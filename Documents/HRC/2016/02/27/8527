<p><i>Summary 
<b></b></i><b> </b>At the invitation of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 14 to 21 June 2010. 
The purpose of the visit was to learn about the efforts made by Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
address cases of enforced disappearances/missing persons, and examine lessons learned and 
good practices.  
</p>
<p> Fifteen years after the end of the war, the Working Group acknowledges the 
immense progress made by Bosnia and Herzegovina in the search and identification of the 
disappeared, reparations for victims and the prosecution of this heinous crime. However, 
much remains to be done to achieve the right to the truth, the right to justice and the right to 
reparation for the disappeared and their families.  
</p>
<p> The main recommendations of the Working Group include setting up the Central 
Records of Missing Persons and the Fund for Support to the Families of Missing Persons, 
as provided for in the Law on Missing Persons. An autonomous crime should be added into 
the criminal law. More support should be given to the work of the Missing Persons Institute 
and for prosecutors working on exhumations and war crimes prosecutions. A national 
programme on reparations for relatives of victims of enforced disappearance should be 
established and protection and assistance programmes for victims and witnesses should be 
strengthened.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Working Group 
on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances visited the country from 14 to 21 June 2010. 
The Working Group was represented by two members: its Chair-Rapporteur, Jeremy 
Sarkin, and Olivier de Frouville. The purpose of the visit was to learn about the country&#8217;s 
efforts to address cases of enforced disappearances/missing persons, and examine lessons 
learned and good practices in dealing with cases of enforced disappearances/missing 
persons, the fight against impunity, and other issues, including truth, justice and reparations 
for victims. 
</p>
<p>2. The delegation held meetings with the Minister of Human Rights and Refugees and 
other high-level representatives of the Government, the Parliament and the judiciary at the 
State and entity levels, many non-governmental organizations, associations of families of 
missing persons, relatives of missing persons and other civil society actors all over Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, and representatives of the international community. The Working Group 
travelled to Sarajevo, Vogo&#353;&#263;a, Srebrenica, Tuzla, Banja Luka, KotorVaro&#353;, Prijedor and 
Mostar. It visited various facilities for the identification of remains, exhumation sites, 
former detention camps and the Poto&#269;ari memorial centre in Srebrenica. It also attended a 
commemoration event held by families of victims. At the end of the visit, a press 
conference was held in Sarajevo.  
</p>
<p>3. The delegation was impressed by how much has been done by the country to deal 
with the issues relating to missing or disappeared persons.  
</p>
<p>4. The Working Group expresses its gratitude and recognition to the Government of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina for inviting the Working Group to visit the country and for its 
positive cooperation before and during the visit.  
</p>
<p>5. The delegation would also like to thank the United Nations Resident Coordinator 
and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Bosnia and Herzegovina for 
the logistical and organizational support provided in connection with the mission. The 
Working Group was also deeply impressed by the level of professionalism and commitment 
of members of the civil society, and expresses its thanks to those NGOs and families of 
victims with which it met.  
</p>
<p><b> II. General observations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General context 
</b></p>
<p>6. Bosnia and Herzegovina declared its independence from the Socialist Federal 
Republic of Yugoslavia on 3 March 1992, after a referendum held on 1 March. This was 
followed by a three and a half years of armed conflict which ended when the General 
Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Annexes thereto 
(Dayton Peace Agreement) was signed. The Dayton Peace Agreement also set up the 
constitutional framework of Bosnia and Herzegovina in its Annex 4 while addressing the 
issue of human rights protection in its Annex 6.  
</p>
<p>7. Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two entities &#8211; the Federation of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska &#8211; each with its own Government, President, 
Parliament and various administrative bodies. In addition, the Br&#269;ko District is a self-
governing administrative unit. It is a federal democratic republic with a bicameral 
parliament consisting of the House of Representatives (42 members, of which two thirds </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4  
</b></p>
<p>are from the Federation and one third are from the Republika Srpska) and the House of 
Peoples (15 members, of which two thirds are from the Federation and five are from the 
Republika Srpska). The three-member Presidency, which consists of one Bosniak and one 
Croat appointed directly from the Federation and one Serb, appointed directly from the 
Republika Srpska, rotates every eight months. The Presidency appoints the Chairperson of 
the Council of Ministers, who in turn appoints other ministers, subject to the approval of the 
House of Representatives.  
</p>
<p>8. The judicial system in Bosnia and Herzegovina is multi-layered and decentralized. 
At the State level, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is composed of nine 
members. Four judges are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two 
by the National Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the 
European Court of Human Rights after consultation with the Presidency. It has exclusive 
jurisdiction over constitutional disputes that arise between two entities or between Bosnia 
and Herzegovina and one or both entities. The Constitutional Court also has appellate 
jurisdiction over issues related to the Constitution arising out of a judgment from another 
court in the country, and jurisdiction over issues referred to it by another court concerning 
compatibility with the Constitution, the European Convention for the Protection of Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its associated protocols, laws of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, or international law pertinent to a court decision. Its decisions are final and 
binding.  
</p>
<p>9. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is composed of 54 judges: 48 national and 6 
international. It is divided into criminal, administrative, and appeals divisions and has 
jurisdiction only over specific types of crimes such as war crimes, financial crimes and 
crimes against the State. The Court operates at the same level as the Supreme Courts of the 
Federation and the Republika Srpska. At the entity level, in the Federation there are a 
Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, 10 cantonal courts, and municipal courts. In the 
Republika Srpska there is a Constitutional Court, a Supreme Court, district courts and basic 
courts. In addition, Br&#269;ko District has its own courts.  
</p>
<p>10. At the State level, there is the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the 
entity level, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has the Federal Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
and 10 Cantonal Prosecutor&#8217;s Offices; the Republika Srpska has the Republic Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office and five District Prosecutor&#8217;s Offices; and the Br&#269;ko District has the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Constitutional and legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Constitution 
</b></p>
<p>11. Article II, paragraph 1, of the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina stipulates that 
Bosnia and Herzegovina and both entities &#8220;ensure the highest level of internationally 
recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;.1 Annex 6 of the Dayton Peace 
Agreement stipulates that the international human rights instruments, as enumerated in 
annex I to the national Constitution, are directly applicable in the national system. 
Additionally, the constitutions of the entities, the Statute of the Br&#269;ko District and the 
constitutions of the 10 cantons in the Federation establish the priority of human rights. 
There is a reference to persons &#8220;unaccounted for&#8221; in Annex 7, article V of the Dayton Peace 
Agreement, which stipulates that &#8220;[t]he Parties shall provide information through the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 The General Framework Agreement: Annex 4 (Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>tracing mechanisms of the ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] on all persons 
unaccounted for. The Parties shall also cooperate fully with the ICRC in its efforts to 
determine the identities, whereabouts and fate of the unaccounted for&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Criminal code 
</b></p>
<p>12. Enforced disappearance is not yet integrated as an autonomous crime in the criminal 
legislation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Enforced disappearance appears as a crime against 
humanity only in article 172 of the Criminal Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, when 
committed &#8220;as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian 
population&#8221;.2 The Code provides that those found guilty shall face at least 10 years or long-
term imprisonment. The Criminal Code specifies that &#8220;<i>[e]nforced disappearance of persons 
</i>means the arrest, detention or abduction of persons by, or with the authorisation, support or 
acquiescence of, a State or a political organisation, followed by a refusal to acknowledge 
that deprivation of freedom or to give information on the fate or whereabouts of those 
persons, with an aim of removing them from the protection of the law for a prolonged 
period of time&#8221;.3  
</p>
<p>13. The crime of enforced disappearance is not codified in the three criminal codes of 
the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republika Srpska and the Br&#269;ko District. 
The Working Group was informed that the Ministry of Justice has set up a team to 
harmonize the criminal legislation at State and entity levels.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Law on Missing Persons  
</b></p>
<p>14. On 17 November 2004, the Law on Missing Persons4 entered into force. It deals 
with issues related to tracing missing persons from/in Bosnia and Herzegovina who 
disappeared between 30 April 1991 and 14 February 1996. It is aimed at, inter alia, 
improving the tracing process, defining what a missing person is, setting up central records 
and realizing social and other rights of family members of missing persons. The Law 
provides that State authorities are under a continuing obligation to trace and identify 
missing persons and that families have the right to know the fate, place of residence or, if 
dead, circumstances and cause of death, location of burial and to receive the mortal remains 
of the missing relatives. The process of tracing a missing person terminates when the 
person is identified.  
</p>
<p>15. Article 7 of the Law on Missing Persons provides for the establishment of the 
Missing Persons Institute (MPI), an independent institution in charge of tracing missing 
persons and accelerating their identification process. This includes finding the missing, 
exhuming graves, examining and identifying human remains and safekeeping them until 
they are to be handed to the victims&#8217; families. It was co-founded in 2005 by the Council of 
Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the International Commission on Missing 
Persons (ICMP).  
</p>
<p>16. In its article 21, the Law also provides for the establishment of the Central Records 
of Missing Persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina (CEN), to be set up and maintained by the 
MPI. The purpose of CEN is to unify all the information available on missing persons at 
local or entity levels kept by authorities, non-governmental organizations, families of 
missing persons, Tracing Offices of the organizations of the Red Cross in Bosnia and

<p>Herzegovina and international organizations. However, the delegation was informed by 
MPI that they are still working on its establishment. Article 15 of the Law provides for the 
establishment of the Fund for Support to the Families of Missing Persons, which has not 
been set up yet.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Ratification of international human rights instruments 
</b></p>
<p>17. Bosnia and Herzegovina is party to the seven major United Nations human rights 
instruments.  
</p>
<p>18. Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance on 6 February 2007. The delegation was 
informed by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that the Government was taking all necessary 
steps towards ratification and that it hoped to conclude the process shortly.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Issue of disappeared persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the special 
process on missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances in the past did have 
a role in dealing with cases of persons who disappeared in the former Republic of 
Yugoslavia, including Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Commission on Human Rights 
established the special process on missing persons in the territory of the former Yugoslavia 
in 1994 and appointed a Working Group member to carry out this task. That person 
resigned in 1997 and the Commission on Human Rights requested the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and other 
institutions to continue this task. At its fifty-first session, the Working Group on Enforced 
or Involuntary Disappearances considered the issue of the follow-up of cases of enforced 
disappearances in the Former Yugoslavia:  
</p>
<p>&#8220;[I]n view of the Commission&#8217;s request to the Special Rapporteur, the Working 
Group decided (&#8230;) that for the time being cases of disappearance which occurred in 
the Republic of Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina until the date of entry into 
force of the Dayton Peace Agreement on 14 December 1995 will not be dealt with 
by the Working Group (&#8230;) and, consequently, the Group will not report to the 
Commission on Human Rights on these cases. With respect to cases (&#8230;) which 
occurred (&#8230;) after 14 December 1995, the Working Group will examine these cases 
in accordance with its methods of work.&#8221; (E/CN.4/1998/43, para. 22).  
</p>
<p>20. Taking into account in particular the fact that the Special Rapporteur had resigned 
more than ten years previously, the Working Group is grateful that Bosnia and Herzegovina 
extended an invitation to visit the country. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The right to the truth 
</b></p>
<p>21. Bosnia and Herzegovina suffered severe and massive human rights violations. It is 
estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed. More than two million people were 
displaced. Tens of thousands of people went missing/disappeared. The number of missing 
persons is a highly politicized and controversial issue. There are disagreements about the 
number of people who went missing. Nevertheless, the Working Group learned from 
various institutions that they largely agree that between 28,000 and 30,000 persons 
disappeared in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the conflict. Of these missing persons, it is 
estimated that about two thirds (about 20 000) have been accounted for, while about one 
third (about 8 000 to 10 000) remain missing. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>22. The delegation was told about the difficulties involved in identifying remains 
because the perpetrators tried to hide their crimes by moving and hiding remains, 
sometimes a few times. By 2010, official identifications had been made for 6,500 of the 
more than 8,000 persons who were recognized as having disappeared from Srebrenica. 
Nevertheless, some groups argue that a number of persons have not been reported missing 
for various reasons. Other groups argue that the number of cases has been overreported. 
Thus, the truth about the past is important to dispel the myths, attitudes and perceptions 
about who was killed, from which group civilian casualties occurred and who carried out 
these attacks. 
</p>
<p>23. All groups allege discrimination in the way they and their communities are dealt 
with even on the question of missing persons. The right to non-discrimination should be 
promoted and protected in any activities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all persons should 
be treated equally, wherever they live and whatever their ethnic origin. Legislation and 
processes to promote equality and prevent discrimination should be a priority. 
</p>
<p>24. As noted in paragraph 16 above, the Central Records of the Missing Persons 
provided for in the Law on Missing Persons has not yet been completed. This should be 
done as soon as possible and be made public with the listing of the ethnic origin of those 
classified as missing. This will promote transparency, accuracy and certainty about who 
went missing. It will reduce the politicization of these issues. The CEN will help to reduce 
prejudices, promote the truth about what occurred, and ensure that a true history of the 
conflict is revealed. For this reason an accurate CEN is critical for the country. 
</p>
<p>25. The Working Group notes that the major demand of family members is still for the 
truth about the fate of their missing loved ones. As far as finding missing persons, there 
have been major developments and advances. A great deal of effort has been made and a 
great deal of success has been achieved in the quest to determine the fate and the 
whereabouts of the missing persons. Steps taken include the actions of ICMP, the 
enactment of the Law on Missing Persons of 2004; the establishment of the Missing 
Persons Institute (MPI); and the significant number of exhumations and identifications 
carried out. 
</p>
<p>26. Before the MPI came into existence, various institutions dealt with these issues, but 
at the local level. In 1997 the Office of the High Representative launched a Joint 
Exhumation Process that allowed for the former warring parties to search for their missing 
on each others&#8217; territories. The role of coordinating the Joint Exhumation Process was later 
given to ICMP, which was established in 1996. The principal function of ICMP is to ensure 
that States work to find and identify those who have gone missing during armed conflict or 
because of human rights violations. It has its headquarters in Sarajevo. The role of ICMP in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been crucial.  
</p>
<p>27. Besides its role in the establishment of the MPI, ICMP has played a huge role in 
finding and identifying those who were found during the exhumation process. The Working 
Group had a number of meetings with ICMP. The delegation visited an exhumation site and 
saw the processes that were being performed to identify the remains with the assistance of 
ICMP. The delegation was shown a number of ICMP facilities where human remains were 
being kept and processes of identification were being undertaken. ICMP has 88,000 blood 
references from family members of those who went missing. For an identification to be 
made, a 99.95 per cent match is needed. As a result of all the scientific work by ICMP, 
including DNA matching, the identification process is very accurate. The Working Group 
was impressed by the professionalism, quality and importance of the work done by ICMP. 
It should remain actively engaged with this work in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the future. 
</p>
<p>28. ICMP was not the only international institution involved in dealing with the question 
of missing persons. Others that have played a role include the United Nations, the Office of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8  
</b></p>
<p>the High Representative, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the European Union and others.<b> </b>These 
organizations should continue to work on the problem of enforced disappearances and 
missing persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Clarifying most cases of missing persons 
should be a part of the dialogue between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union. 
</p>
<p>29. The MPI is mandated to investigate individual and mass graves, to exhume and 
identify bodily remains and to establish an accurate register of missing and identified 
persons. The MPI management consists of a Steering Board; a Board of Directors 
(executive body); a Supervisory Board in charge of financial operations and an Advisory 
Board which gives space to families to raise concerns regarding the work of the MPI. 
Family members are part of the various associations of the missing that exist in the country. 
Representatives of these associations sit on the Advisory Board of the MPI. Through this 
process families are able to monitor the activities of the MPI. Families can also use other 
tracing services, such as ICRC.  
</p>
<p>30. A split exists with regard to the structures that exist in the country to deal with 
missing persons, with a separate system in the Republika Srpska. The MPI looks for 
missing people all over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Working Group was impressed by 
the Institute and its high level of commitment, its tripartite structure, the consensual 
atmosphere among its three directors, and the level of participation of families of the 
disappeared through an advisory board and direct contact. The MPI should be supported 
and strengthened; in particular, its independence should be guaranteed. More resources 
should be given to the Institute. All available technology necessary to detect and exhume 
graves should be provided. The Council of Ministers should also strengthen the 
independence and autonomy of MPI by detailing these issues in the law. The vacant post of 
the management board of the Institute should also be filled. At the same time more political 
and financial support is needed by the MPI. The Institute needs to be supported to a greater 
extent by the Republika Srpska authorities. 
</p>
<p>31. With regard to the process of finding and exhuming graves, the law is quite 
complicated and subject to problems. The process of exhumations is perceived by the 
families to be slow. The delegation was told that some perpetrators who know about mass 
graves are asking for money from families in order to reveal where the burial sites are. This 
needs to be dealt with by the authorities as it could have severe implications in the future. 
</p>
<p>32. When a grave site is identified for an exhumation to take place a court order must be 
obtained. This has not always been easy, and determining which court and which 
prosecutor has jurisdiction has been a complicating factor. Cantonal and district prosecutors 
are not always willing to accept an order coming from the Bosnia and Herzegovina 
prosecutor&#8217;s office. The Working Group was pleased to learn that, following its visit, on 31 
August 2010, the State Prosecutor announced that from 1 January 2011, all exhumations 
and identifications would fall under the jurisdiction of the State Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. This is 
a positive step and the Working Group looks forward to its implementation. 
</p>
<p>33. The number of prosecutors working on exhumations and war crimes prosecutions 
has been extremely low. They also have few resources and staff. Additional staff should be 
appointed to accelerate the process. 
</p>
<p>34. Meetings should be held periodically to ensure the establishment and maintenance of 
a fruitful dialogue between authorities and the relatives of disappeared people and, 
eventually, to enforce the right of the latter to know the truth and to rebuild the confidence 
of civil society towards institutions and establishing mutual trust. 
</p>
<p>35. Those working on exhumations need more assistance and equipment. To speed up 
the process more forensic pathologists are needed. Currently there are very few full-time 
pathologists; therefore some private pathologists are used, which is neither cost-effective </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>nor the best way to get results. A forensic centre could be established. The conditions under 
which those who perform the exhumations work are often inadequate; more resources 
should be assigned for this work. 
</p>
<p>36. Families are not going to be satisfied until they can bury their loved ones with 
dignity and proper religious rites. Nevertheless, the process to determine the location of 
mass graves is becoming more difficult with the passage of time. Between 8,000 and 
10,000 people are still missing. It is now perpetrators who largely have the information on 
where graves can be found. Thus, it is important to bring perpetrators to justice to try to 
enhance the truth discovery process. To encourage more people to reveal information 
concerning grave sites, witness protection programmes should be strengthened. Witness 
support and protection should also be provided to families of missing persons who are at 
times threatened, intimidated and sometimes blackmailed. Plea agreements may assist the 
discovery of truth recovery as information that is unknown may be revealed. When plea 
bargains occurs with a person suspected of having information on missing persons, 
providing that information should be part of the agreement. But there is also in some places 
a lack of cooperation from the local authorities where there could be mass graves. Other 
countries could also assist in the information gathering process. More could be done in 
countries in the region. More assistance could be rendered where prosecutions are 
occurring, for example by other countries ensuring the provision of evidence, etc. These 
countries could also conduct their own trials but not for political reasons. 
</p>
<p>37. Besides the processes to find those missing there have been various processes to 
determine the truth of what occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina. None of these processes 
allowed victims to testify in public.  
</p>
<p>38. The idea of having one overarching truth discovery process has been debated for 
many years. According to a UNDP opinion poll in 2010, about two thirds of people 
interviewed did not know what a truth commission was. However, among those who knew 
about such a process, 90 per cent stressed the importance of having a truth commission in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. Some fear that a truth commission process could undermine the 
process to hold perpetrators accountable. While the International Criminal Tribunal for the 
Former Yugoslavia has convicted a number of persons, it will close its doors shortly. It has 
been estimated that thousands of perpetrators have not been indicted. National justice will 
continue. Victims could benefit from a truth process, but not as a substitute for justice. This 
could include a truth mechanism (possibly a national truth and reconciliation commission). 
There could also be localized commissions of inquiry. International organizations should 
give their full support to such activities. The Bosnia and Herzegovina National Strategy for 
Transitional Justice should be fully supported and funded. It is crucial that a transitional 
justice strategy should cover non-judicial mechanisms &#8211; truth-telling, reparations and 
institutional reforms. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. The right to reparation 
</b></p>
<p>39. Bosnia and Herzegovina does have some programmes to provide those affected by 
the conflict with compensation. These programmes are however mainly concerned with the 
provision of individual monthly payments to the families of those killed or missing as well 
as victims of sexual violence. There is also a restitution programme for those who lost 
property during the war. There is therefore the need for an all-inclusive and thorough 
reparations programme. However, many people seemingly did not know about those laws. 
Victims claim that even public servants who are meant to administer these programmes are 
not knowledgeable about them, find them complicated to administer, or need approval from 
elsewhere for such measures to be given. For this and other reasons many claim that these 
processes are extremely difficult to access. Many victims who seemingly should be entitled </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10  
</b></p>
<p>to reparations are not receiving such assistance for a variety of reasons. Many allege that 
there is a lack of information about such programmes and others allege discrimination in 
the provision of such services. They argue that in some areas while the law in theory does 
not discriminate between the ethnic groups anymore, implementation is designed to exclude 
certain ethnic groups from such services. 
</p>
<p>40. The State, in cooperation with entity authorities, should take steps, including the 
amendment of legislation, to ensure that all relatives of disappeared people have access to 
social benefits and other measures of social support irrespective of where they live. Such 
legislation should be adopted on the State level in order to avoid the continuation of the 
current situation in which there exists discrimination in access to and levels of social 
benefits depending on the entity.
</p>
<p>41. More assistance should also be given to associations of families of disappeared at 
the State level, without any discrimination as to ethnic origin. Measures should be taken in 
order to ensure that members of families of disappeared persons are entitled to social 
benefits and other measures of social support irrespective of where they live, including 
health care, special education programmes and psychological assistance. 
</p>
<p>42. The only instrument related to compensation at the State level in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina is the Law on Missing Persons. The Law provides that family members of 
missing persons &#8220;who were supported by the missing person and who are in need of 
support, are entitled to monthly financial support&#8221;. A person is not entitled to support if 
they receive any other support such as rights based on social welfare, pension-disability 
insurance, veteran disability insurance, income from work, individual performance of 
economic or independent activity and other income that can be considered support in 
accordance with the Bosnia and Herzegovina legislation. 
</p>
<p>43. The Law on Missing Persons provides for reparation by the creation of a State-level 
fund called the Fund for Support to the Families of Missing Persons. This would allow 
reparation and assistance to associations of families. However, the fund has not been 
established, even though the Constitutional Court on a number of occasions ordered the 
establishment of the fund.5 Its establishment has been held up by two issues: the failure to 
agree on the location of the fund and the amount of money each entity should contribute to 
the fund. The entities have different views on which entity should pay a greater share. This 
stalemate has dire effects for victims and should be resolved as soon as possible. 
Establishing the fund should be a priority. 
</p>
<p>44. The Working Group recalls that reparations are not only financial in nature. Article 
19 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (1992) 
establishes that &#8220;the victims of acts of enforced disappearance and their family shall obtain 
redress and shall have the right to adequate compensation, including the means for as 
complete rehabilitation as possible. In the event of the death of the victim as a result of an 
act of enforced disappearance, their dependants shall also be entitled to compensation&#8221;. A 
national programme on reparations for relatives of victims of enforced disappearance that 
includes compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-
repetition should be established. Reparation programmes should take into account a gender 
perspective, considering that most of family relatives of missing persons are women. 
</p>
<p>  
 5 Many orders of the Constitutional Court are not implemented. Such orders should be implemented, 
</p>
<p>and failure to comply with them should be prosecuted as provided by the law of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>45. As the Working Group noted in its general comment (1997) on article 19 of the 
Declaration, States are obligated to adopt legislative and other measures in order to enable 
the victims to claim compensation before the courts or special administrative bodies 
empowered to grant compensation. Victims and their families are also entitled to 
compensation for the suffering during the time of disappearance and in the event of the 
death of the victim dependants are entitled to compensation (E/CN.4/1998/43, para. 72). 
Compensation shall be &#8220;adequate&#8221;, i.e. proportionate to the gravity of the human rights 
violation (e.g. the period of disappearance, the conditions of detention, etc.) and to the 
suffering of the victim and the family. Monetary compensation must be given for any 
damage resulting from an enforced disappearance such as physical or mental harm, lost 
opportunities, material damages and loss of earnings, harm to reputation and costs required 
for legal or expert assistance (ibid., para. 73). States also have an obligation to provide for a 
presumption of death procedure or a similar process which entitles dependants to 
compensation (ibid., para. 74). In addition to the right to monetary compensation, the right 
to obtain redress for acts of enforced disappearance also includes &#8220;the means for as 
complete a rehabilitation as possible&#8221;, which includes medical and psychological care, legal 
and social rehabilitation, rehabilitation for any physical or mental damage, guarantees of 
non-repetition, restoration of personal liberty, family life, citizenship, employment or 
property, return to one&#8217;s place of residence and similar forms of restitution, satisfaction and 
reparation which may remove the consequences of the enforced disappearance (ibid., para. 
75).  
</p>
<p>46. A problem raised by some is that in the past for a family to receive a State pension 
under the law, the missing person had to be declared dead. Many families have done this 
even though the fate or whereabouts of the person is unknown. This has been the cause of 
much emotional hardship. Receiving reparations should not be contingent on getting a 
death certificate. The Law on Missing Persons changes this and now obtaining such a 
certificate is not necessary. However, the Law states that &#8220;three years after the date of the 
coming into force of the Law, persons registered as missing in the period from 30 April 
1991 to 14 February 1996 whose disappearance has been verified within the CEN Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, shall be considered dead and this fact shall be officially entered in the 
Register of Death&#8221;. While the CEN is not yet operating, when it is this provision will be 
problematic as it declares people dead possibly against the wishes of their loved ones. It 
must be remembered that an enforced disappearance is a continuous crime until the 
person&#8217;s fate or whereabouts is determined. It should therefore be clarified what the impact 
of this provision will be for families and for investigations and prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>47. To commemorate the issue of missing persons, without choosing a day that is 
acceptable to one community only, 30 August (International Day of the Disappeared) 
should be declared as the national day for commemorating the memory of all missing 
persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This would commemorate victims of enforced 
disappearance without ethnic distinction. This day is already commemorated by some in the 
country, including for example, the Parliament of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other steps to 
promote reconciliation in the country also should occur. More apologies from more actors 
are necessary. Apologies must be part of a process to ensure reconciliation. In addition 
more should be done on the issues of preventing future cases of enforced disappearances.  
</p>
<p>48. At present the issue of memorials has caused much controversy and unhappiness. 
There are many problems associated with them. For example, at times relatives who wish to 
attend burial ceremonies or visit graves in other parts of the country are prevented from 
doing so or harassed when they do. The issue should be dealt with by the national 
authorities. Families of those killed should be allowed to visit the sites where their loved 
ones were killed, without being opposed, denied access or provoked by others. Obviously, 
this should not be done in a provocative way. Political leaders should be promoting 
tolerance and the security forces should provide access and security to places where </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12  
</b></p>
<p>families wish to visit on important dates. A national law on the issue of memorials should 
be enacted. Such a law should set out the criteria and the process for establishing 
memorials, as victims across the country complained that memorials they wished to erect 
were disallowed by local authorities controlled by those from other ethnic groups. It was 
also argued that some monuments and memorials were erected in places in order to 
intimidate victims from other ethnic groups. In some places memorials were erected by the 
municipality without any consultation. At the same time some municipalities reportedly 
would not fund memorials for the other side and they would not even allow those groups to 
use their own money to erect a memorial. Therefore Bosnia and Herzegovina should adopt 
measures to achieve satisfaction, such as the setting up of memorial sites and monuments. It 
should adopt a comprehensive legal framework to regulate the subject with a view to 
avoiding re-victimization and further violations of the right to dignity.  
</p>
<p><b> V. The right to justice 
</b></p>
<p>49. The realization of the right to justice in Bosnia and Herzegovina takes place in an 
exceptional context. The international framework set up during and after the war greatly 
favoured the prosecution and punishment of perpetrators of enforced disappearances and, 
more generally, of international crimes. Despite tremendous efforts, impunity remains a 
problem in the country. In many communities perpetrators live side by side with their 
victims. This is due to the huge number of alleged perpetrators, believed to be in the 
thousands, making it almost impossible to try them all in a short period of time. 
</p>
<p>50. The prosecution of crimes began at the international level, but the national 
institutions have been more and more involved in the process. 
</p>
<p>51<i>. </i>At the international level, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former 
Yugoslavia was the first international tribunal with jurisdiction over serious international 
crimes to be set up after the experiences of Nuremberg and Tokyo. The Tribunal has 
prosecuted a number of perpetrators, mainly high-level officials. However the number of 
prosecutions remains limited: 161 persons have been indicted and, as of today, 125 trials 
have been completed. Among those, 12 accused have been acquitted while 62 were found 
guilty. The Statute of the Tribunal does not contain the crime of enforced disappearance. 
This likely explains why there have been no convictions for this crime, although enforced 
disappearance has been mentioned in at least two judgements of the Tribunal, once as a 
crime against humanity (&#8220;other inhuman acts&#8221;)6 and once as an act of genocide (&#8220;causing 
serious mental harm to a member of the group&#8221;)7. 
</p>
<p>52. The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia could not try all 
perpetrators in the former Yugoslavia but has had to concentrate on the &#8220;main 
perpetrators&#8221;, that is to say those who bore the &#8220;greatest responsibility for the crimes 
committed&#8221;. In 2003 the Tribunal presented to the Security Council a Completion Strategy, 
which planned to close the tribunal in a number of years and to defer progressively the 
responsibility of further cases to national tribunals, in particular the tribunals of the 
countries of the former Yugoslavia.  
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>others Trial Judgement, para. 208, citing Kupre&#353;ki&#263;.

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>53. At the national level, measures were taken to create appropriate normative and 
institutional frameworks. New criminal codes were adopted: in the Federation (1998), in 
the Republika Srpska (2000), in the Br&#269;ko District (2001) and at the State level (2003). In 
those codes, war crimes previously codified by the Criminal Code of the former Yugoslavia 
were included. To these were added new international crimes, the definition of which was 
inspired from the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p>54. Enforced disappearances are considered crimes only at the State level. The Criminal 
Code of Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted in 2003, provides for the punishment of crimes 
against humanity, through a text which is inspired from the Rome Statute and thus includes, 
among particular crimes, the crime of enforced disappearance (art. 172, para. 1-i). The 
Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina provided the Working Group with a list of 10 judgements 
(trial chamber or appeal chamber) where the accused was convicted on the basis of this 
provision, for having committed the crime of enforced disappearance. While welcoming 
these developments, the Working Group must however reiterate the reservations it already 
expressed elsewhere (see its general comment on the definition of enforced 
disappearances8) on the specific definition of enforced disappearances resulting from the 
Rome Statute. The Working Group recommends that the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina 
interpret this definition in line with the more adequate definition provided for in article 2 of 
the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance (2006); or that the Bosnia and Herzegovina Parliament amend the Criminal 
Code to that effect. Furthermore, the Working Group recommends that, in accordance with 
the Declaration and the Convention, the Code be amended to include enforced 
disappearances as an autonomous crime, so that it can be punished in situations where it 
cannot be qualified as a crime against humanity. 
</p>
<p>55. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, article 118, para. 2 of the Criminal Code provides that 
&#8220;an amnesty for the criminal offences prescribed under this Code, may be granted by the 
Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina by virtue of a law&#8221;.<b> </b>The Working 
Group notes that the Criminal Code does not set any exception to the power of the 
Parliament to grant amnesty. The Working Group recalls that the first paragraph of article 
18 of the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances 
states: &#8220;Persons who have or are alleged to have committed offences referred to in article 4, 
paragraph 1, above, shall not benefit from any special amnesty law or similar measures that 
might have the effect of exempting them from any criminal proceedings or sanction.&#8221; In its 
general comment (2005) on article 18 of the Declaration , the Working Group insisted that 
&#8220;States should refrain from making or enacting amnesty laws that would exempt the 
perpetrators of enforced disappearance from criminal proceedings and sanctions, and also 
prevent the proper application and implementation of other provisions of the Declaration&#8221; 
(para. 1). More recently, in its general comment (2010) on the right to the truth in relation 
to enforced disappearances, the Working Group expressed its opinion that no &#8220;limitation 
[to the right to justice] may occur when the enforced disappearance amounts to a crime 
against humanity&#8221; (para. 8). Accordingly, the Working Group recommends that the Code 
be amended to remove the possibility of granting amnesty for serious crimes of 
international law, including the crime of enforced disappearance, in accordance with 
international customary law and in line with article 18 of the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>56. At the local level (Federation, Republika Srpska, Br&#269;ko District), the criminal codes 
do not include crimes against humanity and thus the specific crime of enforced 
disappearance. Even if the law were to be amended, the jurisprudence of local courts would 
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14  
</b></p>
<p>prevent them from convicting the accused on the basis of this crime, as they refuse to apply 
the 2003 criminal codes to crimes perpetrated in the period 1992-1995. They instead apply 
the Code of the former Yugoslavia. This position remains, despite the fact that the issue 
was dealt with in the <i>Maktouf </i>case, first by the War Crimes Chamber appellate panel of the 
Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina (judgement of 4 April 2006), and then by the 
Constitutional Court. In its judgement, the Court found that the retroactive application of 
the Bosnia and Herzegovina Criminal Code was permissible under article 7, paragraph 2, of 
the European Convention on Human Rights because those acts, at the time when they were 
committed, were already criminal according to the &#8220;general principles of law recognized by 
civilized nations&#8221; (judgement of 30 March 2007).  
</p>
<p>57. The Working Group concurs with this position and would also like to underline the 
fact that an enforced disappearance is a continuous crime and thus can be punished on the 
basis of an ex post legislation without violating the principle of non-retroactivity, for as 
long as the fate or the whereabouts of the disappeared person has not been clarified (see the 
Working Group&#8217;s general comment (2010) on enforced disappearances as a continuous 
crime). The Working Group thus recommends that the criminal codes at the entity and 
district levels be harmonized with the Criminal Code at the State level, so that they provide 
for the repression of enforced disappearances both as a crime against humanity and as an 
autonomous crime and sets the appropriate penalties. These penalties should correspond to 
the level of those applied for the most serious crimes. The Working Group also 
recommends that the local courts change their position on the issue of the non-retroactivity 
of the new criminal codes, as far as international crimes are concerned. 
</p>
<p>58. On the institutional side, the Completion Strategy for the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia triggered the signature of a memorandum of 
understanding between the Office of the High Representative and the Tribunal to create a 
special prosecutor&#8217;s office and a special chamber within the Court of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, having jurisdiction to prosecute and try serious crimes of international law. 
The War Crimes Chamber acquired jurisdiction over cases transferred to it by the Tribunal 
under Rule 11 bis of its rules of procedures, and also over all the cases of war crimes which 
were at that time before local courts, i.e. cantonal courts from the Federation and district 
courts from the Republika Srpska, as well as the district court of Br&#269;ko District. 
</p>
<p>59. In 2008, however, a National War Crimes Prosecution Strategy was adopted, which 
established a new logic of subsidiarity in favour of local courts: the rule being that the more 
complex cases (&#8220;highly sensitive cases&#8221;) would be kept under the jurisdiction of the Court 
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while less complex cases (&#8220;sensitive cases&#8221;) would be deferred 
to the jurisdiction of local courts. A number of cases are thus tried before local courts, and 
the number of those cases should logically increase in the future. 
</p>
<p>60. The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Office of the 
Prosecutor were created as &#8220;hybrid&#8221; institutions composed partly of international judges 
and international prosecutors. However, the plan is that the international component should 
come to an end in the near future. The Working Group heard from different stakeholders 
that the presence of international judges was considered an important asset in the 
functioning of the Court and recommends that this component be kept for as long as 
necessary to ensure that justice is delivered and is seen to be delivered in an impartial 
manner. 
</p>
<p>61. Most of the local courts are not well prepared to prosecute and try perpetrators of 
international crimes. For instance, entity and district courts have no adequate courtrooms or 
technological equipment that would allow an efficient protection of witnesses during trial. 
There are no special prosecutors at the local level in charge of &#8220;war crimes&#8221;. The capacities 
of cantonal and districts courts to try war criminals should be strengthened so as to enable 
them to try most of the cases in the future in appropriate conditions. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>62. The procedure criminal codes at all levels were amended, shifting the approach from 
civil law to common law, with the abolishment of investigative judges and the creation of 
an independent prosecutor and the introduction of the guilty plea. This new procedure was 
questioned because of the use of plea bargaining, which might be used to obtain evidence &#8211; 
for instance to locate mass graves &#8211; but also to reduce drastically the sentence incurred. 
Plea bargaining should be used cautiously in cases of serious crimes, in particular enforced 
disappearances. The conditions under the plea should include, when appropriate, the 
obligation to cooperate in uncovering the truth about the fate and whereabouts of 
disappeared persons, and in particular through the discovery of mass graves.  
</p>
<p>63. Various concerns were expressed by the families of the disappeared. In particular, it 
was alleged that the contact between the families and prosecutors were poor or non-
existent, and that it was difficult to get information about their cases. Some families believe 
that their cases had not been taken up at all, even though they had provided the evidence 
necessary to trigger an immediate prosecution. In Prijedor, the Working Group met with a 
victim who had lost 33 members of his family in 1992, including his wife and children, 
while he was working abroad. This victim submitted his case several times to the 
Prosecutor to no avail, even though the identity of some of the perpetrators is known to 
him. In despair, he submitted his case to the European Court of Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>64. The justice system in Bosnia and Herzegovina should give more attention to the 
victims. An effective public system of free legal aid should be established to enable 
relatives of disappeared persons to receive legal support if they cannot afford it. Offices of 
the prosecutors and courts at all levels should have consistent rules in dealing with the 
public in general and with families of the disappeared in particular. In particular, families of 
victims should be more regularly given information on the process of investigation, the 
results of those investigations and whether trials might be forthcoming. Moreover, the 
Working Group recommends that special personnel be appointed to meet with families and 
inform them, on a regular basis, of progress made in their cases. 
</p>
<p>65. There were also concerns that the witnesses and victims were not well protected 
against reprisals or intimidations and that the psycho-sociological assistance provided to 
them was insufficient. A person with whom the Working Group met told about his 
experience as a witness: he complained that he was threatened on the telephone before his 
appearance before the Court. According to this person, witness protection is almost non-
existent: &#8220;It is reduced to a single phone call to the witness prior to the court proceeding &#8230; 
During and after trial, witnesses never hear back from the programme.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>66. Legislation has been adopted to tackle these problems: the Law on the Protection of 
Witnesses under Threat and Vulnerable Witnesses, adopted at the level of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, the entities and Br&#269;ko District, and the Law on Witness Protection 
Programmes, adopted at the State level only. The Working Group deems that more remains 
to be done to implement these laws. 
</p>
<p>67. The Working Group was informed that programmes of support, including 
psychological support, have been initiated at the State level and in some places at the local 
level, very often in cooperation with local NGOs. However, such programmes need to be 
strengthened and systematized. 
</p>
<p>68. More should be done to protect and offer assistance to victims and witnesses, in 
particular women. In particular, the programme for the protection of witnesses should be 
improved and expanded at the State level, and similar programmes should be created at the 
local level. In the same spirit, programmes of psychological assistance should be 
generalized and strengthened where they already exist. Psychological support to victims 
and witnesses should not be restricted to a short period of time before the person appears 
before the court. It is well known that such support is crucial prior to the testimony, during </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16  
</b></p>
<p>the trial, but also for a certain period of time after the trial. Such programmes should also 
include a gender perspective and give special attention to the specific trauma suffered by 
members of the family of a disappeared person. 
</p>
<p>69. In many cases perpetrators continue to hold office, often in the same communities 
where victims and their families live. At times the perpetrators still hold high-level offices. 
This constitutes a permanent threat and intimidation for the victims. Measures of vetting 
should be improved and/or systematized. When such measures have been taken in the past, 
it is not clear whether those identified as perpetrators have been dismissed from public 
offices, including the police force and public companies.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> Fifteen years after the end of the war, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances acknowledges the immense progress made by Bosnia and 
Herzegovina in the search and identification of the disappeared, reparations for 
victims and the prosecution of this heinous crime. However, taking into account the 
huge proportion of the problem, the Working Group is also aware that much remains 
to be done to achieve the rights to the truth, the right to justice and the right to 
reparation for the disappeared and their families. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> In the context currently prevailing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Working 
Group identified a central issue in the claim by all victims and all groups in the society 
to be treated equally and without any discrimination of any kind.  
</b></p>
<p><b>It is recommended that the right to non-discrimination be promoted and 
protected in any activities, and that all persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
should be treated equally, wherever they live and whatever their ethnic origin. 
Legislation and processes to promote equality and prevent discrimination 
should be a priority. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Working Group notes that Bosnia and Herzegovina was reviewed under 
the universal periodic review procedure in February 2010. However, few 
recommendations concern the issue of enforced disappearances and missing persons 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  
</b></p>
<p><b>It is recommended that the Human Rights Council should follow up on the 
implementation of the recommendations made by the Working Group in the 
present report, in particular on the occasion of the review of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina during the second cycle of the universal periodic review.  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to the truth 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Working Group recalls that &#8220;[t]he right to the truth in relation to enforced 
disappearances means the right to know about the progress and results of an 
investigation, the fate or the whereabouts of the disappeared persons, and the 
circumstances of the disappearances, and the identity of the perpetrator(s)&#8221; (general 
comment on the right to the truth in relation to enforced disappearances, para. 1). 
</b>74.<b> The Working Group acknowledges that, with regard to finding missing 
persons, there have been major developments and advances. A great deal of effort has 
been made and a great deal of success has been achieved in the quest to determine the 
fate and the whereabouts of the missing persons. Steps taken include the actions of the 
International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP), the enactment of the Law on </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b>Missing Persons of 2004; the establishment of the Missing Persons Institute (MPI); 
and the significant number of exhumations and identifications carried out. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The Working Group however notes that there are also several shortcomings. In 
particular, while the Law on Missing Persons provides for the Central Records of 
Missing Persons (CEN), this has not yet been completed.  
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group recommends that this should be done as soon as possible 
and be made public with the listing of the ethnic origin of those classified as 
missing. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Working Group notes that the role of ICMP in Bosnia and Herzegovina 
has been crucial. It has been a key part in the discovery and identification of the 
missing.  
</b></p>
<p><b>ICMP should remain actively engaged with this work in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina in the future. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Other institutions that have played a role include the United Nations, the Office 
of the High Representative, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
the International Committee of the Red Cross, the European Union and others. These 
organizations should continue to work on the problem of enforced disappearances and 
missing persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this connection:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Other institutions should continue to assist Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
the families of the disappeared to realize the right to truth, the right to justice and the 
right to reparation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In particular, clarifying most cases of missing persons should be a 
priority in the dialogue between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the European Union. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> Domestically, the MPI plays a major role in the search of the disappeared. The 
Working Group recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The MPI be supported and strengthened. In particular, its independence 
should be guaranteed;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) More resources be put at the disposal of the MPI to allow it do its work;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) All available technology necessary to detect graves and to exhume them 
be provided to the institution;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The Council of Ministers also strengthen the independence and 
autonomy of MPI by detailing these issues in the law;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) More independence and autonomy be given to the MPI by amending the 
relevant legislation;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) The vacant posts of the management board of the MPI be filled; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The MPI be provided with more political and financial support;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) MPI be supported to a greater extent by the Republika Srpska 
authorities. 
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The number of prosecutors working on exhumations and war crimes 
prosecutions is extremely low. They also have few resources and staff. In this 
connection: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Additional staff should be appointed to accelerate the process;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Those working on exhumations should be provided with needed 
assistance and equipment;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To speed up the process, needed additional forensic pathologists should 
be provided;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) More resources should be given to the people working in this area to 
enable them to complete these gruelling tasks. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> Plea agreements may assist the discovery of truth recovery as information that 
is unknown may be revealed.  
</b></p>
<p><b>When plea bargains occur with a person suspected of having information on 
missing persons, providing such information should be part of the agreement. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Other countries could assist in the information gathering process to locate 
further grave sites. In this connection: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) More could be done in other countries in the region to investigate cases 
perpetrated by people who now live on their territory;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) More assistance could be rendered where prosecutions are occurring, for 
example by other countries ensuring the provision of evidence, etc.;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Such countries could also conduct their own trials, but not for political 
reasons. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> Other processes to arrive at the truth should be explored. This could include a 
truth mechanism (possibly a national truth and reconciliation commission or other 
more localized bodies of inquiries), but not as a substitute for justice. In this 
connection: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Bosnia and Herzegovina National Strategy for Transitional Justice 
should be fully supported and funded;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) It is crucial that a transitional justice strategy should cover non-judicial 
mechanisms &#8211; truth-telling, reparations and institutional reforms. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. The right to reparation 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> As far as reparations are concerned, a lot remains to be done to provide 
integral reparation to the disappeared and their families. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Working Group recommends that:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Fund for Support to the Families of Missing Persons provided for by 
the Law on Missing Persons be established as a matter of priority; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The State, in cooperation with entity authorities, take steps, including the 
amendment of legislation, to ensure that all relatives of disappeared people have 
access to social benefits and other measures of social support irrespective of where 
they live. Such legislation should be adopted on the State level in order to avoid the 
continuation of the current situation in which there exists discrimination in access to 
and levels of social benefits depending on the entity; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) More assistance be given to associations of families of disappeared 
persons at the State level, without any discrimination as to ethnic origin. Measures 
should be taken in order to ensure that members of families of disappeared persons 
are entitled to social benefits and other measures of social support irrespective of 
where they live, including health care, special education programmes and 
psychological assistance; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) A national programme on reparations for relatives of victims of enforced 
disappearance that includes compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, satisfaction and 
guarantees of non-repetition be established. Reparation programmes should take into 
account a gender perspective, considering that most family relatives of missing 
persons are women; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) To commemorate the issue of missing persons, without choosing a day 
that is acceptable to one community only, 30 August (International Day of the 
Disappeared) be declared as the national day for commemorating the memory of all 
missing persons in Bosnia and Herzegovina; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) More apologies from more actors are needed. They must however be 
part of a process that is necessary to ensure reconciliation. In addition more should be 
done on the issue of preventing future cases of enforced disappearances;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) A national law on the issue of memorials be enacted. This law on 
memorials should set out the criteria and the process to establish such memorials. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Law on Missing Persons stipulates that all persons registered in the CEN 
Bosnia and Herzegovina shall be considered dead. While the CEN is not yet operating, 
when it is, this provision will be problematic, as it declares people dead possibly 
against the wishes of their loved ones. It must be remembered that an enforced 
disappearance is a continuous crime until the person&#8217;s fate or whereabouts is 
determined.  
</b></p>
<p><b>It should therefore be clarified what the impact of this provision will be for 
families and for investigations and prosecutions. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. The right to justice 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> While great progress has been made to bring domestic legislation into 
conformity with international law, there are still gaps and problems, in particular on 
the issue of enforced disappearances.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Domestic criminal legislation still needs to be improved. In particular, the 
Working Group recommends that: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina interpret the definition of 
enforced disappearances as a crime against humanity, contained in article 172, 
paragraph 1-i of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Criminal Code, in line with the more 
adequate definition provided for in article 2 of the 2006 International Convention for 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance; or for the Bosnia and 
Herzegovina Parliament to amend the Criminal Code to that effect;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In accordance with the Declaration and the Convention, the Code be 
amended to include enforced disappearances as an autonomous crime, so that it can 
be punished in situations where it cannot be qualified as a crime against humanity;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The Criminal Code be amended to remove the possibility of granting 
amnesty for serious international crimes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The criminal codes at the entity and district levels be harmonized with 
the Criminal Code at the State level, so that they provide for the repression of 
enforced disappearances both as a crime against humanity and as an autonomous 
crime and sets the appropriate penalties. The penalties should correspond to the level 
of those applied for the most serious crimes;  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/16/48/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The local courts change their position on the issue of the non-
retroactivity of the new criminal codes, as far as international crimes are concerned. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> On the institutional side, the Working Group heard from different stakeholders 
that the presence of international judges was considered an important asset in the 
functioning of the Court.  
</b></p>
<p><b>The Working Group therefore recommends that this component be kept for as 
long as necessary to ensure that justice is delivered and is seen to be delivered 
in an impartial manner.  
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> At the local level, the Working Group is aware that most of the local courts are 
not well prepared to prosecute and try perpetrators of international crimes. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The capacities of cantonal and districts courts to try war criminals should be 
strengthened so as to enable them to try most of the cases in the future in 
appropriate conditions. 
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> The Working Group met with several victims who expressed various concerns 
and who sometimes felt left aside by the official institutions. The Working Group 
deems that the justice system in Bosnia and Herzegovina should give more attention to 
the victims. In this connection: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) An effective public system of free legal aid should be established to 
enable relatives of disappeared persons to receive legal support if they cannot afford 
it;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Offices of the prosecutors and courts at all levels should have consistent 
rules in dealing with the public in general and with families of the disappeared in 
particular. In particular, families of victims should be more regularly given 
information on the process of investigation, the results of those investigations and 
whether trials might be forthcoming; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Special personnel should be appointed to meet with families and inform 
them, on a regular basis, of progress made in their cases; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Greater training for all public servants working on issues related to 
enforced disappearance should be held to allow them to be better informed on the 
issues and to provide the victims with a better service;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) More should be done to protect and offer assistance to victims and 
witnesses, in particular women. In particular, the programme for the protection of 
witnesses should be improved and expanded at the State level, and similar 
programmes should be created at the local level;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Programmes of psychological assistance should be generalized and 
strengthened where they already exist. Such programmes should also include a gender 
perspective and give special attention to the specific trauma suffered by members of 
the family of a disappeared person; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Measures of vetting should be improved and/or systematized. Whereas 
such measures have been taken in the past, it is not clear whether those identified as 
perpetrators have been dismissed from public offices, including police forces. Similar 
vetting procedures should be organized to bar perpetrators from holding high-level 
offices in public companies. </b></p>

<p>91.<b> The Working Group invites the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
within 90 days from the date of the presentation of the present report at the sixteenth 
session of the Human Rights Council to provide the Working Group with a timetable 
showing the steps it intends to take to implement these recommendations.
