            Agreement.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Corporation
8. The Corporation hereby represents and warrants to the Subscriber that it has
been duly incorporated and is a valid and subsisting corporation under the laws
of the State of Nevada, United States, is extra-provincially registered in the
Province of Alberta, Canada and has full corporate power and authority to enter
into this Subscription Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.
9. The Corporation hereby covenants with the Subscriber that it will take all
corporate action required to issue to the Subscriber the Units and the Common
Shares and the Warrants comprising the Units on the Closing Date.
Registration Rights
10. If the Corporation proposes to register, pursuant to any registration rights
agreement (a "Registration Rights Agreement"), for shareholders other than the
Subscriber, any of its Common Shares or other equity securities (or securities
convertible into equity securities) under the U.S. Securities Act in connection
with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than a
registration on Form S-8, Form S-4 or Form F-4), the Corporation will, at all
such times, promptly give the Subscriber written notice of such proposed
registration. Upon the written request of the Subscriber, given within 20 days
after the mailing of such notice by the Corporation, the Corporation will,
subject to the provisions of applicable Registration Rights Agreements, use its
commercial best efforts to cause a registration statement covering all of the
(i) Common Shares being acquired hereunder and (ii) Warrant Shares that each
such holder has requested to be registered to become effective under the U.S.
Securities Act. Only to the extent they apply to "piggy back" registrations,
such registration shall also be subject to the other provisions of each
applicable Registration Rights Agreement. For greater certainty, (i) such
registration shall not be subject to any provisions of any Registration Rights
Agreement that are applicable only to "demand" registrations, and (ii) the
Subscriber acknowledges that except as contemplated by this Section, the
Corporation is under no obligation hereunder to register any of its securities
or to complete any offering of its securities it proposes to make, and the
Corporation will therefore incur no liability (including any penalties that may
be incurred under a Registration Rights Agreement) to the Subscriber for its
failure to register any of its securities or to complete any offering of its
securities.
