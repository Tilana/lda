About this report 
 
About this report 
Orora Limited (the Company) is a for-profit entity for the purposes 
of preparing this financial report and is domiciled in Australia.  The 
Company and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Group) 
are primarily involved in the manufacture and supply of packaging 
products and services to grocery, fast moving consumer goods and 
industrial markets.   
This general purpose financial report for the Group for the year 
ended 30 June 2016 was authorised for issue in accordance with a 
resolution of the Directors on 15 August 2016.  The Directors have 
the power to amend and reissue the financial report. 
This financial report is a general purpose financial report which: 
− has been prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting
Standards (AASBs), including Australian Accounting 
Interpretations adopted by the AASB, and the Corporations Act 
2001.  The financial report of the Group also complies with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) and 
Interpretations as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB);
− has been prepared under the historical cost basis except for
financial instruments which have been measured at fair value.  
Non–derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value 
through the income statement;
− is presented in Australian dollars with values rounded to the 
nearest $100,000 unless otherwise stated, in accordance with 
the ASIC Corporations (Rounding in Financial/Directors’ 
Reports) Instrument 2016/191;
− presents reclassified comparative information where required
for consistency with the current period presentation;
− adopts all new and amended Accounting Standards and
Interpretations issued by the AASB that are relevant to the 
operations of the Group and effective for reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2015;
− does not early adopt any Accounting Standards and
Interpretations that have been issued or amended but are not 
yet effective, with the exception of AASB 9 Financial

amendments to other standards, which was adopted on 1 July 
2015.  Refer to note 7.8 for further details; and

Key judgements and estimates 
The preparation of the financial statements requires management 
to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies.  
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.   
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity are 
set out below and in more detail in the related notes:

Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial 
statements of the Company and its controlled entities.  Details of 
the controlled entities (subsidiaries) of the Company are contained 
in note 6.1.   
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the 
consolidated financial statements from the date that the Group 
obtains control until the date that control ceases.  The subsidiary 
financial statements are prepared for the same reporting period as 
the parent company, using consistent accounting policies and all 
balances and transactions between entities included within the 
Group are eliminated.   
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition 
method of accounting when control is obtained by the Group.
Foreign currency 
Items included in the financial statements of each of the entities 
included within the Group are measured using the currency of the 
economic environment in which the entity primarily generates and 
expends cash (the ‘functional currency’).  These financial statements 
are presented in Australian dollars, which is the functional and 
reporting currency of the Company, Orora Limited.  
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the 
functional currency of the entity using the exchange rate prevailing 
at the date of the transaction.  Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  Foreign exchange gains 
and losses arising from the translation of the monetary assets and 
liabilities, or from the settlement of foreign currency transactions, 
are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in 
equity as qualifying cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.  The 
amounts deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges are 
recognised in the income statement when the hedged item affects 
profit or loss and for net investment hedges when the investment is 
disposed of. 
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of entities within 
the Group that have a functional currency different from the 
presentation currency, are translated into Australian dollars at the 
rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the income 
statements are translated at the average exchange rate for the year.  
The exchange differences arising on the balance sheet translation 
are taken directly to a separate component of equity in the 
Exchange Fluctuation Reserve.
Other accounting policies 
Significant and other accounting policies that summarise the 
measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of 
the financial statements are provided throughout the notes to the 
financial statements.

Section 1: Results for the year
30 June 2016
In this section
This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group.  On the following pages you will find 
disclosures explaining the Group’s results for the year, segmental information and earnings per share.  
Earnings before interest and related income tax expense (EBIT) is the key profit indicator for the segments, 
reflecting the way the business is managed and how the Directors assess the performance of the Group. 
This section also analyses the Group’s profit before tax by reference to the activities performed by the Group 
and an analysis of key operating costs.
Financial highlights of the Group
• Sales revenue of $3,849.8 million, up 13.0% 
• EBIT of $280.5 million, up 24.6% 
• Operating free cash flow of $329.1 million, up 36.2% 
• Earnings per share of 14.1 cents, up 29.4%
1.1 Segment results 
The Group’s operating segments are organised and managed 
according to their geographical location.  Each segment represents a 
strategic business that offers different products and operates in 
different industries and markets.  The Corporate Executive Team 
(the chief operating decision-makers) monitor the operating results 
of the businesses separately for the purpose of making decisions 
about resource allocation and performance assessment. 
The following summary describes the operations of each reportable 
segment.
Orora Australasia  
This segment focuses on the manufacture of fibre and beverage 
packaging products within Australia and New Zealand.  The products 
manufactured by this segment include glass bottles, beverage cans, 
wines closures, corrugated boxes, cartons and sacks, and the 
manufacture of recycled paper.
Orora North America 
This segment, predominately located in North America, purchases, 
warehouses, sells and delivers a wide range of packaging and other 
related materials.  The business also includes integrated corrugated 
sheet and box manufacturing and equipment sales capabilities and 
the recently acquired point of purchase retail display solutions and 
other visual communication services provided by the IntegraColor 
business (refer note 6.2). 
Other 
This segment includes the Corporate function of the Group. 
 
 
Accounting policies 
Segment performance is evaluated based on earnings before 
interest and related income tax expense (EBIT).  This measure 
excludes the effects of individually significant non-recurring 
gains/losses whilst including items directly attributable to the 
segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis.   
Interest income and expenditure and other finance costs are not 
allocated to the segments, as this type of activity is managed at the 
Group level.  Transfer prices between segments are priced on an 
‘arms-length’ basis, in a manner similar to transactions with third 
parties, and are eliminated on consolidation.
The results of the reportable segments for the year ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015 are set out below:

Calculation of EPS 
Calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share has been based 
on the following profit attributable to ordinary shareholders and 
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. 
EPS attributable to the ordinary equity holders of Orora Limited 
million
Earnings per share (EPS) is the amount of post-tax profit 
attributable to each share. 
Basic EPS is calculated on the Group profit for the year 
attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company of $168.6 
million (2015: $131.4 million) divided by the weighted average 
number of shares on issue during the reporting period, excluding 
ordinary shares purchased by the Company and held as Treasury 
Shares, being 1,194.9 million (2015: 1,203.0 million). 
Diluted EPS reflects any commitments made by the Group to 
issue shares in the future and so it includes the effect of the 
potential conversion of share options and rights granted to 
employees.  To calculate the impact it is assumed that all share 
options and rights are exercised and new shares are issued.

Accounting policies 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable.  Selecting the appropriate timing and amount of 
revenue recognised requires some judgement.
30 June 2016
Sale of goods 
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership 
have transferred to the customer and it can be reliably measured.  
Risk and rewards are considered passed to the customer at the time 
of delivery of the goods.  Revenue from the sale of products is 
measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable, 
net of returns allowances and discounts.  No revenue is recognised 
if:  
• 
• 
•
there is a risk of return of goods;  
there is continuing managerial involvement with the goods;  
there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the 
consideration due; or  
the costs incurred or to be incurred cannot be measured 
reliably.
•
Rendering of services 
With respect to services rendered, revenue is recognised in the 
period in which the services are rendered.  For fixed-price contracts 
revenue is recognised depending on the stage of completion of the 
service to be provided.

Depreciation and amortisation 
Depreciation in the year was $101.2 million (2015: $92.6 million) 
whilst the amortisation charge was $6.3 million (2015: $5.5 million).  
Refer to notes 3.5 and 3.6 for the Group’s accounting policy and 
details on depreciation and amortisation.
Operating leases 
The Group leases motor vehicles, plant and equipment and property 
which are classified as operating leases.  The leases generally 
provide the Group with a right of renewal at which time all terms 
are renegotiated.  Payments made under operating leases are 
recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the 
term of the lease, while any material lease incentive is recognised as 
an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the 
lease.   
The minimum lease rental payments expensed during the year was 
$75.0 million (2015: $70.1 million).  There were no contingent rental 
payments (2015: nil). 
Refer to note 7.3 for future operating lease commitments.

Accounting policies 
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.  Income tax 
expense is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other 
comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised directly in 
equity or in other comprehensive income respectively.
Current Tax 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the 
period, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of 
previous periods.  Current tax is also adjusted by changes in 
deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary

differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, and by the availability 
of unused tax losses. 
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a 
legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a 
net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability 
simultaneously.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 2: Income tax (continued) 
 
Accounting policies (continued) 
Deferred Tax  
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method in which 
temporary differences are calculated based on the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the 
amounts used for taxation purposes.  Deferred tax is not recognised 
for:  
•
taxable temporary differences arising on the initial 
recognition of goodwill;  
taxable differences on the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit; and  
temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries 
to the extent that the Group is able to control the timing of 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable 
that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
•
•
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be 
applied when the temporary difference reverses, that is, when the 
asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.   
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary 
differences and unused tax losses only to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which 
the assets can be utilised.  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each 
reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer 
probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
30 June 2016
Offsetting deferred tax balances 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset and when the deferred tax balances 
relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable 
entity, or on different tax entities, but the Group intends to settle 
current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and 
liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities 
Deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised in respect of 
temporary differences arising as a result of the translation of the 
financial statements of the Group investments in subsidiaries.  The 
deferred tax liability will only arise in the event of disposal of the 
subsidiary, and no such disposal is expected in the foreseeable 
future. 
Unremitted earnings of the Group’s international operations are 
considered to be reinvested indefinitely and relate to the ongoing 
operations.  Upon distribution of any earnings in the form of 
dividends or otherwise, the Group may be subject to withholding 
taxes payable to various foreign countries, however, such amounts 
are not considered to be significant.  As the Group controls when 
the deferred tax liability will be incurred and is satisfied that it will 
not be incurred in the foreseeable future, the deferred tax liability 
has not been recognised.  There are no unrecognised deferred tax 
assets.
Key judgements and estimates 
The Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and foreign jurisdictions and as a result the calculation of the Group’s tax charge involves a 
degree of estimation and judgement in respect of certain items, including assumptions made in respect of the application of tax legislation.  
There are many transactions and calculations relating to the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is 
uncertain.  The Group recognises liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on management’s best estimate of whether additional taxes will 
be due.  Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, these differences impact the 
current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determinations are made. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable profits 
are available to utilise those temporary differences and losses, and the tax losses continue to be available having regard to the nature and 
timing of their origination and compliance with the relevant tax legislation associated with their recoupment.  The assumptions regarding the 
future realisation, and therefore the recognition of deferred tax assets, may change due to future operating performance and other factors. 
The assumptions made in respect of the recognised tax balances are subject to risk and uncertainty and there is a possibility that changes in 
circumstances or differences in opinion will alter outcomes which may impact the amount of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
recognised and the amount of tax losses and timing differences not yet recognised.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 3: Assets and liabilities
30 June 2016
In this section
This section details the assets used to generate the Group’s trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a 
result.  On the following pages there are notes covering working capital, other assets, non-current assets and 
provisions. 
Liabilities relating to the Group’s financing activities are set out in section 4, whilst the assets and liabilities recognised 
in respect of derivative instruments, used to hedge financial risks, are contained in Section 5.  Information pertaining 
to deferred tax assets and liabilities is provided in Section 2.
For some trade receivables the Group may also obtain security in 
the form of guarantees, deeds of undertaking or letters of credit 
which can be called upon if the counterparty is in default under the 
terms of the agreement. The Group does not otherwise require 
collateral in respect of trade and other receivables. 
The following tables sets out the ageing of trade receivables, 
according to their due date:

(1) These amounts generally arise from transactions outside the usual operating 
activities of the Group.  Interest may be charged at commercial rates where the 
terms of repayment exceed six months.  Collateral is not normally obtained.
Accounting policies 
Trade receivables and loans and other receivables are all classified 
as financial assets held at amortised cost. 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method, less a loss allowance provision.  The carrying value of trade 
and other receivables, less impairment provisions, is considered to 
approximate fair value, due to the short-term nature of the 
receivables. 
Impairment of trade receivables  
The collectability of trade and other receivables is reviewed on an 
ongoing basis.  Individual debts which are known to be uncollectable 
are written off when identified.   
The Group recognises an impairment provision based upon 
anticipated lifetime losses of trade receivables.  The anticipated 
losses are determined with reference to historical loss experience 
and is regularly reviewed and updated. 
The amount of the impairment loss is recognised in the income 
statement within ‘general and administration’ expense.   
Loans and other receivables 
Loans are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable 
payments and are measured at their amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method and are usually interest-bearing.
Credit risks related to receivables 
In assessing an appropriate provision for impairments of receivables 
consideration is given to historical experience of bad debts, the 
ageing of receivables, knowledge of debtor insolvency or other 
credit risk and individual account assessment. 
Customer credit risk is managed by each business group in 
accordance with the procedures and controls set out in the Group’s 
credit risk management policy.  Credit limits are established for all 
customers based on external and internal credit rating criteria and 
letters of credit or other forms of credit insurance cover are 
obtained where appropriate.  In monitoring customer credit risk, 
customers are grouped according to their credit characteristics, 
including whether they are an individual or a legal entity, whether 
they are a wholesale, retail or end-user customer, their geographic 
location, industry and existence of previous financial difficulties.

agreements and are amortised over the period of the contractual arrangement.

Accounting policies 
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.  
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and 
selling expenses. 
Costs incurred in bringing each product to its existing location and 
condition are accounted for as follows.
•  Raw materials – purchase cost on a weighted average cost
formula
•  Manufactured finished goods and work in progress – cost of 
direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of 
production and variable overheads incurred in the normal 
course of business.
Cost may also include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on 
qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of 
inventory. 
During the period the Group recognised a net write-down of $3.9 
million (2015: $1.4 million) with regard to the net realisable value of 
inventories which has been recognised in ‘cost of sales’ expense in 
the income statement.

Accounting policies 
Trade and other payables are all classified as financial liabilities held 
at amortised cost.  Trade and other payables represent liabilities for 
goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the 
financial year which were unpaid at the end of the financial year and 
these amounts are unsecured.   
The carrying value of trade and other payables is considered to 
approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of the payables. 
Trade and other payables are included in current liabilities, except 
for those liabilities where payment is not due within 12 months 
from reporting date which are classified as non-current liabilities.

At 30 June 2016, no property, plant and equipment was provided as security for any interest-bearing borrowings (2015: nil). 
 
 
Accounting policies 
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation and impairment losses.  Cost includes expenditure that 
is directly attributable to the acquisition of the item including 
borrowing costs that are related to the acquisition, construction or 
production of an asset.  Cost may also include transfers from equity 
of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign 
currency purchases of property, plant and equipment.   
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount, or 
recognised as a separate asset, only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the Group.  
All other repairs and maintenance are charged to the income 
statement during the financial year in which they are incurred.
•  Buildings 1% - 5% 
•  Land improvements 1% - 3% 
•  Plant and equipment 2.5% - 25%
Depreciation 
Property, plant and equipment, excluding freehold land, is 
depreciated at rates based upon the expected useful lives, or in the 
case of leasehold improvements and certain leased plant and 
equipment the lease term, using the straight-line method.  Land is 
not depreciated.  Depreciation rates used for each class of asset for 
the current and comparative periods are as follows:
Key judgements and estimates 
Depreciation is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group expects an asset to be used over.  At each reporting date depreciation 
methods, residual values and useful lives are reassessed and adjusted if necessary.  In addition, assets subject to depreciation are reviewed for 
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset carrying amount may not be recoverable.  If an asset’s value 
falls below its depreciated value an additional one-off impairment charge is made against profit.  Refer note 3.8 for further details.

3.6 Intangible assets
The following note details the non-physical assets used by the Group to generate revenue and profits.   
These assets include computer software and licences, customer relationships and goodwill.  The cost of these assets is the amount that the 
Group has paid or, where there has been a business combination, the fair value of the specific intangible assets identified.  In the case of 
goodwill, its cost is the amount the Group has paid for acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual assets and liabilities 
acquired.  The value of goodwill is ‘intangible’ value that comes from, for example, synergies available with the integration of the acquired 
business into the Group, a skilled and knowledgeable assembled workforce, proprietary technologies and processes, a uniquely strong market 
position and customer relationships.

Goodwill 
The goodwill recognised by the Group has arisen as a result of 
business combinations and represents the future economic benefits 
that arise from assets that are not capable of being individually 
identified and separately recognised.   
Goodwill is initially measured as the amount the Group has paid in 
acquiring a business over and above the fair value of the individual 
assets and liabilities acquired.  Goodwill is not amortised but is 
instead tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and 
is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing goodwill is allocated to cash 
generating units as follows.  Refer to note 3.8 for further details.

Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets include computer software, customer 
relationships and software licences.  The cost of these assets is the 
amount that the Group has paid or, where there has been a 
business combination, their fair value at the date of acquisition.  
Internal spend on computer software is only capitalised within the 
development phase, when the asset is separate and it is probable 
that future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to 
the Group.  Following initial recognition, other intangible assets are 
carried at cost less amortisation and any impairment losses. 
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over 
their useful life and tested for impairment whenever there is an 
indication that they may be impaired.  Refer to note 3.8 for further 
details on impairment. 
Computer software and licences are amortised over a period of 
between three to ten years whilst customer relationships are 
amortised over a period of up to 20 years.  The amortisation period 
and method is reviewed each financial year. 
The Group does not hold any indefinite life other intangible assets.
30 June 2016
Key judgements and estimates 
The value of intangible assets, with the exception of 
goodwill, reduces over the number of years the Group 
expects to use the asset via an annual amortisation 
charge to the income statement.  The amortisation charge 
is calculated by estimating the number of years the Group 
expects to benefit from the use of the asset.  At each 
reporting date amortisation methods and useful lives are 
reassessed and adjusted if necessary.  In addition, assets 
subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment.   
Where there has been a technological change or decline 
in business performance a review of the value of the 
intangible assets, including goodwill, is undertaken to 
ensure the assets have not fallen below their amortised 
value.  Should an assets value fall below its amortised 
value an additional one-off impairment charge is made 
against profit.
the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation 
arising from past events; 
it is probable that cash will be paid to settle it; and
− 
−  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the
obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash 
flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects the current market assessments 
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.  The 
unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost in the 
income statement.

Asset restoration 
The Group is required to restore leased premises to their original 
condition at the end of the respective lease term.  The restoration 
requirements typically relate to excessive wear and tear or 
alterations that have been made to the lease property to 
accommodate the operations of the business.  
Where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to restore a 
site on which an asset is located, either through make-good 
provisions included in lease agreements or decommissioning of 
environmental risks, the present value of the estimated costs of 
dismantling and removing the asset and restoring the site is 
recognised as a provision with a corresponding increase in the 
related item of property, plant and equipment.  At each reporting 
date, the liability is remeasured in line with changes in discount 
rates, estimated cash flows and the timing of those cash flows.  Any 
changes in the liability are added to or deducted from the related 
asset, other than the unwinding of the discount, which is recognised 
as a financing cost in the income statement. 
Restructuring 
The restructuring provision primarily relates to cost reduction and 
reorganisation activities associated with the Australasia operations.  
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has a 
detailed formal restructuring plan and the restructuring has either 
commenced or has been publicly announced, including discussions 
with affected personnel, with employee-related costs recognised 
over the period of any required further service.  Future operating 
costs in relation to the restructuring are not provided for.  Payments 
falling due greater than 12 months after reporting date are 
discounted to present value.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 3: Assets and liabilities (continued) 
 
3.7 Provisions (continued) 
Accounting policies (continued) 
Employee entitlements 
The provision for employee entitlements represents the obligation 
for annual leave, long service leave entitlements and incentives 
accrued by employees.   
Liabilities for employee benefits such as wages, salaries and other 
current employee entitlements represent present obligations arising 
from employees’ services provided to the reporting date and are 
calculated at undiscounted amounts based on remuneration wage 
and salary rates, including related on-costs, such as workers 
compensation insurance and payroll tax, and are presented in other 
payables. 
The liability for annual leave and long service leave is measured as 
the present value of estimated future cash outflows to be made in 
respect of services provided by the employee up to the reporting 
date.  Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary 
levels, experience of employee departures and period of service.  
Expected future payments that are not expected to be settled within 
12 months are discounted using market yields at the reporting date 
of high quality corporate bonds.  The rates used reflect the terms to 
maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the 
estimated future cash outflows. 
Workers’ compensation, insurance and other claims 
The Group self-insures for various risks including risks associated 
with workers’ compensation.  Provisions are recognised for claims 
received and expected to be received in relation to incidents 
occurring prior to reporting date and are measured based upon 
historical claim rates.   
Estimated net future cash flows are based on the assumption that 
all claims will be settled and the weighted average cost of historical 
claims adjusted for inflation will continue to approximate future 
costs.
•  future inflation 
•  claim development
Key judgements and estimates 
A provision is recognised by the Group where an obligation exists relating to a past event, it is probable that a cash payment will be required 
to settle it, and the Group is not certain how much cash will be required to settle the liability.  The value of that provision is based upon 
estimates and assumptions with regards to the amount and timing of cash flows required to settle the obligation, which are dependent on 
future events.  The key assumptions applicable to the determination of the provisions are as follows: 
Employee entitlements 
The provision for employee entitlements is based on a number of management estimates, which include:
•  future increase in salaries and wages and on-cost rates 
•  future probability of years of service (long service leave provision)
•  future probability of employee departures
Workers’ compensation 
The self-insured workers’ compensation provision is based on a number of management estimates including, but not limited to:
•  claim administration expenses
•  historical weighted average size of claims
Asset restoration 
Asset restoration provisions require assessments to be made of lease make-good conditions and decommissioning and environmental risks.  
The provisions also require estimates to be made of costs to dismantle and remove equipment and to restore the site to the condition 
required under the terms of the lease and required by environmental laws and regulations. 
Restructuring 
Restructuring provisions require assessments to be made regarding the timing of recognition, specifically are plans sufficiently detailed, 
approved and communicated to support recognition at a point in time.  The provisions also require estimates to be made of the cost of 
restructuring and the timing of these cash outflows.
The judgements, estimates and assumptions used in the booking of all provisions are management’s best estimates based on current and 
forecast operating and market conditions.

Section 3: Assets and liabilities (continued) 
 
3.8 Impairment of non-financial assets 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Testing for impairment 
The Group tests property, plant and equipment, intangibles and 
goodwill for impairment:
No impairment of non-financial assets has been recognised 
during the year ended 30 June 2016 or 30 June 2015.   
In accordance with the Group’s accounting policies 
impairment losses recognised in prior periods were 
reassessed at 30 June 2016 for any indications that the loss 
may have decreased or may no longer exist, no such 
indicators were identified.
•  where there is an indication that an asset may be impaired
(which is assessed at least each reporting date);
•  where there is an indication that previously recognised
•
impairment (on assets other than goodwill) have changed; 
and 
at least annually for indefinite life intangibles and goodwill 
In testing for impairment, the recoverable amount is estimated for 
an individual asset or, if it is not possible to estimate the 
recoverable amount for the individual asset, the recoverable 
amount of the cash generating unit (CGU) to which the asset 
belongs.  CGUs are the smallest identifiable group of assets that 
generate cash inflows that are largely independent from the cash 
flows of other assets or group of assets.  Each CGU is no larger than 
an operating segment. 
Assets are impaired if their carrying value exceeds their recoverable 
amount.  The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined 
as the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal or value in use. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement if the 
carrying amount of an asset or a CGU exceeds its recoverable 
amount.  Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are 
allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs) and then, to reduce the 
carrying amount of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs).
Impairment calculations 
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that 
reflects the risks specific to the asset or CGU and the market’s 
current assessment of the time value of money.   
Value in use is assessed using cash flow projections for five years 
using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts and is 
management’s best estimate of income, expenses, capital 
expenditure and cash flows for each CGU.  Changes in selling prices 
and direct costs are based on past experience and management’s 
expectation of future changes in the markets in which the Group 
operates.  Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated 
using estimated growth rates which are determined with regard to 
the long-term performance of each CGU in their respective markets 
and are not expected to exceed the long-term average growth rates 
for the industry in which each CGU operates. 
The discount rate used in performing the value in use calculations 
reflects the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, as adjusted for 
specific risks relating to each geographical region in which the CGU’s 
operate.
Reversal of impairment 
Where there is an indication that previously recognised impairment 
losses may no longer exist or may have decreased, the asset is
30 June 2016
tested.  The impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change 
in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of the 
asset and is reversed only to the extent that the carrying amount of 
the asset does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, had no 
impairment loss been recognised.  Impairments recognised for 
goodwill are not reversed.
Goodwill impairment tests 
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to cash 
generating units or groups of cash generating units (CGUs) according 
to the level at which management monitors goodwill.  Goodwill is 
tested annually or more regularly if there are indicators of 
impairment.   
The following table presents a summary of the goodwill allocation 
and the key assumptions used in determining the recoverable 
amount of each CGU:

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs were based on the present 
value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the CGU 
(value in use).  Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections 
for five years using data from the Group’s latest internal forecasts.  
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those 
regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in 
earnings during the initial five year period.
Key judgements and estimates 
The determination of impairment involves the use of 
judgements and estimates that include, but are not limited 
to, the cause, timing and measurement of the impairment. 
Management is required to make significant judgements 
concerning the identification of impairment indicators, 
such as changes in competitive positions, expectations of 
growth, increased cost of capital, and other factors that 
may indicate impairment such as a business restructuring.  
In addition, management is also required to make 
significant estimates regarding future cash flows and the 
determination of fair values when assessing the 
recoverable amount of assets (or groups of assets).  Inputs 
into these valuations require assumptions and estimates to 
be made about forecast earnings before interest and tax 
and related future cash flows, growth rates, applicable 
discount rates, useful lives and residual values. 
The judgements, estimates and assumptions used in 
assessing impairment are management’s best estimates 
based on current and forecast market conditions.  Changes 
in economic and operating conditions impacting these 
assumptions could result in changes in the recognition of 
impairment charges in future periods.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 4: Capital structure and financing
30 June 2016
In this section
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital structure and related financing including its balance sheet 
liquidity and access to capital markets. 
The Directors determine the appropriate capital structure of the Group, specifically, how much is raised from shareholders 
(equity) and how much is borrowed from financial institutions (debt) in order to finance the Group’s activities both now 
and in the future.  Maintaining capital discipline and balance sheet efficiency remains important to the Group, as seen 
through the issuance of the US Private Placement notes during the year and other refinancing activities.  Any potential 
courses of action, in respect of the Group’s structure, take into account the Group’s liquidity needs, flexibility to invest in 
the business and impact on credit ratings. 
The Directors consider the Group’s capital structure and dividend policy at least twice a year ahead of announcing results 
and do so in the context of its ability to continue as a going concern, to execute the strategy and to invest in opportunities 
to grow the business and enhance shareholder value.
Capital is defined as the combination of shareholders’ equity, 
reserves and net debt.  The key objective of the Group when 
managing its capital is to safeguard its ability to continue as a 
going concern, so that the Group can continue to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, 
and maintain an optimal capital and funding structure. 
The aim of the Group’s capital management framework is to 
maintain an investment grade credit profile, and the requisite 
financial metrics, to secure access to alternate funding sources 
with a spread of maturity dates and sufficient undrawn 
committed facility capacity; and optimise, over the long term 
and to the extent practicable, the weighted average cost of 
capital to reduce the cost of capital to the Group while 
maintaining financial flexibility. 
The Group uses a range of financial metrics to monitor the 
efficiency of its capital structure, including on-balance sheet 
gearing and leverage ratios, and ensure that its capital 
structure provides sufficient financial strength to allow it to 
secure access to debt finance at reasonable cost.  At 30 June 
2016, the Group’s on-balance sheet gearing and leverage ratios 
were 29.6% (2015: 29.6%) and 1.6 times (2015: 1.9 times), 
respectively.

Section 4: Capital structure and financing (continued) 
 
4.2 Dividends (continued) 
Dividend reinvestment plan 
The Group operates a dividend reinvestment plan which allows 
eligible shareholders to elect to invest dividends in ordinary shares.  
All holders of Orora Limited ordinary shares with Australian or New 
Zealand addresses registered with the share registry are eligible to 
participate in the plan.  The allocation price for shares is based on 
the average of the daily volume weighted average price of Orora 
Limited ordinary shares sold on the Australian Securities Exchange, 
calculated with reference to a period of not less than ten 
consecutive trading days as determined by the Directors.  
Franking Account 
Franking credits are available to shareholders of the Company at the 
30.0% (2015: 30.0%) corporate tax rate.  Both the interim and final 
dividend for 2016 are 30.0% franked (2015: final dividend 30.0% 
franked, interim dividend unfranked).  The balance of the franking 
credits available as at 30 June 2016 is $5.5 million (2015: $0.4 
million), it is estimated that this will reduce by $7.8 million (2015: 
$6.2 million) after payment of the estimated final dividend on 17 
October 2016.  The Company is of the opinion that sufficient 
franking credits will arise from tax instalments expected to be paid 
in the year ending 30 June 2017. 
Conduit Foreign Income Account 
For Australian tax purposes non-resident shareholder dividends will 
not be subject to Australian withholding tax to the extent that they 
are franked or sourced from the Company’s Conduit Foreign Income 
Account.  For the 2016 dividends, 70.0% of the dividend is sourced 
from the Company’s Conduit Foreign Income account (2015: final 
dividend 70.0%, interim dividend 100.0%).  As a result 100.0% of the 
2016 dividends paid to a non-resident will not be subject to 
Australian withholding tax.  The balance of the conduit foreign 
income account as at 30 June 2016 is $100.9 million (2015: $116.9 
million), it is estimated that this will reduce by $42.2 million (2015: 
$33.8 million) after payment of the estimated final dividend on 17 
October 2016.
4.3 Net debt
During the period the Group successfully completed a US Private 
Placement of notes issued by its wholly-owned US subsidiary, 
raising USD250.0 million of which USD100.0 million matures in July 
2023 and USD150.0 million in July 2025.   
In addition to the above, the following facilities were also secured: 
•  a USD200.0 million five year USD revolving facility, through a 
syndicate of domestic and international financial institutions, 
maturing in April 2021, and
•  two bilateral agreements for $50.0 million, each with separate
domestic institutions, maturing in April 2018.
As at 30 June 2016, the Group also had access to a $400.0 million 
revolving multicurrency facility through a syndicate of domestic and 
international financial institutions maturing in December 2019.  This 
facility is unsecured and can be extended. 
During both the current and comparative reporting period Orora 
Limited has complied with the financial covenants of its borrowing 
facilities.

Accounting policies 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents include, cash at bank and on hand and 
short-term money market investments with an original maturity of 
three months or less and are classified as financial assets held at 
amortised cost.   
Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based on daily bank 
deposits.  Short-term deposits are made for varying periods, 
depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and 
earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.  
The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to 
approximate fair value due to the assets liquid nature. 
Bank loans 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of 
the consideration received, less directly attributable transaction 
costs.  Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing liabilities 
are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate 
method. 
Interest-bearing liabilities are derecognised when the obligation 
specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expires.  The 
difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that 
has been extinguished or transferred to another party and the 
consideration paid is recognised in profit or loss. 
Interest-bearing liabilities are classified as current liabilities, except 
for those liabilities where the Group has an unconditional right to 
defer settlement for at least 12 months after the reporting period 
which are classified as non-current liabilities. 
The US Private Placement notes have a carrying value of $333.8 
million while the fair value of the notes is $370.5 million.  For all 
other borrowings, the fair values are not materially different to their 
carrying amount since the interest payable on those borrowings is 
either close to current market rates or the borrowings are of a 
short-term nature.

4.4 Equity (continued) 
4.4.1  Contributed equity (continued) 
Ordinary shares 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.  The Company does not 
have authorised capital or par value in respect of its issued shares.  
All issued shares are fully paid, all shares rank equally with regard to 
the Company’s residual assets.  Ordinary shares entitle the holder to 
participate in dividends, as declared from time to time, and are 
entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company.  
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or 
the exercise of options are recognised as a deduction from equity, 
net of any related income tax benefit effects.   
Treasury shares 
Where the Orora Employee Share Trust purchases equity 
instruments in the Company that have been identified as treasury 
shares, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
costs is deducted from equity, net of any related income tax effects.  
When the treasury shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any 
consideration received, net of any directly attributable costs and the 
related income tax effects, is recognised as an increase in equity, 
and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented in 
retained earnings.  Refer to note 6.3 for further information on the 
Orora Employee Share Trust.

Accounting policies 
Cash flow hedge reserve 
The cash flow hedge reserve comprises the effective portion of the 
cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging 
instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet 
occurred and the cumulative change in fair value arising from the 
time value of options related to future forecast transactions.  Refer 
to note 5.4 for more information on hedging instruments.
Share-based payment reserve 
The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the fair value 
of options and rights recognised as an expense.  The Company 
provides benefits to employees of the Group in the form of share-
based payments, whereby employees render services in exchange 
for options or rights over shares.  Refer to note 7.1 for further 
details of the Groups share-based payment plans. 
The fair value of options and rights granted is recognised as an 
employee benefit expense in the income statement with a 
corresponding increase in the share-based payments reserve in 
equity and is spread over the vesting period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the option or right.  
Upon exercise of the options or rights, the balance of the share-
based payments reserve, relating to the option or right, is 
transferred to share capital.
30 June 2016
Demerger reserve 
The demerger reserve represents the difference between the 
consideration paid by Orora under an internal corporate restructure 
and the assets and liabilities acquired, which were recognised at 
their carrying value under a common control transaction.
Exchange fluctuation reserve 
For controlled entities with a functional currency, that is not 
Australian dollars, their assets and liabilities are translated at the 
closing exchange rate at reporting date while income and expenses 
are translated at year to date average exchange rates. 
On consolidation all exchange differences arising from translation 
are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
the exchange fluctuation reserve.  When a foreign operation is 
disposed of, the amount within the reserve related to that entity is 
transferred to the income statement as an adjustment to the profit 
or loss on disposal.
4.4.3  Retained earnings 
Retained earnings comprises profit for the year attributable to

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 5: Financial risk management
30 June 2016
In this section
The following section outlines how the Group manages the financial risks it is exposed to associated with holding financial 
instruments that arise from the Group’s need to access financing (bank loans and overdrafts and unsecured notes), from 
the Group’s operational activities (cash, trade receivables and payables) and instruments held as part of the Group’s risk 
management activities (derivate financial instruments).
Financial risk management is carried out by Orora Group Treasury under policies that have been approved by the Board for managing each of 
the below risks including principles and procedures with respect to risk tolerance, delegated levels of authority on the type and use of 
derivative financial instruments and the reporting of these exposures.  The treasury function reports regularly to the Audit & Compliance 
Committee and treasury procedures are subject to periodic reviews. 
In accordance with Board approved policies the Group typically uses derivative financial instruments to hedge underlying exposures arising 
from the Group’s operational activities relating to; changes in foreign exchange rates on foreign currency commercial transactions (transaction 
risk), translation of balance sheet items of foreign subsidiaries (translation risk), exposure to changes in commodity prices, changes in interest 
rates on net borrowings and changes in the Company’s share price.
The Group’s overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential 
adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance as set out in the table below:
Risk
Market risks 
-  Foreign exchange
risk
Exposure 
 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk because of its 
international operations.  These risks relate to future commercial 
transactions, financial assets and liabilities not denominated in A$ 
and net investments in foreign operations.
-
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of short and 
long-term borrowings where interest is charged at variable rates.
-  Commodity price
risk
The Group is exposed to changes in commodity prices in respect of 
the purchase of aluminium raw materials.
Management 
 
Where possible loans are drawn in foreign currency by foreign 
entities to create a natural hedge of foreign currency assets and 
liabilities.  Where this is not possible the Group’s policy is to 
hedge contractual commitments denominated in a foreign 
currency by entering into forward exchange contracts. Refer 
notes 5.1.1 and 5.4.
The Group mitigates interest rate risk primarily by entering into 
fixed rate borrowing arrangements.  Where necessary the Group 
hedges interest rate risk using derivative instruments – eg 
interest rate swaps.  Refer notes 5.1.2 and 5.4.
Where possible, the Group mitigates raw material commodity 
price risk by contractually passing rise and fall adjustments 
through to customers.  Refer notes 5.1.3 and 5.4.
-  Employee share
plan risk
Credit risk
The Group’s employee share plans require the delivery of shares to 
employees in the future when rights vest or options are exercised.  
The Group currently acquires shares on market to deliver these 
shares exposing the Group to cash flow risk – ie as the share price 
increases it costs more to acquire the shares on market.
The Group has established the Orora Employee Share Trust which 
manages and administers the Group’s responsibilities under the 
employee share plans through acquiring, holding and transferring 
shares or rights to shares in the Company to participating 
employees.  Refer note 5.1.4
The Group is exposed to credit risk from financial instrument 
contracts and trade and other receivables.  The maximum exposure 
to credit risk at reporting date is the carrying amount, net of any 
provision for impairment, of each financial asset in the balance 
sheet.
Liquidity and funding 
risk
The Group is exposed to liquidity and funding risk from operations 
and from external borrowings, where the risk is that the Group may 
not be able to refinance debt obligations or meet other cash 
outflow obligations when required.
The Group manages credit risk through a robust system of 
counterparty approval, granting and renewal of credit limits, 
regular monitoring of exposures against such credit limits and 
assessing the overall financial stability and competitive strength 
of the counterparty on an ongoing basis. Refer to notes 5.2 and 
3.1 for credit risk exposures relating to trade and other 
receivables. 
The Group only enters into financial instrument contracts with 
high credit quality financial institutions with a minimum long-
term credit rating of A- or better by Standard & Poor’s.
The Group mitigates funding and liquidity risks by ensuring that: 
•  a sufficient range of funds are available to meet working
capital and investment objectives;
•  adequate flexibility within the funding structure is maintained 
through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and unsecured 
notes;
•  through regular monitoring of rolling forecast of cash inflows
and outflows the cost of funding in minimised and that the 
return on any surplus funds is maximised through efficient 
cash management;
•  there is a focus on improving operational cash flow and
maintain a strong balance sheet.

Section 5: Financial risk management (continued) 
 
5.1 Market risks 
5.1.1  Foreign exchange risk 
The Group operates internationally and is therefore exposed to 
currency risk arising from movements in foreign currency rates, 
primarily with respect to the US Dollar and NZ Dollar.  The foreign 
exchange risk arises from: 
-
recognised monetary assets and liabilities held in a non-
functional currency and net investments in foreign operations 
(translation risk); and 
differences in the dates foreign currency commercial 
transactions are entered into and the date they are settled 
(transaction risk)
-
Translation risk 
To limit translation risk exposure the Group’s borrowings are 
generally denominated in currencies that match the cash flows 
generated by the underlying operations of the Group, which are 
primarily Australian and US dollars.  Interest payable on those 
borrowings is denominated in the currency of the borrowing.  In 
respect of the US operations this provides a natural economic hedge 
without requiring derivatives to be entered into. 
Exposure 
The summary quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to 
translation currency risk, as reported to the management of the 
Group, is as follows:

(289.3)

NZD

(5.7%)
Transaction risk 
To manage foreign currency transaction risk the Group’s policy is to 
hedge material foreign currency denominated expenditure at the 
time of commitment and to hedge a proportion of foreign currency 
denominated forecasted exposures (mainly relating to export sales 
and the purchase of inventory) on a rolling 18 month basis, using 
either a natural hedge where one exists, or through the use of 
forward foreign exchange contracts or foreign currency options 
taken out for up to two years from the forecast date.  
Sensitivity 
The following sensitivity illustrates how a reasonably possible 
change in the US dollar and NZ dollar would impact the fair value of 
the derivative financial instruments (refer note 5.4) held for future 
commercial transactions as at 30 June 2016:
•
•
if the Australian dollar had weakened by 10% against the US 
dollar with all other variables held constant, equity would 
have been $8.2 million higher (2015: $3.3 million higher). 
if the Australian dollar had weakened by 10% against the NZ 
dollar with all other variables held constant, equity would 
have been $15.3 million lower (2015: $10.1 million lower).
30 June 2016
Amounts recognised in profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income 
During the year, the Group recognised a foreign currency gain of 
$3.4 million (2015: loss $3.6 million) and a loss of $1.7 million (2015: 
gain $1.0 million) relating to foreign currency derivatives, that did 
not qualify as hedges, within general and administrative expenses in 
the income statement.   
In addition, a loss of $13.7 million (2015: $3.3 million loss) relating 
to cash flow hedges and a $13.5 million gain (2015: $16.3 million 
gain) on the translation of foreign operations was recognised in 
other comprehensive income, whilst a $2.6 million gain (2015: $2.9 
million loss) relating to cash flow hedges was transferred from 
equity to operating profit.  A loss relating to hedge ineffectiveness 
on interest rate swaps contracts of $0.9 million (2015: nil) was 
recognised in finance costs.
5.1.2  Interest rate risk 
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term 
borrowings with variable rates, which expose the Group to cash flow 
interest rate risk.  The Group’s Treasury risk management policy is 
to maintain an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate 
borrowings, monitoring global interest rates, and where 
appropriate, hedging floating interest rate exposures or borrowings 
at fixed interest rates through the use of interest rate swaps and 
forward interest rate contracts.   
The Group’s policy is to hold up to 85.0% fixed rate debt.  At 30 June 
2016 approximately 83.0% (2015: 45.0%) of the Group’s debt is 
fixed rate.
Exposure 
The Group had the following variable rate borrowings and interest 
rate swap contracts outstanding at 30 June:

All of the Group’s interest rate swaps are predominantly classified as 
cash flow hedges so any movement in the fair value is recognised 
directly in equity.  The amounts accumulated in equity are 
transferred to the income statement in the period in which the 
hedged item affects profit or loss.  During the period a $0.4 million 
loss (2015: $8.9 million loss) was recognised directly in equity in 
relation to interest rate swaps. 
Sensitivity 
At 30 June 2016, if Australian and US interest rates had increased by 
1.0%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $0.8 million 
lower (2015: $3.8 million lower), net of derivatives.  If Australian 
dollar interest rates had decreased by 1.0%, post-tax profit for the 
year would have been $0.1 million higher (2015: $0.5 million 
higher), net of derivatives.  US dollar debts have been excluded from 
the sensitivity for interest rate decreases as rates are already below 
1.0%.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 5: Financial risk management (continued) 
 
5.1 Market risks (continued) 
5.1.3  Commodity price risk 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk arising from the 
purchase of aluminium.  In managing commodity price risk the 
Group is able to pass on the price risk contractually to customers 
through rise and fall adjustments.  In the case of aluminium some 
hedging is undertaken using fixed price swaps on behalf of certain 
customers.  Hedging undertaken is upon customer instruction and 
all related benefits and costs are passed through onto the customer 
on maturity of the transaction. 
The movements in commodity hedges are recognised in equity and 
the cumulative amount of the hedge is recognised in the income 
statement when the forecast transaction is realised.  There is no 
impact on profit as a result of movements in commodity prices 
where hedges have been put in place as the Group passes the price 
risk contractually through to customers.  As the Group ultimately 
passes on the movement risk associated with commodity prices to 
customers, no sensitivity has been performed.
5.1.4  Employee Share Plan risk 
The Group is exposed to movements in the value of ordinary shares 
of the Company in respect of the obligations under the Group’s 
Employee Share Plans (refer note 7.1).  To mitigate this risk the 
Group has established the Orora Employee Share Trust (the Trust) to 
manage and administer the Group’s responsibilities under the 
Employee Share Plans through the acquiring, holding and 
transferring of shares, or rights to shares, in the Company to 
participating employees. 
As at 30 June 2016, the Trust held 15,179,750 treasury shares in the 
Company (2015: 6,460,678) and 1,199,190 allocated shares in 
respect of the CEO Grant (2015: 932,132).  Refer to note 6.3 for 
further details.
5.2 Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or 
counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations.  It arises principally from the Group’s receivables from 
customers, cash and cash equivalents and in-the-money derivatives.  
There is also credit risk relating to the Group’s own credit rating as 
this impacts the availability and cost of future finance. 
The Group manages credit risk through the maintenance of 
procedures such as the utilisation of systems of approval, granting 
and renewal of credit limits, regular monitoring of exposures against 
such credit limits and assessing the overall financial stability and 
competitive strength of the counterparty on an ongoing basis.
Trade and other receivables 
Credit risk exposures related to trade and other receivables are 
discussed in note 3.1.
30 June 2016
Cash and cash equivalents and derivatives 
Credit risk related to balances with banks and financial institutions is 
managed by Orora Group Treasury in accordance with Group policy.  
The policy only allows financial derivative instruments to be entered 
into with high credit quality financial institutions with a minimum 
long-term credit rating of A- or better by Standard & Poor’s.  In 
addition the Board has approved the use of these financial 
institutions, and specific internal guidelines have been established 
with regards to limits, dealing and settlement procedures.   
The maximum exposure to credit risk by class of recognised financial 
assets at the end of the reporting period, excluding the value of any 
security held, is equivalent to the carrying amount and classification 
of the financial assets (net of any provisions) as presented in the 
statement of financial position.
Guarantees 
The Group’s policy is to provide financial guarantees only to certain 
parties securing the liabilities of subsidiaries, and are only provided 
in exceptional circumstances (refer note 7.3).
5.3 Liquidity risk and funding risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its 
financial obligations as they fall due.  The Group’s financing policy is 
to fund itself for the long term by using debt instruments with a 
range of maturities and to ensure access to appropriate short-term 
facilities.  Orora Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility within 
the funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts and bank 
loans.   
Management manages liquidity risk through maintaining minimum 
undrawn committed liquidity of at least $175.0 million that can be 
drawn upon at short notice and regularly monitoring rolling 
forecasts of cash inflows and outflows in relation to the Group’s 
activities.  This monitoring includes financial ratios to assess possible 
future credit ratings and headroom and takes into account the 
accessibility of cash and cash equivalents.
At 30 June 2016, the Group had access to:
Financing arrangements
•  A $400.0 million revolving multicurrency facility through a
syndicate of domestic and international financial 
institutions maturing in December 2019.  This facility is 
unsecured and can be extended
•  US Private Placement of notes USD250.0 million of which
USD100.0 million matures in July 2023 and USD150.0 
million which matures in July 2025
•  a USD200.0 million five year USD revolving facility, through
a syndicate of domestic and international financial 
institutions, maturing in April 2021
•  two bilateral agreements for $50.0 million each with 
separate domestic institutions, maturing in April 2018

Hedging activities and the use of derivatives  
What is a derivative? 
A derivative is a type of financial instrument typically used to manage risk.  A derivative’s value changes over time in response to underlying 
variables, such as exchange rates or interest rates, and is entered into for a fixed period of time.  A hedge is where a derivative is used to 
manage exposure in an underlying variable. 
The Group is exposed to certain market risks which include foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk.  In accordance 
with Board approved policies the Group manages these risks by using derivative financial instruments to hedge the underlying exposures. 
Why do we need them? 
The key market risks facing the Group: 
•  Foreign currency risk arises from:
-  translation risk – the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency profits, assets and liabilities (balance

Derivative instruments 
The following table sets out the fair value of derivative financial instruments analysed by type of contract.
borrowings
•  Forward exchange contracts and options are derivative instruments used to hedge transaction risk so they enable the sale or purchase of
foreign currency at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date.  The Group holds forward exchange contracts and options denominated in 
US Dollar, Euro and NZ Dollar to hedge highly probable forecast sale and purchase transactions (cash flow hedges);
•  Interest rate swaps are derivative instruments that exchange a fixed rate of interest for a floating rate, or vice versa, or one type of floating
rate for another, and are used to manage interest rate risk.  These derivatives are entered into to optimise the Group’s exposure to fixed 
and floating interest rates arising from borrowings.  These hedges incorporate cash flow hedges, which fix future interest payments, and fair 
value hedges, which reduce the Group’s exposure to changes in the value of its assets and liabilities arising from interest rate movements.
In respect of managing commodity price risk the Group uses forward commodity contracts.  Forward commodity contracts are derivatives 
instruments used to hedge price risk so they enable the purchase of aluminium raw materials at a known fixed rate on an agreed future date.  
On behalf of customers, aluminium hedging is undertaken using fixed price swaps.  The Group passes on the price risk of commodities 
contractually through to customers, including any benefits and costs relating to swaps upon their maturity (fair value hedge). 
Analysis of the derivatives used by the Group to hedge its exposure and the various methods used to calculate their respective fair values are
sheet risk) and non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities (income statement risk); and
-  transaction risk – the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Group’s future cash flows due to
changes in foreign currency between the date a commercial transaction is entered into and the date at which the transaction is settled
•  Interest rate risk arises from fluctuations in variable market interest rates impacting the fair value or future cash flows on long-term
•  Commodity price risk arises from significant changes in the price of key raw material inputs, in particular the purchase of aluminium

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 5: Financial risk management (continued) 
 
5.4 Hedging instruments (continued) 
Derivative instruments (continued) 
Derivative financial instruments are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures, the Group does not use derivatives to speculate.  As at 
30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015, the Group only held derivative financial instruments (hedging instruments) whose fair values were measured in 
accordance with level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
There were no transfers between level 1 and 2 for recurring fair value measurements during the year.  The Group does not hold any level 3 
derivative financial instruments.
30 June 2016
Accounting policies 
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the date the instrument is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at 
fair value or ‘marked to market’ at each reporting date.  The gain or loss on remeasurement is recognised immediately in the income statement 
unless the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument in which case the remeasurement is recognised in equity.   
Hedge accounting 
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group formally designates the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well 
as its risk management objective for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception 
and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly effective in 
offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.  Where option contracts are used to hedge forecast transactions, only the intrinsic 
value of the option contract is designated as the hedging instrument. 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:
•  fair value hedges - hedges of the exposure to fair value changes in recognised assets or liabilities or firm commitments;  
•  cash flow hedges - hedges of the exposure to variability in cash flows attributable to a recognised asset or liability or highly probable forecast
transaction; or
•  net investment hedges - hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
Net investment hedge
Financial instruments hedging 
changes in foreign currency when the 
net assets of a foreign operation are 
translated from their functional 
currency into Australian dollars.
On consolidation, foreign currency 
differences arising on the translation 
of financial assets and liabilities 
designated as net investment hedges 
of a foreign operation are recognised 
in other comprehensive income and 
accumulated in the foreign exchange 
reserve, to the extent that the hedge 
is effective.  Any ineffective portion is 
recognised in the income statement.
Fair value hedge
Cash flow hedge
A derivative or financial instrument 
designated as hedging the change in fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability or 
firm commitment.
A derivative or financial instrument hedging the 
exposure to variability in cash flow attributable to a 
particular risk associated with an asset, liability or 
forecasted transaction.
Changes in the fair value of the 
derivative are recognised in the income 
statement, together with the changes in 
fair value of the hedged asset or liability 
attributable to the hedged risk.   
The gain or loss relating to the effective 
portion of interest rate swaps, hedging 
fixed rate borrowings, is recognised in 
the income statement within ‘finance 
costs’, together with changes in the fair 
value of the hedged fixed rate 
borrowings attributable to interest rate 
risk.  The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised in the 
income statement within ‘other income’ 
or ‘general and administration 
expenses’.
The effective part of any gain or loss on the 
derivative financial instrument is recognised in 
other comprehensive income and accumulated in 
equity in the hedging reserve.    The change in the 
fair value that is identified as ineffective is 
recognised immediately in the income statement 
within ‘other income’ or ‘general and 
administration expenses’. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to 
the income statement in the periods when the 
hedged item affects profit or loss (for instance, 
when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place).  
However, when the forecast transaction that is 
hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial 
asset (for example, inventory), the gains and losses 
previously deferred in equity are transferred from 
equity and included in the measurement of the 
initial cost or carrying amount of the asset. 
Where options are used, changes in the fair value of 
the option are recognised in other comprehensive 
income depending on whether it is designated as 
the hedging instrument in its entirety, or it’s 
intrinsic value only.  If only the intrinsic value is 
designated, the option’s time value that matches 
the terms of the hedged item is be recognised in 
equity and released to profit or loss over the term 
of the hedged item.

Hedge accounting (continued)

Fair value hedge
Cash flow hedge
Discontinuation 
of hedge 
accounting
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria 
for hedge accounting, the adjustment to 
the carrying amount of a hedged item, 
for which the effective interest method 
is used, is amortised to the income 
statement over the period to maturity 
using a recalculated effective interest 
rate.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any 
cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that 
time remains in equity and is recognised when the 
forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the 
income statement.  When a forecast transaction is 
no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or 
loss that was reported in equity is immediately 
transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedge
Upon disposal of the foreign 
operation, which is subject to the net 
investment hedge, the cumulative 
amount that has been recognised in 
equity in relation to the hedged net 
investment is transferred to the 
income statement and recognised as 
part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Rebalancing 
If the hedging ratio for risk management purposes is no longer optimal but the risk management objective remains unchanged and the hedge 
continues to qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge relationship will be rebalanced by adjusting either the volume of the hedging instrument or 
the volume of the hedged item so that the hedge ratio aligns with the ratio used for risk management purposes.  Any hedge ineffectiveness is 
calculated and accounted for in profit or loss at the time of the hedge relationship rebalancing.
Key judgements and estimates 
The Orora Group Treasury team performs the financial instrument valuations and reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and 
the Audit & Compliance Committee.  Discussions of valuation processes and results are held with the CFO and Orora Group Treasury at 
least once every six months, in line with the Group’s half-yearly reporting requirements.  Significant valuation issues are reported to the 
Audit & Compliance Committee. 
When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible.  Fair values are 
categorised into three levels as prescribed under accounting standards, with each of these levels indicating the reliability of the inputs 
used in determining fair value.  The levels in the fair value hierarchy are: 
Level 1: fair value identified from quoted price traded in an active market for an identical asset or liability at the end of the reporting 
period.  The quoted market price used for assets is the last bid price. 
Level 2: fair value determined using valuation techniques that maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on 
entity-specific estimates.  All significant inputs used in the valuation method are observable. 
Level 3: one or more of the significant inputs in determining fair value for the asset or liability is not based on observable market data 
(unobservable input). 
Determining fair value 
The specific valuation techniques used to value derivative financial instruments are as follows:
•  the fair value of forward exchange contracts and currency options is determined by using the difference between the contract
exchange rate and the quoted exchange rate at the reporting date;
•  the fair value of interest rate swaps calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows – ie the amounts that the
Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the reporting date, based on observable yield curves;
•  the fair value of commodity forward contracts is determined by using the difference between the contract commodity price and the
quoted price at the reporting date.

The Group did not dispose of any controlled entities during the 
twelve month period ending 30 June 2016 (2015: nil).  Refer below 
for details of acquisitions.
6.2 Acquisition of controlled entities 
6.2.1  IntegraColor LLC 
On 1 March 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share 
capital of IntegraColor LLC (IntegraColor), a provider of point of 
purchase retail display solutions and other visual communication 
services for customers across consumer (food and beverage), 
healthcare/education and horticulture industries.  The operations 
are based in Dallas, Texas and service customers across North 
America.  The results of IntegraColor are included in the North 
America segment from the date of acquisition. 
The accounting for the IntegraColor acquisition has been 
provisionally determined as at 30 June 2016 as the post-close 
adjustment process remains in progress.  Management is continuing 
to assess the fair value of the opening balance sheet which may 
result in adjustments to the fair value attributable to the net assets 
acquired as reported below.

North American business and the skills and talent of IntegraColor’s 
workforce.   
Acquired receivables 
The fair value of acquired trade receivables is $22.7 million.  The 
gross contractual amount for trade receivables due is $22.8 million 
of which $0.1 million is expected to be uncollectable.

6.2.2  Jakait 
On 1 September 2015 the Group acquired the assets and business of 
Jakait, a supplier of packaging, logistics and label products to the 
greenhouse produce sector based in Ontario, Canada.   
The initial consideration was CAD16.5 million ($17.7 million) with an 
additional returns based consideration, of up to CAD5.5 million 
($5.9 million), payable over the next five years and resulted in the 
recognition of $15.7 million goodwill.  The results of the Jakait 
operations are included in the North America segment from the 
date of acquisition.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 6: Group Structure (continued) 
 
6.3 Orora Employee Share Trust 
The Group holds shares in itself as a result of shares purchased by 
the Orora Employee Share Trust (the Trust).  The Trust was 
established to manage and administer the Company’s 
responsibilities under the Groups Employee Share Plans (refer note 
7.1) through the acquiring, holding and transferring of shares, or 
rights to shares, in the Company to participating employees.  In 
respect of these transactions, at any point in time the Trust may 
hold ‘allocated’ and ‘unallocated’ shares.   
Allocated shares 
Allocated shares represent those shares that have been purchased 
and awarded to employees under the CEO Grant (refer note 7.1).  
Shares granted to an employee under the CEO Grant are restricted 
in that the employee is unable to dispose of the shares for a period 
of up to five years (or as otherwise determined by the Board).  The 
Trust holds these shares on behalf of the employee until the 
restriction period is lifted at which time the Trust releases the 
shares to the employee.  Allocated shares are not identified or 
accounted for as treasury shares. 
Where the Orora Employee Share Trust purchases equity 
instruments in the Company, as a result of managing the Company’s 
responsibilities under the Group’s CEO Grant Employee Share Plan 
award, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable 
costs is deducted from equity, net of any related income tax effects. 
Unallocated shares 
Unallocated shares represent those shares that have been 
purchased by the Trustee on-market to satisfy the potential future 
vesting of awards granted under the Groups Employee Shares Plans, 
other than the CEO Grant.  As the shares are unallocated they are 
identified and accounted for as treasury shares (Treasury Shares) 
refer note 4.4.1.
Accounting policies 
As at 30 June 2016 the Trust held 15,179,750 Treasury Shares 
(unallocated shares) in the Company (2015: 6,460,678) and 
1,199,190 allocated shares in respect of the CEO Grant (2015: 
932,132).   
Transactions with the Group-sponsored Trust are included in these 
financial statements.  In particular, the Trust’s purchases of shares in 
Orora Limited are debited directly to equity.  The shares are held in 
the Trust until such time as they may be transferred to participants 
of the various Group share schemes.  In accordance with the Trust 
Deed, the Trustees have the power to exercise all voting rights in 
relation to any investment (including shares) held within the Trust. 
Subsequent to the end of the current reporting period, on 15 August 
2016 the Board authorised management to issue a request to the 
Trustee to waive all right and entitlement to be paid the final FY16 
dividend in respect of Treasury Shares held by the Trust.  As a result, 
assuming the Trustee grants the request, the Treasury Shares will 
not receive a dividend payment in respect of the final FY16 dividend.

Section 7: Other
30 June 2016
In this section
This section includes additional financial information that is required by the accounting standards and the Corporation Act 
2001 including details about the Group’s employee reward and recognition programs.
7.1 Share-based compensation
The Group provides benefits to employees (including senior executives) of the Group in the form of share-based incentives.  The Orora 
employee incentive plans have been established to ensure employees are motivated and incentivised to develop and successfully execute 
against both short and long-term strategies that grow the business and generate shareholder returns.  The plans provide an appropriate level 
and mix of short and long-term incentives to appropriately recognise and reward employees creating a high performance culture and Orora’s 
ability to attract and retain talent.  Orora’s remuneration strategy is competitive in the relevant markets to support the attraction and 
retention of talent. 
The following information provides details of Orora’s employee incentive plans.  During the period the Group recognised a share-based 
payment expense of $8.6 million (2015: $5.5 million).  Employee expenses and employee provisions are shown in note 1.4 and 3.7 respectively. 
This note should be read in conjunction with the Remuneration Report, as set out in the Directors’ Report, which contains detailed information 
regarding the setting of remuneration for Key Management Personnel.

Section 7: Other (continued) 
 
7.1 Share-based compensation (continued) 
Accounting policies 
The cost of the share-based compensation provided to employees is 
measured using the fair value at the date at which the option or 
right is granted and is recognised as an employee benefit expense in 
the income statement with a corresponding increase in the share-
based payments reserve in equity.  The expense is spread over the 
vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally 
entitled to the option or right granted.  Upon exercise of the option 
or right, the balance of the share-based payment reserve, relating to 
the option or right, is transferred to share capital. 
At each reporting period the Group revises the estimate of the 
number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-
market vesting conditions.  Any impact to the revision of an original 
estimate is recognised in the income statement with a 
corresponding adjustment to the share-based payment reserve.  
The employee expense, recognised each period, reflects the most 
recent estimate.

Key judgements and estimates 
The fair value of options is measured at grant date taking into account market performance conditions, but excludes the impact of any 
non-market conditions (eg profitability and sales growth targets).  Non-market vesting conditions are included in the assumptions about 
the number of options that are expected to be exercisable.   
The fair value of each option granted is measured on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option pricing model that takes into 
account the exercise price, the vesting and performance criteria, and where applicable the market condition criteria, term of the option, 
impact of dilution, the non-tradeable nature of the option, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying 
share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option.   
The fair value of rights is measured at grant date using a Monte-Carlo valuation model which simulates the date of vesting, the 
percentage vesting, the share price and total shareholder return.  Once the simulated date of vesting is determined a Black-Scholes 
methodology is utilised to determine the fair value of the rights granted. 
The following weighted average assumptions were used in determining the fair value of options and rights granted during the period:
2015
4.20
24.00
1.66
1.22
3.00
3.50
2.55
3.35
The dividend yield reflects the assumption that the current dividend payout will continue with no anticipated changes.  The expected life 
of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.  The expected volatility 
reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Guarantees 
The Group has issued a number of bank guarantees to third parties 
for various operational and legal purposes.  In addition, Orora 
Limited has guaranteed senior notes issued by Orora DGP in the US 
private placement market in 2015, the notes have maturities 
between 2023 and 2025 (see note 4.3).  It is not expected that these 
guarantees will be called on. 
Other 
Certain entities in the Group are party to various legal actions and 
exposures that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  The 
actions are being defended and the Directors are of the opinion that 
provisions are not required as no material losses are expected to 
arise.
Key judgements and estimates 
Legal proceedings 
The outcome of currently pending and future legal, judicial, 
regulatory and other proceedings of a litigious nature 
cannot be predicted with certainty.  Legal proceedings can 
raise difficult and complex issues and are subject to many 
uncertainties and complexities including, but not limited to, 
the facts and circumstances of each particular case, issues 
regarding the jurisdiction in which each proceeding is 
brought and differences in applicable law. 
An adverse decision in a legal proceeding could result in 
additional costs that are not covered, either wholly or 
partially, under insurance policies, which could significantly 
impact the business and the results of operations of the 
Group.  
Each legal proceeding is evaluated on a case-by-case basis 
considering all available information, including that from 
legal counsel, to assess potential outcomes. Where it is 
considered probable that a future obligation will result in an 
outflow of resources, a provision is recognised in the 
amount of the present value of the expected cash outflows, 
if these are deemed to be reliably measureable.

Orora Limited financial information 
The financial information for the parent entity Orora Limited has been 
prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements, 
except as set out below. 
Investments in subsidiaries  
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are 
carried at cost less, where applicable, accumulated impairment losses. 
Tax consolidation regime 
Orora Limited and its wholly-owned Australian resident entities 
have formed a tax-consolidated group and are therefore taxed as a 
single entity.  The head entity within the tax-consolidated group is 
Orora Limited. 
The Company, and the members of the tax-consolidated group, 
recognise their own current tax expense/income and deferred tax 
assets and liabilities arising from temporary differences using the 
‘stand alone taxpayer’ approach by reference to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities in the separate financial statements 
of each entity and the tax values applying under tax consolidation. 
In addition to its current and deferred tax balances, the Company 
also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets), and the 
deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax 
credits assumed from members of the tax-consolidated group, as 
part of the tax-consolidation arrangement.  Assets or liabilities 
arising as part of the tax consolidation arrangement are recognised 
as current amounts receivable or payable from the other entities 
within the tax-consolidated group.
30 June 2016
Nature of tax sharing agreement 
Upon tax consolidation, the entities within the tax-consolidated 
group entered into a tax sharing agreement.  The terms of this 
agreement specify the methods of allocating any tax liability in the 
event of default by the Company on its group payment obligations 
and the treatment where a subsidiary member exits the group.  The 
tax liability otherwise remains with the Company for tax purposes.
Contingent liabilities of Orora Limited 
Deed of Cross Guarantee 
Pursuant to the terms of the ASIC Class Order 98/1418 (as amended) 
dated 13 August 1998, which relieved certain wholly-owned 
subsidiaries from specific accounting and financial reporting 
requirements, Orora Limited and all of the Company’s Australian 
wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into an approved deed for the 
cross guarantee of liabilities.  No liabilities subject to the Deed of 
Cross Guarantee at 30 June 2016 are expected to arise to Orora 
Limited and subsidiaries, as all such subsidiaries were financially 
sound and solvent at that date. 
Details of the deed and the consolidated financial position of the 
Company and the subsidiaries party to the Deed are set out in note 
7.5. 
Other guarantees 
Orora Limited has guaranteed senior notes issued by Orora DGP in 
the US private placement market in 2015, the notes have maturities 
between 2023 and 2025 (see note 4.3).  It is not expected that these 
guarantees will be called on.

7.8 New and amended accounting standards and
interpretations
7.8.1 Adopted from 1 July 2015 
All new and amended Australian Accounting Standards mandatory 
as at 1 July 2015 to the Group have been adopted, including the 
early adoption off AASB 9 Financial Instruments (Dec 2014).   
Although the adoption of these standards has resulted in some 
changes to the accounting policies of the Group they have not 
resulted in any material adjustment to the amounts recognised in 
the financial statements.  The adoption of AASB 9 (Dec 2014) is 
discussed further below.
AASB 9 Financial Instruments (Dec 2014) 
Orora early adopted and applied all of the requirements of  
AASB 9 (2014) including consequential amendments to other 
standards, from 1 July 2015.   
The adoption of AASB 9 (Dec 2014) impacts the Group as follows: 
Classification and Measurement 
The Group classified its financial assets and financial liabilities as 
subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value in 
accordance with AASB 9 (2014).  The principal impact on Orora’s 
financial assets at 1 July 2015 is the reclassification of cash and cash 
equivalents and trade and other receivables from ‘loans and 
receivables’ under AASB 139 to ‘financial assets at amortised cost’ 
under AASB 9 (Dec 2014). 
There were no material changes in the measurement of the Group’s 
financial assets and financial liabilities as a result of the change in 
classification.   
Hedging 
AASB 9 (2014) introduced a new hedge accounting model to simplify 
hedge accounting outcomes and more closely align hedge 
accounting with risk management objectives.  This has resulted in 
the following key changes to Orora’s hedge accounting: 
•
the intrinsic value of an option can now be designated as the 
hedging instrument, with the change in time value recognised in 
other comprehensive income rather than in profit and loss.  The 
amount recognised in other comprehensive income is then 
recycled to profit or loss either over the period of the hedge, if 
the hedge is time-related, or when the hedged transaction 
affects profit or loss, if the hedge is transaction related; 
effectiveness measurement testing will only be performed on a 
prospective basis with no defined numerical range of 
effectiveness applied in the testing.
•
Upon adoption of AASB 9 (Dec 2014), on 1 July 2015, there was a 
continuation of the existing hedge relationships.  As a result, there 
was no material impact on the income statement, the statement of 
comprehensive income, balance sheet or statement of changes in 
equity. 
The accounting policies for cash and cash equivalents (note 4.3), 
trade and other receivables (note 3.1) and derivative financial 
instruments (hedging instruments) (note 5.4) have been updated 
and are applicable from 1 July 2015.  The terminology in these 
policies has been updated in accordance with the requirements of 
AASB 9 (Dec 2014).  There has been no material change in the 
measurement and recognition of these items.

Notes to the financial statements 
Section 7: Other (continued) 
 
7.8.2  Issued but not yet effective 
The following new or amended accounting standards issued by the 
AASB are relevant to current operations and may impact the Group 
in the period of initial application.  They are available for early 
adoption but have not been applied in preparing this financial 
report.
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
AASB 15 replaces existing revenue recognition guidance, including 
AASB 118 Revenue, AASB 111 Construction Contracts, Interpretation 
13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, Interpretation 15 Agreements for 
the Construction of Real Estate, Interpretation 18 Transfers of Assets 
from Customers and Interpretation 131 Revenue – Barter 
Transactions Involving Advertising Services.  The new standard is 
based on the principle that revenue is recognised when control of a 
good or service transfers to a customer.  The notion of control under 
AASB 15 replaces the existing notion of risks and rewards under the 
current accounting standards.  The standard is applicable from 1 
January 2018 with early adoption permitted. 
The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of the new 
standard upon the Group’s revenue recognition policy and at this 
stage are unable to estimate the financial impact on adopting the 
standard.  The standard is not however expected to have a material 
impact upon the financial results of the Group.
AASB 16 Leases 
AASB 16 replaces the current dual operating/finance lease 
accounting model for lessees under AASB 117 Leases and the 
guidance contained in Interpretation 4 Determining whether an 
Arrangement contains a Lease.  The new standard introduces a 
single, on-balance sheet accounting model, similar to the current 
finance lease accounting.  Under the new standard Orora will be 
required to recognise a ‘right-of-use’ asset and a lease liability for all 
identified leased assets.  The current operating lease expense will be 
replaced with a depreciation and finance charge. 
The standard is applicable from 1 January 2019 with early adoption 
permitted with some targeted relief from the application of the 
lease accounting model where a lease is for a term of 12 months or 
less and for low value items. 
The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new standard 
upon the income statement and balance sheet.
AASB 2016-5 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – 
Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment 
Transactions 
AASB 2016-5 amends the accounting for cash-settled share-based 
payments and equity-settled awards that include a ‘net settlement’ 
feature in respect of withholding taxes.   
The amendment clarifies that the fair value of a cash-settled award 
is determined on a basis consistent with that used for equity-settled 
awards with any modification to a cash-settled award reflected 
immediately in the measurement of fair value.  Any incremental 
value added to an equity-settled award is to be recognised over the 
remaining vesting period, any reduction in value is ignored. 
In respect of net settlement features relating to withholdings taxes 
the amendments require the entity to disclose an estimate of the 
amount that it expects to pay to the tax authority in respect of the 
withholding tax obligations.
30 June 2016
The amendments are applicable from 1 January 2018, with early 
adoption permitted.  At the date of this report the assessment of 
the amendments made to AASB 2 by AASB 2016-5 indicate that 
there will be no impact upon the financial performance or position 
of Orora.  The Group has not granted any cash-settlement 
arrangements nor are there any net settlement features relating to 
tax obligations.  All current awards are accounted for as equity 
settled share based payments.
