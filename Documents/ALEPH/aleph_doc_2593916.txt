CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements contained in this report may contain “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). All
statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this report are forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of words
such as “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “project,” “intends,” “plans,” “pursue,” “target,” “continue,”
“believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” “estimates,” “predicts,” or “potential,” the negative of such
terms or variations thereon, or other comparable terminology. Statements that describe our future
plans, strategies, intentions, expectations, objectives, goals or prospects are also forward-looking
statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements. Readers should consider carefully the risks described under the “Risk Factors”
section included in our previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015, and the other disclosures contained herein and therein, which describe
factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated in forward-looking
statements, including, but not limited to, the following factors:
·volatility and weakness in commodity prices for oil and natural gas and the effect of prices set or
influenced by action of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”);
 ·substantial changes in estimates of our proved reserves;
 ·substantial declines in the values of our oil and natural gas reserves;
 ·our ability to replace our oil and natural gas reserves;
 ·the potential for production decline rates for our wells to be greater than we expect;
 ·the timing and extent of our success in discovering, acquiring, developing and producing oil and
natural gas reserves; 
 ·the ability and willingness of our partners under our joint operating agreements to join in our
future exploration, development and production activities;
 ·our ability to acquire leases and quality services and supplies on a timely basis and at
reasonable prices;
 ·the cost and availability of high quality goods and services with fully trained and adequate
personnel, such as drilling rigs and completion equipment;
 ·risks in connection with potential acquisitions and the integration of significant acquisitions;
 ·the possibility that acquisitions and divestitures may involve unexpected costs or delays, and
that acquisitions may not achieve intended benefits and will divert management’s time and
energy;
 ·the possibility that anticipated divestitures may not occur or could be burdened with unforeseen
costs;
 ·reductions in the borrowing base under our credit facility;
 ·risks incident to the drilling and operation of oil and natural gas wells including mechanical
failures;
 ·the presence or recoverability of estimated oil and natural gas reserves and the actual future
production rates and associated costs;
 ·the availability of sufficient pipeline and other transportation facilities to carry our production and
the impact of these facilities on prices;
 ·significant competition for acreage and acquisitions;
 ·the effect of existing and future laws, governmental regulations and the political and economic
climates of the United States;
 ·our ability to retain key members of senior management and key technical and financial
employees;
 ·changes in environmental laws and the regulation and enforcement related to those laws;
 ·the identification of and severity of environmental events and governmental responses to these
or other environmental events;
 ·legislative or regulatory changes, including retroactive royalty or production tax regimes,
hydraulic-fracturing regulations, derivatives reform, and changes in state, and federal income
taxes;
3
·general economic conditions, whether internationally, nationally or in the regional and local
market areas in which we conduct business, may be less favorable than expected, including the
possibility that economic conditions in the United States will worsen and that capital markets
will be disrupted or unavailable; 
 ·social unrest, political instability or armed conflict in major oil and natural gas producing regions
outside the United States, such as Africa, the Middle East, and armed conflict or acts of terrorism
or sabotage;
 ·the insurance coverage maintained by us may not adequately cover all losses that may be
sustained in connection with our business activities;
 ·other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, legislative, including federal, state and
tribal regulations and laws, geopolitical and technological factors that may negatively impact our
business, operations or oil and natural gas prices;
 ·the effect of our oil and natural gas derivative activities;
 ·title to the properties in which we have an interest may be impaired by title defects; and
 ·our dependency on the skill, ability and decisions of third party operators of oil and natural gas
properties in which we have non-operated working interests.
All forward-looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary
statements in this section and elsewhere in this report. Other than as required under the
securities laws, we do not assume a duty to update these forward-looking statements, whether as
a result of new information, subsequent events or circumstances, changes in expectations or
otherwise.

EARTHSTONE ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Earthstone Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Earthstone” or the “Company”) is an
independent oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the acquisition,
development, exploration and production of onshore, crude oil and natural gas reserves, with a
current focus on the Eagle Ford trend and Midland Basin in Texas and the Williston Basin of
North Dakota and Montana.
The accompanying Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Earthstone and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which we refer to as “we,” “our” or “us,” have been prepared in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
applicable to interim financial statements. The information furnished herein reflects all
adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for the fair presentation of the
Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods
presented.  The Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 is
derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with the generally accepted accounting
principles of the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. For
further information, see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the “2015 Form 10-K”).
Interim period results are not necessarily indicative of results of operations or cash flows for the
full year and accordingly, certain information normally included in financial statements and the
accompanying notes prepared in accordance with GAAP, has been condensed or omitted.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the 2015 Form 10-K, and the
Company’s other filings with the SEC.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Standards adopted in 2016
Debt Issuance Costs – In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
updated guidance which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial
statements.  Under this updated guidance, debt issuance costs are presented on the balance
sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.  Amortization of
the costs is reported as interest expense.  In August 2015, the FASB subsequently issued a
clarification as to the handling of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements that
allows the presentation of these costs as an asset.  The standards update was effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted this
standards update, as required, effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this standards update
did not affect the Company’s method of amortizing debt issuance costs and did not have a
material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Measurement-Period Adjustments – In September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that
eliminates the requirement to restate prior periods to reflect adjustments made to provisional
amounts recognized in a business combination.  The updated guidance requires that an acquirer
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period
in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The standards update
was effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this standard update, as required, effective
January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact on its Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Stock Compensation - In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on share-based
payment accounting.  The standards update is intended to simplify several areas of accounting
for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on
the statement of cash flows and forfeitures.  The standards update is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  The Company
elected to early-adopt this standards update as of April 1, 2016 in connection with its initial grant

record the impact of forfeitures on compensation cost as they occur.  The Company is also
permitted to withhold income taxes upon settlement of equity-classified awards at up to the
maximum statutory tax rates.  There was no retrospective adjustment as the Company did not

Standards not yet adopted
Revenue Recognition - In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance for recognizing
revenue from contracts with customers. The objective of this guidance is to establish principles
for reporting information about the nature, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows
arising from an entity’s contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative
disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and change in judgments, and
assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued
guidance deferring the effective date of this standards update for one year, to be effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In March 2016, the FASB issued
guidance which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations.
In April 2016, the FASB issued further guidance on identifying performance obligations and
clarification of the licensing implementation guidance.  Early adoption of this updated guidance is
permitted as of the original effective date of December 31, 2016.  The Company expects to adopt
this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018. The Company is in
the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on its Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements.
Leases – In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on accounting for leases.  This
update requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make
lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an
accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease
liabilities. Similar to current guidance, the update continues to differentiate between finance
leases and operating leases; however, this distinction now primarily relates to differences in the
manner of expense recognition over time and in the classification of lease payments in the
statement of cash flows. The standards update is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to use a
modified retrospective adoption, with certain relief provisions, for leases that exist or are entered
into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements when
adopted. The Company expects to adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the
first quarter of 2019.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the
adoption of this guidance on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Lynden Arrangement
In May 2016, the Company acquired Lynden Energy Corp. (“Lynden”) in an all-stock
transaction.  The acquisition was effected through an arrangement (the “Arrangement”) instead of
a merger because Lynden is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada.  The Company acquired
all the outstanding shares of common stock of Lynden through a newly formed Company
subsidiary, with Lynden surviving in the transaction as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company.  The   Company issued 3,700,279 shares of its Common Stock to the holders of
Lynden common stock in the transaction.
The Arrangement was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with FASB Topic
ASC 805, Business Combinations, which among things requires the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed to be measured and recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date.
An allocation of the purchase price was prepared using, among other things, a reserve report
prepared by qualified reserve engineers and priced as of the acquisition date. The following
allocation is still preliminary with respect to final tax amounts and certain accruals and includes
the use of estimates based on information that was available to management at the time these
condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared. Additional changes to the purchase
price allocation may results in a corresponding change to goodwill in the period of the change.

Beginning at the Effective Time, for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the
Company recognized $1.4 million of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids sales related to the
Lynden assets and $1.0 million of operating expenses, inclusive of depletion. During the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized $0.3 million and $0.7 million,
respectively, of non-recurring transaction costs related to this acquisition.
Other Acquisitions
In June 2015, the Company acquired a 50% operated working interests in approximately 1,000
gross acres in southern Gonzales County, Texas. The acreage, acquired for future Eagle Ford
development, is 100% held-by-production by two gross Austin Chalk wells with gross production
of 44 barrels of oil equivalent per day as of the time of acquisition.
Also during June 2015, the Company acquired 400 gross acres in northern Karnes County,
Texas, which is adjacent to the 1,000 gross acres in southern Gonzales County,
Texas.  Subsequent trades in Karnes County reduced the gross acreage from 400 to 350 gross
acres (117 net acres).

North Dakota, for $1.4 million plus purchase price adjustments of $2.0 million for the revenues,
net of production taxes and operating expenses and capital costs incurred for the existing
wells.  The acquisition included 164 net acres which allowed the Company to increase its
working interest in approximately 41 producing wells and 21 wells that are in the drilling and
completion phase.
In August 2015, the Company acquired a 33% working interest in approximately 1,650 gross
acres, in southern Gonzales County, Texas for $3.3 million.
Divestitures
In April 2015, the Company sold substantially all of its Louisiana properties located primarily in
DeSoto and Caddo Parishes for cash consideration of $3.4 million, recording a gain of $1.6
million.  The effective date of the transaction was March 1, 2015.

Note 3. Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, such as
commodity price risk. Derivative contracts are utilized to economically hedge the Company’s
exposure to price fluctuations and reduce the variability in the Company’s cash flows associated
with anticipated sales of future oil and natural gas production. The Company follows FASB ASC
Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to account for its derivative financial instruments. The
Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading purposes. It is the
Company’s policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy
financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive. The Company did
not post collateral under any of these contracts.
The Company’s crude oil and natural gas derivative positions consist of swaps. Swaps are
designed so that the Company receives or makes payments based on a differential between
fixed and variable prices for crude oil and natural gas. The Company has elected to not
designate any of its derivative contracts for hedge accounting. Accordingly, the Company records
the net change in the mark-to-market valuation of these derivative contracts, as well as all
payments and receipts on settled derivative contracts, in “Net loss on derivative contracts” on the
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. All derivative contracts are recorded at fair
market value and are included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or
liabilities.
With an individual derivative counterparty, the Company may have multiple hedge positions that
expire at various points in the future and result in fair value asset and liability positions. At the
end of each reporting period, those positions are offset to a single fair value asset or liability for
each commodity by counterparty, and the netted balance is reflected in the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets as an asset or a liability.
The Company nets its derivative instrument fair value amounts executed with each counterparty
pursuant to an International Swap Dealers Association Master Agreement (“ISDA”), which
provides for net settlement over the term of the contract. The ISDA is a standard contract that
governs all derivative contracts entered into between the Company and the respective
counterparty. The ISDA allows for offsetting of amounts payable or receivable between the
Company and the counterparty, at the election of both parties, for transactions that occur on the
same date and in the same currency.

Note 4. Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure (“ASC Topic 820”), defines fair
value as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820
provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a three level hierarchy for fair value
measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of
the measurement date and requires consideration of the counterparty’s creditworthiness when
valuing certain assets.
The three-level fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements defined by ASC
Topic 820 is as follows:
Level 1 – Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement
date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. An active market is defined as a market where
transactions for the financial instrument occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide
pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2 – Inputs, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are either directly or indirectly
observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date
and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life.
Level 3 – Prices or valuations that require unobservable inputs that are both significant to the fair
value measurement and unobservable. Valuation under Level 3 generally involves a significant
degree of judgment from management.
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Where available, fair value is based on
observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where
observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation
techniques involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is
dependent on the price transparency for the instruments or market and the instrument’s
complexity. The Company reflects transfers between the three levels at the beginning of the
reporting period in which the availability of observable inputs no longer justifies classification in
the original level. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels for the six months
ended June 30, 2016.

Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis. The
derivative financial instruments consist of swaps for crude oil and natural gas. The Company’s
swaps are valued based on a discounted future cash flow model. The primary input for the model
is published forward commodity price curves. The swaps are also designated as Level 2 within
the valuation hierarchy.
The fair values of commodity derivative instruments in an asset position include a measure of
counterparty nonperformance risk, and the fair values of commodity derivative instruments in a
liability position include a measure of the Company’s nonperformance risk. These measurements
were not material to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table summarizes the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities,

 $ —   $3,694   $ —   $3,694
Other financial instruments include cash, accounts receivable and payable, and revenue
royalties. The carrying amount of these instruments approximates fair value because of their
short-term nature. The Company’s long-term debt obligation on its credit facility has a floating
interest rate structure, therefore its carrying amounts approximates its fair value.
Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
The Company applies the provisions of the fair value measurement standard on a non-recurring
basis to its non-financial assets and liabilities, including oil and gas properties and
goodwill.  These assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are
subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. Fair value measurements of
certain assets acquired and certain liabilities assumed in business combinations are based on
inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent Level 3 inputs.  The fair value of
acquired properties is based on market and cost approaches.  Asset retirement obligation
estimates are derived from historical costs as well as management’s expectations of future cost
environments.  As there is no corroborating market activity to support the assumptions, the
Company has designated these liabilities as Level 3 as well.
The Company did not recognize any impairment write-downs with respect to its oil and natural
gas properties or goodwill during the six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.

Note 6.  Stock-Based Compensation
Incentive Plan
In December 2014, our stockholders approved and adopted, effective on December 19, 2014, the
2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”), which remains in effect until December 18,
2024.  In October 2015, the 2014 Plan was amended to increase the number of shares of our
common stock authorized to be issued.  Under the 2014 Plan, the board of directors is authorized
to grant stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
performance units, performance bonuses, stock awards and other incentive awards to the
Company’s employees or those of its subsidiaries or affiliates as well as persons rendering
consulting or advisory services and non-employee directors, subject to the conditions set forth in
the 2014 Plan.
The 2014 Plan currently provides that a maximum of 1,500,000 shares of the Company’s
common stock may be issued in conjunction with awards granted under the 2014 Plan.  Awards
that are forfeited or awards settled in cash are available for future issuance under the 2014
Plan.  As of June 30, 2016 727,500 shares of common stock remained available for issuance
under the 2014 Plan.
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic
718, Compensation – Stock Compensation.  The guidance requires that all stock-based
payments to employees and directors, including grants of restricted stock units, to be recognized
in the financial statements based on their fair values.

Restricted Stock Units
Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) represents a contingent right to receive one share of the
Company’s common stock and vest upon satisfaction of the requisite service conditions.  Prior to
the RSUs vesting, recipients have no ownership interest in the Company’s common stock, no
rights to vote and no rights to receive any dividends. The RSUs grant date fair values are based
on the Company’s closing common stock price at the date of grant. Expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award ensuring compensation
cost recognized is consistent with the number of awards vested. Forfeitures are accounted for as
they occur through reversal of the previously recognized expense on the awards that were
forfeited during the period.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company granted 772,500 RSUs with a
weighted average grant date fair value of $12.55. The RSUs vest over a 19 or 34 month period
with one-third of the award vesting at the end of either seven or 10 months and the remaining
two-thirds vesting monthly thereafter. As of June 30, 2016, all 772,500 RSUs were unvested.
For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized $0.6 million of
stock-based compensation expense. There was no stock-based compensation expense
recognized for the comparable periods in 2015.  At June 30, 2016, the Company had $9.1 million
of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.5 years.

In December 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million
four-year senior secured revolving credit facility.  At June 30, 2016, the borrowing base under the
credit agreement was $75.0 million and is subject to redetermination during May and November
of each year. As of June 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement bear
interest at a rate elected by the Company that is equal to a base rate (which is equal to the
greater of the prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and 1-month LIBOR plus
1.00%) or LIBOR, in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from
1.25% to 2.25% for base rate loans and from 2.25% to 3.25% for LIBOR loans, in each case
depending on the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. The
Company is obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee of 0.50% per year on the unused portion
of the borrowing base, which fee is also dependent on the amount of the loan outstanding in
relation to the borrowing base. The Company is also required to pay customary letter of credit
fees.  Principal amounts outstanding under the credit facility are due and payable in full at
maturity on December 19, 2018. All of the obligations under the credit agreement, and the
guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had a $75.0 million borrowing base, with $10.0 million of debt
outstanding, (bearing an interest rate of 2.715%), $0.2 million of letters of credit outstanding,
resulting in $64.8 million of borrowing base availability under its credit facility.
The credit facility contains a number of customary covenants that, among other things, restrict,
subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens
on asset, pay dividends, and repurchase its capital stock. In addition, the Company is required to
maintain certain financial ratios, including a minimum modified current ratio which includes the
available borrowing base of 1.0 to 1.0 and a maximum annualized quarterly leverage ratio of 4.0
to 1.0. The Company is also required to submit an audited annual report 120 days after the end of
each fiscal period.  As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company was in
compliance with these covenants under the credit facility.
Interest expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, includes amortization of
deferred financing costs of $72,000 and $0.1, million, respectively. Interest expense for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2015, includes amortization of deferred financing costs of
$65,000 and $0.1, million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0.8
million of costs, net of amortization, associated with the credit facility have been
capitalized.  These costs are included in Other noncurrent assets on the Company’s Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company’s policy is to capitalize the financing costs
associated with the credit agreement and amortize those costs on a straight-line basis over the
term of the credit agreement.
Promissory Note
In July 2016, the Company issued a $5.1 million unsecured promissory note to a drilling rig
contractor in settlement of rig idle charges and the termination amount of the contract.  These
expenses from late January 2016 through June 30, 2016 were recognized in the Company’s
Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations in the line item Rig idle and contract
termination expense. The note amortizes over a three-year period maturing in July 2019, with an
annualized interest rate of 8.0% for the first 12 months, 10.0% for
17

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(continued)
the subsequent 12 months, and 12.0% for the last 12 months, with no prepayment
penalty.  Interest expense will be recognized using the effective interest method of approximately
9.1% over the life of the note. As of June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $1.6 million as a
current liability and $3.5 million as a long-term liability relating to the note.
Note 8. Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company has asset retirement obligations associated with the future plugging and
abandonment of oil and natural gas properties and related facilities. The accretion of the asset
retirement obligation is included in “Lease operating expense” in the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Revisions to the liability typically occur due to changes in the
estimated abandonment costs, well economic lives, and/or the discount rate.
The following table summarizes the Company’s asset retirement obligation transactions recorded
during the six months ended June 30, 2016 (in thousands):

Note 9. Income Taxes
For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $0.2 million of
income tax expense related to its Lynden subsidiaries which include Lynden USA, Inc., a
company with taxable income in the United States and its Canadian parent company, Lynden
Energy, Inc. (collectively the “Lynden subsidiaries”).  The Company’s corporate structure requires
the filing of two separate consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns.  Taxable income of
Earthstone, excluding the Lynden subsidiaries cannot be offset by tax attributes, including net
operating losses of the Lynden subsidiaries, nor can taxable income of the Lynden subsidiaries
be offset by tax attributes of Earthstone, excluding the Lynden subsidiaries. The effective tax rate
for both the three and six month ended June 30, 2016 for the Lynden subsidiaries was 34.5%,
which included approximately 0.5% for the estimated portion of the subsidiaries income subject
to state income tax. The Company, excluding the Lynden subsidiaries, recorded no income tax
expense or benefit because property impairments recorded during the year ended December 31,
2015 reduced the book value of the Company’s properties below their tax basis requiring the
Company to record a net deferred tax asset.  Because the future realization of this deferred tax
asset could not be assured, the Company recorded a 100% valuation allowance against its
deferred tax asset. The pre-tax loss recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016,
increased the Company’s net deferred tax asset but did not result in a recognized tax benefit
because the realization of the Company’s net tax asset still cannot be assured, therefore, the
valuation allowance also was increased and offset the tax benefit that would have resulted from
the net operating loss. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company
recorded an income tax benefit of $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively, all of which was
deferred. The effective tax rate for the three and six month ended June 30, 2015 was 28% and
32%, respectively, which included approximately 0.7% of the estimated portion of the Company’s
income subject to income tax in the states in which the Company operates.
The Company provides for deferred income taxes on the difference between the tax basis of an
asset or liability and its carrying amount in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. This difference will result in taxable
income or deductions in future years when the reported amount of the asset or liability is
recovered or settled, respectively. In recording deferred tax assets, the Company considers
whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets, if any, is dependent upon the
generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those deferred income tax assets
would be deductible.
Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies
In the course of its business affairs and operations, the Company is subject to possible loss
contingencies arising from federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and
regulations and third party litigation.

Commitments
As a part of the 2013 Eagle Ford Acquisition, the Company and its primary working interest
partner in the area ratified several long-term natural gas purchasing and natural gas processing
contracts. As is customary in the industry, the Company has reserved gathering and processing
capacity in a pipeline. In one of the contracts, the Company and its primary working interest
partner have a volume commitment, whereby the owner of the pipeline is paid a fee of $0.45 per
MMBtu to hold 10,000 MMBtu per day of capacity. Since the time of the acquisition, the volume
commitment has not been met. The rate and terms under this purchasing and processing contract
expire on June 1, 2021.  As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s share of the remaining commitment
on this contract is approximately $4.1 million.
Contingencies
Environmental
The Company’s operations are subject to risks normally associated with the exploration for and
the production of oil and natural gas, including blowouts, fires, and environmental risks such as
oil spills or natural gas leaks that could expose the Company to liabilities associated with these
risks.
In the Company’s acquisition of existing or previously drilled well bores, the Company may not
be aware of prior environmental safeguards, if any, that were taken at the time such wells were
drilled or during such time the wells were operated. The Company maintains comprehensive
insurance coverage that it believes is adequate to mitigate the risk of any adverse financial
effects associated with these risks.
However, should it be determined that a liability exists with respect to any environmental cleanup
or restoration, the liability to cure such a violation could still accrue to the Company. No claim has
been made, nor is the Company aware of any liability which the Company may have, as it relates
to any environmental cleanup, restoration, or the violation of any rules or regulations relating
thereto.
Legal
From time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries may be involved in various legal
proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business.  In July 2015, EF Non-Op, LLC, a
subsidiary of the Company, filed suit in the 125th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas
against the operator of its properties in LaSalle County, Texas. In the case EF Non-Op, LLC vs.
BHP Billiton Petroleum Properties (N.A.), LP (F/K/A Petrohawk Properties, LP), the Company
claims the operator has breached the applicable joint operating agreements in numerous ways,
including, but not limited to, improper authorization for expenditure requests, improper and
imprudent operations, misrepresentation of charges and excessive billings, as well as refusal to
provide requested information. The Company also claims damages from negligent
representation and fraud.  The Company is seeking all relief to which it is entitled, including
consequential damages and attorneys’ fees. With respect to a portion of the litigation associated
with nine non-operated gas wells that were drilled in 2014 and placed on production in the first
half of 2015, BHP Billiton recently elected to deem the Company as a non-consenting working
interest owner regarding costs associated with the drilling, completing and operating of these
nine wells, as BHP’s sole and exclusive remedy.  The Company has accepted this “non-consent”
status. The litigation is continuing with respect to other disputes. The outcome of remaining
disputes in this proceeding is uncertain, and while the Company is confident in its position, any
potential monetary recovery to the Company cannot be estimated at this time.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital
resources should be read together with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements and notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in
this report as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “the Company,” “our,” “we,” “us,” and
“Earthstone” refer to Earthstone Energy, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Statements in this discussion may be forward-looking.  These forward-looking statements involve
risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which cause actual results to differ from
those expressed.  For more information, see “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-
Looking Statements.”
Overview
We are a growth-oriented independent oil and gas company engaged in the development and
acquisition of oil and gas reserves through an active and diversified program that includes the
acquisition, drilling and development of undeveloped leases, asset and corporate acquisitions,
and exploration activities, with our current primary assets located in the Eagle Ford trend of
South Texas, the Midland Basin of West Texas and in the Williston Basin of North Dakota.
  Future growth in assets, earnings, cash flows and share values will be dependent upon our
ability to acquire, discover and develop commercial quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that
can be produced at a profit and to assemble an oil and natural gas reserve base with a market
value exceeding its acquisition, development and production costs.  Our strategy includes a
combination of acquisition, development and exploration activities, typically in more than one
basin. Historically, we have shifted our emphasis among basins and these basic activities to take
advantage of changing market conditions and to facilitate profitable growth. The majority of our
efforts are currently focused on developing our acreage positions in our primary assets. In
addition, it is essential that, over time, our personnel expand our current projects and/or generate
additional projects so that we have the potential to replace economically our production and
increase our proved reserves.
During the first half of 2016, it was our intent to limit our operations.  We temporarily suspended
drilling and completion operations within our operated assets during the first half of 2016 and
reduced general and administrative costs by decreasing our head count and salaries. Generally,
employee base salaries were reduced 10% and certain employee benefits were
reduced.  Further, we do not intend to pay cash bonuses during 2016. Our actions are in direct
response to continuing low commodity prices. While we believe we have made appropriate
adjustments, we have also maintained a positive corporate culture and retained an outstanding
staff.  If commodity prices improve and stabilize during the second half of 2016, then we may
increase certain drilling and completion activities.  The following is a brief outline of our current
plans:
·pursue attractive asset or corporate acquisitions;
 ·maintain and  expand our acreage positions and drilling inventory;
 ·pending adequate commodity prices continue the development of our acreage positions in the
Eagle Ford trend, Midland Basin and in the Williston Basin;
 ·generate additional exploration and development projects; and
 ·obtain additional capital as available and needed, or utilize our common stock for acquisitions.
Commodity Prices:
The upstream oil and natural gas business is cyclical and we are currently operating in a
sustained low commodity price environment. Our consolidated average realized prices for the
first six months of 2016 decreased 31% for crude oil, 30% for natural gas and 23% for natural gas
liquids compared with the same period in 2015. These low prices resulted in a reduction in our
capital spending program, had significant negative impacts on our revenues, profitability, cash
flows and proved reserves, resulted in asset and goodwill impairments at the end of 2015, and
caused us to execute certain cost-saving organizational changes.
During the first six months of 2016, commodity prices continued to trade in a low range, with
crude oil prices falling during the first quarter below $30.00 per barrel on some occasions.
Towards the end of the second quarter prices improved and traded in the $40.00 to $50.00 per
barrel range. If the industry downturn continues or prices fall back to where they were in the first
quarter, we could experience additional material negative impacts on our revenues, profitability,
cash flows, liquidity, and reserves, and we could consider reductions in our capital program.  Our
production could decline further as a result of these activities.
20
Acquisitions and Divestitures:
In April 2015, we sold substantially all of our Louisiana properties located primarily in DeSoto
and Caddo Parishes for cash consideration of $3.4 million, recording a gain of $1.6 million.  The
effective date of the transaction was March 1, 2015.
In June 2015, we acquired a 50% operated working interest in approximately 1,000 gross acres
in southern Gonzales County, Texas. The acreage, acquired for future Eagle Ford development,
is 100% held-by-production from two gross Austin Chalk wells with gross production of 44 barrels
of oil per day as of the time of acquisition.  This acreage position is expected to support 13 gross
Eagle Ford locations.
Also during June 2015, we acquired 400 gross acres in northern Karnes County, Texas, which is
adjacent to our 1,000 gross acres in southern Gonzales County, Texas.  Subsequent trades in
Karnes County reduced the gross acreage from 400 gross acres to 350 gross acres (117 net
acres) which has allowed for longer laterals and more efficient development.  We initiated drilling
on this acreage during the fourth quarter of 2015, with completion of the four wells expected
during the second half of 2016.
In June 2015, we acquired additional acreage and working interest in wells located within
existing Bakken units primarily located in the Banks Field of McKenzie County, North Dakota, for
$1.4 million plus purchase price adjustments of $2.0 million for the revenues, net of production
taxes and operating expenses and capital costs incurred for the existing wells.  The acquisition
included 164 net acres which allowed us to increase our working interest in approximately 41
producing wells and 21 wells that in the drilling and completion phase.
In August 2015, we acquired a 33% working interest in approximately 1,650 gross acres, in
southern Gonzales County, Texas for $3.3 million. This acreage supports 16 gross Eagle Ford
locations.
In May 2016, we acquired Lynden Energy Corp. (“Lynden”) in an all-stock transaction.  The
acquisition was effected through an arrangement (the “Arrangement”) instead of a merger
because Lynden is incorporated in British Columbia, Canada.  We acquired all the outstanding
shares of common stock of Lynden through a newly formed subsidiary, with Lynden surviving in
the transaction as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  We issued 3,700,279 shares of
our common stock to the holders of Lynden common stock in the transaction.

(1)Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of
natural gas equals one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). This ratio does not assume price
equivalency and, given price differentials, the price per barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas
and natural gas liquids may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.
(2)Amounts exclude the impact of cash paid/received on settled derivative contracts as we did
not elect to apply hedge accounting. Our derivatives have been marked-to-market through our
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as other income/expense:
which means that all our realized gains/losses on these derivatives are reported in other
income/expense. For further information, see the Net Loss on Derivative Contracts discussed
below.
As noted above, the Arrangement closed in May 2016. The revenue and expenses of the
Midland Basin properties acquired in the Arrangement were included in our results from May 18,
2016, the closing date of the transaction, through June 30, 2016.
Sales of Oil
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, oil revenues decreased by $4.1 million or 33%
relative to the comparable period in 2015. Of the decrease, $2.9 million was attributable to the
decline in our realized price and $1.2 million was attributable to decreased volume. Our average
realized price per Bbl decreased from $52.94 to $40.28 or 24%. We had a net decrease in the
volume of oil sold of 29 MBbls. The Midland Basin properties we acquired in the Arrangement
provided an additional 25 MBbls, however our operated Eagle Ford, which includes newer wells
in their initial steeper decline rate, decreased by 47 MBbls. The remaining 7 MBbls net decrease
was due to normal production declines and the variability in sales volumes in our other properties
mainly in Texas and North Dakota.
Sales of Natural Gas
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, natural gas revenues decreased by $1.0 million or
49% relative to the comparable period in 2015.  Of the decrease, $0.6 million was attributable to
the decline in our realized price and $0.4 million was attributable to decreased volumes. Our
average realized price per Mcf decreased from $2.68 to $1.87 or 30%. The volume of natural gas
sold decreased by 195 MMcfs, our non-operated Eagle Ford property decreased by 200 MMcfs,
our non-operated East Texas properties decreased by 46 MMcfs and our Oklahoma properties
decreased by 16 MMcfs. The Midland Basin properties we acquired in the Arrangement partially
offset these decreases and provided an additional 72 MMcfs. The remaining 5 MMcfs decrease
was due to production declines and variability in sales volumes in our conventional properties
mainly in Texas.
Sales of Natural Gas Liquids
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, natural gas liquids revenues decreased by $0.1
million or 18% relative to the comparable period in 2015. The average realized price per Bbl
decreased from $14.01 to $13.18 or 6%. The volume of natural gas liquids sold decreased by 8
MBbl or 14%. Our volumes sold decreased at both our operated and non-operated Eagle Ford
properties and our non-operated assets in the Bakken-Three Forks area. These decreases were
partially offset by 13 MBbl provided by the Midland Basin properties we acquired in the
Arrangement.

Lease Operating Expenses
Lease operating expenses (“LOE”) includes all costs incurred to operate wells and related
facilities for both operated and non-operated properties. In addition to direct operating costs such
as labor, repairs and maintenance, equipment rentals, materials and supplies, fuel and
chemicals, LOE includes product marketing and transportation fees, insurance, ad valorem taxes,
accretion expense related to asset retirement obligations, and overhead charges from other
operators provided for in operating agreements.

Total LOE decreased by $1.0 million or 25% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 relative to
the comparable period in 2015.  On a unit-of-production basis, LOE, excluding ad valorem taxes
and accretion expense, also decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2016 by 10% or
$0.93 per BOE due to our continued focus on reducing operating costs, economies of scale on
our operated Eagle Ford property, and a decrease in the cost of oil field services in general.
Severance Taxes
Severance taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $0.2 million or 31%
relative to the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the decline in oil and natural gas
prices. As a percentage of revenues from oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, severance
taxes increased by 5% due to the mix of our production. During the three months ended June 30,
2016, a larger portion of a production and revenues where generated from oil wells, compared to
wells which primarily produce natural gas, which do not qualify for full or partial severance tax
exemptions.  This increase caused our overall severance tax rate to increase over the
comparable period during 2015.
Re-engineering and Workovers
Re-engineering and workover expenses include the costs to restore or enhance production in
current producing zones as well as costs of significant non-recurring operations which may
include surface repairs. These costs increased by $0.1 million during the three months ended
June 30, 2016, relative to the comparable period during 2015, due to the mix of projects and the
variability of our working interest in the areas in which the projects are occurring. We continually
evaluate these projects and weigh the advantages of the projects while seeking to control current
and future expenditures.
23
Rig Idle and Contract Termination Expenses
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we incurred rig idle and contract termination
expenses of $3.8 million related to the drilling rig we had under contract. We entered into an
agreement with the lessor of the rig to terminate our contract. Per the terms of the agreement, a
termination fee for the remaining commitment on the contract was due and the termination fees
were retroactively applied back to January 2016, when we suspended our daily drilling and
temporarily idled this contracted drilling rig. In connection with the termination, we issued a three-
year amortizing promissory note with a principal amount of $5.1 million, which was equivalent to
the unpaid idle charges and the termination fee.
General and Administrative Expenses (“G&A”)
G&A - primarily consist of employee remuneration, professional and consulting fees and other
overhead expenses.  G&A expenses decreased by $0.2 million from $2.5 million during the three
months ended June 30, 2015 to $2.3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016
primarily due to the salary and benefits reductions summarized in the Overview section above
offset by professional fees related to the Arrangement of $0.3 million.
G&A – stock-based compensation includes the expense associated with the grant of restricted
stock units (“RSUs”) issued to employees and non-employee directors. During the three months
ended June 30, 2016 we recognized expense of $0.6 million related to the RSU grants that
occurred on May 20, 2016 and June 1, 2016. The comparable prior period had no stock-based
compensation expense since there were not any previously granted RSUs or other equity based
compensation granted.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (“DD&A”)
DD&A decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 by $3.1 million, or 35% relative to
the comparable period during 2015 due to lower production volumes and reduced net book value
in the 2016 period as a result of the significant impairments recognized as the end of 2015.  On a
per BOE basis, our overall DD&A rate, decreased by $4.74 or 22% from $21.10 during the three
months ended June 30, 2015 to $16.36 during the three months ended June 30, 2016, due to the
impact of proved property impairments of $94.0 million recorded at the end of 2015.  The reserve
decreases that lead to the impairments were primarily attributable to lower average oil and
natural gas prices.
Interest Expense
Interest expense includes commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, and interest
on outstanding indebtedness. Interest expense was $0.4 million for the three months ended June
30, 2016, as compared to $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.  During the
2016 period we had higher interest expense charges since we had a higher weighted average
debt balance that was incurred in connection with the Arrangement.
Net Loss on Derivative Contracts
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss on derivative contracts of
$4.2 million, consisting of net gains on settlements of $0.8 million and unrealized mark-to-market
losses of $5.0 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded net
settlements related to crude oil contracts of $0.7 million and $0.1 million related to natural gas
contracts. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a net loss on derivative
contracts of $1.3 million, consisting of net gains on settlements of $0.9 million and unrealized
mark-to-market losses of $2.2 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, all of our
net settlements related to crude oil contracts.
Income Tax Benefit
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $0.2 million of income tax expense
related to our Lynden subsidiaries, which include Lynden USA, Inc., a company with taxable
income in the United States and its Canadian parent company, Lynden Energy, Inc. (collectively
the “Lynden subsidiaries”).  Our corporate structure requires the filing of two separate
consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns.  Taxable income of Earthstone, excluding the
Lynden subsidiaries cannot be offset by tax attributes, including net operating losses of the
Lynden subsidiaries, nor can taxable income of the Lynden subsidiaries be offset by tax
attributes of Earthstone, excluding the Lynden subsidiaries.  The effective tax rate for the Lynden
subsidiaries was 34.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Excluding the Lynden
subsidiaries, we recorded no income tax expense or benefit because of property impairments
recorded in 2015, which reduced the book value of our properties below our tax basis requiring
us to record a net deferred tax asset. Because the future realization of this deferred tax asset
could not be assured, we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset. The pre-
tax loss we recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and other book to tax differences
increased our net deferred tax asset but did not result in a recognized an income tax benefit
because the realization of our
24
net deferred tax asset still cannot be assured; therefore, we increased our valuation allowance
and offset the entire deferred tax benefit.  During the three months ended June 30, 2015 we
recorded an income tax benefit of $0.3 million as a result of our pre-tax net loss.

(1)Barrels of oil equivalent have been calculated on the basis of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of
natural gas equals one barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). This ratio does not assume price
equivalency and, given price differentials, the price per barrel of oil equivalent for natural gas
and natural gas liquids may differ significantly from the price for a barrel of oil.
(2)Amounts exclude the impact of cash paid/received on settled derivative contracts as we did
not elect to apply hedge accounting. Our derivatives have been marked-to-market through our
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as other income/expense:
which means that all our realized gains/losses on these derivatives are reported in other
income/expense. For further information, see the Net Gain on Derivative Contracts discussed
below.
As noted above, the Arrangement closed in May 2016. The revenue and expenses of the
Midland Basin properties acquired in the Arrangement were included in our results from May 18,
2016, the closing date of the transaction, through June 30, 2016.
Sales of Oil
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, oil revenues decreased by $7.6 million or 36% relative
to the comparable period in 2015. Of the decrease, $6.5 million was attributable to the decline in
our realized price and $1.1 million was attributable to decreased volumes. Our average realized
price per Bbl decreased from $48.42 to $33.60 or 31%. We had a net decrease in the volume of
oil sold of 32 MBbls. The Midland Basin properties we acquired in the Arrangement provided an
additional 25 MBbls and our non-operated Bakken-Three Forks property increased by 4 MBbls;
these increases were offset by a 51 MBbls decrease from our operated Eagle Ford property,
which includes newer wells in their initial steeper decline rate, and a 10 MBbls decrease from our
non-operated Eagle Ford property.
26
Sales of Natural Gas
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, natural gas revenues decreased by $1.6 million or 44%
relative to the comparable period during 2015.  Of the decrease, $1.1 million was attributable to
the decline in our realized price and $0.5 million was attributable to decreased volumes. Our
average realized price per Mcf decreased from $2.71 to $1.90 or 30%. The volume of natural gas
sold decreased by 267 MMcfs; our non-operated Eagle Ford property decreased by 249 MMcfs,
our non-operated East Texas properties decreased by 28 MMcfs and we sold 33 MMcfs less as a
result of the sale of our Louisiana properties which was effective as of March 31, 2015. The
Midland Basin properties we acquired in the Arrangement partially offset these decreases and
provided an additional 72 MMcfs. The remaining 29 MMcfs decrease was due to production
declines and variability in sales volumes in our conventional properties mainly in Texas.
Sales of Natural Gas Liquids
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, natural gas liquids revenues decreased by $0.5 million
or 33% relative to the comparable period during 2015. The average realized price per Bbl
decreased from $14.38 to $11.01 or 23%. The volume of natural gas liquids sold decreased by
13 MBbl or 13%. Our volumes sold decreased at both our operated and non-operated Eagle Ford
properties and our non-operated assets in our Bakken-Three Forks area. These decreases were
partially offset by 13 MBbl provided by the Midland Basin properties we acquired in the
Arrangement.

Total LOE decreased by $2.3 million or 27% for the six months ended June 30, 2016 relative to
the comparable period in 2015.  On a unit-of-production basis, LOE, excluding ad valorem taxes
and accretion expense, also decreased during the six months ended June 30, 2016 by 19% or
$2.01 per BOE due to our continued focus on reducing operating costs, economies of scale on
our operated Eagle Ford property, and a decrease in the cost of oil field services in general.
Severance Taxes
Severance taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by $0.5 million or 35%
relative to the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the decline in oil and natural gas
prices. As a percentage of revenues from oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, severance
taxes remained relative flat an increased by only 3% due to the mix of production and revenues.
27
Re-engineering and Workovers
Re-engineering and workover expenses increased by $0.3 million during the six months ended
June 30, 2016 relative to the comparable period during 2015 due to the mix of projects and the
variability of our working interest in the areas in which the projects are occurring. We continually
evaluate these projects and weigh the advantages of the projects while seeking to control current
and future expenditures.
Rig Idle and Contract Termination Expenses
We incurred rig idle and termination expenses of $5.1 million during the six months ended June
30, 2016. In late January 2016, we suspended drilling and temporarily idled our contracted
drilling rig. Our rig contractor agreed to a reduced daily rate of approximately $20,000 per day
while the rig was idled. We entered into an agreement with the lessor of the rig to terminate our
contract. Per the terms of the agreement, a termination fee for the remaining commitment on the
contract was due and the termination fees were retroactively applied back to January 2016, when
we suspended our daily drilling and temporarily idled our contracted drilling rig. In connection
with the termination, we issued a three-year amortizing promissory note with a principal amount
of $5.1 million, which was equivalent to the unpaid idle charges and the termination fee.
General and Administrative Expenses
G&A – expenses increased by $0.4 million from $5.1 million during the six months ended June
30, 2015 to $5.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to additional
professional and consulting fees related to the Arrangement and the documenting and testing of
controls as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The increase in professional and consulting fees
was partially offset by the salary and benefits reductions summarized in the Overview section
above. Included in G&A for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are professional fees related to
the Arrangement of $0.7 million.
G&A – stock-based compensation includes the expense associated with the grant of RSUs
issued to non-employee directors and employees. During the six months ended June 30, 2016
we recognized expense of $0.6 million related to the RSU grants that occurred on May 20, 2016
and June 1, 2016. The comparable prior period had no stock-based compensation expense
since there were not any previously granted RSUs or other equity based compensation.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
DD&A decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2016 by $3.5 million, or 24% relative to the
comparable period during 2015 due to lower production volumes and reduced net book value in
the 2016 period as a result of the significant impairments recognized during the three-month
period ended December 31, 2015. On a per BOE basis, our overall DD&A rate, decreased by
$2.64 or 14% from $19.27 during the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $16.63 during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, due to the impact of proved property impairments of $94.0 million
recorded at the end of 2015.  The reserve decreases that lead to the impairments were primarily
attributable to lower average oil and natural gas prices.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.6 million compared to $0.3
million for the comparable period during 2015. During the 2016 period we had higher interest
expense charges since we had a higher weighted average debt balance due to the Arrangement
and higher amortization of deferred financing costs.
Net Loss on Derivative Contracts
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss on derivative contracts of
$3.5 million, consisting of net gains on settlements of $2.8 million and unrealized mark-to-market
losses of $6.3 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded net settlements
related to crude oil contracts of $2.6 million and $0.2 million related to natural gas contracts.
During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded a net loss on derivative contracts of
$0.6 million, consisting of net gains on settlements of $2.4 million and unrealized mark-to-market
losses of $3.0 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, we recorded net settlements
related to crude oil contracts of $2.2 million and $0.2 million related to natural gas contracts.
28
Income Tax Expense
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded $0.2 million of income tax expense
related to our Lynden subsidiaries. Our corporate structure requires the filing of two separate
consolidated U.S. Federal income tax returns.  Taxable income of Earthstone, excluding the
Lynden subsidiaries cannot be offset by tax attributes, including net operating losses of the
Lynden subsidiaries, nor can taxable income of the Lynden subsidiaries be offset by tax
attributes of Earthstone, excluding the Lynden subsidiaries.  The effective tax rate for the Lynden
subsidiaries was 34.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  Excluding the Lynden
subsidiaries, we have recorded no income tax expense or benefit because of property
impairments recorded in 2015, which reduced the book value of our properties below our tax
basis requiring us to record a net deferred tax asset. Because the future realization of this
deferred tax asset could not be assured, we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred
tax asset. The pre-tax loss we recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and other book
to tax differences increased our net deferred tax asset but did not result in a recognized an
income tax benefit because the realization of our net deferred tax asset still cannot be assured;
therefore, we increased our valuation allowance and offset the entire deferred tax benefit.  During
the six months ended June 30, 2015 we recorded an income tax benefit of $0.9 million as a result
of our pre-tax net loss.
29
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We expect to finance future acquisition, development and exploration activities through cash
flows from operating activities, borrowings under our credit facility, the sale of non-strategic
assets, various means of corporate and project financing, including the issuance of additional
debt and/or equity securities. In addition, we may continue to partially finance our drilling
activities through the sale of interest participations to industry partners or financial institutions,
and we could structure such arrangements on a promoted basis, whereby we may earn working
interests in reserves and production greater than our proportionate capital costs.
Common Stock Offering
In June 2016, we completed a public offering of 4,753,770 shares of common stock (including
253,770 shares purchased pursuant to the underwriter’s overallotment option), at an issue price
of $10.50 per share.  We received net proceeds from this offering of $47.1 million, after deducting
underwriters’ fees and offering expenses of $2.7 million. We used $37.8 million of the net
proceeds from the offering to partially repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit
facility; the majority of which was incurred in connection with the Arrangement.
Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and Promissory Note
In December 2014, we entered into a credit agreement providing for a $500.0 million four-year
senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with BOKF, NA dba Bank of
Texas (“Bank of Texas”), as agent and lead arranger, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association
(“Wells Fargo”), as syndication agent, and the Lenders signatory thereto (collectively with Bank of
Texas and Wells Fargo, the “Lender”).
The initial borrowing base of the Credit Agreement was $80.0 million and is subject to
redetermination during May and November of each year. In our latest redetermination, in May
2016, our borrowing base was set at $75.0 million. The amounts borrowed under the Credit
Agreement bear annual interest rates at either (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)
plus the applicable utilization margin of 2.25% to 3.25% or (b) the base rate (which is equal to the
greater of the prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and 1-month LIBOR plus
1.00%) plus applicable margin of 1.25% to 2.25%. Principal amounts outstanding under the
Credit Agreement are due and payable in full at maturity on December 19, 2018. All of the
obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by
substantially all of our assets. Additional payments due under the Credit Agreement include
paying a commitment fee to the Lender in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The
commitment fee, which is due quarterly, is 0.50% per year on the unused portion of the borrowing
base. We are also required to pay customary letter of credit fees.  At June 30, 2016, we had
approximately $64.8 million of borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement.  Our Credit
Agreement contains customary covenants and we were in compliance with them as of June 30,
2016.
In connection with the termination of a drilling rig contract, we entered into a $5.1 million three-
year promissory note which has an interest rate for the first year of 8%, 10% for the second year
and 12% for the third year and does not contain a prepayment penalty. The principle balance on
the note is equal to the unpaid idle fees that we previously included in accounts payable and the
remaining termination amount of the contract. The idle charges and the termination amount on
the rig contract was reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations during the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, and the note was included in our Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Cash Flows from Operating Activities
Substantially all of our cash flows from or used in operating activities are derived from and used
in the production of our oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids reserves.  We use any excess
cash flows to fund our on-going exploration and development activities in search of new
reserves. Variations in cash flows from operating activities may impact our level of exploration
and development expenditures.
Cash flows used by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $12.1
million compared to $10.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  The net loss, after
adjustments for non-cash items, provided cash of $6.0 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to $13.6 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the decrease in
revenues attributable to lower commodity prices compared to the prior year period. Changes in
operating assets and liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $17.9 million
compared to $24.0 million in the prior year period.  The decreases were primarily related to
changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses, advances and revenues and royalties payable
associated with reductions of drilling expenditures and revenues distributable.  We continue to
focus on controlling LOE and other operating costs in seeking to improve our operating cash
flows in this sustained low commodity price environment, and therefore believe that we have
sufficient liquidity and capital resources to execute our business plan over the next 12 months
and for the foreseeable future.
30
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We had a net cash outflow of $31.3 million related to the Arrangement; which was comprised of a
$36.6 million repayment of debt held by Lynden, net of the $5.3 million of cash held by Lynden of
$5.3 million. Cash applied to oil and natural gas properties for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015 was $6.7 million and $42.9 million, respectively. Cash applied to other non-oil
and gas property fixed assets for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $44,000
and $0.3 million, respectively.  The decrease in cash applied to oil and natural gas properties
was primarily due to our curtailment of drilling and completion activities as a result of lower
commodity prices.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
During the six months ended June 30, 2016 we completed an offering of common stock, as
discussed above, in which we received proceeds of $47.1 million, net of offering costs of $2.7
million.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we borrowed $36.6 million under our Credit
Agreement to pay off the credit facility of Lynden. Subsequent to our common stock offering, we
reduced the outstanding balance on our Credit Agreement to $10.0 million.
We had no significant financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Derivative Instrument and Hedging Activity
We do not engage in speculative commodity trading activities and do not hedge all available or
anticipated quantities of our production. In implementing our hedging strategy, we seek to
effectively manage cash flow to minimize price volatility.
We seek to reduce our sensitivity to oil and natural gas price volatility and secure favorable debt
financing terms by entering into commodity derivative transactions.  We believe our hedging
strategy should result in greater predictability of internally generated funds, which in turn can be
dedicated to capital development projects and corporate obligations.
Changes in fair value of commodity derivative instruments are reported in earnings in the period
in which they occur.  Our open commodity derivative instruments were in a net liability position
with a fair value of $2.6 million at June 30, 2016.  Based on the published commodity futures
price curves for the underlying commodity as of June 30, 2016, a 10% increase in per unit
commodity prices would cause the total fair value of our commodity derivative financial
instruments to decrease by approximately $2.4 million to a net liability of $5.0 million. A 10%
decrease in per unit commodity prices would cause the total fair value of our commodity
derivative financial instruments to increase by approximately $3.8 million to a net asset of $1.2
million. There would also be a similar increase or decrease in “Net gain on derivative contracts”
in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
In conjunction with our office lease located in The Woodlands, Texas, we established a letter of
credit in the amount of $0.2 million and $0.3 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.
Other than normal operating leases for office space and the letter of credit noted above, we do
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, special purpose entities, financing partnerships or
guarantees.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon
the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
Preparation of these Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to
make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues
and expenses. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies from
those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015.
31
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
Standards adopted in 2016
Debt Issuance Costs – In April 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance which changes the
presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements.  Under this updated guidance,
debt issuance costs are presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related
debt liability rather than as an asset.  Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense.  In
August 2015, the FASB subsequently issued a clarification as to the handling of debt issuance
costs related to line-of-credit arrangements that allows the presentation of these costs as an
asset.  The standards update was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted this standards update, as required, effective
January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this standards update did not affect our method of amortizing
debt issuance costs and did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Measurement-Period Adjustments – In September 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that
eliminates the requirement to restate prior periods to reflect adjustments made to provisional
amounts recognized in a business combination.  The updated guidance requires that an acquirer
recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period
in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The standards update
was effective prospectively for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015,
with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this standard update, as required, effective January 1,
2016, which did not have a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements.
Stock Compensation - In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on share-based
payment accounting.  The standards update is intended to simplify several areas of accounting
for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income tax impact, classification on
the statement of cash flows and forfeitures.  The standards update is effective for interim and
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  We elected to
early-adopt this standards update as of April 1, 2016 in connection with its initial grant of awards
under our 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan. We elected to record the impact of forfeitures on
compensation cost as they occur.  We are also permitted to withhold income taxes upon
settlement of equity-classified awards at up to the maximum statutory tax rates.  There was no
retrospective adjustment as we did not have any outstanding equity awards prior to adoption.
See Note 6 Stock-Based Compensation.
Standards not yet adopted
Revenue Recognition - In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
updated guidance for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The objective of this
guidance is to establish principles for reporting information about the nature, timing, and
uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers, including
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments
and change in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. In
August 2015, the FASB issued guidance deferring the effective date of this standards update for
one year, to be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In
March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal
versus agent considerations. In April 2016, the FASB issued further guidance on identifying
performance obligations and clarification of the licensing implementation guidance.  Early
adoption of this updated guidance is permitted as of the original effective date of December 31,
2016.  We will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of 2018.
We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on our
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Leases – In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance on accounting for leases.  This
update requires that a lessee recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make
lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an
accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease
liabilities. Similar to current guidance, the update continues to differentiate between finance
leases and operating leases; however, this distinction now primarily relates to differences in the
manner of expense recognition over time and in the classification of lease payments in the
statement of cash flows. The standards update is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Entities are required to use a
modified retrospective adoption, with certain relief provisions, for leases that exist or are entered
into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements when
adopted. We will adopt this standards update, as required, beginning with the first quarter of
2019.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact, if any, of the adoption of this guidance on
our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks associated with interest rate risks, commodity price risk and
credit risk. We have established risk management processes to monitor and manage these

Commodity Price Risk, Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activity
We are exposed to various risks including energy commodity price risk. When oil, natural gas,
and natural gas liquids prices decline significantly our ability to finance our capital budget and
operations may be adversely impacted. We expect energy prices to remain volatile and
unpredictable. Therefore, we use derivative instruments to provide partial protection against
declines in oil and natural gas prices and the adverse effect it could have on our financial
condition and operations. The types of derivative instruments that we may choose to utilize
include costless collars, swaps, and deferred put options. Our hedge objectives may change
significantly as our operational profile changes and/or commodities prices change. Currently, we
have hedged only a portion of our anticipated production beyond 2016 due to relatively low
commodity prices. As a consequence, our future performance is subject to increased commodity
price risks, and our future cash flows from operations may be subject to further declines if low
commodity prices persist. We do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative trading
purposes.
We are exposed to market risk on our open derivative contracts related to potential non-
performance by our counterparties. We enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties
that are creditworthy institutions and are deemed by management as competent and competitive
market makers. We did not post collateral under any of these contracts as they are secured under
our Credit Agreement or are uncollateralized trades. Please refer to Note 3 Derivative Financial
Instruments in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this
report for additional information.
We account for our derivative activities under the provisions of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and
Hedging, (“ASC 815”). ASC 815 establishes accounting and reporting that every derivative
instrument be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value.
Please refer to Note 3 Derivative Financial Instruments in our Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for additional information.
Interest Rate Sensitivity
We are also exposed to market risk related to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest rate
risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in short-term rates, which are LIBOR and the
prime rate based and may result in reductions of earnings or cash flows due to increases in the
interest rates we pay on these obligations.
At June 30, 2016, the principal amount of our total long-term debt with a variable interest rate was
$10.0 million and bears interest at rates further described in Note 7 Debt. Fluctuations in interest
rates will cause our annual interest costs to fluctuate. At June 30, 2016, the interest rate on
borrowings under our revolving credit facility was 2.715% per year. If these borrowings at June
30, 2016 were to remain constant, a 10% change in interest rates would impact our cash flow by
approximately $27,000 per year.
Disclosure of Limitations
Because the information above included only those exposures that existed at June 30, 2016, it
does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, our
ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate and commodity price fluctuations will
depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our commodity price risk management
strategies at the time and interest rates and commodity prices at the time.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is accurately recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that
such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control
objectives, and management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures.
As of June 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)).  Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2016 our disclosure controls
and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there were changes to the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting as described below:
Material weakness related to inadequate segregation of duties. As of December 31, 2015
management concluded that it had certain design deficiencies relating to the segregation of
duties, review and approval and verification procedures, primarily resulting from our limited
number of accounting staff, during a continuing industry-wide downturn, available to perform
such procedures. Additionally, management identified certain design deficiencies related access
over information systems. During 2016, the Company implemented the following measures to
address this previously reported material weakness:
·Provided additional management oversight and engaged additional consultants to improve the
overall design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting.
·Hired additional professional accounting staff that further enabled the delegation of certain prior
·Hired additional professional accounting staff that further enabled the delegation of certain prior
management responsibilities and improved other controls concerning segregation of duties,
review and approval and verification procedures.
 ·Improved information system controls by providing additional management oversight of the
process, aligning information system access consistent with our segregation of duties controls
and adding additional information system user access review and approval controls.
Management concluded that the above control enhancements successfully remediated the
material weakness related to segregation of duties during the second quarter of 2016.
There were no additional changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
