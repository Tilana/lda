equivalent
produced from
the Bracemac-
McLeod
development
project (the
“Bracemac-
McLeod Mine”)
for a per ounce
payment equal
to the lesser of
$350 and the
prevailing
market price of
gold. This
transaction
highlights the
synergy
between the
Company and
Sandstorm
Metals &
Energy which
has
concurrently
agreed to
purchase
17.5% of the
life of mine
copper from the
Bracemac-
McLeod Mine. •
During the three
months ended
September 30,
2011, gold
production
reached
feasibility levels
at both the
Aurizona Mine
and Santa
Elena Mine. •
Significant
progress has
been made on
the
development of
the Ming Mine,
which is
expected to
begin producing

OVERVIEW
The Company is
a growth
focused
company that
seeks to
acquire gold
purchase
agreements
(“Gold Streams”)
from companies
that have
advanced stage
development
projects or
operating
mines. In return
for making up
front payments
to acquire a
Gold Stream,
Sandstorm
receives the
right to
purchase, at a
fixed price per
ounce, a
percentage of a
mine’s gold
production for
the life of the
mine.
Sandstorm
helps other
companies in
the resource
industry grow
their
businesses,
while acquiring
attractive assets
in the process.
The Company is
focused on
acquiring Gold
Streams from
mines with low
production
costs,
significant
exploration
potential and
strong
management
teams. The
Company
currently has
seven Gold
Streams.
Effective
February 17,
2011, the
Company
changed its
name from
Sandstorm
Resources Ltd.
to Sandstorm
Gold Ltd.
OUTLOOK
Based on
existing Gold
Stream
agreements,
forecasted
2011
attributable
production is
16,000 to
18,000 ounces
of gold,
increasing to
over 50,000
ounces of gold
per annum by
2014. This
growth is driven
by the
Company’s
portfolio of Gold
Stream
agreements
with mines, all
of which are
either currently
producing or
expected to
commence
commercial
production by
2014.

BLACK FOX
GOLD
STREAM The
Company has
a Gold
Stream
agreement to
purchase
12% of the
life of mine
gold
produced
from Brigus
Gold Corp.’s
(“Brigus”)
open pit and
underground
Black Fox
mine, located
in Ontario,
Canada (the
“Black Fox
Mine”) and
10% of the
life of mine
gold
produced
from Brigus’
Black Fox
extension,
which
includes a
portion of
Brigus’ Pike
River
concessions
for a per
ounce
payment
equal to the
lesser of
$500 and the
then
prevailing
market price
of gold.
Brigus has
the option
until January
1, 2013 to
repurchase
50% of the
Brigus Gold
Stream by
making a
$36.6 million
payment to
the
Company,
upon receipt
of which, the
percentage
of gold the
Company is
entitled to
purchase will
decrease to
6% for the
Black Fox
Mine and
4.5% for the
Black Fox
extension.
The Black
Fox Mine
began
operating as
an open pit
mine, but
since mid-
2010, Brigus
began
development
of an
underground
mine. Both
open pit and
underground
operations
are running
concurrently,
feeding the
2,000 tonnes
per day mill.
Gold Streams
Current
activities at
the Black Fox
Mine include:
• Production
during the
three months
ended
September
30, 2011 was
16,838
ounces of
gold. • Mill
throughput
averaged
2,062 tonnes
per day
during the
three months
ended
September
30, 2011. •
During the
three months
ended
September
30, 2011,
Brigus
processed
189,674
tonnes of ore
at an
average
grade of 2.9
grams per
tonne (“g/t”)
and an
average
recovery of
95.2%. Of
the ore
processed,
75% was
mined from
the Phase 2
open pit. The
remainder
consisted
primarily of
underground
development
ore with a
small amount
from
underground
mining stopes
towards the
end of the
quarter and
low-grade
stockpiles
early in the
quarter. •
Underground
production
was a
combination
of ore from
mining stopes
and lower
grade
development
ore. • Mining
from the
open pit will
be reduced
as higher-
grade
underground
ore
production
increases in
future
quarters. •
Brigus
announced
at the end of
June that it
would
proceed with
an initial
expansion of
the Black Fox
mill, which is
expected to
be completed
and in
service,
during the
first quarter of
2012. This
initial
expansion will
increase
processing
capacity at
the Black Fox
mill to up to
2,200 tonnes
per day.
Processing
capacity and
recovery is
planned to
be increased
through
optimization
of existing
equipment,
some
equipment
additions and
elimination of
production
losses.

THREE
MONTHS
ENDED
SEPTEMBER
30, 2011
COMPARED
TO THE
THREE
MONTHS
ENDED JUNE
30, 2011 For
the three
months ended
September
30, 2011, net
income and
cash flow from
operations
were $4.4
million and
$8.6 million,
respectively,
compared with
$2.3 million
and $2.6
million for the
three month
period ended
June 30,
2011. The
increase in
net income
and cash flow
from
operations is
attributable to
a combination
of factors
including: • A
50% increase
in the number
of gold
ounces sold,
primarily due
to: i. 127%
increase in
gold deliveries
from the
Aurizona Mine
reflecting the
mine reaching
feasibility
levels of
production;
and ii. 21%
increase in
gold deliveries
from the Black
Fox Mine
reflecting the
continued
ramping up of
operations;
and iii. 77%
increase in
gold deliveries
from the
Santa Elena
Mine (of which
589 gold
ounces
remained in
inventory at
the end of the
third quarter);
and • A 15%
increase in
the average
realized
selling price of
gold; and • A
decrease of
$0.3 million in
non-cash
share-based
payment
expense.
Sales
continue to be
earned from
Gold Streams
in
geographically
secure
countries with
100% of
revenues
being
generated by
assets located
in North
America and
Brazil. THREE
MONTHS
ENDED
SEPTEMBER

COMPARED
TO THE
THREE
MONTHS
ENDED
MARCH 31,
2011 For the
three months
ended
September
30, 2011, net
income and
cash flow from

were $4.4
million and
$8.6 million,
respectively,
compared with
$1.0 million
and $1.6
million for the
three month
period ended
March 31,
2011. The
increase in
net income
and cash flow
from
operations is
attributable to
a combination
of factors
including: • A
111%
increase in
the number of
gold ounces
sold with such
increase
being primarily
related to
increased
production at
the Aurizona,
Black Fox,
Santa Elena
and Summit
Mines
reflecting the
continued
ramping up of
operations;
and • A 24%
increase in
the average
realized

gold. THREE
MONTHS
ENDED
SEPTEMBER
30, 2011
COMPARED
TO
REMAINING
QUARTERS
During the
three months
ended
December 31,
2010, the
Company
earned $1.7
million of net
income,
primarily
resulting from
(i) $1.6 million
in gross profit
driven by the
sale of 1,939
ounces of
gold; and (ii) a
foreign
exchange
gain of $1.4
million from
the
appreciation
of the
Company’s
Canadian
dollar
denominated
currency.
These gains
were partially
offset by (i)
administration
expenses of
$0.6 million;
and (ii) a non-
cash share-
based
payment of
$0.2 million.
Ounces of
gold sold
during the
three months
ended
December 31,
2010 were
lower than the
three months
ended
September
30, 2011,
June 30,
2011 and
March 31,
2011 as the
Aurizona
Mine, Santa
Elena Mine,
and Summit
Mine began
initial
production
late in 2010
and the
Company
began
purchasing
gold from the
Black Fox
Mine in 2011.
During the
three months
ended
September
30, 2010, the
Company
incurred a net
loss of $0.2
million
primarily
resulting from
administration
expenses and
project
evaluation
expenditures
that where in
excess of the
Company’s
$0.2 million
gross profit.
During the
three months
ended June
30, 2010, the
Company
incurred a net
loss of $1.1
million
primarily
resulting from
a loss of $0.7
million on the
fair value of
the warrant
liability. The
Company did
not have any
gold sales
prior to the
three months
ended June
30, 2010.
Therefore,
previous
quarter results
are not
comparable to
the quarters
ended June
30, 2010 and
thereafter.

Non-IFRS
Measures
The
Company has
included,
throughout
this
document,
certain non-
IFRS
performance
measures,
including (i)
average cash
cost per
ounce; and
(ii) Cash flow
from
operations
per share
(basic and
diluted). i.
Average cash
cost per
ounce is
calculated by
dividing the
Company’s
costs of sales
by the
number of
ounces sold
purchased.
The
Company
presents
average cash
cost per
ounce as it
believes that
certain
investors use
this
information to
evaluate the
Company’s
performance
in comparison
to other
companies in
the precious
metals mining
industry who
present
results on a
similar basis.
ii. Cash flow
from
operations
per share
(basic and
diluted) is
calculated by
dividing cash
generated by
operating
activities by
the weighted
average
number of
shares
outstanding
(basic and
diluted). The
Company
presents
operating
cash flow per
share as it
believes that
certain
investors use
this
information to
evaluate the
Company’s
performance
in comparison
to other
companies in
the precious
metals mining
industry who
present
results on a
similar basis.
These non-
IFRS
measures do
not have any
standardized
meaning
prescribed by
IFRS, and
other
companies
may calculate
these
measures
differently.
The
presentation
of these non-
IFRS
measures is
intended to
provide
additional
information
and should
not be
considered in
isolation or as
a substitute
for measures
of
performance
prepared in
accordance
with IFRS.

The Company
issued
compensation
warrants (the
“Compensation
Warrants”) to
agents in
2009. Each
Compensation
Warrant
entitles the
holder to
acquire one
unit comprised
of one
common share
of the
Company and
one-half of a
share
purchase
warrant. Each
Compensation
Warrant has
an exercise
price of $0.33
and 1,227,550
of the
Compensation
Warrants were
outstanding as
of November
9, 2011. Each
whole share
purchase
warrant issued
upon exercise
of the
Compensation
Warrants will
entitle the
holder to
purchase one
common share
at a price of
$0.60 until
April 23, 2014.
Financial
Instruments
The
Company’s
financial
instruments
consist of
cash, trade
and other
receivables,
investments,
trade and
other
payables, and
the warrant
liability. The
warrant liability
represents the
derivative
liability from
warrants
issued with
exercise prices
denominated
in Canadian
dollars as the
Company will
receive a
variable
amount of
cash in their
functional
currency of
U.S. dollars
when warrants
are exercised.
All financial
instruments
are initially
recorded at fair
value. CREDIT
RISK The
Company’s
credit risk is
limited to trade
and other
receivables in
the ordinary
course of
business. The
Company sells
gold
exclusively to
large
corporations
with strong
credit ratings
and the
balance of
trade and
other
receivables
owed to the
Company in
the ordinary
course of
business is not
significant.
Therefore, the
Company is
not exposed to
significant
credit risk and
overall, the
Company’s
credit risk has
not changed
significantly
from the prior
year.
CURRENCY
RISK The
Company is
exposed to the
fluctuations of
the Canadian
to U.S. dollar
as from time to
time, it
completes
equity
financings
denominated
in the
Canadian
dollar and
exchanges the
Canadian
dollar
proceeds to
the U.S. dollar.
As of
September 30,
2011 and
December 31,
2010, the
Company held
an insignificant
portion of its
financial
instruments in
Canadian
dollars and
was not
exposed to
significant
currency risk.
OTHER RISKS
The Company
is not subject
to significant
interest rate or
other price
risks and the
Company’s
exposure to
these risks has
not changed
significantly
from the prior
year.
14 SANDSTORM
GOLD LTD. Risks
to Sandstorm
The primary risk
factors affecting
the Company are
set forth below.
For additional
discussion of risk
factors, please
refer to the
Company’s
annual
information form
dated July 22,
2011, which is
available on
www.sedar.com.
RISKS
RELATING TO
MINERAL
PROJECTS To
the extent that
they relate to the
production of
gold from, or the
operation of, the
Aurizona Mine,
the Santa Elena
Mine, the Summit
Mine, the Ming
Mine, the Black
Fox Mine, the
Bachelor Lake
Mine, and the
Bracemac-
Bracemac-
McLeod Mine
(the “Mines”), the
Company will be
subject to the risk
factors applicable
to the operators
of such Mines.
NO CONTROL
OVER MINING
OPERATIONS
The Company
has no
contractual rights
relating to the
operation or
development of
the Mines.
Except for any
payments which
may be payable
in accordance
with applicable
completion
guarantees or
cash flow
guarantees, the
Company will not
be entitled to any
material
compensation if
these mining
operations do
not meet their
forecasted gold
production
targets in any
specified period
or if the Mines
shut down or
discontinue their
operations on a
temporary or
permanent basis.
The Mines may
not commence
commercial
production within
the time frames
anticipated, if at
all, and there can
be no assurance
that the gold
production from
such properties
will ultimately
meet forecasts or
targets. At any
time, any of the
operators of the
Mines or their
successors may
decide to
suspend or
discontinue
operations.
GOVERNMENT
REGULATIONS
The Mines are
subject to various
foreign laws and
regulations
governing
prospecting,
exploration,
development,
production,
exports, taxes,
labour standards,
waste disposal,
protection and
remediation of
the environment,
reclamation,
historic and
cultural resources
preservation,
mine safety and
mine safety and
occupation
health, handling,
storage and
transportation of
hazardous
substances and
other matters.
The costs of
discovering,
evaluating,
planning,
designing,
developing,
constructing,
operating and
closing the Mines
in compliance
with such laws
and regulations
are significant. It
is possible that
the costs and
delays
associated with
compliance with
such laws and
regulations could
become such
that the owners
or operators of
the Mines would
not proceed with
the development
of or continue to
operate the
Mines. Moreover,
it is possible that
future regulatory
developments,
such as
increasingly strict
environmental
protection laws,
regulations and
enforcement
policies
thereunder, and
claims for
damages to
property and
persons resulting
from the Mines
could result in
substantial costs
and liabilities in
the future.
INTERNATIONAL
OPERATIONS
The Aurizona
Mine is located in
Brazil, the Santa
Elena Mine is
located in
Mexico, the
Summit Mine is
located in the
United States of
America, and
each of the Ming
Mine, the Black
Fox Mine,
Bachelor Lake
Mine, and the
Bracemac-
McLeod Mine is
located in
Canada and as
such the Mines
are exposed to
various levels of
political,
economic and
other risks and
uncertainties.
These risks and
uncertainties
include, but are
include, but are
not limited to,
terrorism,
hostage taking,
military
repression, crime,
political
instability,
currency controls,
extreme
fluctuations in
currency
exchange rates,
high rates of
inflation, labour
unrest, the risks
of war or civil
unrest,
expropriation and
nationalization,
renegotiation or
nullification of
existing
concessions,
licenses, permits,
approvals and
contracts, illegal
mining, changes
in taxation
policies,
restrictions on
foreign exchange
and repatriation,
and changing
political
conditions, and
governmental
regulations.
Changes, if any,
in mining or
investment
policies or shifts
in political
attitude in
Mexico, Brazil,
the United States
of America or
Canada may
adversely affect
the operations or
profitability of the
Mines in these
countries.
Operations may
be affected in
varying degrees
by government
regulations with
respect to, but
not limited to,
restrictions on
production, price
controls, export
controls, currency
remittance,
income taxes,
expropriation of
property, foreign
investment,
maintenance of
claims,
environmental
legislation, land
use, land claims
of local people,
water use, mine
safety and the
rewarding of
contracts to local
contractors or
require foreign
contractors to
employ citizens
of, or purchase
supplies from, a
particular
jurisdiction.
Failure to comply
Failure to comply
strictly with
applicable laws,
regulations and
local practices
relating to
mineral right
applications and
tenure, could
result in loss,
reduction or
expropriation of
entitlements, or
the imposition of
additional local or
foreign parties as
joint venture
partners with
carried or other
interests. The
occurrence of
these various
factors and
uncertainties
cannot be
accurately
predicted and
could have an
adverse effect on
the Mines.

the
Company’s
financial
results may be
significantly
adversely
affected by a
decline in the
price of gold.
The price of
The price of
gold fluctuates
widely,
especially in
recent years,
and is
affected by
numerous
factors
beyond the
Company’s
control,
including but
not limited to,
the sale or
purchase of
gold by
various central
banks and
financial
institutions,
interest rates,
exchange
rates, inflation
or deflation,
fluctuation in
the value of
the United

After applying
dilution, losses
and a 95%
mining
recovery, the
tonnage of
each stope
was integrated
into the mineral
reserves
provided its net
smelter return
value was
greater than or
equal to $65
per tonne,
which
represents the
average
preliminary
operating cost
estimated for
the Bracemac-
McLeod Mine
(comprised of
mining, ore
processing and
general and
administration
costs). This
process did not
modify the
resource block
model
envelopes. 55.
Bracemac-
Mineral
Resources are
estimated
under the
definition of the
Australian
Code for
Mineral
Resources and
Ore Reserves
Reporting of
Exploration
Results, using
a net smelter
return (“NSR”)
cut-off value of
$43.77. 56.
Metal prices
used in the
calculation of
the NSR are:
$0.80 per
pound of zinc,
$2.50 per
pound of
copper, $12.00
per ounce of
silver and
silver and
$1,000 per
ounce of gold,
using an
exchange rate
of C$1.00 =
US$1.04. 57.
Except for the
inferred mineral
resource
category, the
resource
calculation
used the
inverse
distance
squared
method for all
zones, using
the Gemcom
software. The
results were
then
transferred into
the Surpac
software to
initiate
engineering
design and
scheduling.
Inferred mineral
resources in
the McLeod
Deep zone
were estimated
using a 3D
polygonal
method, with
the Gemcom
software. 58.

and as such,
recovery is
estimated at
29%. 59.

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS
Sandstorm Gold
Ltd. (“Sandstorm”
or “the
Company”) was
incorporated
under the
Business
Corporations Act
of British
Columbia on
March 23, 2007
under the name
Sandstorm
Resources Ltd.
Effective
February 17,
2011, the
Company
changed its
name to
Sandstorm Gold
Ltd. The
Company is a
resource based
company that
seeks to acquire
gold streams
(“Gold Streams”)
from companies
that have
advanced stage
development
projects or
operating mines.
In return for
making a one-
time up front
payment to
acquire a Gold
Stream,
Sandstorm
receives the right
to purchase, at a
fixed price per
unit, a
percentage of a
mine’s
production for
the life of the
mine. The head
office, principal
address and
registered office
of the Company
are located at
Suite 1400, 400
Burrard Street,
Vancouver,
British Columbia,
V6C 3A6. These
condensed
consolidated
interim financial
statements were
authorized for
issue by the
board of
directors of the
Company on
November 9,
2011. 2. BASIS
OF
PRESENTATION
( A )
STATEMENT OF
COMPLIANCE
These
condensed
consolidated
interim financial
statements,
including
comparatives,
have been
prepared in
accordance with
International
Accounting
Standard (“IAS”)
34: Interim
Financial
Reporting using
accounting
policies
consistent with
the International
Financial
Reporting
Standards
(“IFRS”) issued
by the
International
Accounting
Standards Board
(“IASB”) and
interpretations of
the IFRS
Interpretations
Committee
(“IFRIC”) issued
as of September
30, 2011. IFRS
standards
require that
financial
statements be
prepared in
accordance with
standards
expected to be
in place as at the
annual reporting
period, therefore,
changes may be
required to
reflect IFRS
standards in
place at
December 31,
2011. The
preparation of
these
condensed
consolidated
interim financial
statements are
based on the
same accounting
policies and
methods of
applications as
the condensed
consolidated
interim financial
statements for
the three months
ended March 31,
2011. These
condensed
consolidated
interim financial
statements do
not contain all
the disclosures
required by IFRS
for annual
financial
statements and
should be read
in conjunction
with the
Company’s
audited annual
consolidated
financial
statements for
the year ended
December 31,
2010 prepared in
accordance with
Canadian
Generally
Accepted
Accounting
Principles
(“GAAP”). These
are the
Company’s third
IFRS condensed
consolidated
interim financial
statements for
the period
covered by the
Company’s first
IFRS annual
consolidated
financial
statements for
the year ended
December 31,
2011 as
previously the
Company
prepared its
consolidated
annual and
interim financial
statements in
accordance with
GAAP.
Comparatives
have been
restated from
GAAP to IFRS
(Note 15). ( B )
BASIS OF
PRESENTATION
These
condensed
consolidated
interim financial
statements have
been prepared
on a historical
cost basis except
for certain
financial
instruments
which are
measured at fair
value. 3.
FUTURE
CHANGES IN
ACCOUNTING
POLICIES The
IASB issued a
number of new
and revised
accounting
standards which
are effective for
annual periods
beginning on or
after January 1,
2013, with early
adoption
permitted. These
standards
include the
following: • IFRS
10, Consolidated
Financial
Statements; •
IFRS 11, Joint
Arrangements; •
IFRS 12,
Disclosure of
Interests in Other
Entities; • IFRS
13, Fair Value
Measurement; •
Amended IAS
27, Separate
Financial
Statements; and
• Amended IAS
28, Investments
in Associates
and Joint
Ventures. In
June 2011, the
IASB also issued
amended IAS 1,
Presentation of
Financial
Statements,
which is effective
for annual
periods
beginning on or
after July 1,
2012. These
new and revised
accounting
standards have
not yet been
adopted by
Sandstorm, and
the Company
has not yet
completed the
process of
assessing the
impact that they
will have on its
financial
statements, or
whether to early
adopt any of the
new
requirements.

years CREDIT
RISK The
Company’s credit
risk is limited to
cash and trade
and other
receivables in
the ordinary
course of
business. The
Company sells
gold exclusively
to large
corporations with
strong credit
ratings and the
balance of trade
and other
receivables owed
to the Company
in the ordinary
course of
business is not
significant.
Therefore, the
Company is not
exposed to
significant credit
risk and overall,
the Company’s
credit risk has
not changed
significantly from
the prior year.
CURRENCY
RISK The
Company is
exposed to the
fluctuations of
the Canadian to
U.S. dollar as
from time to time,
it completes
equity financings
denominated in
the Canadian
dollar and trades
the Canadian
dollar proceeds
to the U.S.
dollar. As of
September 30,
2011 and
December 31,
2010, the
Company held
an insignificant
portion of its
financial
instruments in
Canadian dollars
and was not
exposed to
significant
currency risk.
OTHER RISKS
The Company is
not subject to
significant
interest rate or
other price risks
and the
Company’s
exposure to
these risks has
not changed
significantly from
the prior year.

NOTE TO IFRS
RECONCILIATIONS
i. Warrant Liability
Under GAAP,
warrants are
accounted for at
their carrying value
within equity. Under
IFRS, warrants that
have an exercise
price denominated
in a currency other
than the Company’s
functional currency
meet the definition
of a derivative
liability and are
recorded as a
financial liability
initially at fair value
and subsequently
mark-to-market
each period. The
warrants issued in
the April 2008
private placement
(the “April 2008
Warrants”) have an
exercise price
denominated in
Canadian dollars,
which was the
Company’s
functional currency
when these
warrants were
issued. Effective
April 1, 2009, the
Company changed
its functional
currency from the
Canadian dollar to
the U.S. dollar, and
in accordance with
IFRS, the April
2008 Warrants
ceased to meet the
definition of an
equity instrument
and were recorded
at fair value as a
derivative liability,
with the difference
between the fair
value and the
carrying value,
upon transition,
being recognized in
equity. Subsequent
changes in the fair
value of the April
2008 Warrants were
recognized as gains
or losses in the
Statement of
Comprehensive
Income (Loss) until
they were exercised
by April 2010.
