<p><b>9/&#8230; Follow-up to the seventh special session of the Human Rights Council  
on the negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the 
realization of the right to food for all 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions and decisions on the right to food adopted in the 
framework of the United Nations, in particular Council resolution S-7/1 of 22 May 2008, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council.<b> </b></p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the first Millennium 
Development Goal of eradicating hunger and extreme poverty by 2015, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the outcome of the High-level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges 
of Climate Change and Bioenergy, held from 3 to 5 June 2008, in Rome,  
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to act to ensure that the human rights perspective is taken into account at the 
national, regional and international levels in measures to address the current world food crisis,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the holding of the panel discussion entitled &#8220;The human right to food and the 
global food crisis: root causes and responses&#8221;, held in New York, on 29 August 2008, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> the task force established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the 
Secretary-General to continue his efforts in this regard, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the complex character of the current global food crisis, as a combination of 
several major factors, both structural and conjunctural, also impacted negatively by, inter alia, 
environmental degradation, drought and desertification, global climate change, natural disasters 
and the lack of the necessary technology, and recognizing also that a strong commitment from 
national Governments and the international community as a whole is required to confront the 
major threats to food security,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation</i> the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food (A/HRC/9/23), and takes note of his recommendations;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses</i> grave concern at the fact that the current world food crisis still seriously 
undermines the realization of the right to food for all, and especially for one sixth of the world 
population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, suffering from hunger, 
malnutrition and food insecurity; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Encourages</i> States to mainstream the human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to adequate food for all, which 
could include, inter alia, the mapping of the food insecure, the adoption of relevant legislation </p>

 <p></p>
<p>and policies with a right to food framework, the establishment of mechanisms to ensure 
accountability so that rights-holders are able to claim their right to food, and the establishment 
of mechanisms and processes which ensure participation of rights-holders, particularly the most 
vulnerable, in the design and monitoring of such legislation and policies; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also</i> <i>encourages </i>all States to invest or promote investment in agriculture and rural 
infrastructure in a manner that empowers the most vulnerable and affected by the current crisis in 
order to ensure their realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon</i> States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, 
relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all necessary measures 
to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to 
consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of 
the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such 
a policy or measure; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses</i> that States have a primary obligation to make their best efforts to meet the 
vital food needs of their own populations, especially of vulnerable groups and households, such 
as by enhancing programmes to combat mother-child malnutrition, and to increase local 
production for this purpose, while the international community should provide, through a 
coordinated response and upon request, support for national and regional efforts by providing the 
necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly through agricultural 
development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation assistance and food 
aid, with a special focus on the gender-sensitive dimension; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages</i> all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring to their 
studies, research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security a human rights perspective 
and the need for the realization of the right to food for all; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the right to food to continue the promotion of the 
right to food and the follow-up to the current world food crisis in all relevant forums, especially 
in the framework of the United Nations and all the relevant international organizations and 
agencies of the United Nations system, in order to contribute to identifying means to implement 
the right to food; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 9. <i>Also requests </i>the Special Rapporteur to report on the implementation of the present 
resolution to the Council at its twelfth session, including on the progress made and obstacles 
encountered in relation with the implementation at the national level of the measures and best 
practices adopted by States to respond to the global food crisis;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to bring the 
present resolution to the attention of all relevant international organizations and agencies; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of the implementation of the present resolution.
