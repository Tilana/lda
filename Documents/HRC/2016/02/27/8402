<p><b>  Consolidated report of the Secretary-General and 
the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights on the right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p> In its resolution 65/219, the General Assembly reaffirmed the request to the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in mainstreaming the right to development, 
to undertake effectively activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for 
development between Member States, development agencies and the international 
development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect those activities in detail in her 
next report to the Human Rights Council. The Assembly also requested the Secretary-
General to submit an interim report to the Council on the implementation of resolution 
65/219, including efforts undertaken at the national, regional and international levels in the 
promotion and realization of the right to development. In accordance with established 
practice and owing to the timing of the reporting cycle, the consolidated report of the 
Secretary-General and the High Commissioner on the right to development is submitted to 
the Council at the same time as the report of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development in order to allow consolidated action by the Council on the same thematic 
issue. In this context, it is recalled that the twelfth session of the Working Group is 
scheduled for 14 to 18 November 2011; the report on that session will be therefore 
submitted to the Council at its nineteenth session. The consolidated report of the Secretary-
General and the High Commissioner on the right to development will also be submitted to 
the Council at that session.
