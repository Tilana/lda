<p><i> Guided </i>by the principles relating to economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in

universal, indivisible, interrelated, interdependent and mutually reinforcing and must be 
treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and 
recalling also that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never 
exempt States from the promotion and protection of the other rights, 
</p>

Commission on Human Rights on the realization of economic, social and cultural rights, as 
well as Council resolution 4/7 of 30 March 2007,
