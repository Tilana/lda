<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p>Illicit financial flows generated from crime, corruption, embezzlement and tax 
</p>
<p>evasion represent a major drain on the resources of developing countries, reducing tax 
</p>
<p>revenues and the scope for progressive taxation, hindering development and the rule of law, 
</p>
<p>exacerbating poverty and inequality, and undermining the enjoyment of human rights. Tax 
</p>
<p>evasion and abuse are considered to be responsible for the majority of all illicit financial 
</p>
<p>outflows, followed by illicit financial flows relating to criminal activities, such as drug and 
</p>
<p>human trafficking, the illicit arms trade, terrorism and corruption-based illicit financial 
</p>
<p>flows. According to some estimations developing countries lost US$ 991 billion in illicit 
</p>
<p>financial outflows in 2012 and those flows increased in real terms at a rate of 9.4 per cent 
</p>
<p>per annum over the period 2003&#8211;2012. The annual loss is substantially more than the 
</p>
<p>estimated yearly costs of achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>The present interim study is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>25/9, and updates earlier reports by the previous Independent Expert. It outlines how illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows undermine the enjoyment of economic, social, cultural, civil and political 
</p>
<p>rights and emphasizes the need for due diligence and due process in the fight against illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows, for better protection of witnesses and whistle-blowers and for incorporating 
</p>
<p>human rights considerations in the management of returned stolen assets. It concludes with 
</p>
<p>recommendations on how the goal of curbing illicit financial flows could be 
</p>
<p>operationalized within the post-2015 development agenda of the United Nations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 25/9 the Human Rights Council requested the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>on the effects of foreign debt and other related international financial obligations of States 
</p>
<p>on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, 
</p>
<p>to undertake a further study to analyse the negative impact of illicit financial flows on the 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of human rights in the context of the post-2015 development agenda, and to 
</p>
<p>present an interim study to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-eighth session. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert welcomes the request to analyse the human rights 
</p>
<p>implications of illicit financial flows, which may endanger the stability and security of 
</p>
<p>societies, undermine the values of democracy, morality and tax justice, and jeopardize 
</p>
<p>social, economic and political development, especially when an inadequate national and 
</p>
<p>international response leads to impunity. Corruption, the transfer of illicit funds, and legal 
</p>
<p>and other barriers to their repatriation not only divert resources away from activities that are 
</p>
<p>critical for poverty eradication, the fight against hunger and sustainable economic and 
</p>
<p>social development, they also undermine the enjoyment of economic, social, cultural, civil 
</p>
<p>and political rights and the right to development.  
</p>
<p>3. The present interim study updates earlier reports by the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (A/HRC/19/42) and the previous Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/22/42 and A/HRC/25/52). It also complements a recent report on taxation policies 
</p>
<p>by the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights (A/HRC/26/28). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Illicit financial flows and asset recovery 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Definitions 
</b></p>
<p>4. Illicit financial flows in a narrow sense are funds which are illegally earned, 
</p>
<p>transferred or utilized, and include all unrecorded private financial outflows that drive the 
</p>
<p>accumulation of foreign assets by residents in breach of relevant national or international 
</p>
<p>legal frameworks.1 The illicit nature stems from two distinct but overlapping causes: the 
</p>
<p>first relating to the proceeds of crime, the second, initially deriving from legitimate 
</p>
<p>economic activities that ultimately become illicit owing to the contravention of laws 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/22/42, para. 5). In a broader sense, illicit financial flows encompass in addition all 
</p>
<p>kinds of artificial arrangements that have been put in place for the essential purpose of 
</p>
<p>circumventing the law or its spirit, including certain legal &#8220;tax-optimization&#8221; schemes, 
</p>
<p>making use of legal loopholes that allow for example transnational corporations to shift 
</p>
<p>around profits to zero or low corporate tax jurisdictions, without undertaking any real 
</p>
<p>economic activities in those jurisdictions.2  
</p>
<p>5. Activities related to illicit funds can also be clustered according to the illicit 
</p>
<p>motivations involved.3 Those may be market and regulatory abuse, tax abuse, tax evasion, 
</p>
<p>or abuse of power, including the theft of State funds and assets, and the profit from crime or 
</p>
<p>

</i></p>

<p>corruption. Commonly used methods to evade or avoid taxation include trade misinvoicing 
</p>
<p>and transfer mispricing (A/HRC/22/42, paras. 6&#8211;7). Transfer mispricing refers to a practice 
</p>
<p>of multinational companies. A subsidiary of a company avoids paying taxes in a relatively 
</p>
<p>high-tax country by selling its products at a loss to a subsidiary in a low-tax country, which 
</p>
<p>then sells the product to final customers at market price and yields the profit. While tax 
</p>
<p>evasion, which breaks national tax laws, is illegal, many tax avoidance schemes comply 
</p>
<p>with existing laws and regulations; or at least, go unchallenged in situations where tax 
</p>
<p>authorities have scarce capacity and information. 
</p>
<p>6. Three main actors responsible for illicit financial flows may be identified: (a) private 
</p>
<p>actors&#8212;individuals, domestic businesses and transnational corporations&#8212;committing for 
</p>
<p>example tax and regulatory abuse and the related professional advisers on tax, legal matters 
</p>
<p>and accounts; (b) public officeholders (both elected and employed); and (c) criminal 
</p>
<p>groups.  
</p>
<p>7. Asset recovery is understood in the present report as the process by which the 
</p>
<p>proceeds of corruption (as defined by articles 15&#8211;23 of the United Nations Convention 
</p>
<p>against Corruption) are recovered and returned to a foreign jurisdiction. Asset recovery 
</p>
<p>includes tracing of illicit assets, securing, freezing and returning them through a variety of 
</p>
<p>legal avenues, including criminal confiscation and restitution, non-conviction-based 
</p>
<p>confiscation, civil actions or actions involving the use of mutual legal assistance. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Updated estimates 
</b></p>
<p>8. There is overwhelming consensus that the volume of illicit financial flows is 
</p>
<p>significant, although estimates vary greatly and are debated. Since illicit financial flows are 
</p>
<p>by definition hidden, it is inevitable that estimates will be subject to substantial uncertainty. 
</p>
<p>Methodologies continue to develop, while data quality and availability remain problematic. 
</p>
<p>In addition, the lack of transparency of financial intermediaries involved in financial 
</p>
<p>transactions renders it difficult to calculate illicit financial flows with a high degree of 
</p>
<p>certainty. However, as stated recently in an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
</p>
<p>Development (OECD) report, there is consensus that they exceed aid flows and investment 
</p>
<p>in volume4 and that the scale of the problem warrants international policy attention 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/22/42, para. 12).  
</p>
<p>9. For several years Global Financial Integrity (GFI) has produced regular estimates for 
</p>
<p>illicit financial outflows, using data from international organizations for their statistics: 
</p>
<p>They measure (a) outflows due to deliberate trade misinvoicing, by analysing imbalances in 
</p>
<p>reported export and import values between a country and the world; and (b) outflows due to 
</p>
<p>leakages in the balance of payments, also known as illicit hot money narrow outflows.5 
</p>
<p>While the data and methodology of these estimates have been subject to criticism,6 
</p>
<p>economists and international financial institutions have not to date published a 
</p>
<p>comprehensive critique of GFI methodology. Alternative estimates point in the same 
</p>
<p>direction: there is a huge loss owing to illicit financial flows and this annual loss is

</p>
<p>Financial Integrity, Washington, D.C., December 2014), pp. 3&#8211;6. 
</p>

<p>pp. 37&#8211;39.  </p>


<p>substantially higher than the estimated annual costs of achieving the Millennium 
</p>
<p>Development Goals.7 
</p>
<p>10. According to the latest GFI estimates, developing countries lost US$ 991.2 billion in 
</p>
<p>illicit financial outflows in 2012, a further increase of 1.8 per cent from 2011. Since 2003, 
</p>
<p>illicit financial outflows have increased in real terms by about 9.4 per cent per annum. The 
</p>
<p>significance of such a resource drain is demonstrated by comparing those figures with 
</p>
<p>official development assistance (ODA) received by developing countries. In 2012 ODA 
</p>
<p>stood at US$ 89.7 billion, meaning that, for every dollar in development assistance spent in 
</p>
<p>2012, more than US$ 10 left developing countries in the form of illicit financial outflows. 
</p>
<p>According to GFI, ODA and foreign direct investment combined did not net out illicit 
</p>
<p>financial outflows from developing countries over the last decade.8

<p>11. While a certain percentage of illicit financial outflows re-enters developing counties 
</p>
<p>in the form of illicit inflows, those funds do not make up for the loss of capital through 
</p>
<p>illicit outflows. Even estimates that net out illicit outflows with inflows indicate a 
</p>
<p>substantial net outflow during recent decades.9 Furthermore, illicit financial inflows are 
</p>
<p>generally not taxed, or invested into public or social services to further the realization of 
</p>
<p>human rights. Instead they flow into the underground economy, thereby compounding the

<p>problem. Even if they are repatriated after they have been laundered abroad or offshore, 
</p>
<p>they tend to be reinvested into luxury residential property and other luxury goods, 
</p>
<p>increasing inequality rather than being allocated to strengthening the rule of law, or judicial, 
</p>
<p>health, education or social security systems, for the benefit of the common good. 
</p>
<p>Frequently illicit inflows fund further crime, including organized crime, human trafficking, 
</p>
<p>piracy, the illicit arms trade and terrorist activities undermining the rule of law, peace and 
</p>
<p>security, and human rights.10  
</p>
<p>12. Trade misinvoicing is estimated to be the most popular way of moving funds illicitly 
</p>
<p>out of developing countries. GFI estimated that they account for 77.8 per cent of all illicit 
</p>
<p>outflows over the last decade. Although Sub-Saharan Africa has the smallest nominal share 
</p>
<p>of regional outflows over the period 2003&#8211;2012, it has the highest average illicit outflows 
</p>
<p>to gross domestic product ratio (5.5 per cent), indicating that illicit financial outflows have 
</p>
<p>had a disproportionate impact on the region.11

</p>
<p>13. Illicit financial flows are also a serious concern for developed countries. Tax 
</p>
<p>avoidance schemes by transnational corporations shifting profits to low tax jurisdictions 
</p>
<p>within OECD countries and commercial banks that facilitate tax evasion by high net worth 
</p>
<p>individuals in a systematic manner have recently received much attention.12 In addition, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 10 For a comprehensive analysis see for example Alex Cobham, (see footnote 3 ) and Jeremy Haken, 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Transnational crime in the developing world&#8221; (Washington D.C., Global Financial Integrity, 2011). 
</p>
<p> 11 Kar and Spanjers, &#8220;Illicit financial flows from developing countries: 2003&#8211;2012&#8221; (see footnote 5), 
</p>

</p>
<p> 12 See for example, www.forbes.com/sites/halahtouryalai/2013/01/04/tale-of-two-swiss-banks-why-

<p>there is a lack of comprehensive information as to where illicit funds are held.13 While in 
</p>
<p>some cases significant funds may be returned and invested in private assets, such as land 
</p>
<p>and luxury estates in the countries of origin, most funds remain offshore (A/HRC/22/42, 
</p>
<p>paras. 20&#8211;23). The main beneficiaries of illicit financial flows are secrecy jurisdictions, 
</p>
<p>financial service providers and economic sectors into which laundered funds are reinvested, 
</p>
<p>including vendors of luxury estates and producers of luxury goods.  
</p>
<p>14. Against common beliefs, corruption-based illicit financial outflows account only for 
</p>
<p>a small fraction of all illicit financial flows. The Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR), a 
</p>
<p>joint initiative by the World Bank and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
</p>
<p>(UNODC), has tried, jointly with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
</p>
<p>Development, to track international asset recovery efforts relating to corruption-based illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows. Their report <i>Few and Far: The Hard Facts on Stolen Asset Recovery</i>, 
</p>
<p>published in September 2014, provides a bleak picture of international asset recovery 
</p>
<p>efforts.14  
</p>
<p>15. Between 2010 and June 2012, only 8 of 34 OECD countries reported asset recovery 
</p>
<p>efforts (Belgium, Canada, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, the United 
</p>
<p>Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America) 
</p>
<p>including cross-border asset tracking, freezing or asset return efforts.15  
</p>
<p>16. On the positive side, the volume of assets frozen between 2010 and June 2012 
</p>
<p>amounted to US$ 1.39 billion and increased in comparison to the four-year period from 
</p>
<p>2006 to 2009 (US$ 1.23 billion). However assets returned from 2010 to June 2012 
</p>
<p>remained US$ 147.2 million lower compared to the earlier period. A slightly positive 
</p>
<p>development is that assets returned to developing countries increased from 
</p>
<p>US$ 108.1 million (during the four years from 2006 to 2009) to 127.7 million (for the 
</p>
<p>2.5 years from 2010&#8211;June 2012). However, the total volume of assets returned between 
</p>
<p>2006 and June 2012 was US$ 423.5 million, which is significantly less than the 
</p>
<p>US$ 2.623 billion in assets that were reported frozen, and again only a fraction of the 
</p>
<p>estimated US$ 20 billion to 40 billion stolen each year from developing countries by means 
</p>
<p>of corruption-related activities.16 Figure 3 illustrates this relationship, assuming a rather 
</p>
<p>conservative estimate of an annual outflow of US$ 20 billion in the form of corruption-
</p>
<p>based illicit financial flows.

</p>
<p>and institutions, amounting to US$ 25.6 billion, which were not exclusively the proceeds of 
</p>
<p>corruption.  </p>

</p>
<p>17. According to data collected by StAR only four OECD countries managed to return 
</p>
<p>stolen assets to countries of origin after completing national legal procedures during the 6.5 
</p>
<p>year period between 2006 and June 2012. They are Australia, Switzerland, United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>and the United States of America, with Switzerland and the United States of America, each 
</p>
<p>accounting for about 40 per cent of all asset returns to foreign jurisdictions.17  
</p>
<p>18. The results demonstrate the difficulties and barriers existing in the complex process 
</p>
<p>of tracking stolen assets, freezing them, or returning them through criminal or non-
</p>
<p>conviction based confiscation, private civil action and domestic investigation. The political 
</p>
<p>will to combat corruption and to recover assets in receiving States, timely and well 
</p>
<p>documented requests for mutual legal assistance and close collaboration between 
</p>
<p>investigating authorities in countries of origin and destination are all essential to ensure the 
</p>
<p>successful repatriation of stolen assets. States continue to face challenges in recovering 
</p>
<p>assets owing to differences between legal systems, the complexity of multijurisdictional 
</p>
<p>investigations and prosecutions, the limited implementation of effective domestic tools such 
</p>
<p>as non-conviction-based forfeiture for asset recovery, lack of familiarity with the mutual 
</p>
<p>legal assistance procedures of other States and difficulties in identifying the flow of 
</p>
<p>corruption proceeds. In addition there are particular challenges posed in recovering the 
</p>
<p>proceeds of corruption in cases involving individuals occupying prominent public positions. 
</p>
<p>19. One significant way of reducing illicit gains and related illicit financial flows is to 
</p>
<p>focus on the supply side, the bribe payers. An estimated US$ 1 trillion is paid in bribes 
</p>
<p>worldwide each year, and bribery in the developing world may amount to an equivalent of 
</p>
<p>15&#8211;30 per cent of all ODA. Ending impunity on the supply side must be part of the efforts 
</p>
<p>to reduce illicit financial flows. An OECD report taking stock of the total number of 
</p>
<p>individuals and legal persons sanctioned or acquitted in relation to foreign bribery from 
</p>
<p>1992 to 2012 shows significant disparities between prosecutorial efforts and the 
</p>
<p>enforcement of anti-bribery legislation in the 40 States parties to the OECD Convention on 
</p>
<p>Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions 
</p>

<p>bribery cases that were solved through legal settlements showed that only 3.3 per cent (or 
</p>
<p>US$ 197  out of the total value of settlements of nearly US$ 6 billion) was returned or 
</p>
<p>ordered to be returned to the countries where the bribery had taken place, as monetary 
</p>
<p>sanctions were mostly imposed in countries where the corrupt companies were 
</p>
<p>headquartered.19  
</p>
<p>21. It should be stressed that the return of stolen assets is only the last step and is 
</p>
<p>unlikely to result in the full recovery of assets stolen, as it is frequently very difficult to 
</p>
<p>trace, freeze and finally return stolen assets in accordance with international and national 
</p>
<p>legal provisions. Much more needs to be done on the supply side of illicit financial funds, 
</p>
<p>to prevent illicit financial outflows leaving countries of origin and to combat non-
</p>
<p>corruption-based illicit financial outflows related to tax evasion and questionable tax 
</p>
<p>avoidance schemes. Curbing tax-based illicit financial flows would, from a purely financial 
</p>
<p>perspective, have the biggest impact on the fiscal space of States and their ability to realize 
</p>
<p>social and economic rights and the right to development. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Illicit financial flows and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>22. There are various connections between illicit financial flows and human rights: illicit 
</p>
<p>financial outflows deprive Governments first and foremost of resources required to realize 
</p>
<p>progressively economic, social and cultural rights. They also undermine efforts to build up 
</p>
<p>effective institutions to uphold civil and political rights and the rule of law in the countries 
</p>
<p>of origin. Third, business enterprises, including transnational business corporations, have to 
</p>
<p>ensure that their tax planning strategies and policies not only adhere to national law, but 
</p>
<p>also comply with international human rights norms. Fourth, whistle-blowers and reporting 
</p>
<p>persons, media representatives and human rights defenders require effective protection 
</p>
<p>based on international human rights standards and the United Nations Convention Against 
</p>
<p>Corruption . Fifth, human rights and due process guarantees are essential to protect persons 
</p>
<p>from undue allegations, undue removal from office, criminalization, freezing or 
</p>
<p>confiscation of their assets or arbitrary deprivation of property or detention. Finally, human 
</p>
<p>rights obligations of States should also inform the public management of returned assets to 
</p>
<p>ensure that maximum available resources are directed to the realization of economic, social 
</p>
<p>and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Impact on social, economic and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>23. Illicit financial outflows divert resources intended for development and may 
</p>
<p>undermine government efforts to provide basic services and ability to comply with their 
</p>
<p>international human rights obligations. The diversion of resources due to illicit financial 
</p>
<p>outflows reduce the &#8220;maximum resources&#8221; available to the countries of origin for the 
</p>
<p>realization of economic, social and cultural rights (A/HRC/26/28, paras. 24&#8211;28). It would 
</p>
<p>be improper to solely blame illicit financial flows for lack of compliance with human rights 
</p>
<p>obligations. Failure to respect social, economic and cultural rights is frequently not 
</p>
<p>exclusively due to unavailability of public funds. However, illicit financial outflows from 
</p>
<p>developing countries and tax abuse in industrialized countries have clearly limited the fiscal 
</p>
<p>space of governments to ensure the progressive realization of social, economic and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights.

<p>24. A comprehensive report published in October 2013 by the International Bar 
</p>
<p>Association underscored the linkages between illicit financial flows, poverty and human 
</p>
<p>rights. The report found that  
</p>
<p>tax abuses have considerable negative impacts on the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p>
<p>Simply put, tax abuses deprive governments of the resources required to provide the 
</p>
<p>programmes that give effect to economic, social and cultural rights, and to create 
</p>
<p>and strengthen the institutions that uphold civil and political rights. Actions of States 
</p>
<p>that encourage or facilitate tax abuses, or that deliberately frustrate the efforts of 
</p>
<p>other States to counter tax abuses, could constitute a violation of their international 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations, particularly with respect to economic, social and cultural 
</p>
<p>rights.20  
</p>
<p>25. This link has also been stressed by the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>human rights, who recently stated that tax abuse is  
</p>
<p> not a victimless practice; it limits resources that could be spent on reducing 
</p>
<p>poverty and realizing human rights, and perpetuates vast income inequality. While 
</p>
<p>the rich benefit from this practice, the poor feel the negative impact on their standard 
</p>
<p>of living, their unequal political power and the inferior quality of health and 
</p>
<p>education services for themselves and their children. (A/HRC/26/28, para. 59) 
</p>
<p>26.  The Special Rapporteur emphasized that high levels of tax abuse undermine the 
</p>
<p>principles of equality and non-discrimination, given that evaders end up paying less than 
</p>
<p>taxpayers with the same&#8212; or less&#8212; capacity to pay. High net-worth individuals and large 
</p>
<p>corporations also have a far greater ability to evade or avoid taxes as they are able to pay 
</p>
<p>tax advisers or able to open undeclared foreign bank accounts in low-tax jurisdictions. 
</p>
<p>Governments then have to raise revenue from other sources: often regressive taxes, the 
</p>
<p>burden of which falls hardest on the poor. Therefore, if States do not tackle tax abuse, they 
</p>
<p>are likely to be disproportionately benefiting wealthy individuals to the detriment of the 
</p>
<p>most disadvantaged (ibid., para. 60).  
</p>
<p>27. The negative impact on social and economic rights can be illustrated by analysing 
</p>
<p>how illicit financial flows have contributed to undermining efforts of governments in sub-
</p>
<p>Saharan States to realize progressively the right to health, as enshrined in article 12 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. A recent study published 
</p>
<p>in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine has estimated the impact of illicit financial 
</p>
<p>outflows on the ability of sub-Saharan States to realize Millennium Development Goal  4, 
</p>
<p>relating to the right to health. The three indicators for Goal 4 are: (1) Under-five mortality 
</p>
<p>rate, (2) Infant mortality rate and (3) Proportion of 1 year-old children immunized against 
</p>
<p>measles. The study analysed data for 34 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The results speak 
</p>
<p>for themselves: at the current rate of progress it is estimated that only six of the 34 countries 
</p>
<p>in Sub-Saharan Africa would reach their Millennium Development Goal targets by the end 
</p>
<p>of 2015. If illicit financial outflows were completely curtailed, that number could be 
</p>
<p>increased to 16 countries. Even those countries that would not achieve their targets by 2015 
</p>
<p>would be able to reach them in a substantially shorter period in the absence of illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows.21

<p>28. In the decade before the Ebola outbreak, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone 
</p>
<p>experienced, according to recent GFI estimates, an annual average of US$ 1.37 billion 
</p>
<p>illicit financial outflows, while, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), 
</p>
<p>during the same period the three countries spent on average only US$ 140 million per year 
</p>
<p>on public health (see fig. IV).22 All three countries were under International Monetary Fund 
</p>
<p>(IMF) programmes, failed to meet targets for social spending before the outbreak and saw a 
</p>
<p>further decrease in the number of community health workers from 0.11 per 1,000 
</p>
<p>population in 2004 to 0.02 per 1,000 population in 2010.23 Some health experts claimed that 
</p>
<p>IMF programmes contributed to the weaknesses of the public health systems in the 
</p>
<p>countries, an assessment that has been questioned.24  
</p>
<p>29. In addition to illicit financial flows, the three countries paid on average 
</p>
<p>US$ 205 million in debt service per annum on public or publicly guaranteed external debt 
</p>
<p>during the decade before the Ebola outbreak, and continued to spend US$ 81.6 million in 
</p>
<p>2013.25 In Sierra Leone, where the estimate for illicit financial outflows is lower, legal tax 
</p>
<p>incentives and tax breaks for extractive industries have weakened domestic resource 
</p>
<p>mobilization. Christian Aid has estimated that the Government of Sierra Leone will lose 
</p>
<p>revenues of US$ 131 million in the three years 2014&#8211;16 alone as the result of corporate 
</p>
<p>income tax incentives granted to five mining companies &#8211; an average of US$ 43.7 million a 
</p>
<p>year. All tax incentives combined amounted in 2012 to eight times the health budget and 
</p>
<p>seven times the education budget.26 While the roots of the weakness of the public health 
</p>
<p>system in the Ebola-affected countries are varied, tax evasion, legal tax breaks and external 
</p>
<p>debt services have been contributing factors to the weak state of public health institutions 
</p>
<p>and services. The above examples demonstrate that debt relief, improved tax regimes and a 
</p>
<p>reduction in illicit financial flows would allow those and many other least developed 
</p>
<p>countries to improve their public health and education systems.

<p>30. The Independent Expert welcomes the call for debt relief for Ebola-affected 
</p>
<p>countries made by the United States of America and the United Nations Economic 
</p>
<p>Commission for Africa and hopes that such relief will be implemented swiftly, after the 
</p>
<p>G20 summit in Brisbane announced in November 2014 that IMF would grant a US$ 300-
</p>
<p>million package to Ebola-affected countries comprising new concessional loans, debt relief 
</p>
<p>and grants.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Impact on civil and political rights and on the rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>31. Illicit financial outflows and their non-repatriation undermine civil and political 
</p>
<p>rights and the rule of law in countries of origin and destination. The existence of illicit 
</p>
<p>unregulated money contributes to the spread of other criminal activities, such as illegal 
</p>
<p>weapons, smuggling, terrorism and the infiltration of criminal interests in the public sector. 
</p>
<p>That includes funding of political parties or election campaigns in contravention of 
</p>
<p>domestic regulations, contributing to the risk of State capture and subverting the right to 
</p>
<p>vote and to participation in public affairs on a non-discriminatory basis. 
</p>
<p>32. In addition, States need independent, well-equipped, trained and properly paid 
</p>
<p>officers responsible for combating corruption and tax evasion, handling requests for mutual 
</p>
<p>legal assistance and a properly functioning independent judicial system to combat illicit 
</p>
<p>financial funds. Significant investments are required to ensure that nobody is above the law, 
</p>
<p>including so-called politically exposed persons, their associates, or large business </p>


<p>enterprises.27 Where both the incentives for and the opportunities to export illicit wealth are 
</p>
<p>significant, it is likely that the damage to the rule of law will be exacerbated. It has been 
</p>
<p>pointed out that &#8220;the potential to hide illicit capital securely in tax havens is a direct 
</p>
<p>stimulus to corruption and other illicit activities like transfer mispricing. It decreases the 
</p>
<p>chances of detection and therefore increases the likely returns&#8221;.28 If parts of the political 
</p>
<p>elite are able or willing to accumulate wealth through illicit outflows, economic inequalities 
</p>
<p>are exacerbated and incentives to strengthen tax agencies, the investigatory powers of 
</p>
<p>police services, the independence of the judiciary and public audit services are low. That is 
</p>
<p>a problem in particular in developing countries that face resource constraints in establishing 
</p>
<p>well-equipped and independent institutions to address such complex issues as transfer 
</p>
<p>mispricing. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Responsibilities of business enterprises 
</b></p>
<p>33. Illicit financial flows should not be a human rights concern for States only. While 
</p>
<p>States have the primary duty to respect, protect and fulfil human rights, business enterprises 
</p>
<p>are also required to &#8220;avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through 
</p>
<p>their own activities, and address such impacts when they occur&#8221; as set out in the Guiding 
</p>
<p>Principles on Business and Human Rights (guiding principle 13). Business enterprises have 
</p>
<p>to respect human rights throughout their operations. They can demonstrate respect for 
</p>
<p>human rights through appropriate policies and due diligence procedures. Multinational 
</p>
<p>enterprises, as well as their advisers and financiers, need to understand that their tax 
</p>
<p>planning strategies have potential negative impacts on human rights. 
</p>
<p>34. Business enterprises that contribute through transfer mispricing, tax evasion or 
</p>
<p>corruption to significant illicit financial outflows cause adverse human rights impacts by 
</p>
<p>undermining the abilities of States to progressively achieve the full realization of economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights. This is particularly the case when they operate in States that have 
</p>
<p>difficulties in meeting the minimum core human rights obligations. One obvious way for 
</p>
<p>business enterprises to show responsible behaviour and demonstrate compliance is to 
</p>
<p>embrace a greater degree of transparency, in particular by publishing on a country-by-
</p>
<p>country basis their sales, profits and taxes.  
</p>
<p>35. The same applies to trust and company service providers and commercial banks that 
</p>
<p>do not meet basic due diligence standards when they provide services or help launder and 
</p>
<p>hide illicit funds in offshore financial centres. Most illicit financial flows are facilitated by 
</p>
<p>tax havens, secrecy jurisdiction, shell companies that cannot be traced back to their owners, 
</p>
<p>anonymous trust accounts, bogus charitable foundations, money-laundering techniques and 
</p>
<p>questionable trade practices. There is evidence that banks play a key role in facilitating 
</p>
<p>illicit financial flows when they do not exercise due diligence with their customers 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/22/42, para. 11). It is the responsibility of States to ensure that their banking 
</p>
<p>regulations comply fully with international recommendations against money-laundering 
</p>
<p>and to take action against structures facilitating illicit financial flows.

<p><b> D. Protection of whistle-blowers and reporting persons 
</b></p>
<p>36. In its resolution 23/9, the Human Rights Council acknowledged the important role 
</p>
<p>that civil society plays in exposing corruption and drawing attention to the negative impact 
</p>
<p>of the non-repatriation of funds of illicit origin on the rule of law and the realization of 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights. In that resolution the Council reiterated the obligation 
</p>
<p>of States to protect reporting persons in accordance with article 33 of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption and the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of 
</p>
<p>Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 
</p>
<p>37. Journalists, whistle-blowers, anti-corruption activists, investigating officers, judges, 
</p>
<p>prosecutors, lawyers and human rights defenders exposing corruption have frequently been 
</p>
<p>victims of reprisals or human rights violations, including death threats, arbitrary detention, 
</p>
<p>enforced disappearances and killings. Between 1 January 2010 and 31 November 2014, the 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the Human Rights Council sent more than 35 urgent appeals and 
</p>
<p>letters of allegation to 22 countries and territories covering such concerns.29 The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression recently stressed that journalists covering corruption, organized crime and drug 
</p>
<p>trafficking were at particular risk (see A/HRC/20/17). According to the Committee to 
</p>
<p>Protect Journalists, as of 31 December 2014 out of 725 journalists murdered since 1992 
</p>
<p>worldwide, 208 of them, or 29 per cent, had covered corruption issues.30 Reporters Without 
</p>
<p>Borders reported in 2011 that at least 141 journalists covering organized crime or drug 
</p>
<p>trafficking&#8212;another major source for illicit financial flows&#8212; were killed in the decade 
</p>
<p>2000&#8211;2010.31  
</p>
<p>38. While several jurisdictions have introduced new laws protecting witnesses, whistle-
</p>
<p>blowers or persons reporting corruption, the protection of whistle-blowers and witnesses to 
</p>
<p>corruption frequently falls short of international standards or best practices. The latest 
</p>
<p>thematic report presented to the Implementation Review Group of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Convention against Corruption notes that there &#8220;was wide variation among the States 
</p>
<p>parties with regard to the protection of witnesses, experts and victims&#8221;. While in several 
</p>
<p>States the protections went beyond the minimal protection of non-disclosure of the identity 
</p>
<p>or whereabouts of witnesses, the report noted that &#8220;in several States no measures had been 
</p>
<p>taken for the effective protection of witnesses and experts&#8221;. The report furthermore 
</p>
<p>underlines that &#8220;a number of States parties had not established comprehensive whistle-
</p>
<p>blower protections, although legislation was pending in several cases. Common challenges 
</p>
<p>related to specificities in national legal systems, limited capacity and the absence of specific 
</p>
<p>regulations or systems for the protection of whistle-blowers&#8221; (CAC/COSP/IRG/2014/7, 
</p>
<p>paras. 13&#8211;14).  
</p>
<p>39. Transparency International has highlighted the fact that many legal frameworks to 
</p>
<p>protect whistle-blowers do not adequately ensure the confidentiality and anonymity of 
</p>
<p>reporting persons or fail to cover whistleblowing within the private sector.32 Several 
</p>
<p>countries have introduced notable new national legislation strengthening the protection of 
</p>
<p>whistle-blowers in recent years: they include the Republic of Korea, South Africa, and 
</p>
<p>

<p>Slovenia, and, during 2014, Ireland and Greece.33 An analysis of whistle-blower legislation 
</p>
<p>in the European Union showed that national legislation frequently falls short of 
</p>
<p>international standards or best practice. In November 2013 only four countries had legal 
</p>
<p>frameworks for whistle-blower protection that Transparency International considered 
</p>
<p>advanced.34 The Independent Expert hopes that a new recommendation adopted on 30 April 
</p>
<p>2014 by the Council of Europe will strengthen the protection of whistle-blowers. Their 
</p>
<p>protection is, however, a worldwide concern, as indicated by reports of the Implementation 
</p>
<p>Review Group of the Convention and of anti-corruption organizations.35 In addition, the 
</p>
<p>protection of persons exposing tax abuses or evasion who may not be able to rely on the 
</p>
<p>protection of the Convention needs to be strengthened.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Due process in asset recovery and criminal matters 
</b></p>
<p>40. Human rights are also relevant for the seizure and freezing of the proceeds of 
</p>
<p>corruption or other criminal activities. That includes due process rights in criminal or civil 
</p>
<p>law matters against persons presumed to be responsible for corruption, tax evasion or other 
</p>
<p>related criminal conduct and ensuring the independence of authorities charged with 
</p>
<p>investigating and prosecuting crimes, including ensuring that asset freezing and forfeiture 
</p>
<p>does not deprive persons suspected of, or investigated for, corruption of the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>essential core minimum levels of social, economic and cultural rights. While the right to 
</p>
<p>property, contained in article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in 
</p>
<p>several regional human rights instruments, does not protect stolen assets from recovery, no 
</p>
<p>one may be arbitrarily deprived of that right. The Independent Expert is also concerned 
</p>
<p>about reports that governments have occasionally used charges of tax evasion or corruption 
</p>
<p>against former members of the ruling elite, political opponents, dissidents or human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders to criminalize them. Special procedures have also sent communications on behalf 
</p>
<p>of such individuals.36  
</p>
<p>41. It is also notable that some provisions of the Convention against Corruption have 
</p>
<p>been contested on human rights grounds. Article 31, paragraph 8, of the Convention 
</p>
<p>provides that an offender must demonstrate the lawful origin not only of the alleged 
</p>
<p>proceeds of crime but also of other property liable to confiscation. The United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights has noted that &#8220;similar provisions were analysed in a set 
</p>
<p>of precedents that established the conditions that must be met in order not to violate due-
</p>
<p>process rights. Such precedents held that the right to be presumed innocent is not an 
</p>
<p>absolute right, and that legal presumptions in criminal law are not per se restrictive to such 
</p>
<p>right as long as States take into account the importance of what is at stake, and respect the 
</p>
<p>right to defence&#8221; (A/HRC/19/42, para. 46).

<p><b> F. Use of repatriated illicit funds 
</b></p>
<p>42. Finally, a human rights approach to asset recovery has to consider policy 
</p>
<p>implications relating to the use of returned illicit funds. StAR has pointed out that the use of 
</p>
<p>returned assets is the sovereign decision of the country that recovers its stolen property, but 
</p>
<p>concluded that &#8220;countries that have embraced a policy of openness and transparency in the 
</p>
<p>design of arrangements for the management of returned assets have benefited from this 
</p>
<p>approach&#8221;.37  
</p>
<p>43. The Independent Expert supports that view. In his estimation, respect for and 
</p>
<p>adherence to the human rights principles of transparency, accountability and participation is 
</p>
<p>a critical factor in ensuring the prudent use of repatriated illicit funds. He further endorses 
</p>
<p>the view that &#8220;decisions over resources allocation cannot be made behind closed doors, but 
</p>
<p>publicly and openly, with due attention to civil society&#8217;s demands. In some cases, lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency and participation in the allocation decisions can end up in the use of the 
</p>
<p>recovered assets to ends different from those sought by human rights principles&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/19/42, para. 30). As the study by the High Commissioner underscored, since 
</p>
<p>&#8220;recovered resources are not foreseen or public income included in the budget, States must 
</p>
<p>allocate them in accordance with their obligation to devote the maximum of available 
</p>
<p>resources to the fulfilment of economic, social, and cultural rights&#8221; (ibid., para. 28). 
</p>
<p>44. In transitional countries, returned illicit assets may also help States to fulfil their 
</p>
<p>obligations to provide reparation to victims of human rights violations of a previous regime. 
</p>
<p>This is particularly the case if returned illicit funds derive from assets controlled by 
</p>
<p>politically exposed persons who are alleged to have been directly or indirectly responsible 
</p>
<p>for past human rights violations. While not a comprehensive solution to the problem of 
</p>
<p>financing transitional justice initiatives and reparation programmes, recovered assets have 
</p>
<p>for example been used in Peru for anti-corruption and transitional justice measures, 
</p>
<p>including truth-seeking and reparations.38 The Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, 
</p>
<p>published in September 2014, a best practice compilation for the management of recovered 
</p>
<p>assets, drawing on international experiences.39 
</p>
<p>45. It is important that asset recovery efforts are viewed as one of several efforts that 
</p>
<p>States must make in order to comply with their human rights obligations. As the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights has underscored, those &#8220;obligations apply to both 
</p>
<p>countries of origin and recipient countries of funds of illicit origin due to the principle of 
</p>
<p>international cooperation and assistance towards the realization of human rights, 
</p>
<p>particularly economic, social, and cultural rights&#8221; (A/HRC/19/42, para. 24).

<p><b> IV. International initiatives to curb illicit financial flows 
</b></p>
<p>46. Before discussing the importance of curbing illicit financial flows in the context of 
</p>
<p>the post-2015 development agenda, the Independent Expert wishes to provide a brief 
</p>
<p>overview of recent international initiatives, updating information contained in previous 
</p>
<p>reports (A/HRC/22/42 and A/HRC/25/52). 
</p>
<p>47. The Convention against Corruption constitutes a comprehensive point of reference 
</p>
<p>for anti-corruption laws, institutions and actions of States parties and recognizes the return 
</p>
<p>of illicit funds as one of its fundamental principles in article 57, paragraph 3 (a). In 
</p>
<p>article 52 of the Convention each State party is enjoined to &#8220;conduct enhanced scrutiny of 
</p>
<p>accounts sought or maintained by or on behalf of individuals who are, or have been, 
</p>
<p>entrusted with prominent public functions and their family members and close associates&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>48. The Independent Expert welcomes the fact that Germany, Oman, the State of 
</p>
<p>Palestine and the Sudan ratified the Convention in 2014, bringing the number of States 
</p>
<p>parties to 173 (as of 31 December 2014). He calls upon those States that have not yet 
</p>
<p>signed or ratified the Convention to do so at their earliest opportunity.  
</p>
<p>49. The Conference of States Parties to the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Corruption has set up the open-ended intergovernmental working group on asset recovery. 
</p>
<p>Since its first session in 2006, the working group has convened eight times and discussed 
</p>
<p>during its most recent meeting the prevention and detection of transfer of the proceeds of 
</p>
<p>crime, and measures for direct recovery of property under articles 52 and 53 of the 
</p>
<p>Convention.40 
</p>
<p>50. On 18 December 2014, the General Assembly adopted resolution 69/199, in which it 
</p>
<p>underlined the need to redouble efforts to assist in the recovery of stolen assets in order to 
</p>
<p>preserve stability and sustainable development and for transparency in financial institutions. 
</p>
<p>The General Assembly called upon Member States to continue to work with all 
</p>
<p>stakeholders in international and domestic financial markets to deny safe haven to assets 
</p>
<p>acquired illicitly by individuals engaged in corruption and urged States to promote the 
</p>
<p>active participation of individuals and groups outside the public sector, such as civil 
</p>
<p>society, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, in the 
</p>
<p>prevention of, and the fight against, corruption. The General Assembly acknowledged the 
</p>
<p>vital importance of ensuring the independence and effectiveness of authorities charged with 
</p>
<p>investigating and prosecuting crimes of corruption and of recovering the proceeds of such 
</p>
<p>crimes and the fundamental principles of due process of law in criminal proceedings and in 
</p>
<p>civil or administrative proceedings to adjudicate property rights. In addition, in resolution 
</p>
<p>69/199 the Assembly expressed concern about the negative impact of widespread 
</p>
<p>corruption on the enjoyment of human rights, recognizing that corruption constitutes one of 
</p>
<p>the obstacles to the effective promotion and protection of human rights, as well as to the 
</p>
<p>achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed 
</p>
<p>development goals. 
</p>
<p>51. StAR, jointly launched in 2007 by UNODC and the World Bank, supports 
</p>
<p>international efforts to end safe havens for corrupt funds. StAR works with developing 
</p>
<p>countries and financial centres to prevent the laundering of the proceeds of corruption and 
</p>
<p>to facilitate more systematic and timely return of stolen assets. In recent years StAR has 
</p>
<p>continued providing training, capacity-building and technical assistance to countries that 
</p>
<p>are operationally engaged in asset recovery cases. Its corruption case database includes, as 
</p>
<p>of 31 December 2014, information on 748 transborder corruption cases.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 40 CAC/COSP/WG.2/2014/4, paras. 40&#8211;58. </p>


<p>52. The third meeting of the Arab Forum on Asset Recovery, hosted by the Government 
</p>
<p>of Switzerland, in association with StAR, was held in Geneva from 1 to 3 November 2014, 
</p>
<p>bringing together 250 specialists from 40 countries.41 In parallel, a side event focused on 
</p>
<p>the role of civil society organizations in the asset recovery process and stressed the need to 
</p>
<p>create mechanisms for information sharing between civil society and governments, and the 
</p>
<p>need to establish accountable and transparent mechanisms to manage and dispose of 
</p>
<p>returned assets, through broad consultation with concerned stakeholders.42 
</p>
<p>53. On 29 and 30 April 2014, StAR provided technical support to the Ukraine Forum on 
</p>
<p>Asset Recovery following asset freezes in relation to the former Ukrainian President, Viktor 
</p>
<p>Yanukovych, and his associates by Austria, Canada, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, the United 
</p>
<p>States of America and the European Union. In that context a guide for civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations illustrating how they can contribute to asset recovery efforts was published.43  
</p>
<p>54. In response to public outcry over tax evasion and corporate tax avoidance, the G8 
</p>
<p>countries made a commitment at the Lough Erne Summit in June 2013 to introduce 
</p>
<p>automatic exchange of information by tax authorities across the world in order to fight the 
</p>
<p>scourge of tax evasion; to change rules that let companies shift their profits across borders 
</p>
<p>to avoid taxes; to assist developing countries with information and capacity to collect taxes 
</p>
<p>owed to them; to introduce public country-by-country reporting for extractive companies; 
</p>
<p>and to address the issue of misuse of shell companies to facilitate illicit financial flows.44 
</p>
<p>OECD was tasked by the G8 and G20 Finance Ministers with developing an Action Plan on 
</p>
<p>Base Erosion and Profit Shifting , published in July 2013, containing 15 specific actions to 
</p>
<p>address a range of issues relating to tax transparency, accountability and information 
</p>
<p>exchange. The G20 declaration in St. Petersburg in September 2013 underlined that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;developing countries should be able to reap the benefits of a more transparent international 
</p>
<p>tax system&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>55. During the annual meeting of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of 
</p>
<p>Information for Tax Purposes in Berlin in October 2014, 51 jurisdictions announced the 
</p>
<p>introduction of a new single global standard on Automatic Exchange of Information on 
</p>
<p>Taxation Matters by 2017 or the end of 2018. Leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane, 
</p>
<p>Australia, in November 2014 affirmed the principle that &#8220;profits should be taxed where 
</p>
<p>economic activities deriving the profits are performed and where value is created&#8221;. G20 
</p>
<p>leaders also welcomed progress on taxing patent boxes, a practice whereby intellectual 
</p>
<p>property royalties can divert profits from the countries where they are made.45 
</p>
<p>56. Concerns have, however, been expressed that developing countries have been 
</p>
<p>excluded from the design phase of the new system for automatic exchange of tax 
</p>
<p>information or may not yet be in a position to provide reciprocal information and may thus 
</p>
<p>gain little from it, which would deprive many low and middle income countries of the 
</p>
<p>benefits of international tax information exchange. One suggestion is for a window of, say,

<p>five years, during which lower-income countries would receive tax information 
</p>
<p>automatically, without a requirement for full reciprocity. That would allow time for 
</p>
<p>domestic systems to be modified and improved, while demonstrating the value of 
</p>
<p>participating in information exchange. 
</p>
<p>57. OECD has named combating illicit financial flows one of its three priority areas in 
</p>
<p>its Strategy on Development (2012). In 2014, OECD published a report entitled &#8220;Illicit 
</p>
<p>Financial Flows from Developing Countries: Measuring OECD Responses&#8221;, which 
</p>
<p>analyses the performance of OECD countries against the main international standards for 
</p>
<p>countering illicit financial flows. It focuses on five policy areas: money-laundering, tax 
</p>
<p>evasion, foreign bribery, asset recovery and the role of development agencies. Another 
</p>
<p>OECD publication &#8211; <i>Better Policies for Development 2014: Policy Coherence and Illicit 
</i></p>
<p><i>Financial Flows</i> stresses the need for policy coherence to address illicit financial flows. 
</p>
<p>The OECD analysis shows that countries are making progress in the fight against illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows, but warns that &#8220;without action, OECD countries are at risk of becoming 
</p>
<p>safe havens for illicit assets from developing countries&#8221; (p. 22). 
</p>
<p>58. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has become an international policymaking 
</p>
<p>body in the fight against money-laundering. FATF has developed a series of<b> 
</b></p>
<p>recommendations<b> </b>that are recognized as the international standard for combating money-
</p>
<p>laundering and the financing of terrorism, and conducts peer reviews of each member on an 
</p>
<p>ongoing basis to assess their implementation. In February 2012, FATF adopted a new set of 
</p>
<p>recommendations which will provide an opportunity to ensure that national legislation 
</p>
<p>makes it more difficult to hide illicit money in secrecy jurisdictions. In October 2013 new 
</p>
<p>FATF guidance on the due diligence requirements in relation to politically exposed persons 
</p>
<p>was published, followed in 2014 by guidance on transparency and beneficial ownership to 
</p>
<p>deter and prevent the misuse of corporate vehicles for money-laundering, terrorist 
</p>
<p>financing, tax evasion or other illicit activities. 
</p>
<p>59. At the regional level in Africa, the African Union and the Economic Commission for 
</p>
<p>Africa have been combating the flow of illicit funds. The High-Level Panel on Illicit 
</p>
<p>Financial Flows was established in February 2012 to address the debilitating problem of 
</p>
<p>illicit financial outflows from Africa. The Panel has carried out consultations, country visits 
</p>
<p>and studies in six African countries. In its progress report, the Panel found &#8220;that in some 
</p>
<p>African countries, the institutional architecture for responding to illicit financial flows was 
</p>
<p>at best uneven or, as in several key instances, non-existent. Lack of transparency, secrecy 
</p>
<p>and the difficulty of obtaining information and systematic data remain key challenges 
</p>
<p>across the board&#8221; (E/ECA/CM/47/6, para. 20).46  
</p>
<p>60. In February 2013, the European Commission published proposals to amend the 
</p>
<p>Anti-Money-Laundering Directive, clarifying the definition of &#8220;beneficial ownership&#8221; and 
</p>
<p>providing more detail on customer due diligence requirements.47 The new directive will for 
</p>
<p>the first time oblige European Union member States to maintain central registers listing 
</p>
<p>information on the ultimate beneficial owners of corporate and other legal entities, and 
</p>
<p>trusts. The registers will not be public, but accessible to competent authorities and financial 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 46  The final report of the High-Level Panel was released on 31 January 2015 after the present study was 
</p>
<p>submitted by the Independent Expert for editing. It will be duly considered in the final study of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert. See &#8220;Illicit Financial Flows: Report of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial 
</p>

<p>intelligence units and to people with a &#8220;legitimate interest&#8221;, such as investigative journalists 
</p>
<p>and other  citizens concerned. The aim is to enhance transparency, make &#8220;dodgy deals&#8221; 
</p>
<p>harder to hide and fight money-laundering and tax crime. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Curbing illicit financial flows and the United Nations post-
2015 development framework 
</b></p>
<p>61. IIFs were not explicitly addressed in the United Nations Millennium Development 
</p>
<p>Goals, including Goal 8 on global partnership for development, covering foreign debt, trade 
</p>
<p>and development cooperation. That neglect has been addressed by the report of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the post-2015 development agenda, 
</p>
<p>published in May 2013, which recommended including a global target to &#8220;reduce illicit 
</p>
<p>flows and tax evasion and increase stolen-asset recovery&#8221; in the future development goals.48 
</p>
<p>62. The report stated that &#8220;it is time for the international community to use new ways of 
</p>
<p>working, to go beyond an aid agenda and put its own house in order: to implement a swift 
</p>
<p>reduction in corruption, illicit financial flows, money-laundering, tax evasion, and hidden 
</p>
<p>ownership of assets&#8221;. It underlined that developed countries &#8220;have special responsibilities 
</p>
<p>in ensuring that there can be no safe haven for illicit capital and the proceeds of corruption 
</p>
<p>and that multinational companies pay taxes fairly in the countries in which they operate&#8221; 
</p>
<p>and noted that &#8220;developed countries could be more actively seizing and returning assets that 
</p>
<p>may have been stolen, acquired corruptly, or transferred abroad illegally from developing 
</p>
<p>countries&#8221;.49 
</p>
<p>63. Civil society organizations have also advocated for addressing the issue of illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows as part of the post-2015 development agenda. For example, the Center for 
</p>
<p>Economic and Social Rights and Christian Aid proposed an explicit target for reducing 
</p>
<p>illicit financial flows as part of the new sustainable development goals , to address cross-
</p>
<p>border tax evasion, return of stolen assets, odious debt and tax abuses.50 They further noted 
</p>
<p>that &#8220;People&#8217;s right to access detailed, reliable, periodic and disaggregated fiscal and 
</p>
<p>financial information is strongly curtailed in many countries, especially the financial 
</p>
<p>information necessary to root out illicit financial flows, curb corporate capture of 
</p>
<p>development processes, and detect other tax abuses such as socially-useless tax 
</p>
<p>expenditures. This fundamental vacuum in fiscal information compounds and reinforces the 
</p>
<p>lack of effective, meaningful and institutionalized participation of the most disadvantaged 
</p>
<p>social groups and countries in the design, implementation and monitoring of fiscal policy.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>64. The Independent Expert welcomes those and other initiatives that eventually ensured 
</p>
<p>that the report of the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals, adopted on 19 July 2014, incorporated the issue of illicit financial 
</p>
<p>flows under a proposed goal 16 to &#8220;promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable 
</p>
<p>development&#8221;. It proposed a specific goal (16.4) &#8220;to reduce significantly illicit financial and 
</p>
<p>arms flows, strengthen recovery and return of stolen assets, and combat all forms of 
</p>
<p>organized crime&#8221; by 2030.

</p>
<p>rights policy brief&#8221; (May 2014). </p>


<p>65. The synthesis report of the Secretary-General on the post-2015 agenda, issued in 
</p>
<p>December 2014, stressed that &#8220;access to fair justice systems, accountable institutions of 
</p>
<p>democratic governance, measures to combat corruption and curb illicit financial flows and 
</p>
<p>safeguards to protect personal security are integral to sustainable development&#8221;, thus 
</p>
<p>embedding the fight against illicit financial flows and corruption in the core of human 
</p>
<p>rights protection and good governance. He noted in the same paragraph that &#8220;an enabling 
</p>
<p>environment under the rule of law must be secured for the free, active and meaningful 
</p>
<p>engagement of civil society&#8221; and referred to &#8220;press freedom and access to information, 
</p>
<p>freedom of expression, assembly and association&#8221; as &#8220;enablers of sustainable development&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/69/700, para. 78). 
</p>
<p>66. The report of the Secretary-General confirms the view of the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>that curbing illicit financial flows is a human rights issue and closely interlinked with the 
</p>
<p>protection and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, transparency, the 
</p>
<p>right to participation and access to information. The Independent Expert fully endorses the 
</p>
<p>view of the Secretary-General that the implementation of the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda, including efforts to curb illicit financial flows, &#8220;must ensure that all actions respect 
</p>
<p>and advance human rights, in full coherence with international standards&#8221; (ibid., para 65), 
</p>
<p>and recommends that such language should be explicitly included in the final set of 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals agreed upon by Member States. 
</p>
<p>67. In his report, the Secretary-General underlines that effectively addressing illicit 
</p>
<p>flows is urgent and that more vigorous implementation of the Convention against 
</p>
<p>Corruption is needed, as well as measures to overcome impediments to the return of stolen 
</p>
<p>assets. He further suggests that Member States should consider measures to ensure 
</p>
<p>information exchange, judicial cooperation and the establishment of an intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>committee on tax cooperation, under the auspices of the United Nations (ibid., para. 115). 
</p>
<p>68. The Independent Expert welcomes those recommendations, which would contribute 
</p>
<p>to more inclusive participation by all Members States, including least developed countries, 
</p>
<p>in current efforts by the G8/G20 and OECD to reform international tax rules and shrink tax 
</p>
<p>evasion globally.  
</p>
<p>69. The Independent Expert also notes some concerns. One of the main issues is to 
</p>
<p>specify how progress to achieve the proposed target on curbing illicit financial flows can be 
</p>
<p>measured and how accountability for their implementation can be ensured, in particular on 
</p>
<p>a matter that requires concerted effort, both by countries of origin and destination and 
</p>
<p>public and private stakeholders, including governments, business enterprises and the 
</p>
<p>financial sector. He shares the view of the Secretary-General that the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda should include strong inclusive public mechanisms at all levels for 
</p>
<p>reporting, monitoring progress, learning lessons and ensuring mutual accountability 
</p>
<p>(A/69/700, para. 60).  
</p>
<p>70. He is disappointed, however, at the lack of references by the Open Working Group 
</p>
<p>to addressing tax evasion and tax havens, in particular, in the proposed goal 17 on 
</p>
<p>strengthening the means of implementation and revitalizing the global partnership for 
</p>
<p>sustainable development. For example, finance target 17.1 only addresses the issue of 
</p>
<p>taxation in the context of improving developing countries&#8217; capacity for tax and other 
</p>
<p>revenue collection, but does not mention combating tax evasion. An earlier proposal on 
</p>
<p>international tax evasion and avoidance by the High-Level Panel was not included in its 
</p>
<p>outcome document, possibly representing a missed opportunity for developed and 
</p>
<p>developing countries to address one of the most needed structural reforms.  
</p>
<p>71. To ensure that the sustainable development goal on curbing illicit financial flows 
</p>
<p>will lead to policy action by countries of origin and destination and the private sector, 
</p>
<p>progress needs to be tracked with suitable indicators, baselines and targets. GFI has </p>


<p>proposed that the sustainable development goal on illicit financial flows should incorporate 
</p>
<p>the target to &#8220;reduce illicit financial flows from trade misinvoicing by 50 per cent&#8221;, noting 
</p>
<p>that the current proposal by the Open Working Group to &#8220;reduce significantly illicit 
</p>
<p>financial flows&#8221; or to &#8220;strengthen recovery of stolen assets&#8221; leaves it very vague as to what 
</p>
<p>each State or actor would have to achieve by 2030. GFI argued that selecting tax and trade-
</p>
<p>related illicit flows as a target would focus on the majority of illicit financial flows, could 
</p>
<p>be measured using official government statistics, would complement transparency 
</p>
<p>initiatives already under way, enhance domestic resource mobilization and tax revenue and 
</p>
<p>ensure that a far larger amount of capital would remain in developing countries.51  
</p>
<p>72. Alex Cobham has suggested specifying three targets aimed at curbing illicit financial 
</p>
<p>flows through enhanced transparency and exchange of tax information. His proposal is to:  
</p>
<p>(a) Reduce to zero the legal persons and arrangements for which beneficial 
</p>
<p>ownership information is not publicly available, in order to eliminate the potential for 
</p>
<p>anonymous ownership of companies, trusts and foundations; 
</p>
<p>(b) Reduce to zero the cross-border trade and investment relationships between 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions where there is no bilateral automatic exchange of tax information, in order to 
</p>
<p>prevent hiding of offshore assets and income streams;  
</p>
<p>(c) Reduce to zero the number of multinational businesses that do not report 
</p>
<p>publicly on a country-by-country basis, in order to expose major misalignments between 
</p>
<p>the distribution of profit and the location of real economic activity. 
</p>
<p>73. Cobham argued that the strength of such targets would be that data could be 
</p>
<p>collected to highlight to what extent each jurisdiction had met its responsibilities, so that 
</p>
<p>accountability for financial secrecy affecting others could be properly monitored and 
</p>
<p>tracked over time against objective criteria rather than vague political promises.52  
</p>
<p>74. The Independent Expert is of the view that the targets and indicators suggested by 
</p>
<p>GFI and Cobham would be essential to operationalize and track progress in implementing a 
</p>
<p>rather unspecified inspirational goal of &#8220;reducing significantly illicit financial flows&#8221;, that 
</p>
<p>may easily fall victim to a lack of specification as to who should be responsible and held 
</p>
<p>accountable for its implementation. However, such targets may need to be complemented 
</p>
<p>by other indicators that would allow the tracking of progress in asset recovery efforts and 
</p>
<p>the curbing of corruption and crime-related illicit financial flows.53 Consideration should 
</p>
<p>also be given to indicators that would ensure that human rights are fully integrated into 
</p>
<p>national and international efforts to curb illicit financial flows. Therefore, additional targets 
</p>
<p>relating to the protection of witnesses and whistleblowers, the implementation of due 
</p>
<p>diligence procedures by financial business and service providers, and investigative and 
</p>
<p>prosecutorial efforts in relation to tax evasion and corruption should be considered.

<p><b> VI. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>While crime, corruption, and tax evasion and abuse can contribute to illicit 
</b></p>
<p><b>financial flows, all negatively affecting human rights in a number of ways, it has been 
</b></p>
<p><b>estimated that the majority of all illicit financial flows are related to cross-border tax-
</b></p>
<p><b>related transactions. In developing countries, trade and transfer mispricing is the 
</b></p>
<p><b>main vehicle for tax evasion or abuse and the financial crisis has focused attention in 
</b></p>
<p><b>high-income countries on tax evasion and avoidance schemes of transnational 
</b></p>
<p><b>corporations. Tax havens, secrecy jurisdictions and offshore financial centres greatly 
</b></p>
<p><b>facilitate illicit flows. While more empirical research is needed, such quantitative 
</b></p>
<p><b>aspects will be kept in mind when the final study, with a more holistic set of 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations, is prepared and submitted to the Human Rights Council in March 
</b></p>
<p><b>2016.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>Reiterating recommendations made by the former Independent Expert and by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights (A/HRC/25/52, 
</b></p>
<p><b>para. 50; A/HRC/26/28, paras. 79</b>&#8211;<b>82) the Independent Expert would like to make the 
</b></p>
<p><b>following recommendations as a timely contribution to current discussions on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>post-2015 development goals of the United Nations.</b> <b>He would also like to draw his 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations to the attention of the third International Conference on Financing 
</b></p>
<p><b>for Development, to be held in Addis Ababa from 13 to 16 July 2015. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Independent Expert recommends that States: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Include a goal to reduce illicit financial flows in the final set of 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustainable development goals, anchoring that goal in the context of good governance, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the rule of law, justice and the duty of States to respect, protect and fulfil human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Include in the final post-2015 development agenda explicit language 
</b></p>
<p><b>specifying that States and other actors, when implementing the sustainable 
</b></p>
<p><b>development goals, must ensure that human rights are respected and advanced in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>measures and activities undertaken, in full compliance with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Complement an overarching goal of reducing illicit financial flows with 
</b></p>
<p><b>measurable targets and indicators to ensure accountability for implementation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Support empirical research on illicit financial flows, improve existing 
</b></p>
<p><b>data and estimations, and agree on common methodology for the purpose of tracking 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress in curbing illicit financial flows by 2030; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Ensure that such indicators will include specified percentage targets to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reduce trade- and tax-based illicit financial flows by 2030; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Include in the measurement of progress three transparency targets 
</b></p>
<p><b>aimed at reducing to zero:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) The number of legal persons and arrangements for which beneficial 
</b></p>
<p><b>ownership information is not publicly available;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) The number of cross-border trade and investment relationships between 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdictions where there is no automatic exchange of tax information;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) The number of transnational business corporations that do not report 
</b></p>
<p><b>publicly on a country-by-country basis. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Those zero targets should be complemented by additional indicators tracking 
</b></p>
<p><b>asset recovery efforts, curbing corruption and crime-based illicit financial flows; 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring implementation of due diligence procedures by financial businesses and </b></p>


<p><b>service providers; strengthening the legal frameworks and practical arrangements for 
</b></p>
<p><b>the protection of witnesses and whistleblowers; and enhancing investigative and 
</b></p>
<p><b>prosecutorial efforts in relation to tax evasion and corruption in consonance with 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Consider the establishment of an intergovernmental committee on tax 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperation, under the auspices of the United Nations, to ensure that all countries, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the least developed countries, will benefit from the emerging new system of 
</b></p>
<p><b>automatic exchange of tax information and can fully participate in its further design 
</b></p>
<p><b>and implementation.
