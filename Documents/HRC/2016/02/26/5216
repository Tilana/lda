<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> In Human Rights Council resolution 6/12, the Council decided to extend the mandate of 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous 
people, inter alia to work in close cooperation with other special procedures and subsidiary 
organs of the Council, relevant United Nations bodies, the treaty bodies and regional human 
rights organizations and to develop a regular cooperative dialogue with all relevant actors. The 
Special Rapporteur participated, along with the members of the Expert Mechanism on the rights 
of indigenous peoples, four members of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous 
Issues and a group of experts from various regions, including the former Special Rapporteur, 
Rodolfo Stavenhagen, in the International Expert Seminar on the Role of United Nations 
Mechanisms with a Specific Mandate regarding the Rights of Indigenous Peoples organized by 
the Alm&#225;ciga Intercultural Working Group and the International Work Group for Indigenous 
Affairs and hosted by the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation from 4 to 
6 February 2009 in Madrid. 
</p>
<p> The main objective of the meeting was to promote an informal dialogue among the 
members of the three mechanisms to better coordinate their work, as well as their activities with 
other United Nations agencies and bodies. The participants discussed methods for streamlining 
the work of the three mechanisms by examining the priority work area or areas of the respective 
mandates and identifying ways in which those aspects of each mandate might be maximized. The 
members of the three mechanisms put forth a number of recommendations, which are contained 
in the present document. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>(Madrid, 4-6 February 2009) 
I.  INTRODUCTION </b></p>
<p>1. Article 42 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states 
that the United Nations and its bodies, including the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, 
&#8220;shall promote respect for and full application of the provisions of [the] Declaration and follow 
up the effectiveness of [the] Declaration&#8221;. In the context of the process of institutional reform of 
the United Nations human rights machinery, the Declaration has been specifically identified as 
part of the normative framework of the mechanisms of the Human Rights Council with a specific 
mandate regarding the rights of indigenous peoples: the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples<b>1</b> and the expert mechanism on the 
rights of indigenous peoples.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>2. An important innovation in the new United Nations institutional design concerning the 
rights of indigenous peoples is the emphasis on cooperation among these different mechanisms 
with a view to avoiding unnecessary duplication and enhancing the effectiveness of the system 
as a whole.<b>3</b> Reinforced cooperation among the mechanisms requires in-depth reflection on ways 
to improve existing channels of communication and to generate new methodologies of 
interaction. 
</p>
<p>3. At the initiative of Bartolom&#233; Clavero, a member of the Permanent Forum, and the Special 
Rapporteur, members of the United Nations mechanisms with a mandate regarding indigenous 
peoples, as well as a number of indigenous experts, were invited to participate in an informal 
meeting to discuss issues of coordination in their work to promote the rights of indigenous 
peoples within the framework of the implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The meeting took place at the Spanish Agency for International

</b>  The mandate of the Special Rapporteur calls upon him/her to &#8220;work in close cooperation with

<p>the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and to participate in its annual session&#8221; 
(resolution 6/12, para. 1 (e)). Similarly, the Human Rights Council decided, &#8220;in order for the 
expert mechanism to enhance cooperation and avoid duplicating the work of the Special 
Rapporteur &#8230; and the Permanent Forum, that it shall invite the Special Rapporteur and a 
member of the Permanent Forum to attend and contribute to its annual meeting&#8221; (resolution 6/36, 
para. 5). </p>

<p>Cooperation in Madrid, from 4 to 6 February 2009. It was organized jointly by the 
non-governmental organizations, the International Work Group on Indigenous Affairs and the 
Alm&#225;ciga Intercultural Working Group. The seminar was attended by all the members of the 
expert mechanism and four members of the Permanent Forum, as well as representatives of the 
secretariats of the three United Nations mechanisms and a group of experts from and members of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations from various regions. The members of the three mechanisms 
put forth the following conclusions and recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>4. <b>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples provides the 
framework for action towards the full protection and implementation of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights. 
</b></p>
<p>5. <b>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is the principal 
normative framework for the three United Nations mechanisms with a specific mandate 
regarding indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and it should also constitute an important frame of 
reference for the United Nations treaty bodies and other relevant international and 
regional human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>6. <b>Article 42 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
requires the three mechanisms to apply the Declaration universally, irrespective of the 
positions of individual States on the Declaration. 
</b></p>
<p><b>General coordination 
</b></p>
<p>7. <b>The three mechanisms should take advantage of their participation at the annual 
sessions of the Permanent Forum and Expert Mechanism to meet and coordinate their 
work agendas. In any case, the three mechanisms should consider holding an annual 
meeting to coordinate their work. 
</b></p>
<p>8. <b>The Chairperson, or, if this is not possible, a designated member of the Permanent 
Forum and of the Expert Mechanism, and the Special Rapporteur should always 
participate in the annual sessions of the Permanent Forum and the Expert Mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p>9. <b>The three mechanisms should consult with the Inter-Agency Support Group to 
develop methods for strengthening coordination and cooperation with United Nations 
agencies. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Division of labour among mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>10. <b>Taking into account the specific terms of their respective mandates, each of the three 
mechanisms should avoid engaging in work that is the special focus of the mandates of the 
other mechanisms or that would more adequately be addressed by other bodies and 
agencies of the United Nations system, including the treaty bodies. </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/34/Add.7 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>11. <b>In the aftermath of the adoption of the United Nations Declaration, the Permanent 
Forum should review its working methods in order to promote cooperation with the other 
two mechanisms and enhance its responsibilities under article 42 of the Declaration. A 
greater role could be given to the Permanent Forum&#8217;s interaction with the United Nations 
agencies, including in public meetings, particularly those that carry out activities regarding 
the rights of indigenous peoples at the country level. 
</b></p>
<p>12. <b>The sessions of the Permanent Forum and the Expert Mechanism should strive to 
focus the participation of Governments, indigenous representatives and other stakeholders 
on the specific issues and functions falling within their respective mandates. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Thematic research 
</b></p>
<p>13. <b>The Expert Mechanism has a specific mandate to carry out thematic research. The 
Special Rapporteur has adopted the view that his role in thematic research will be 
secondary, contributing to the thematic research of the other mechanism on the basis of his 
experience engaging with Governments on country situations. 
</b></p>
<p>14. <b>The Permanent Forum should reflect on its role in carrying out thematic research 
and avoid duplication of the work of the Expert Mechanism to prevent &#8220;thematic fatigue&#8221;. 
</b></p>
<p>15. <b>The Expert Mechanism and the Permanent Forum should seek to collaborate closely 
on research projects of shared interest. The participation of indigenous experts should 
always be promoted. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Specific situations of human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>16. <b>This is a priority area of work for the Special Rapporteur. 
</b></p>
<p>17. <b>The Permanent Forum and the Expert Mechanism should develop measures to 
channel the specific allegations of human rights violations presented by indigenous peoples 
during their annual sessions, including to the Special Rapporteur and other relevant 
mechanisms mandated to address such allegations. 
</b></p>
<p>18. <b>The Special Rapporteur should develop methodologies for receiving allegations of 
human rights violations and, as required, for direct dialogue between Governments and 
indigenous peoples, during his participation at the annual sessions of the Permanent Forum 
and the Expert Mechanism. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>19. <b>Country visits to assess the human rights conditions of indigenous peoples is one of 
the principal work methods of the Special Rapporteur pursuant to his mandate. 
</b></p>
<p>20. <b>The Permanent Forum has an important role to develop in relation to the work of the 
United Nations agencies and programmes at the country level, enhancing knowledge of 
indigenous issues among the different agencies. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/12/34/Add.7 
page 6 
 
</p>
<p>21. <b>The Permanent Forum should develop internal guidelines to orient the activities and 
scope of work carried out by its individual members during country visits. 
</b></p>
<p>22. <b>The Permanent Forum&#8217;s secretariat could seek methods of enhancing cooperation 
and information-sharing among the Forum&#8217;s individual members in order to strengthen 
their roles and the effectiveness of their activities as members between sessions. The 
Forum&#8217;s members should be actively involved in intersessional activities, including those 
carried out by the secretariat. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Role of the secretariats 
</b></p>
<p>23. <b>The secretariat staff should periodically share information regarding the activities of 
the three mechanisms and the secretariats themselves, coordinate workplans regularly, and 
collaborate on research and other areas as appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p>24. <b>The secretariats should enhance efforts for training of United Nations staff members 
on indigenous rights and issues at headquarters and in the field, in coordination with 
efforts made by the three mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p>25. <b>Where possible, more resources, both financial and human, should be dedicated to 
the secretariats. In particular, the secretariat of the Expert Mechanism needs to be 
strengthened considerably. Priority should be given to the recruitment of indigenous staff. 
</b></p>
<p>26. <b>The secretariat of the Permanent Forum and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights should consider utilizing the members of the Permanent 
Forum and the Expert Mechanism as resource persons in the elaboration of their own 
policies, guidelines and publications on indigenous issues.
