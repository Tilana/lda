Commenting on the results today, Clifford Elphick, Chief Executive of Gem Diamonds, said:
"I am pleased to report an underlying EBITDA of US$43.5 million. This reflects careful cost
management and capital discipline. It is also encouraging to see that the capital projects
implemented at Letšeng are bearing fruit, with a notable increase in tonnes treated and carats
recovered compared to prior periods.
The first half of 2016 saw a decline in the number of +100 carat diamonds recovered at Letšeng
compared to 2015, reflecting the areas in which mining had taken place, which impacted the US$
per carat achieved in the Period. Since the beginning of July, two exceptional diamonds of 104
carats and 85 carats have been recovered as mining moves to a different area.
In late July, some of the heaviest snowfalls in the past decade were experienced at Letšeng.
Waste tonnes mined and carats recovered will remain within original guidance but tonnes treated
will reduce to 6.6 - 6.8 million tonnes from 6.8 - 7.0 million tonnes. Letšeng provided
accommodation and food to approximately 250 local people who were experiencing life-
threatening conditions during the severe weather. The Deputy Prime Minister and a government
delegation which visited the mine thanked management for its assistance to the community.
At Ghaghoo we continue to make good progress to downsize the operation and reduce costs in
line with the Group's strategic objectives. Targeted production rates and cost levels are
anticipated to be achieved in H2 2016. The ongoing weak market for Ghaghoo type diamonds
has resulted in a non-cash impairment of US$40.0 million being made against the carrying value
of this asset.
In June, the Company paid an ordinary dividend of 5 US cents per share and a special dividend
of 3.5 US cents per share resulting in a total dividend of US$11.8 million. Capital and cash
management discipline remain a high priority. We are focused on delivering our 2016 guidance
and maintaining the Company's dividend policy."
The Company will host a live audio webcast presentation of the half-year results today, 17
August 2016, at 09:30 BST. This can be viewed on the Company's website:

ABOUT GEM DIAMONDS:
Gem Diamonds is a leading global diamond producer of high value diamonds. The Company
owns 70% of the Letšeng mine in Lesotho and 100% of the Ghaghoo mine in Botswana. The
Letšeng mine is famous for the production of large, top colour, exceptional white diamonds,
making it the highest dollar per carat kimberlite diamond mine in the world. Since Gem
Diamonds' acquisition of Letšeng in 2006, the mine has produced four of the 20 largest white
gem quality diamonds ever recorded.
Gem Diamonds has a growth strategy based on the expansion of the Letšeng mine and bringing
the Ghaghoo mine into production, while maintaining its strong balance sheet. The Company
seeks to maximise revenue and margin from its rough diamond production by pursuing cutting,
polishing and sales and marketing initiatives further along the diamond value chain. With
favourable supply/demand dynamics expected to benefit the industry over the medium to long
term, particularly at the high end of the market supplied by Gem Diamonds, this strategy positions
the Company well to generate attractive returns for shareholders in the coming years.

Interim Business Review
The first half of 2016 (the Period), saw a strong operational performance at the Letšeng mine with
production of 57 380 carats (50 019 in H1 2015) and both waste tonnes mined and ore treated up
on H1 2015. Letšeng benefited from the Plant 2 Phase 1 upgrade project completed in 2015,
realising an increased daily treatment rate through this plant. Letšeng's high-value diamonds
performed well during the Period and achieved an average value of US$1 899* per carat.
During the Period, Letšeng continued to implement the optimised life of mine plan, which
significantly enhances the mine's net present value through optimising waste stripping
and increasing the percentage of the higher-grade, higher-value Satellite pipe ore available to be
treated earlier over the life of mine.
The Group will continue to pursue its broader strategy to identify and implement low capital,
value enhancing opportunities at Letšeng, and feasibility studies have commenced to progress
the next phase of plant enhancements.
On 6 May 2016, the Letšeng Diamond Discovery Centre was officially opened by His Majesty
King Letsie III. This centre is a permanent interactive exhibition that tells the story of Lesotho's
diamond industry, with specific focus on the history of diamond mining at Letšeng. The centre
was built to promote knowledge and serve as a foundation for Basotho learners who wish to
learn more about the diamond mining industry and possibly pursue careers in the field. This
further emphasises Letšeng's commitment to the development of the mining industry
within Lesotho.
Development of the Ghaghoo mine continues to progress with the implementation of the
previously announced strategy to reduce the tonnage and associated cost structure. Despite
some initial headwinds experienced in the retrenchment process where a court in Botswana
ordered the reinstatement of some 20 workers (the order is currently suspended pending an
appeal), and the costs associated with the premature caving experienced in November 2015, it is
anticipated that the targeted monthly cost rates will be achieved during H2 2016.
The sales of Ghaghoo's rough diamonds have been impacted by the cautious state of the
diamond market during the Period. Two sales were concluded during the Period for
US$4.8 million, achieving an average of US$157 per carat.
In line with the Group's strategy of returning cash to its shareholders, the Company paid a
dividend of 5 US cents per share (US$6.9 million) and a special dividend of 3.5 US cents per
share (US$4.9 million) in June 2016.
The Group's financial position remains robust with a cash balance of US$66.5 million and
undrawn facilities of US$52.1 million as at 30 June 2016 underpinned by underlying EBITDA1
of US$43.5 million during the Period (30 June 2015: US$46.1 million).
Diamond market
The market for both rough and polished diamonds remained cautious. Liquidity constraints, high
polished inventory levels and the uncertain macro-economic outlook continue to create
challenges for the diamond market. In the medium to long term, rough diamond prices are
expected to be supported by the favourable demand/supply fundamentals, which are
underpinned by a continued growth in demand coupled with a limited growth in supply.
Letšeng's high-value goods performed well. A modest improvement in the prices of smaller,
Letšeng quality goods was experienced during the Period.
Health, safety, social and environment (HSSE)
The Group continues to strive towards its goal of zero harm to its people and the environment
and to operate within its sustainable development framework. The Group reports a fatality-free
first half of 2016, however, two lost time injuries (LTIs) occurred during the Period. The two LTIs
resulted in a Group-wide lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) of 0.15. The Group-wide all injury
frequency rate (AIFR) is 2.61 for the Period. The Group is committed to working closely with
project affected communities and implementing sustainable community projects that address the
needs of the various communities. No major or significant environmental or stakeholder incidents
were recorded over the Period.

The Letšeng mine is famous for its exceptional, top-quality diamonds, having the highest
proportion of large, high-value diamonds, making it the highest average dollar per carat
kimberlite diamond mine in the world. Gem Diamonds owns 70% of Letšeng Diamonds (Letšeng)
in partnership with the government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, which owns the remaining 30%.
Letšeng was acquired in July 2006 and has consistently delivered exceptional returns for its
shareholders.
During the Period, 15.3 million tonnes of waste was mined (35% higher than H1 2015) as waste
mining ramps up in line with the optimised mine plan, which allows for increased levels of higher
grade ore from the higher-value Satellite pipe to be mined annually. This was driven by
additional mining fleet which was mobilised and commissioned successfully during the Period.
Letšeng treated a total of 2.9 million tonnes of ore through its two main plants during the Period,
of which 66% was sourced from the Main pipe, and 34% from the Satellite pipe. The anticipated
benefits from the Plant 2 Phase 1 upgrade, which was successfully commissioned in H1 2015,
have started to materialise, evidenced by an increased daily treatment rate through Plant 2
during H1 2016. The remaining 0.4 million tonnes of ore were treated through Alluvial Ventures,
the contractor plant, 66% of which was sourced from the Main pipe and 34% from stockpiles.
Letšeng's relationship with its long standing contractor Alluvial Ventures continues to operate
with the objective of maximising returns for the Company. Options to extend the contract post-
December 2016 for a further 24 months are currently being reviewed.
During the Period, 57 380 carats were recovered (15% higher than H1 2015) resulting in a grade
of 1.72 carats per hundred tonnes (cpht). The high grades achieved are reflective of the area
mined in the Satellite pipe that has historically produced higher than reserve grades, albeit at a
slightly smaller average stone size. This also saw a reduction in +100 carat diamonds recovered
during the Period impacting the US$ per carat achieved, but, as the mining moved into a different
area of the Satellite pipe in early July 2016, exceptional 104 carat and 85 carat diamonds were
recovered.
Further optimisation of the Coarse Recovery Plant during the Period included the refinement of
the XRT sensitivities, improvement of feed quality and the installation of a high-tech glove box
materials handling system to cater for the separation of ore concentrate streams from Letšeng's
two processing plants. The Coarse Recovery Plant is currently operating at the designed >5mm
size cut off.
A capital project of LSL245 million (US$16.7 million) to relocate and construct a new mining fleet
workshop is under review for H2 2016. This capital investment is driven by the optimised mine
plan. As Letšeng continues to invest in the future of the operation, the new waste pushback
which is required to extend the life of the open pit has been brought forward. The mining
workshops, offices and related services, therefore, need to be relocated within the mining site
and will allow the mine to effectively maintain the new and larger fleet of mining equipment. This
project will be funded through additional external debt and an initial Term Sheet has been
agreed with Lenders.
Details of overall costs and capital expenditure incurred at Letšeng during the Period are
included in the Group financial performance section.
2016 Guidance
In late July 2016, extreme weather conditions were experienced across the Maluti Mountains in
Lesotho where the Letšeng mine is located, with excessive snowfall and severe winds limiting
access to the mine. Following damage to the overhead power lines, standby generators
previously installed at the mine were used to mitigate the impact, allowing the plants to continue
to operate, albeit at reduced rates. The Lesotho Electricity Company repaired the damaged
overhead power lines on 10 August 2016 and the external power supply was fully restored.
Given the strong operational performance in H1 2016, waste tonnes mined and carats recovered
remain within the Company's original guidance and the Satellite pipe ore contribution has
increased. Full-year guidance for ore tonnes treated and operating costs have been revised.
Stay in business capital has also been revised to account for the commencement of the
construction of the mining workshop.

Diamond sales
Four tenders were completed during H1 2016, with a total of 55 948 carats sold in Antwerp
through Gem Diamonds Marketing Services, a wholly owned Gem Diamonds subsidiary. The
average price achieved was US$1 899* per carat resulting in total rough tender revenue of
US$106.2 million*, bringing the 12-month rolling US$ per carat average to US$2 113* per carat.
Among the exceptional diamonds recovered during the Period was an 11.8 carat pink diamond
which sold for US$187 700 per carat, the third highest price per carat achieved for a single
Letšeng diamond, and a 160.2 carat Type II white diamond which was sold into a partnership
arrangement with additional participation in the final polished margin.
HSSE
One LTI was recorded at Letšeng during the Period, resulting in an LTIFR of 0.09. The AIFR for
the Period was 1.52. Letšeng continues to build on the culture of safety it has created, as well as
implementing various initiatives aimed at integrating its approach to HSSE management.
Behaviour-based safety continues to form the cornerstone of the health and safety management
programme at the operation.
Environmental rehabilitation trials through re-vegetation are continuing in key areas of the mine.
The results from these trials will assist the operation when tailoring rehabilitation initiative
requirements.
Letšeng has continued with the implementation of its three-year corporate social investment
(CSI) plan (which commenced in 2014) aimed at uplifting communities, locally and beyond.
No significant or major environmental or stakeholder incidents were recorded in the Period.
H2 2016 and onwards
The focus at Letšeng will be on the following key areas:
·      continue work streams on enhancing value through reducing diamond damage and progress
feasibility studies for the next phase of plant enhancements;
·      continue the implementation of a fleet management system to improve grade control, fleet
optimisation and reduce operating costs;
·      commence construction of the mining workshop;
·      extend the life of the tailings residue facility by an additional three years through lifting and
strengthening the existing wall; and
·      commence the review and design of the next three-year CSI plan.

The Ghaghoo diamond mine in Botswana is being developed by the Company's wholly owned
subsidiary, Gem Diamonds Botswana, which is the holder of a 25-year mining licence. The initial
objectives of Phase 1 of the development were to confirm the grade, diamond prices and the
recovery processes, including the use of autogenous milling, which were expected to increase
diamond liberation. The results from Phase 1 were planned to underpin a study aimed at defining
the way forward for mining at Ghaghoo. However, based on prevailing diamond market
conditions impacting the Ghaghoo production, the operation has been downsized to 300 000
tonnes per annum from the planned Phase 1 of 720 000 tonnes per annum. It is anticipated that
the planned output rate will be achieved in H2 2016.  Ghaghoo had not reached commercial
production during the Period which resulted in all sales realised and costs incurred in the Period
being capitalised to the carrying value of the asset. The ongoing difficult market conditions for
Ghaghoo's production has resulted in a US$40.0 million non-cash impairment charge against the
carrying value of this asset.

Following the caving which occurred in Block 1 at the end of 2015, a buffer zone was
successfully created during the first quarter of 2016 to prevent the ingress of sand into the
production levels, resulting in the sterilisation of approximately 300 000 tonnes of ore. This
impacted the volume of tonnes delivered to surface stockpiles during the Period.
During the Period, 95 569 tonnes of ore sourced from Level 1 were treated, from which a total of
20 876 carats were recovered, resulting in a grade of 21.8cpht. Of the total tonnes treated during
the Period, only 23% was high-grade, undiluted material which achieved an average grade of
27.6cpht when compared to the reserve grade of 27.8cpht. The balance of the ore was sourced
from areas close to the contact zone of the Kimberlite pipe where there was dilution of ore as
Block 1 was mined out. The establishment of the Block 2 production stopes is progressing
according to plan.
Work practices adopted to manage the water underground have proven effective and the
development of the Level 2 production level has commenced and is progressing in line with the
plan to maintain production flexibility into 2017.
During Q2 2016, work was performed to optimise the performance of the mill which resulted in
higher mill retention times and better diamond liberation. This elevated the number of stones
recovered in the smaller size fraction during the Period. Initiatives to further improve the overall
efficiency of the processing plant continue.
The downsizing activities progressed during the Period, with the operation now structured to
produce at the targeted rate of 300 000 tonnes per annum.
Details of overall costs and capital expenditure incurred at Ghaghoo during the Period are
included in the Group financial performance section.
Diamond sales
Two sales were concluded during the Period. The first sale of 14 114 carats achieved US$160
per carat (US$2.3 million) and the second sale of 16 163 carats, which had an increased
proportion of smaller size fraction diamonds, achieved US$155 per carat (US$2.5 million). The
total sales achieved for the Period were US$4.8 million reflecting an average of US$157 per
carat.
HSSE
One LTI has been recorded during the Period, resulting in an LTIFR of 0.42. The AIFR for the
Period was 4.23. Ghaghoo continues to work towards improvement of its health, safety
and environmental systems with specific focus on the implementation of a behaviour-based
safety programme. Ghaghoo continues to contribute towards community initiatives aimed at
improving community access to medical services and the upgrading of education infrastructure.
No major or significant environmental or stakeholder incidents were recorded in the Period.
H2 2016 and onwards
The focus at Ghaghoo will be on the following key areas:
·      further optimise the downsizing and manage costs to limit cash burn;
·      continuing underground development on Level 2 to ensure sustainable production at the
planned rates;
·      enhance mineral resource data through sampling ore from VK Main;
·      continue plant efficiency initiatives to improve throughput;
·      monitor market conditions to assess expansion options; and
·      continuous improvement of HSSE practice.
Operating review: Sales, marketing and manufacturing
Operational overview
·      US$106.2 million* with an average price of US$1 899* per carat was achieved for Letšeng's
production
·      US$4.8 million with an average of US$157 per carat was achieved for Ghaghoo's production
·      20 rough diamonds sold for greater than US$1.0 million each during the Period compared to
13 in H1 2015
·      Sales of polished diamonds contributed US$1.2 million in additional margin to the Group
The Group's in-house sales and marketing function provides a flexible sales strategy with
multiple marketing channels to maximise revenue from the Group's production. This is achieved
through competitive tenders and other appropriate sales and marketing channels for its rough
and polished diamonds.
The Group's rough diamond analysis capabilities provide in-depth knowledge of the value of
large, rough diamonds and are vital in the setting of appropriate reserve prices for the diamonds
to be sold at each tender.
The Group's ability to extract select diamonds for manufacturing further contributes to revenue by
allowing access to additional margins further along the diamond value chain.
Sales and marketing
Gem Diamonds Marketing Services (GDMS) markets and sells Letšeng's rough diamond
production through an electronic tender platform. The tender platform is designed to enhance
engagement with customers by allowing continual access, flexibility and communication, as well
as ensuring transparency during the tender process. Although tender viewings of Letšeng's
diamonds take place in Antwerp, the electronic tender platform allows customers the flexibility to
participate in each tender from anywhere in the world. This flexibility, together with the
professional and transparent manner in which the tenders are managed and the reputable
customers who participate in the tenders, contribute to the strategy of achieving highest market-
driven prices for Letšeng's rough diamond production.
Rough diamonds selected for own polishing are analysed, planned and manufactured by
Baobab Technologies (Baobab). The final polished diamonds are sold by GDMS through direct
selling channels to reputable high-end diamantaires.
During the first half of 2016, four Letšeng tenders were held with 55 948 carats sold for a total
value of US$106.2 million* achieving an average of US$1 899* per carat. Through its multiple
marketing channels, a 160.2 carat Type II diamond recovered during the Period was sold into a
partnership arrangement, while an 11.8 carat pink diamond achieved US$187 700 per carat on
tender.
Gem Diamonds Marketing Botswana (GDMB) was incorporated in 2015 to market the Ghaghoo
diamonds together with GDMS. During the Period, two Ghaghoo sales were held with
30 277 carats sold for a total value of US$4.8 million achieving an average of US$157 per carat.
Analysis and manufacturing
Baobab's advanced mapping and analysis of Letšeng's large, exceptional quality rough
diamonds assists the Group in understanding and assessing appropriate values for these rough
diamonds when presented for sale. This ensures that robust reserve prices are set for its
diamonds at each tender and assists in the making of strategic selling, partnering or
manufacturing decisions.
The Group selectively manufactures some of its own high-value rough diamonds and has the
flexibility to place other exceptional diamonds into strategic partnership arrangements with select
customers in order to achieve margins along the diamond value chain.

Revenue
The Group's revenue is primarily derived from its two business activities, namely its mining
operations in Lesotho (Letšeng) and Botswana (Ghaghoo), and its rough diamond manufacturing
operation in Antwerp. The first six months of the year continued to be influenced by the cautious
approach adopted by the diamond traders for both rough and polished diamonds.
Letšeng achieved an average of US$1 899* per carat during the Period which was 16% lower
than that achieved in H1 2015 of US$2 264*. This lower US$ per carat was a function of fewer
+100 carat diamonds being recovered than usual, as mining occurred in the lower value areas of
the Satellite pipe. Notwithstanding the fewer +100 carat diamonds, some exceptional high-value
diamonds were recovered, including an 11.8 carat pink diamond which was sold for US$187 700
per carat, the third highest single diamond per carat value achieved at Letšeng. The impact of the
reduced US$ per carat on overall revenue was mitigated by the higher than reserve grades
achieved which resulted in a 19% increase in carats sold compared to the prior period. This
resulted in Letšeng sales of US$106.2 million*, similar to that achieved in H1 2015 of
US$106.3 million*.

Ghaghoo achieved an average of US$157 per carat during the Period from two sales. The first
sale of 14 114 carats achieved US$160 per carat (US$2.3 million), and the second sale of
16 163  carats, which was impacted by an increase in the recovery of fine diamonds, achieved
US$155 per carat (US$2.5 million). These sales are not reported in the Group revenue, but have
been offset against operating and development costs capitalised to the carrying value of the
Ghaghoo asset as the mine did not reach full commercial production by the end of the Period.
Additional revenue of US$1.2 million was generated through polished margin by the
manufacturing operation. The Group's revenue was also positively impacted by the movement in
own manufactured inventory, increasing Group revenue by US$1.6 million. As a result, the Group
achieved revenue of US$109.1 million for H1 2016 which is 8% lower than that achieved in H1
2015.

Royalties consist of an 8% levy paid to the Lesotho Revenue Authority on the sale of diamonds
in Lesotho. Royalties in Botswana are levied at 10% on the sale of diamonds; however, these
costs were capitalised to the carrying value of the Ghaghoo development asset, together with the
associated sales earned during the Period. Diamond selling and marketing-related expenses are
incurred by the Group's sales and marketing operation in Belgium.
Operations
While revenue is generated in US dollar, the majority of operational expenses are incurred in the
local currency in the operational jurisdictions. The Lesotho loti (LSL) (pegged to the South
African rand), Botswana pula (BWP) and British pound (GBP) were all weaker against the US
dollar during the Period which positively impacted the Group's US dollar reported costs.
However, the strong US dollar has negatively impacted certain purchases which are US dollar-
based.

Letšeng mining operation
Group cost of sales for the Period was US$48.7 million, compared to US$56.1 million in H1
2015, the majority of which was incurred at Letšeng and includes waste stripping costs amortised
of US$18.0 million (2015: US$24.4 million).
During the Period, 15.3 million tonnes of waste were mined at Letšeng being 35% higher than H1
2015 and in line with the optimised mine plan. Ore tonnes treated at Letšeng of 3.3 million tonnes
were 7% higher than H1 2015. Of the total ore treated, 2.9 million tonnes were treated through the
Letšeng Plants 1 and 2, of which 66% was sourced from the Main pipe and 34% from the
Satellite pipe, similar to the 67% and 33% ratio in H1 2015.

Total direct cash costs (before waste costs) at Letšeng in local currency increased by 10% from
LSL443.5 million in H1 2015 to LSL487.6 million in H1 2016 of which 75% related to the
increase in volumes treated during the Period. This resulted in unit costs per tonne treated for the
Period of LSL146.15 relative to the prior comparative period of LSL142.60, representing an
effective increase of 2%. Cost-saving initiatives contributed to the lower increase than general in-
country inflation of approximately 6%, however, US dollar-based purchases, such as fuel and the
capital costs associated with the increased mining fleet, were negatively impacted by the strong
US dollar.
Operating costs per tonne treated for the Period increased by 5% to LSL219.70 per tonne
compared to LSL209.33 per tonne in H1 2015. These costs are driven by the direct cash costs
above, the waste stripping cost amortised (which is influenced by the different waste to ore strip
ratios for the particular ore processed) and inventory movements. Operating costs per tonne
treated for the Period were impacted by the higher proportion of Satellite pipe material mined in
H1 2016 when compared to the full-year anticipated Satellite pipe ore contribution.
The increase in the local currency waste cash cost per waste tonne mined of 8% was impacted
by local country inflation costs and the impact of the US dollar strength on the cost of the mining
fleet.

Ghaghoo mining operation
Based on the prevailing market conditions, Ghaghoo has predominantly focused on downsizing
to improve efficiencies and processes during the Period. Initiatives to downsize included profiling
the ramp up of production to achieve targeted monthly rates in H2 2016 (300 000 tonnes per
annum) and restructuring staff complements through retrenchments. Although the retrenchment
process was largely completed, the cost-cutting programme has required renegotiation of various
contracts from which the benefits will only materialise in H2 2016.
During the Period, cash operating costs (net of sales received) amounted to US$5.6 million and
included once-off retrenchment costs and costs associated with the creation of the buffer zone to
prevent sand ingress into the production levels following the sink hole that resulted from the early
caving. In addition, development costs of US$2.8 million were invested in order to access both
current and future ore producing tunnels.
The operation did not reach its targeted production rates during the Period and therefore
commercial production was not achieved by the end of the Period. As a result, all costs, net of
sales, have been capitalised to the carrying value of the development asset.
As a result of the continued market uncertainty, the ongoing difficult market conditions for
Ghaghoo's production, recent strengthening of the Botswana pula against the US dollar and the
challenges in the operation reaching its targeted production rate, the Group recognised a
US$40.0 million (post-tax) impairment. This has been disclosed as an exceptional item and
represents the estimated impact on the asset when applying a conservative view to diamond
prices and market recovery in the short term.
Diamond manufacturing operation
The Group generated additional margin on selected high-value diamonds through its
manufacturing facilities and partnership arrangements.
During the Period, 145 carats were extracted and selected for manufacturing. Extracted diamond
inventory on hand at the end of the Period amounted to US$4.6 million (compared to
US$6.2 million at the end of December 2015), resulting in a polished inventory movement
increase in Group revenue of US$1.6 million for the Period. In total, the diamond manufacturing
operation contributed US$1.2 million to Group revenue (through additional polished uplift
generated) and US$0.6 million to underlying EBITDA during the Period.
Corporate office
Corporate costs relate to central costs incurred by the Group through its technical and
administrative offices in South Africa and the United Kingdom and are incurred in both South
African rand and British pound. Corporate costs for the Period of US$7.1 million include notice
costs relating to the retirement of an Executive Director. During the latter part of 2015, the
Diamond Producers Association was formed, with Gem Diamonds as a founding member along
with industry peers. Costs for the Period include the new associated membership fees and
certain project costs.
The share-based payment charge for the Period amounted to US$0.9 million. A new long-term
incentive plan (LTIP) option was issued during the Period whereby 1 400 000 nil-cost options
were granted to certain key employees and Executive Directors. The vesting of the options will
be subject to the satisfaction of certain market and non-market performance conditions over a
three-year period. The share-based payment charge associated with this new award was
US$0.2 million for the Period.
Underlying EBITDA1 and attributable profit
Based on the above operating results, the Group generated an Underlying EBITDA1 of
US$43.5 million. The profit attributable to shareholders before exceptional items2 for the Period
was US$13.4 million equating to 9.70 US cents per share on a weighted average number of
shares in issue of 138 million.
The forecast effective tax rate for the full year is 38.4% and has been applied to the actual results
for the Period. This rate excludes the impact of the exceptional item as there is no tax effect on
this item. The forecast effective tax rate is above the UK statutory tax rate of 20.0% as a result of
profits generated by Letšeng being taxed at 25.0%, withholding tax of 10.0% on dividends from
Letšeng and deferred tax assets not recognised on losses incurred in non-trading operations.
Financial position and funding review
The Group continued its prudent cash management and ended the Period with US$66.5 million
(31 December 2015: US$85.7 million) cash on hand of which US$53.2 million is attributable to
Gem Diamonds and US$2.7 million is restricted. The restricted cash mainly relates to funds
reserved for a portion of the future repayment of the US$25.0 million secured bank facility at
Ghaghoo. Furthermore, standby undrawn facilities of US$ 52.1 million remain available,
comprising US$35.0 million at Gem Diamonds (which was increased from US$20.0 million in
January 2016) and US$17.1 million (LSL250.0 million) at Letšeng.
The Group generated cash from operating activities of US$44.5 million (30 June 2015:
US$38.7 million) before the investment in waste stripping costs at Letšeng of US$31.3 million,
capital expenditure of US$6.0 million, incurred mainly at Letšeng and cash operational costs (net
of sales) at Ghaghoo of US$5.6 million. Furthermore, development costs at Ghaghoo of
US$2.8 million were incurred in order to access both current and future ore producing tunnels.
During the Period, Letšeng paid dividends of US$20.8 million, which resulted in a net cash flow
of US$13.1 million to Gem Diamonds after withholding taxes of US$1.5 million and the payment
to the government of Lesotho's dividend portion of US$6.2 million.
The Group paid dividends of US$11.8 million on 14 June 2016, consisting of an ordinary
dividend of US$6.9 million (5 US cents per share) and a special dividend of US$4.9 million (3.5
US cents per share).
1 Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and mining asset amortisation.
2 Exceptional item relates to an impairment to the carrying value of the Ghaghoo development
asset.
The Group remains well funded and ended the Period in a net cash position of US$37.6 million
(after borrowings). The LSL140.0 million facility at Letšeng has an outstanding balance of
LSL58.1 million (US$4.0 million) and is due to be fully repaid by June 2017. During the Period,
US$0.1 million of the US$25.0 million secured bank facility at Ghaghoo was paid. This facility is
being restructured, whereby capital repayments are scheduled to re-commence in June 2019
with a final repayment due on 31 December 2021.
Outlook
Capital and cash management discipline remains a high priority in the short term and the
Company remains committed to generating and returning cash to shareholders. The Company's
dividend policy as previously adopted remains intact.
Letšeng remained cash generative and as mining moves into the higher-value area of the
Satellite pipe in H2 2016, the cash generation is expected to improve. Letšeng will be
commencing its mining workshop capital project in H2 2016.
Focus at Ghaghoo will be on cost optimisation and reduction in cash consumption.
Risks to our business
The Group is exposed to a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on
its  performance and long-term growth.
Many of these risks are beyond the control of the Group but a formal risk management process
exists to assist in identifying and reviewing potential risks. Mitigating plans are formulated and
reviewed regularly to understand their effectiveness and progress. The Group is focused on
continuously analysing and assessing the risks faced and improving the risk management
process accordingly.
The Group internal audit function carries out a risk-based programme approved by the Audit
Committee to evaluate the effectiveness and contribute to the improvement of risk management
controls and governance processes.
A reassessment of the risks, which have been previously reported in the Business Review in the
2015 Annual Report, has identified that the principal risks and uncertainties have not changed.
These may impact the Group over the medium to long term; however, the following key risks may
impact the Group over the next six months.
Short-term demand and prices (market and price risk)
While the medium to long-term fundamentals of the diamond market remain intact, with demand
forecast to significantly outpace supply, in the short term the prevailing climate of global
economic uncertainty may cause some volatility in rough diamond pricing. The cautious
approach adopted by rough and polished diamantaires and manufacturers could continue into
the second half of the year. Market conditions are constantly monitored to identify current trends
that may pose a threat or create an opportunity for the Group. In this regard, management has
taken all reasonable measures to preserve its cash position and to have flexibility in its sales
processes and in reassessing its capital projects and operational strategies.
Currency (financial risk)
The Group receives its revenue in US dollar while its cost base arises in the local currencies of
the various countries within which the Group operates (mainly in Lesotho, Botswana and South
Africa). The volatility of these currencies against the US dollar will impact the Group's profitability.
In order to mitigate currency risk, these fluctuations are closely monitored and, where appropriate
and at relevant currency levels, the Group enters into exchange rate contracts to protect future
cash flows.
Capital projects (operational risk)
Ghaghoo has predominantly focused on downsizing operations during the period and continues
to focus on reducing its cash consumption in the current challenging market until such time as the
market recovers. During the downsizing of operations, people were retrenched and the retention
of key operational staff is essential to ensure that the mine achieves its targets.
Political risks (operational risk)
The political environments of the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates may
adversely impact the ability to operate effectively and profitably. Emerging market economies are
generally subject to greater risks, including regulatory and political risk, and are potentially
subject to rapid change. Changes to the political environment and regulatory developments are
closely monitored. Where necessary, the Group engages in dialogue with relevant government
representatives in order to remain well informed of all legal and regulatory developments
impacting its operations and to build relationships.
Mineral resource risks (operational risk)
The Group's mineral resources influence the operational mine plans and affect the generation of
sufficient margins. Variability of its mineral resources could affect the Group's profitability in the
short term, mitigated by flexibility in the mining faces and improved in-pit geological controls.
Production interruption (operational risk)
The Group may experience material mine and/or plant shut downs or periods of decreased
production due to a number of different events. Any such event could negatively affect the
Group's operations and impact both profitability and cash flows. The likelihood of possible
interruption events is continually reviewed and the appropriate controls, processes and business
continuity plans are in place to mitigate this risk.

Independent Review Report to the Members of Gem Diamonds Limited
We have been engaged by Gem Diamonds Limited (the Company) to review the condensed
consolidated set of financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Group) in the
Half-yearly Report for the six months ended 30 June 2016 which comprises the interim
consolidated income statement, interim consolidated statement of comprehensive income,
interim consolidated statement of financial position, interim consolidated statement of changes in
equity, interim consolidated statement of cash flows and the related explanatory notes. We have
read the other information contained in the Half-yearly Report and considered whether it contains
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the condensed
set of financial statements.
This report is made solely to the Company in accordance with guidance contained in
International Standard on Review Engagements 2410 (UK and Ireland) Review of Interim
Financial Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company, for our work, for this report, or for the conclusions we have
formed.
Directors' responsibilities
The Half-yearly Report is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the Directors. The
Directors are responsible for preparing the Half-yearly Report in accordance with the Disclosure
and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 1.2.1 in the 2015 audited annual financial statements, the Annual Financial
Statements of the Group are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS). The condensed consolidated set of financial statements included in this Half-
yearly Report have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34
Interim Financial Reporting.
Our responsibility
Our responsibility is to express to the Company a conclusion on the condensed consolidated set
of financial statements in the Half-yearly Report based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(UK and Ireland) 2410 Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.
A review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and consequently does not enable us to
obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in
an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
condensed consolidated set of financial statements in the Half-yearly Report for the six months
ended 30 June 2016 are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International
Accounting Standard 34 and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom's
Financial Conduct Authority.

Condensed Notes to the Consolidated Interim Financial Statements
for the six months ended 30 June 2016
1.Corporate information
  1.1Incorporation and authorisation
The holding company, Gem Diamonds Limited (the Company), was incorporated on 29 July
2005 in the British Virgin Islands. The Company's registration number is 669758.
The financial information shown in this report relating to Gem Diamonds Limited and its
subsidiaries (the Group) was approved by the Board of Directors on 16 August 2016, is
unaudited and does not constitute statutory financial statements. The report of the auditors
on the Group's 2015 Annual Report and Accounts was unqualified.
The Group is principally engaged in the development and operating of diamond mines.
2.Basis of preparation and accounting policies
  2.1Basis of presentation
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the six months ended 30 June
2016 (the Period) have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
Reporting. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the
information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read
in conjunction with the Group's Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31
December 2015.
Going concern
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future
development, performance and position are set out in the Interim Business Review on
pages 3 to 15. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are
described in the Interim Business Review on pages 10 to 15.
After making enquiries which include reviews of forecasts and budgets, timing of cash flows,
borrowing facilities and sensitivity analyses and considering the uncertainties described in
this report either directly or by cross reference, the Directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group and the Company have adequate financial resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the
going-concern basis in preparing this half-yearly report and accounts of the Group.
2.2Significant accounting policies
2.2Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the condensed consolidated interim
financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Group's
Annual Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2015, except for the adoption
of new standards and amendments as of 1 January 2016. The Group has not early adopted
any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet
effective.
Although the new standards and amendments apply for the first time in 2016, they do not
have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of the
Group.
Annual improvements 2012 - 2014 Cycle
These improvements are effective from 1 January 2016 and the Group has applied these
amendments in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements.
Standards issued but not effective
The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of
issuance of the Group's financial statements are disclosed below. The Group intends to
adopt these standards if applicable when they become effective.

The new revenue standard introduces a single,
principles-based, five-step model for the recognition
of revenue when control of a good or service is
transferred to the customer. The Group will assess
the impact prior to the effective date.
The amendments clarify that an entity needs to
consider whether tax law restricts the sources of
taxable profits against which it may make deductions
on the reversal of that deductible temporary
difference. Furthermore, the amendments provide
guidance on how an entity should determine future
taxable profits and explains in which circumstances
taxable profit may include the recovery of some
assets for more than their carrying amount. The
Group will assess the impact prior to the effective
date.

3.Segment information
  For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical units as its risks and
For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical units as its risks and
required rates of return are affected predominantly by differences in the geographical regions of
the mines and areas in which the Group operates. Other regions where no direct mining
activities take place are organised into geographical regions in the areas where the operations
are managed. The main geographical regions and the type of products and services from which
each reporting segment derives its revenue from are:
·      Lesotho (diamond mining activities);
·      Botswana (diamond mining activities);
·      Belgium (sales, marketing and manufacturing of diamonds); and
·      BVI, RSA and UK (technical and administrative services).
Management monitors the operating results of the geographical units separately for the
purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss.
  Inter-segment transactions are entered into under normal arm's-length terms in a manner
similar to transactions with third parties. Segment revenue, segment expenses and segment
results include transactions between segments. Those transactions are eliminated on
consolidation.
Segment revenue is derived from mining activities, polished manufacturing margins and Group
services.
The following table presents revenue and profit, and asset and liability information from
operations regarding the Group's geographical segments:

3 The operating loss in the Botswana segment mainly relates to the impairment provided for on
the Ghaghoo development asset (refer to Note 4, Exceptional item), which has been marginally
offset by realised foreign exchange gains on third-party funding. The commissioning and
development costs (net of sales) have been capitalised to the carrying value of the Ghaghoo
asset. The foreign exchange gains have not been capitalised to the carrying value of the
Ghaghoo asset.

Included in revenue is revenue from a single customer which amounted to US$24.2 million (30
June 2015: US$21.6 million) arising from sales reported in the Lesotho and Belgium segments.
Segment assets and liabilities do not include net deferred tax liabilities of US$58.3 million (31
December 2015: US$50.4 million).
Operating profits have decreased marginally, notwithstanding the lower revenue as a result of
lower diamond prices achieved. This is mainly due to costs which have decreased mainly as a
result of the strong trading of the US dollar against the Lesotho loti which positively impacted
US dollar reported costs during the Period.

Impairment - Ghaghoo
At 31 December 2015, the recoverable amount of Ghaghoo was assessed through a value-in-
use calculation, and although it exceeded the carrying value at that date, the value did not
reflect significant headroom. This value in use remained highly sensitive to rough diamond
prices and future diamond price escalation rates.
As a result of the continued market uncertainty, the ongoing difficult market conditions for
Ghaghoo's production, the recent strengthening of the Botswana pula against the US dollar
and the challenges in the operation reaching targeted production rate, the Ghaghoo
recoverable amount was reassessed at 30 June 2016 and an impairment was considered
appropriate. The Group recognised a consolidated income statement impairment charge of
US$40.0 million (post-tax), being the estimated impact on the value-in-use calculation when
applying a conservative view to diamond prices and market recovery in the short term.
Although the Group has taken a number of steps to respond to these conditions, such as
downsizing the operation and reducing cash spend, the impact and benefit of these steps have
not yet been realised.
The valuation remains sensitive to market conditions impacting price and any adverse
changes thereto could result in additional impairment.
The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount are:
Diamond prices
The diamond prices used in the impairment test have been set with reference to recent prices
achieved, the Group's conservative short-term forecast and market trends; and medium to long-
term diamond price escalations are based on external market consensus forecasts as
published by independent marketing consultants.
Discount rate
A discount rate which represents a pre-tax risk-free rate adjusted for market risk, volatility and
risks specific to the asset and its operating jurisdiction was applied.
Exchange rates
Exchange rates are estimated based on current exchange rates and devalued over the Period
in line with economic forecasts.
5. Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and mining asset amortisation (EBITDA)
Underlying EBITDA is shown, as the Directors consider this measure to be a relevant guide to
the performance of the Group. The reconciliation from operating profit to underlying EBITDA

During the prior period, the Group sold its small manufacturing business facility in Mauritius,
through Gem Diamonds Technology Mauritius (Proprietary) Limited. The sale was finalised for
the agreed purchase price of US$0.4 million, to be paid in quarterly instalments of a minimum
of US$50 000 which was due to commence in January 2016. Based on current market
conditions, the consideration has not been received to date and therefore a provision for bad
debt of US$0.4 million has been included in receivables and other assets (refer to Note 11,
Receivables and other assets).
The results of the Mauritius operation for the Periods ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015

The Group's sales environment with regard to its diamond sales is not materially impacted by
seasonal and cyclical fluctuations. The mining operations may be impacted by seasonal
weather conditions. Appropriate mine planning and ore stockpile build-up ensures that mining
can continue during adverse weather conditions.

The forecast effective tax rate for the full year is 38.4% and has been applied to the actual
results excluding exceptional items for the Period. This rate excludes the impact of the
exceptional item as there is no tax effect on this item. The forecast effective tax rate is above
the UK statutory tax rate of 20.0% as a result of profit generated by Letšeng being taxed at
25.0%, withholding tax of 10.0% on dividends from Letšeng and deferred tax assets not
recognised on losses incurred in non-trading operations.

The 2015 proposed dividend based on the 2015 full-year results was approved on 7 June
2016 and a final cash dividend of US$11.8 million was paid on 14 June 2016, comprising an
ordinary dividend of US$6.9 million (5 US cents per share) and a special dividend of
US$4.9 million (3.5 US cents per share).
The Directors intend on applying a similar dividend policy in the current year on the 2016 full
year results as has been adopted previously. This dividend policy is dependent on the results
of the Group's operations, its financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, profits
available for distribution and other factors deemed to be relevant at that time.
10.Property, plant and equipment
During the Period, the Group acquired property, plant and equipment of US$6.0 million (30
June 2015: US$11.5 million), of which US$3.7 million related to Letšeng, US$1.9 million
related to Ghaghoo and the balance to other Group operations. Letšeng's capital spend was
incurred mainly on improvements to the Coarse Recovery Plant (US$1.4 million),
rehabilitation to the fresh water dam (US$0.5 million) and initial costs associated with the
feasibility of the new mining workshop which is required for the larger fleet. The balance of the
spend was incurred on stay-in-business capital. At Ghaghoo, capital spend was mainly on
mining fleet.
Letšeng further invested US$31.3 million (30 June 2015: US$28.5 million) in deferred
stripping costs and Ghaghoo further invested US$2.8 million (30 June 2015: US$4.5 million)
in development costs.
As Ghaghoo had not reached commercial production during the Period, operating costs of
US$5.6 million (30 June 2015: US$10.5 million) were capitalised until such time as the mine
reaches sustainable levels of operation. Due to the ongoing weak diamond market for
Ghaghoo diamonds, an impairment of US$40.0 million has been provided against the
carrying value of the development asset. The carrying value of the Ghaghoo development
asset after the impairment is US$95.0 million. Refer to Note 4, Exceptional item, for further
information.
Borrowing costs of US$0.8 million (30 June 2015: US$0.4 million) incurred in respect of the
US$25.0 million Ghaghoo facility (refer to Note 15, Interest-bearing loans and borrowings)
have been capitalised. The weighted average capitalisation rate used to determine the
amount of borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation was 3.2%.
In addition to the above, foreign exchange movements on translation were affecting property,
plant and equipment US$16.7 million (30 June 2015: (US$15.5 million)).
Depreciation and mining asset amortisation of US$5.0 million (30 June 2015: US$5.6 million)
was charged to the income statement during the Period.
Amortisation of the deferred stripping asset (waste stripping cost amortisation) of
US$18.0 million (30 June 2015: US$24.4 million) was charged to the income statement
during the Period. The amortisation is directly related to the areas that were mined during the
Period and their associated waste to ore strip ratios.

Included in total prepayments is an amount of US$2.1 million (31 December 2015:
US$2.1 million) (comprising a non-current portion of US$1.8 million (31 December 2015:
US$1.9 million) and a current portion of US$0.3 million (31 December 2015: US$0.2 million)
relating to the balance of the value to be recovered from the mining contractor as a result of
the estimation change in respect of the waste mined, which was disclosed in 2012. The waste
tonnes and strip ratio for future cuts have been reassessed and has resulted in a credit to the
waste amortisation charge (included in cost of sales) of US$0.7 million (31 December 2015:
US$0.7 million) and a finance income adjustment of US$0.2 million (31 December 2015:

  There was one option award granted during the current period:
  Employee Share Option Plan for March 2016
In March 2016, 1 400 000 cost options were approved to be granted to certain key employees
and Executive Directors under the Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) of the Company. The
vesting of the options will be subject to the satisfaction of certain market and non-market
performance conditions over a three-year period. The satisfaction of certain performance as
well as service conditions are classified as non-market conditions. A total of 185 000 of the
options granted relate to market conditions. The options vest after a three-year period and are
exercisable between 15 March 2019 and 14 March 2026. If the performance or service
conditions are not met, the options lapse.
The performance conditions relating to the non-market conditions are not reflected in the fair
value of the award at grant date, and therefore the Company will assess the likelihood of
these conditions being met with a relevant adjustment to the cumulative charge as required at
each financial year end. The fair value of the nil-cost options is £0.99 (US$1.40).
The fair value of the options granted relating to the market conditions is estimated at the date
of the grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model, taking into account the terms and
conditions upon which the options were granted, projected dividends, share price fluctuations,
the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate, expected life of the options in years and the
weighted average share price of the Company. Of the total options originally granted, 5 000
have been forfeited following the resignation of employees.
The following table illustrates the inputs to the model used for the market condition awards:

The Board has approved capital projects of US$6.1 million (31 December 2015:
US$5.3 million) of which US$4.9 million (31 December 2015: US$5.2 million) have been
contracted at 30 June 2016.

employee-related legal costs approximating US$0.8 million (31 December 2015:
US$0.6 million) and tax claims within the various jurisdictions in which the Group operates

The carrying amounts of the Group's financial instruments held approximate their fair value.
 Fair value hierarchy
All financial instruments for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements
are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, based on the lowest level input that is significant
 
to the fair value measurement as a whole, as follows:
 Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
 
measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
 
measurement is unobservable.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements or any transfers
 
into or out of Level 3 fair value measurements during the Period.
Other risk management activities
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on future sales of diamonds at Letšeng and
Ghaghoo. In order to reduce this risk, the Group enters into forward exchange contracts to
hedge this exposure. The Group performs no hedge accounting. During the current Period,
the Group did not enter into any new forward exchange contracts due to the strong US dollar
being favourable to the Group's revenue.
