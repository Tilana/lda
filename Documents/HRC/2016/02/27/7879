Human rights situations that require the Council&#8217;s attention<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights in Belarus</b>*  **<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights in Belarus to the Human Rights Council in accordance with its resolution 20/13. In 
the report, the Special Rapporteur presents the developments in human rights since the 
report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights presented to the 
Council at its twentieth session (A/HRC/20/8).  
</p>
<p> In the report, the Special Rapporteur outlines his methodology of engagement with 
the Government of Belarus in pursuance of his mandate. He describes positive 
developments where they were discernible. In his assessment, human rights remain 
systemically and systematically restricted, especially in the case of the freedoms of 
association, of assembly, and of expression and opinion, as well as the guarantees of due 
process and fair trial. 
</p>
<p> Of particular concern is the continuing imprisonment of political opponents, human 
rights defenders and activists based on spurious criminal charges and unfair procedures, 
aggravated by allegations of torture and ill-treatment while in custody, as part of physical 
and psychological pressure aimed at &#8220;breaking&#8221; them into admission of guilt. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur accounts for enduring and emerging human rights concerns 
to be read in the light of the international commitments of Belarus. Lastly, the Special 
Rapporteur makes his recommendations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Background 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Belarus 
was established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 20/13. In the present report, 
the Special Rapporteur, Mikl&#243;s Haraszti, who officially assumed his functions on 1 
November 2012, describes the prevailing situation of human rights in Belarus since the 
establishment of the mandate on 5 July 2012 and includes information received until 31 
March 2013. 
</p>
<p>2. The aftermath of the presidential elections held on 19 December 2010 and the 
ensuing deterioration in the situation of human rights still mark the human rights context of 
Belarus. A broad range of human rights concerns were laid out in the report of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.1 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, there were reports of limitations on the rights to the 
freedoms of peaceful assembly, of association, and expression and opinion; the lack of 
independence of the judiciary, due process and fair trial procedures; torture and ill-
treatment by law enforcement officials; arbitrary detention; harassment of human rights 
defenders; and growing concerns for the protection of labour rights and discriminatory 
practices towards minority groups.  
</p>
<p>4. On a more positive note, a recent report of the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) showed Belarus moving from 65th to 50th position in the Human 
Development Index rating among 187 States.2 This would reflect how the State has 
prioritized the Millennium Development Goals into its policies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>5. The parliamentary elections of 23 September 2012 saw 110 parliamentarians elected 
for a four-year term. No seats went to any opposition candidates. Prior to the elections and 
during the campaign, opposition parties and candidates decided to boycott the elections, 
citing procedural violations, media discrimination and the imprisonment of opposition 
activists. The observation mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human 
Rights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) found that the 
elections had not met the State&#8223;s commitments, including to citizens&#8223; rights to associate, to 
stand as candidates and to express themselves freely,3 while the election observation 
mission dispatched by the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) found them to be in 
compliance with democratic norms and national legislation.4  
</p>
<p>6. The impact of geopolitics on the situation of human rights in Belarus should not be 
underestimated. Relations between Belarus and the European Union are at this time quite 
defined by the sanctions imposed in the wake of the human rights violations reported since 
</p>

<p>2010. In 2013, Belarus has the CIS Chairmanship and is deepening its economic and policy 
integration with the Russian Federation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>7. According to Human Rights Council resolution 20/13, the Special Rapporteur has a 
mandate: 
</p>
<p>(a) To monitor the human rights situation in Belarus and provide 
recommendations for its improvement; 
</p>
<p>(b) To help to implement the recommendations contained in the report of the 
High Commissioner; 
</p>
<p>(c) To assist the Government of Belarus in fulfilling its human rights obligations;  
</p>
<p>(d) To offer support and advice to civil society; 
</p>
<p>(e) To seek, receive, examine and act on information from all relevant 
stakeholders pertaining to the situation of human rights in Belarus. 
</p>
<p>8. Since taking up his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has stressed his commitment to 
independence, impartiality and objectivity, and to cooperation with all stakeholders, as the 
guiding principles for his work. In particular, he has sought to enlist the cooperation of the 
Government of Belarus in order to engage in a constructive dialogue and to assess fully the 
situation of human rights. The Special Rapporteur addressed four letters to the Permanent 
Representative of the Republic of Belarus to the United Nations Office at Geneva or, 
through him, to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to request meetings and to seek to arrange 
an initial visit.5 No reply has been received to date.  
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur has pursued wherever possible the collection of information 
from primary sources, convinced that this is a key factor to an accurate, time-bound and 
measured report on the situation of human rights in Belarus.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the extensive cooperation he enjoyed with 
many stakeholders living in Belarus. Since assuming his mandate, he has undertaken three 
trips to Lithuania and Ukraine to meet with a broad range of civil society representatives 
and victims of human rights violations. In both States, he met with representatives of the 
respective Ministries of Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p>11. From 11 to 15 November 2012, in Vilnius, the Special Rapporteur participated in his 
first consultation with civil society, organized by the Belarusian Human Rights House.6 
From 12 to 16 January 2013, also in Vilnius, the Special Rapporteur held consultations, 
also organized by the Belarusian Human Rights House, with legal professionals on matters 
concerning the justice system and lawyers, and met with individuals from Belarus with 
particular human rights concerns. From 18 to 21 February 2013, during the joint event on 
&#8220;Media space and human rights&#8221; organized by the Belarusian Human Rights House, the 
Human Rights House Kyiv and the Human Rights House Foundation, he met with media 
experts, human rights defenders and civil society representatives in Kyiv. From these first-
hand consultations, information was collected, documented and recorded on the prevailing 
human rights concerns in Belarus. 
</p>
<p>  
 5  On 6 November and19 December 2012, and on 2 and 18 January 2013. 
 6  See http://humanrightshouse.org/Articles/18851.html. </p>


<p>12. On 18 February 2013, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet with the 
First Secretary of the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus to Ukraine on the sidelines of an 
event entitled &#8220;Media and human rights&#8221;, organized by the Human Rights House 
Foundation, in Kyiv.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur collaborated with several other special procedures mandate 
holders to transmit two allegation letters to the authorities of Belarus. 
</p>
<p>14. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur links the human rights concerns 
discerned with the recommendations made by the High Commissioner in her report1 (see 
annex).  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur regrets that first-hand information from sources designated 
by the Government was not forthcoming.  
</p>
<p>16. The present report contains a number of cases that are emblematic of the nature of 
the human rights violation under discussion. They do not, however, represent the full list of 
allegations submitted to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Cooperation with United Nations human rights mechanisms and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Office of the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>17. On 3 August 2012, Belarus submitted its eighteenth and nineteenth periodic reports 
to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (due in 2008);7 on 27 
November 2012, it submitted a timely response to the Committee against Torture.8  
</p>
<p>18. Belarus continued to reject a number of newly registered cases under the Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, mainly invoking 
procedural grounds. With regard to follow-up to recommendations in its views, the Human 
Right Committee has to date not been satisfied by the measures taken by the State party. 
One reply was received in July 2012 regarding a case decided under the Optional Protocol 
to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and 
the follow-up dialogue is ongoing.  
</p>
<p>19. The visit in 2009 of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially 
women and children9 was the last visit to be undertaken by a special procedures mandate 
holder. Since 2009, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and association and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention have sought to 
make a visit and have yet to receive a response. 
</p>
<p>20. A number of joint communications were sent by special procedures mandate 
holders. Belarus has at times substantially responded to the issues raised. It has also alleged 
that special procedures mandates holders have violated the principle of non-accumulation 
of functions by sending joint communications, and that communications were politically 
motivated and unduly interfered in domestic affairs.

<p>21. In 2012, the Government submitted its mid-term progress report on the 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations.10 The submission of mid-
term reports is not an obligation, but is a good practice encouraged by the High 
Commissioner. 
</p>
<p>22. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights continued 
to provide Belarus with technical assistance. On the request of the Government, assistance 
has focused on the issues of human trafficking and discrimination. This has included the 
development of a project on the theme &#8220;Combating trafficking in human beings: new 
challenges and threats&#8221; with UNDP in Belarus and the Minsk International Training Centre 
</p>
<p>on Migration and Combating Trafficking. The project is currently being registered in 
accordance with national requirements. Planning is under way for a two-day anti-
discrimination workshop, to be held in Minsk in June 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> II.  Positive developments  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. National human rights institution 
</b></p>
<p>23. In 2012, Belarus indicated its intention to establish an institution of a human rights 
commissioner, in accordance with a recommendation from its universal periodic review in 
2010.11 It announced it would hold consultations with non-governmental organizations to 
launch the said initiative, but subsequently failed to directly inform all intended 
participants.12 
</p>
<p><b> B. Prisoners: access and release 
</b></p>
<p>24.  In September 2012, Archbishop Claudio Gugerotti, the Apostolic Nuncio in Minsk, 
was allowed to visit the imprisoned political opponents and human rights defenders Ales 
Bialiatski, Mikalai Statkevich, Dzmitry Dashkevich, Pavel Seviarynets, Siarhei Kavalenka, 
Pavel Syramalotau and Eduard Lobau.13 As the inmates had been enduring deprivations in 
their prison conditions, health supplies and in the visits of their lawyers and relatives, the 
visit was, according to individual consultations with relatives and diplomats of the Holy 
See, a welcome relief and resulted in the temporary cessation of the use of solitary cells for 
some of the inmates. The prisoners&#8223; relatives expressed their gratitude to Pope Emeritus 
</p>
<p>Benedict XVI and the Apostolic Nuncio, and asked that they facilitate the prompt release of 
all political opponents and activists. 
</p>
<p>25. In September 2012, Mr. Kavalenka and Mr. Syramalotau, who had been sentenced 
on criminal charges during the demonstrations of December 2010, were released. In June 
2012, they had signed a request for a pardon that acknowledged their guilt, after being 
exposed to increasingly harsh detention conditions.

<p><b> C. Human trafficking 
</b></p>
<p>26. Belarus is addressing concerns that it is both a source and transit country for women, 
men and children subjected to human trafficking for both sexual exploitation and forced 
labour. Belarus was one of the first CIS member States to devise activities and legal tools, 
both nationally and in cooperation with international bodies, on this issue.14 The Special 
Rapporteur recalls the request made by Belarus on 30 December 2009 to accede to the 
Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, and within 
that agreed to the terms of the Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings, its monitoring mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Issue of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>27. Despite the regrettable fact that Belarus enforced the death penalty in two cases in 
2012, some developments may be seen as signs of openness towards a possible reform. It 
abstained in the vote held by the Third Committee on a draft resolution on a moratorium on 
the use of the death penalty.15 It was announced on 20 December 2012 that a parliamentary 
working group had been re-established to consider the issue of the death penalty. In the first 
months of 2013, the Chairman of the Constitutional Court stressed several times that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>question of a moratorium on the death penalty remains open&#8221;, although it would not be on 
</p>
<p>the agenda in the foreseeable future.16 
</p>
<p><b> E. Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur recognizes the efforts being made by Belarus to achieve 
several of the Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>29. Belarus has fully implemented the target to reduce by more than three times the 
share of the population living below the national poverty line. Data available only until 
2009 show that the share of individuals below the minimum subsistence levels dropped 
from 41.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent. 
</p>
<p>30. As at 2009, Belarus had succeeded in halving the mortality rate of children under 5 
years of age. It has a low maternal mortality rate (1 per 100,000 births in 2009), 
approaching the average for industrialized nations. Further action is needed to strengthen 
the national response to HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis, which is highly prevalent, and 
constitutes a major threat to public health. The national strategy for sustainable 
socioeconomic development to 2020 calls for the development of policies to secure 
environmental health and to improve the quality of life.17  
</p>
<p>31. At its universal periodic review in 2010, Belarus accepted a number of 
recommendations to increase its efforts in certain areas relating to the Millennium 
Development Goals.18

<p>32. The Special Rapporteur regrets the fact that, owing to his lack of access to the 
country, he is not able to witness first-hand the above-mentioned reported positive 
developments and the impact that they have on the daily lives of Belarusians. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Rule of law 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at the lack of rule of law in Belarus, in 
particular with regard to procedural guarantees, as envisaged by article 14 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Multiple meetings with human rights 
defenders and victims of human rights violations reflected a lack of trust in the judiciary, as 
well as a lack in the belief that rights would be protected by the judiciary over the interests 
of the authorities. 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur wishes to address specifically the concern that human rights 
violations in the country have a systemic and systematic character. Their nature remains 
structural and endemic, as characterized in the report of the High Commissioner, in which 
she stressed that &#8220;deficiencies pertaining to human rights in Belarus are of a systemic 
nature. They need to be addressed by the authorities through a comprehensive approach, 
which would include a review of the legislation, policies, strategies and practice pertaining 
to human rights.&#8221;19 In its judgement on <i>Jerzy Broniowski v. Poland</i>, the European Court of 
Human Rights defined systemic human rights violations as deriving from structural causes 
not addressed by the responsible authorities. In the case of Belarus, many United Nations 
bodies have observed in several cases similar violations not addressed by the State: 
violations of the rights to freedom of expression and opinion;20 right to a fair trial;21 or to 
freedom of association.22 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that Belarus de facto denies alleged victims of 
human rights violations the right to appeal decisions of the Supreme Court to the Human 
Rights Committee, even though Belarus has ratified the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

<p><b> B. Presidential decrees 
</b></p>
<p>36. The structural character of the fact that widespread human rights violations remain 
unaddressed is underlined by the centralization of the legislative and executive powers in 
the office of the President.  
</p>
<p>37. Presidential decrees are used as the main, and in fact, supreme legislative 
mechanism in the country. Article 85 of the Constitution provides for presidential decrees 
to have force of law in instances outlined by the Constitution. Article 101 defines such 
instances in two ways. Parliament may permanently delegate powers to the President, 
limited only to the subject and the term of the power in question.23 Additionally, article 101 
(3) empowers the President to issue decrees defined as temporary. These decrees retain 
force unless they are abolished by a majority of two-thirds of each House of Parliament (the 
House of Representatives and the Council of the Republic).  
</p>
<p>38. Even temporary decrees de facto become permanent given that a two-thirds majority 
is needed to overturn them. Moreover, not even laws adopted by Parliament will provide 
the necessary guarantees for the rule of law as long as the political parties represented in 
Parliament are seen to support the head of the executive exclusively. This concern is 
amplified by the fact that draft laws in Belarus are in general prepared by the Presidential 
Administration. 
</p>
<p><b> C. National legislation  
</b></p>
<p>39. Belarus has a civil law system based on the Constitution, the supreme law of the 
State. Article 21, paragraph 3 of the Constitution provides for the States &#8220;to guarantee the 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms of citizens of Belarus &#8230; enshrined in the Constitution and laws, and 
specified by the State&#8223;s international obligations&#8221;.24 Article 8 recognizes the supremacy of 
the universally acknowledged principles of international law and ensures that the laws of 
Belarus comply with them.  
</p>
<p>40. During the period under review, various legislative developments may influence the 
full enjoyment of human rights:  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The adoption of amendments to law No. 390-&#1047; on State security bodies of Belarus, 
providing for, inter alia, broad powers for State security bodies and creating 
conditions for the restriction to the rights of the individual to liberty, security and 
dignity  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The adoption of an amnesty law that excludes articles 342 (the organization of 
actions grossly violating public order, or participation in such actions) and 367 
(defamation of the President) of the Criminal Code  
</p>
<p>&#8226; The promulgation of law 435-&#1047; on the introduction of amendments and additions to 
certain laws of Belarus &#8220;on the issues of combating terrorism and countering 
</p>
<p>extremism&#8221;, which further broadened the definition of extremism  
  
</p>
<p> 23 Article 101 (2) further states that there is to be no delegation of powers to the President to issue 
decrees providing for changes and additions to the Constitution and its interpretation; changes and 
additions to programme laws; approval of the republican budget and the report on its implementation; 
changing the procedure of elections of the President and the Parliament; or restrictions of 
constitutional rights and freedoms of the citizens. The law on delegating legislative powers to the 
President does not permit him to change the said law, nor does it empower him to adopt retroactive 
norms.

<p>&#8226; Decree No. 9 on additional measures for the development of the wood processing 
industry, restricting the right of employees to terminating their employment  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Decree No.2, introducing restrictive amendments to decree No.1 of 16 January 2009 
on State registration and liquidation (termination of activities) of economic entities  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Draft legislation introduced to amend the laws on national and local assemblies, and 
on the activities of political parties and other public associations. 
</p>
<p>41. In early 2013, plans were announced to prepare 30 draft laws that year, including 
bills to amend the Election Code, the Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code, the 
Administrative Violations Code, the code of Execution Procedure for Administrative 
Violations, and a draft law on the State border of Belarus.25 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Human rights concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to life and the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>42. Belarus retains the death penalty for certain crimes during times of peace and war. 
Executions are carried out by a gunshot to the back of the head. There is a lack of 
transparency about persons held on death row, and an inadequate procedure for appeals. 
Annual statistics on the use of the death penalty are not available, nor are the names of most 
of those who have been already executed. Those facing the death penalty, and their 
relatives, are not informed of the scheduled date of execution; following the execution, the 
relatives are not informed of where the body is buried.  
</p>
<p>43. At the time of reporting, Uladzlau Kavalyou and Dzmitry Kanavalau were the last 
two known individuals to have been executed, in March 2012. In 2011, both were 
sentenced to death for the terrorist attack of 11 April 2011 in the Minsk metro. During the 
trial, Mr. Kavalyou (Kovalev) withdrew his confession, which he claimed had been 
obtained under duress.26 
</p>
<p>44. The above-mentioned executions were held despite the issuance by the Human 
Rights Committee of interim protection measures requesting that the executions be 
suspended while it considered the appeals of the two individuals. The bodies of the two 
were not released to their relatives, nor was information provided on the burial site. A death 
certificate received and a letter dated 16 March 2012 from the Supreme Court of Belarus 
informed Mrs. Kavalyou (Kovaleva) that her son had been executed. In October 2012, the 
Human Rights Committee found that there had been violations of the right to life, the 
presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial and access to an effective judicial review, 
as well as inhuman treatment with regard to his family.27 The Committee highlighted the 
fact that Belarus was under an obligation to prevent similar violations in the future, 
including by amending article 175, paragraph 5 of the Criminal Executive Code in 
accordance with article 7 of the Covenant. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur is 
concerned that Belarus systematically dismisses the Committee&#8223;s views, which is 
</p>
<p>particularly worrying in cases of appeals from individuals on death row. In the period 2010 
&#8211; 2012, five executions were held, even though the Committee had requested, in 
accordance with rule 92 of its rules of procedure, interim measures of protection. In all five

<p>cases, allegations of violations of the right to a fair trial were reported, and three of the 
individuals claimed that they had confessed under duress.28 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur shares the view that the way the death penalty is carried out 
in Belarus amounts to inhuman treatment, as outlined by the Special Rapporteur on torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in his recent report to the 
General Assembly.29  
</p>
<p><b> B. Enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>46. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur received no new reports of 
enforced disappearances. Concerns were, however, raised that there had been no progress in 
solving the outstanding cases, three of which have been referred to the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances.30 These cases, which date from 1999 and 2000, 
concern Viktar Hanchar, a member of the dissolved Parliament and his close associate, 
Anatol Krasouski, as well as Yury Zakharenko, former Minister of the Interior, and Dimitry 
Zavadsky, an investigative journalist. Every three months, the authorities report that there 
have been &#8220;no results&#8221; in any of the cases. 
</p>
<p>47. In the first three of the above-mentioned cases, the Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances has received three communications from the Government, 
dated from January to October 2012. It found that the information provided was not 
sufficient to lead to the clarification of the cases. While in the case of Mr. Krasouski the 
Human Rights Committee found Belarus in violation of the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights by failing to provide an effective remedy and to include a thorough and 
diligent investigation of the facts, the prosecution and punishment of the perpetrators, with 
adequate information about the inquiries and adequate compensation.31  
</p>
<p>48. In individual consultations, relatives and lawyers expressed their concern that the 
cases would be closed officially 15 years after the disappearances owing to the statute of 
limitations.32  
</p>
<p>49. The lack of response by the Government to cases of the enforced disappearance of 
political opponents continues to gravely affect the general trust in rule of the law and the 
safe exercise of the right to civic activities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Prison conditions, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading 
</b></p>
<p><b>treatment 
</b></p>
<p>50. Allegations of torture and ill treatment continue to be received from detainees and 
inmates who have been deprived of their liberty by law enforcement bodies, at the moment 
of apprehension by police, or during pretrial or post-trial detention.  
</p>
<p>51. In its concluding observations on Belarus, the Committee against Torture, while 
noting that article 25 of the Constitution of Belarus prohibited torture, expressed its concern 
</p>
<p>  
 28 Andrei Zhuk, Vasily Yuzepchuk, Aleh Gryshkautstou, Andrei Burdyka and Uladzlau Kavalyou. See 
</p>
<p>the report submitted to OHCHR by the Belarusian Human Rights House, the Human Rights House 
Foundation, Penal Reform International and the human rights centre Viasna, April 2012. Available 
from http://humanrightshouse.org/Articles/17981.html.

<p>at the gap between the legislative framework and its practical implementation.33 It also 
noted that articles 128 and 394 of the Criminal Code do not criminalize torture in 
accordance with article 4, paragraph 2 of the Convention against Torture (arts. 1, 2 and 4).34 
Belarus has nonetheless indicated that the definition of torture contained in article 1 of the 
Convention was used for the purpose of criminal prosecution of perpetrators of acts of 
torture.  
</p>
<p>52. Reports continue to be received of the use of torture and other ill-treatment by police 
and investigators in order to extort confessions that are then used as evidence in trial 
proceedings. In such cases, there is evidence of a failure by officials to conduct prompt, 
impartial and full investigations into allegations of torture and ill-treatment and to prosecute 
alleged perpetrators. This was of particular concern to the Human Rights Committee in the 
Kavalyou (Kovalev) death penalty case.35 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur received information about ongoing serious concerns 
regarding the treatment of inmates and their conditions of confinement. Many find 
themselves in cold detention conditions, with no hot water. Some reported having been 
deprived of sleep, placed in stress positions, denied medical care, placed in disciplinary 
isolation cells for petty violations or prevented from observing their religious beliefs or 
studying. 
</p>
<p>54. Some inmates, especially political and civic activists, consistently complained about 
accumulated ill-treatment to coerce them into seeking a pardon.  
</p>
<p>55. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, there is an urgent need to publicly prohibit 
torture; for measures to be taken to effectively prevent acts of torture and ill-treatment by 
State officials; and for the conduct of prompt, impartial and full investigations, and the 
prosecution of alleged perpetrators.36  
</p>
<p><b> D. Treatment of political opponents, human rights defenders and activists  
</b></p>
<p>56. A number of political opponents and activists, whose sentences appear to have been 
politically motivated, have reportedly faced increasing psychological and physical pressure 
while deprived of their liberty.37 These individuals are routinely handed out disciplinary 
punishments for allegedly violating the rules of detention. The result is limitations placed 
on meetings with relatives and/or counsel, on receipt of packages (food and medicine), and 
correspondence.  
</p>
<p>57. In November 2011, Ales Bialiatski, head of the human rights centre Viasna, was 
found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced under article 243 (2) (tax evasion) of the 
Criminal Code to four and a half years and confiscation of all assets. In June 2012, the 
prison authorities labelled him a repeat violator of the regulations of his detention. 
Reportedly, he has since continued to face arbitrary reprimands in the form of restrictions 
on his mealtimes and on permission to receive parcels for having violated the rules in the 
penal colony No. 2 in Babruisk.38 Other inmates are not allowed to communicate,

<p>threatened with disciplinary action. On 13 February 2013, the administration of penal 
colony No. 2 announced that Mr. Bialiatski would not be allowed any visits with family 
members for a further six months.39 He last met with his wife on 20 December 2012. 
</p>
<p>58. On 28 August 2012, Zmitser Dashkevich, leader of the youth movement Malady 
Front, was sentenced to a further year in prison for allegedly violating prison rules under 
article 411 of the Criminal Code (deliberate disobedience to the correctional institution 
administration). He had originally been sentenced on 24 March 2011 to two years in a 
labour colony for alleged assault under article 339 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code. On 
21 September, he went on hunger strike to protest against the &#8220;inhuman&#8221; treatment of the 
</p>
<p>colony&#8223;s administration. The hunger strike lasted two weeks; he was subsequently put in 
</p>
<p>solitary confinement for 15 days. On 30 October, his sentence conditions were harshened 
on the allegation that he had committed gross and systematic violations of the regulations, 
whereafter he was transferred to prison No. 1 in Hrodna. While he was able to marry in 
December 2012, this was initially blocked. His deprivation of liberty has been marked by 
provocation by the authorities, incitement from other inmates, pressure owing to his 
political and religious views, and restrictions on correspondence and meetings. He now has 
the status of repeat violator of regulations. 
</p>
<p>59. On 3 February 2013, Nikolai Statkevich, a 2010 presidential candidate, is serving a 
six-year prison term after having been sentenced on 26 May 2011 under article 293 (1) of 
the Criminal Code (organizing mass unrest accompanied by violence against individuals, 
programmes, arson, destruction of property and armed resistance to government 
representatives). He is currently in prison No. 4 in Mahiliou. Already classified as a flagrant 
violator in December 20111, the administration in the penal colony in Shklou, where Mr. 
Statkevich first served his sentence, went on to classify him as &#8220;prone to escape and 
</p>
<p>assault&#8221;. He faced three rounds of disciplinary punishment in 2012 while in prison No. 4. 
On 27 June 2012, he was put in solitary confinement for 10 days. He has constantly faced 
different forms of provocation, with demands on him to sign a petition to request a pardon. 
On 11 February 2013, he reported another series of provocations against him. 
</p>
<p>60. The above instances are emblematic of a broader pattern of continuous, cumulative 
and cruel pressure applied to individuals while isolated from the outside world (for 
example, by limiting access to relatives, lawyers, correspondence and communication).The 
overall aim (often voiced even by wardens) is to &#8220;break&#8221; these individuals and force them 
to seek a pardon. Such practices could be viewed as amounting to ill-treatment or even 
torture.40 
</p>
<p><b> E. Independence of judges and lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>61. Despite the Code on the Judicial System and the Status of Judges of 2007, which 
according to the Government sets forth all the fundamental principles necessary for 
safeguarding judicial independence, concerns remain that, while article 110 of the 
Constitution and article 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code provide for an independent

<p>judiciary, other provisions in the law, specifically those on disciplining and the removal of 
judges, their appointment and tenure, undermine these provisions.41 
</p>
<p>62. The dependence of the judiciary on the executive branch is conditioned by the 
imbalance of the branches of power vested in the amendments to the Constitution of 1996. 
The President continues to appoint, dismiss and determine the tenure of judges.  
</p>
<p>63. The lack of independence of lawyers is particularly worrying and has not been 
addressed by the authorities. The reports received by the Special Rapporteur echo the 
findings by the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers following 
her visit to Belarus in 2001, when she spoke of &#8220;a pattern of intimidation and interference 
</p>
<p>in the discharge of the professional functions of lawyers&#8221;.42  
</p>
<p>64. Reports indicate that lawyers face interference, harassment, intimidation or other 
consequences for proper defence of the interests of their clients, and overall interference 
with lawyer-client confidentiality. There are reports of impediments in access to the legal 
profession and practicing as a lawyer. Lawyers are prevented from forming independent bar 
associations. 
</p>
<p>65. Hanna Bakhtina, Daria Lipkina, Aleh Ahejeu, Tatstsiana Ahejeu, Uladzimir 
Toustsik, Tamara Harajeva and Paval Sapelka are the best-known cases of disbarred 
lawyers. They have been the subject of retaliation for representing candidates in the 
presidential elections of December 2010, who were detained afterwards for advocating for 
the respect of human rights through their work.  
</p>
<p>66. The Ministry of Justice regulates entry to the legal profession. It controls the 
operation and governance of bar associations, and considers complaints leading to 
disciplinary measures.43 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur suggest reforming the Bar to protect the independence of 
legal professionals, including by guaranteeing in practice the independence of bar 
associations and their right to decide on their own membership. This would guarantee legal 
protection for all persons residing in Belarus. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Fair trial  
</b></p>
<p>68. The Human Rights Committee continues to indicate that the right to the presumption 
of innocence and fair trial standards are violated.44 The most recent findings of the 
Committee, in its decision on Mr. Kavalyou (Kovalev), illustrate the systemic concerns in 
the application of due process and procedural guarantees in Belarus. It found, inter alia, that 
Mr. Kavalyou had been denied adequate access to his lawyer prior to and during the trial, 
therefore a breach of fair trial, and that, before the final judgement, he had been branded a 
terrorist by the State media, thus a denial of the presumption of innocence.45 
</p>
<p>69. In the light of the ongoing deficiencies in and violations of the right to a competent, 
independent and impartial tribunal, a fair trial and the presumption of innocence, the 
Belarusian authorities should fully implement the recommendations made in the report of

</p>
<p><b> G. Arbitrary arrest and detention 
</b></p>
<p>70. Reports indicate that arbitrary detention is used as a means to intimidate, harass and 
punish individuals through arbitrary administrative and criminal detention, especially when 
they are engaged in undesired activities. The Special Rapporteur received reports from 
journalists, lawyers, human rights defenders and members of political organizations who 
claimed that they had been detained, beaten in the process and charged with speculative 
administrative and criminal offences. 
</p>
<p>71. The testimonies received highlighted the consequences of the lack of provision for 
judicial review of a decision to detain a person, which continues to be sanctioned by the 
prosecutor. While a detainee may appeal to the court against the detention, the court may 
only check the legality of the procedure, not the decision itself to detain a person.  
</p>
<p>72. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found the detention of Ales Bialiatski, 
Head of the human rights centre Viasna, to be arbitrary, in contravention of article 20, 
paragraph 1 of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and article 22 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Working Group emphasized that 
&#8220;the adequate remedy is to release Mr. Bialiatski and accord him an enforceable right to 
</p>
<p>compensation pursuant to article 9, paragraph 5&#8221; of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights.47 
</p>
<p>73. The authorities of Belarus should ensure that detention may be ordered only by a 
judge, and that pretrial detention is applied only in exceptional circumstances. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Freedom of expression and opinion 
</b></p>
<p>74. In July 2012, a lawsuit to suspend the newspapers <i>Nasha Niva</i> and <i>Narodnaya Volya</i> 
was withdrawn. Since then, no attempts have been made to shut down independent media 
outlets. Freedom of expression and opinion continues, however, to be severely restricted 
through centralized media governance, arbitrary regulations, State ownership of all major 
media, and the threat of law enforcement against unwanted journalism.  
</p>
<p>75. The Ministry of Information continued to exert its overwhelming powers to 
authorize, warn and shut down media outlets. In the period 2010&#8211;2012, the Ministry issued 
more than 180 warnings to media outlets and 105 refusals to register mass media.48  
</p>
<p>76. In 2012, 60 journalists were reported to have endured short-term detention, 
including journalists from Estonia and Sweden.49 Office searches and equipment seizures 
were found to be routinely performed during detention of journalists, despite the fact that 
international standards regard such measures as restrictions on freedom of expression.

<p>77. A worrying new trend has emerged with the Government&#8223;s increased harassment of 
Internet-based expression. In September 2012, social media activists were detained and 
pressured for passwords of their social media accounts. Law enforcement by the authorities 
repeatedly led to the persecution of persons posting photographs of themselves holding a 
portrait of Ales Bialiatski, taken on empty streets in Hrodna and Novopolotsk,50 on the 
charge of &#8220;conducting an unauthorized mass event&#8221;. On 13 February 2013, the Special 
Rapporteur communicated these cases to the authorities jointly with the Special Rapporteur 
on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and 
the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (see also section I 
below).  
</p>
<p>78. Photographs posted on the Internet were also criminalized in the still ongoing 
investigation of the videoblogger Anton Suryapin over the globally reported case of 
parachuted teddy bears with captions on free speech.51 The charge brought against Mr. 
Suryapin, who is currently banned from travelling, of &#8220;helping illegal border-crossing&#8221; 
could lead to a seven-year prison sentence. 
</p>
<p>79. The above actions by the Government not only tightened control over the Internet, 
despite the explicit recommendation of the High Commissioner, but also arbitrarily applied 
already oppressive extra-journalistic regulations to the online media. 
</p>
<p>80. Andrei Poczobut, correspondent of the Polish newspaper <i>Gazeta Wyborcza</i>, was 
charged with defamation of the President after articles that he authored were posted on 
several websites. Mr. Poczobut was forced to remain in Hrodna from June 2012 to March 
2013, when the case was dropped.52 
</p>
<p>81. Cultural rights were found to have been jeopardized in the harassment of <i>ARCHE</i>, a 
well-respected intellectual journal and forum, which resulted in the closure of the 
publication and the forced emigration of its editor, Valeriy Bulhakau.53 On 14 September 
2012, Mr. Bulhakau was detained at the launch of his book on the &#8220;Sovetization of Western 
Belarus&#8221; in Hrodna. He was accused of engagement in an illegal business for selling copies 
</p>
<p>of his book. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>82. Although article 26 of the Constitution guarantees the right to peaceful assembly, the 
legislative amendments to peaceful assembly adopted in 2011 broadened the definition of 
mass events and criminalized their organization, in violation of the law. Authorities 
regularly prohibit peaceful gatherings and use &#8220;hooliganism&#8221; or similar charges of 
misdemeanour to detain, intimidate and silence citizens. 
</p>
<p>83. One emerging concern is that individuals are sentenced to an administrative offence 
for participating in an unsanctioned event only after information has become available on 
the Internet, and after the event. An example of this was when three human rights defenders 
were charged under article 23.34 of the Administrative Code (organizing or conducting a

<p>mass event or demonstration) after they had posted photographs of themselves portraits of 
political prisoner Ales Bialiatski on the Internet, on 10 December 2012. They were charged 
nine days after the event and sentenced to an administrative fine (see also paragraph 77 
above).54 
</p>
<p>84. The systemic and ongoing nature of the denial of peaceful assembly can be seen in 
the nine cases brought by Pavel Levinov of the Belarusian Helsinki Committee,55 which 
were joined owing to their &#8220;factual and legal similarity&#8221;, given that, in each case, Mr. 
</p>
<p>Levinov had applied to the executive authorities of the town of Vitebsk for permission to 
picket.56 
</p>
<p>85. The actions of the authorities are more directed at stopping such above-mentioned 
events and holding participants liable, when they should be aimed more at facilitating them 
legally and in practice, as recalled by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association. Administrative detention should only be used in an 
exceptional manner and only for imperative reasons of security. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Freedom of association and human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>86. On 31 July 2012, a bill on the introduction of alterations and addenda to certain laws 
&#8220;on the issues of functioning of political parties and other public associations&#8221; was 
</p>
<p>submitted to the House of Representatives of the National Assembly, without any prior 
consultation with non-governmental organizations. The bill is still pending. Despite a 
number of positive norms in comparison with the current legislation, the bill would, even if 
adopted and implemented, not improve the overall situation of freedom of association in 
Belarus. 
</p>
<p>87. On 24 January 2013, decree No. 2 was adopted, introducing amendments to decree 
No. of January 1999 on the registration and liquidation procedures of non-profit 
organizations, such as institutions and associations. The decree stipulates that the 
application for State registration should confirm that the owner of the property or the head 
of the legal entity is not on the preventive register, in accordance with Law No. 453-3 on 
the prevention of offences. The grounds for &#8220;preventive registration&#8221; (a method for the 
prevention of offences), as indeed those for non-registration, are subjective and unclear.  
</p>
<p>88. In 2012, 111 new associations, four unions of public associations and 29 new 
organizational structures of political parties were registered. According to information 
given at a press conference of the Ministry of Justice, on 7 February 2013, registration was 
denied to 19 public organizations, including two political parties: Belarusian Christian 
Democracy and the Belarusian Communist Workers&#8223; Party.  
</p>
<p>89. Human rights organizations appear to be particularly subjected to scrutiny. On 9 
October 2012, the Minsk economic court ordered the closure of the association Platforma 
for allegedly missing the deadline for its tax declaration and failing to notify the tax 
inspector of its relocation, even though papers were reportedly submitted on time and no 
move had taken place. It was fined 3,000,000 roubles at the first instance, a ruling that was 
upheld on 13 November 2012 by the Minsk City Economic Court. Moreover, since 
Platforma representatives participated in the forty-seventh session of Committee against

<p>Torture in November 2011, they have faced continued harassment.57 In reply to a joint 
allegation letter by special procedures mandate holders, Belarus provided a procedural 
overview.  
</p>
<p>90. Throughout the year, the human rights centre Viasna continued to come under 
pressure. On 26 November 2012, the office was sealed by the police. The property, 
officially registered under the name of Mr. Bialiatski, was subject to confiscation by the 
court decision in 2011 brought against him for alleged tax evasion. In the Bialiatski case, 
the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that the fund raising undertaken by Mr. 
Bialiatski for the purposes of allowing the very existence of Viasna and continuation of its 
activities was in conformity with articles 20, paragraph 1 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 22 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.58 
</p>
<p>91. Moreover, the Working Group found Belarus in breach of its international 
obligations in interfering in the funding of human rights activities of non-governmental 
organizations. It stressed that the criminal law applied to Mr. Bialiatski&#8223;s case did not list 
human rights-related activities among the purposes that allow tax exemption, and that 
States parties to the Covenant were not only under a negative obligation not to interfere 
with the founding of associations or their activities, but also under a positive obligation to 
ensure and provide measures such as facilitating associations' tasks by public funding or 
allowing tax exemptions for funding received from outside the country.59 In its reply, 
Belarus considered the opinion of the Working Group to be non-authoritative, politically 
motivated and outside the bounds of its mandate.  
</p>
<p>92. Reports were received of persistent acts of intimidation and the judicial harassment 
of human rights defenders, at times resulting in prison sentences and heavy fines amid 
reports of due process irregularities in trials. 
</p>
<p>93. Joint communications highlighted concerns about the arrest and detention of human 
rights defenders, as well as allegations of judicial and administrative harassment of non-
governmental human rights organizations. Responses from the Government of Belarus to 
these communications have at times substantially responded to the issues raised.  
</p>
<p>94. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that opportunities for the exercise of freedom 
of association have not broadened, and that legislation is complex. In addition, human 
rights organizations and defenders appear to be under particular scrutiny, which raises 
concerns for their protection, safety and ability to undertake their work in a safe and secure 
environment. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>95. While the general principles of equality and non-discrimination are guaranteed in 
article 22 of the Constitution and contained in various domestic laws, there is no definition 
of discrimination in national legislation. Only article 14 of the Labour Code lists possible 
grounds for discrimination.  
</p>
<p>96. There is no court practice for hearing cases of discrimination, given that courts do 
not accept discrimination as a basis for lawsuits.  
</p>
<p>97. The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
noted an absence of a specific prohibition of discrimination against women in all areas of 
</p>
<p>  
 57 A/HRC/21/49, case no BLR 2/2012, p. 47. 
 58 A/HRC/WGAD/2012/39, para. 50. 
 59 Ibid., para. 48. </p>


<p>life in national legislation, as well as an absence of a law on gender equality or of 
comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation covering sex- and gender-based 
discrimination.60 
</p>
<p>98. Similarly, there is no anti-discrimination legislation covering persons with 
disabilities.  
</p>
<p>99. As discrimination is a cross-cutting issue that affects the enjoyment of civil, cultural, 
economic, social and political rights, the definition of discrimination is an essential first 
step in the eradication of anti-discriminatory practices. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons 
</b></p>
<p>100. Although &#8220;homosexual activity&#8221; was decriminalized in Belarus in 1994, social 
prejudice against sexual minorities and human rights defenders working on this issue 
appears to be encouraged by an openly derisive discourse from the official media and the 
authorities. In March 2013, in response to international criticism over human rights 
violations, President Lukashenko stated &#8220;it is better to be a dictator than gay&#8221;.61 Reports 
persist of instances of hate-motivated violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender (LGBT) persons,62 but rarely meet with any law enforcement action.  
</p>
<p>101. The situation of the rights to freedom of assembly and of association is particularly 
critical for LGBT persons. Reportedly, no LGBT public events or associations were 
authorized during the period under review.63 Recently, LGBT persons reported a significant 
deterioration in their situation. The organization GayBelarus sought registration with the 
Ministry of Justice as the human rights centre &#8220;Lambda&#8221;, producing more than the required 
</p>
<p>70 signatures of founding members. On 8 February 2013, Lambda was denied registration 
on the grounds that its charter did not provide appropriately for youth socialization and all-
round development.64 Subsequently, 67 of the 71 founding members, living in 12 different 
cities in Belarus, were reportedly summoned by drug or traffic police for a &#8220;conversation&#8221;. 
Those who refused were visited by the police, at home or at work, while &#8220;notifications&#8221; 
</p>
<p>were sent to their workplace.  
</p>
<p>102. The police also repeatedly raided LGBT clubs in Minsk and Vitebsk,65 of which 
eight were registered in January and February 2013.66 The raids were reportedly 
intimidating and degrading, with people lined up, body searched and interrogated about 
their sexual habits.67

<p><b> M. Labour rights and trade unions  
</b></p>
<p>103. Discriminative disadvantaging and intimidation of independent trade unions have 
continued, especially in the large State-owned sector. Belarus remains excluded from the 
trade preferences system of the European Union because of systematic violations, 
registered by the International Labour Organization (ILO), of workers&#8223; freedom of 
</p>
<p>association and the right to collective bargaining. In November 2012, ILO found that the 
Government of Belarus still failed to respond to its recommendations.68 No improvement 
has been witnessed in the laws and practices impeding the registration of labour 
organizations outside the structures of the Federation of Trade Unions of Belarus.  
</p>
<p>104. The ILO Committee on the Freedom of Association noted several allegations of 
administrative and physical harassments of unionists. Complaints of continuing interference 
and anti-union pressure by the authorities were submitted by three unions.69 The Committee 
registered allegations of arrest and detention, as well as beatings of trade union leaders and 
members, the search of the regional office of the Radio and Electronic Workers Union in 
Brest, and seizure of its computers, documents and seal. In the Gomel and Mogilev regions, 
more than 50 people reportedly lost their jobs owing to their independent trade union 
activism. 
</p>
<p>105. ILO regards the prohibition of forced and child labour as the cornerstone of 
international labour law. Officials in Belarus continue, however, to organize <i>subbotniks</i>, or 
unpaid weekend work (a traditional Soviet-era method of workforce mobilization) and 
unpaid agricultural work mostly required of students. Despite the fact that regulations 
relating to <i>subbotniks</i> specify that the work should be voluntary, employees have to 
perform either their regular work duties or tasks set by local executive authorities, such as 
cleaning the streets. Their salaries are calculated, but all earnings are transferred to funds 
for various public projects, such as the construction of a library in Minsk, a new museum 
dedicated to the Second World War or a nuclear power plant.70  
</p>
<p>106. On 7 December 2012, President Lukashenka signed decree No. 9 on additional 
measures for the development of the wood processing industry. The new decree effectively 
takes away the right of workers in the wood processing industry to freely leave their jobs. 
The companies participating in the State-funded modernization project are obliged to pay 
benefits to their workers above and beyond their salaries. According to the new decree, 
employees wishing to leave the company against the will of their employers can be forced 
to either pay back the benefits or required to stay until the required amount has been 
withdrawn from their salaries. Currently, the decree affects fewer than 20,000 employees in 
Belarus.  
</p>
<p>107. When visiting the woodworking company OAO Mogilevdrev on 13 December 
2012, the President commented that the essence of decree No. 9 was &#8220;forced labour&#8221;, 
stating that &#8220;they cannot quit without your authorization; those who do quit will have to do 
</p>
<p>forced labour here.&#8221;71 In this way, decree No. 9 can be considered in violation of the core 
standards for employees' rights, especially the ILO Conventions concerning Forced or

<p>Compulsory Labour, 1930 (No. 29), the Abolition of Forced Labour, 1957 (No. 105) and 
Employment Policy, 1964 (No. 122). It also contradicts article 8.3 (a) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 41 (4) of the Constitution, both of which 
prohibit forced labour other than for punishment decided by a court or in a state of 
emergency. 
</p>
<p><b> N. Elections 
</b></p>
<p>108. Parliamentary elections were held on 23 September 2012. Most international 
observers regarded the polling as inconsistent with basic standards for competitive, free and 
fair elections. The OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights stated that 
Belarus had not respected its &#8220;OSCE commitments, including citizens&#8223; rights to associate, 
to stand as candidates and to express themselves freely&#8221;.72 The CIS election observation 
mission, however, deemed the elections &#8220;to be in compliance with universally accepted 
</p>
<p>democratic norms and national legislation&#8221;.73  
</p>
<p>109. Two political parties boycotted the elections, while two others withdrew their 
candidates, citing the continued imprisonment of individuals on political grounds, the 
limited role of parliament and the low level of confidence in the electoral process. A total of 
293 candidates contested 110 seats. Sixteen were elected unopposed. None of the elected 
candidates represented the opposition. The new House of Representatives, just like the 
previous one, comprised representatives of the three parties supporting the President. 
</p>
<p>110. In a welcome improvement over the parliamentary elections held in 2008, the 
number of party political candidates and civil election commission members increased 
significantly. For the first time, political parties were able to nominate candidates in all 
constituencies. At the counting of votes, however, representatives of opposition political 
parties accounted for less than 1 per cent of the electoral commissions, the selection of 
which remained the prerogative of the local executive branch.74 
</p>
<p>111. The amendments made in 2011 to the laws on political parties, mass events and the 
Criminal Code restricted public calls to conduct meetings, rallies and demonstrations 
during the electoral campaign. Some prominent political figures that may have played a 
role in the contest were not eligible to register owing either to the fact that they were 
currently imprisoned or had been so in the past. The field of contestants was further 
restricted by arbitrary administrative actions. The central election commission disqualified 
candidates on the basis of minor inaccuracies. In total, one in four nominees was not 
registered. 
</p>
<p>112. An honest count, in compliance with the requirements described in paragraph 7.4 of 
the OSCE Copenhagen Document, could not be guaranteed, either because observers were 
not given a meaningful opportunity to observe the count or because of the lack of properly 
delineated counting procedures. Transparency of the results was denied by the fact that the

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations  
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>The Special Rapporteur concludes that there has only been scant progress in 
the implementation of recommendations made by the High Commissioner in her 
</b></p>
<p><b>report to the Human Rights Council in 2012.</b>76<b> He welcomes the initiatives to establish 
</b></p>
<p><b>a parliamentary working group on the death penalty and a national human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>institution in line with the Paris Principles, which he hopes will result in the prompt 
</b></p>
<p><b>fulfilment of recommendations in both these areas. He urges the Government to 
</b></p>
<p><b>increase its efforts to implement comprehensively all the recommendations made by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Nations human rights mechanisms.  
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Through the consultations held during the period under review, the Special 
Rapporteur views the system of governance </b>&#8211;<b> decrees, legislation, policy and practice 
</b></p>
<p>&#8211;<b> as impeding the realization of the constitutional guarantees for the protection of 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights for all those who live in Belarus. The situation of human rights </b>&#8211;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>precarious in general, grave in certain areas </b>&#8211;<b> is clearly affected by the domination of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the executive branch over the legislative and the judiciary.  
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The information gathered from primary sources suggests the existence of 
systemic and systematic violations of human rights, especially in the areas of due 
</b></p>
<p><b>process, fair trial, and torture. The effective denial reported of the full enjoyment of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the freedoms of expression and opinion, of peaceful assembly and of association is in 
</b></p>
<p><b>itself indicative of the state of human rights in Belarus, as these rights are so often the 
</b></p>
<p><b>pathway along which other civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights are 
</b></p>
<p><b>exercised. 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The situation for those deprived of their liberty, particularly well-known 
political prisoners, is of deep concern. Their conditions of detention, combined with 
</b></p>
<p><b>the allegations of physical and psychological pressure that they facie, can be seen as 
</b></p>
<p><b>amounting to ill-treatment or even torture.  
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>The Special Rapporteur is grateful to all those who provided detailed first-hand 
information for his assessment. He regrets the fact that the Government did not avail 
</b></p>
<p><b>itself of this opportunity. He again reiterates his readiness to develop an incremental 
</b></p>
<p><b>approach to engagement with the Government, starting with issues that both 
</b></p>
<p><b>acknowledge as human rights concerns.  
</b></p>
<p>118. <b>The Special Rapporteur stands ready to continue to offer his support to civil 
society, in accordance with his mandate, and acknowledges their spirit and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment to the protection of human rights for all. 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Belarus review 
and fully implement the recommendations made by the High Commissioner in her 
</b></p>
<p><b>report. In addition, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
