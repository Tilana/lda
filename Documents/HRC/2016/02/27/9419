 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p>This third report by the independent expert<b> </b>on the question of human rights and extreme 
poverty builds upon his two earlier reports on extreme poverty as well as his mission report on 
extreme poverty conditions in the United States, and brings together the observations of the 
group of experts, which met in Geneva at a Workshop on Extreme Poverty on 23 and 
24 February 2007. 
</p>
<p>In the present report, the independent expert further explores the link between human 
rights and extreme poverty by outlining the following three considerations that contribute to the 
distinct value added of viewing extreme poverty in terms of violation or denial of human rights. 
</p>
<p>In Section 1, the independent expert builds on the existing consensus within the 
international community on the multidimensionality of poverty, and analyses the different 
characteristics of the conditions of extreme poverty, namely income poverty, human 
development poverty and social exclusion, so that they can be linked to the conditions of 
deprivation of human rights.  
</p>
<p>Section 2 describes these core characteristics in a manner aimed at achieving an 
operational definition of the notion of extreme poverty, so that a process of implementation, 
progress-mapping and monitoring, can be developed in a comprehensive manner. The 
independent expert further emphasizes the advantage of viewing the eradication of extreme 
poverty as a human rights entitlement in itself, rather than a mere claim towards the 
implementation of measures to eradicate poverty, based on the instrumental role of human rights. 
</p>
<p>Finally, in section 3, the independent expert looks at some of the policy experiences of 
different countries in a context specific environment, in order to identify and enhance the distinct 
value added of implementing policies in a human rights framework.

<p>The independent expert is grateful for the research assistance provided by Avani Kapur,

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Commission on Human Rights established the mandate of the independent expert on 
the question of human rights and extreme poverty at its fifty-fourth session, in 
resolution 1998/25. At its sixtieth session, in resolution 2004/23, the Commission extended the 
mandate for two years and appointed Mr. Arjun Sengupta (India) as the new mandate holder. In 
resolution 2005/16 the Commission reconfirmed the mandate of the independent expert and 
further invited him to &#8220;pay special attention to the concrete experiences of involvement of people 
living in extreme poverty in the political decision-making and social processes&#8221; and &#8220;to continue 
to focus on the various aspects of the link between human rights and extreme poverty&#8221;. The 
present report is submitted in accordance with Human Rights Council decision 1/102.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. The third report on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights by the independent expert, builds 
upon his two earlier reports on the subject submitted to the Human Rights Commission in 2005 
and 2006, as well as on his mission report on extreme poverty conditions in the United States, 
considered by the Commission last year. This third report also takes into account the 
observations of the group of experts, which met in Geneva at a workshop on 23 and 
24 February 2007 to consider the different aspects of the approach of the Independent Expert on 
Human Rights and Extreme Poverty.<b>1</b>  
</p>
<p>3. Three considerations motivated the independent expert&#8217;s approach to the problem of 
extreme poverty and human rights. First, he wished to analyse the different characteristics of the 
conditions of extreme poverty, so that they can be linked to the conditions of deprivation of 
human rights. This approach was meant to facilitate the acceptance by the international 
community of States that the eradication of extreme poverty could be viewed as a human rights 
entitlement by the national and international authorities, as well as multilateral institutions. To 
that end, a consensus has to be developed not only on the core characteristics of extreme poverty, 
but also, on how to describe them in an operational manner, as well as on the feasibility of the 
policies that can eradicate those conditions.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>4. The second consideration was to describe the core contents of extreme poverty in a manner 
that would permit the monitoring of improvement or deterioration of conditions, and the 
identification of policies to remove the specific conditions of extreme poverty and to establish 
indicators to measure progress or failure of the process of eradication. In other words, the 
operational definition of extreme poverty should be amenable to a process of monitoring the 
progress of the implementation of policies, in as an objective a manner as possible, with the help 
of specific indicators. 
</p>
<p>5. The third consideration was to examine some of the policy experiences of different 
countries and identify the manner by which the implementation of those policies could be 
improved within a human rights framework. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE MULTIDIMENSIONALITY OF POVERTY 
</b></p>
<p>6. To facilitate the development of a consensus around the concept of poverty and extreme 
poverty, the independent expert built upon the existing consensus in the international community 
on the multidimensionality of poverty. The international community had affirmed, in virtually all 
international forums, that poverty was not only confined to economic deprivation, but extended 
to social, cultural and political deprivation as well. While growth in gross national product 
(GNP) was the goal of development in the 1950&#8217;s and 1960&#8217;s, the first Human Development 
Report (1990) of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) stated that promoting 
individual development has to be reckoned in terms of human development which it defined as 
&#8220;the process of widening people&#8217;s choices and the level of their achieved well-being&#8221;. In this 
context, poverty implied severe deprivation of human development. To operationalize this 
notion, the UNDP report introduced a Human Development Index (HDI), based on the 
availability of data in different countries, which captured three essential components of human 
rights namely longevity, knowledge and basic income for a decent living standard, as a first 
approximation to measuring human development as a whole. Longevity and knowledge refer to 
forms of human capabilities, and income is a proxy measure for the choices people have in 
putting their capabilities to use. This methodology was a major innovation, although economists 
such as Arthur Lewis had also previously emphasized the instrumental role of income growth, 
that not only increases wealth but also increases the range of human choice because it gives man 
greater control over his environment, and thereby increases his freedom.<b>2</b> The Human 
Development Report clearly emphasized the need for policies specifically aimed at the 
expansion of human capabilities, which the instrumentality of income growth alone could not 
capture. 
</p>
<p>7. The Copenhagen Declaration of the World Summit for Social Development in 1995 clearly 
stated, that &#8220;Poverty has various manifestations, including lack of income and productive 
resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihood; hunger and malnutrition; ill-health; 
minimum and lack of access to education and other basic services increase morbidity and 
mortality from illness; homelessness and inadequate housing; unsafe environment; and social 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>domination and exclusion&#8221;.
<b>3
</b> It further stated that, &#8220;Absolute poverty is a condition characterized 
</p>
<p>by severe deprivation of basic human needs, including food, safe drinking water, sanitation 
facilities, health, shelter, education and information. It depends not only on income but also 
access to social services.&#8221;<b>4</b> This characterization of poverty was reiterated in several international 
conferences such as the World Food Summit in Rome in 1966, the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration of 2000 and the World Summit on Sustainable Development in 2002. 
</p>
<p>8. In line with this approach, the independent expert defined poverty, as a composite of 
income poverty, human development poverty and social exclusion, and extreme poverty, as the 
extreme form of these three different dimensions of poverty. People who suffer from income 
poverty are those who have a dispensable income or expenditure below an agreed level that can 
be considered to be the minimum required for leading a sustainable life.<b>5</b> People suffering from 
human development poverty were regarded as those who lacked access to those certain basic 
goods and services that make it possible to lead a meaningful life. As it may not be possible to 
capture all the aspects of human development, a few essential components of human 
development poverty, such as longevity, the availability and access to food and nutrition, basic 
education or shelters, of minimal standards, may be chosen by consensus in a society and on the 
basis of the availability of data and information. Social exclusion would refer to the basic 
security of the individual&#8217;s ability to lead an adequate social existence, depending on the 
characteristics of the society in which he lives and the structure of relationships. 
</p>
<p>9. It is recognized that these three dimensions of poverty are often interdependent but are not 
perfectly correlated to each other. They represent different aspects of the poverty phenomenon 
and would require different sets of policies to address them. A composite of these characteristics 
would imply a union of these three sets of poor people, those who are either income poor or 
human development poor or socially excluded, without overlaps, to avoid double counting. This 
would include, in addition to those people suffering from all three types of poverty, those who 
suffer from any of them. An alternative definition of poverty would be the intersection of these

</b>  This method of measuring income poverty is known as &#8220;headcount ratio&#8221;, which is the 
</p>
<p>proportion of people below the poverty line and is a simpler measure for which now data has 
been collected for most developing countries. But this is not necessarily the best measure of 
income poverty because, it does not capture the average shortfall of income of the poor from the 
poverty line nor the distribution of income among the poor. Both these notions may be necessary 
in order to devise a policy to solve the problems of the poorest in any anti-poor programme. 
Where data is available, these other indicators may be used in addition to the &#8220;headcount ratio&#8221;, 
to appropriately attack income poverty. However, we have chosen the usual headcount ratio as 
an indicator of income poverty, as a first approximation of this exercise. See A. Sen (1995) 
<i>Inequality Re-examined</i>, Oxford, pp. 102-116.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>three sets, that is, only those people who suffer from all the three dimensions of poverty. This 
would cover a much smaller number of poor people than that in the concept of the union of these 
three poverty sets. 
</p>
<p>10. Following this approach, extreme poverty can be regarded as a union of sets of people who 
are extremely income poor, extremely human development poor and extremely socially 
excluded. What will be considered as the most extreme form of poverty among them would be 
determined by social consensus, and thus may vary from one country to another. The 
internationally accepted definition of extreme poverty is that of having to live on an income of 
less than US$ 1 a day in terms of purchasing power parity. However, many developing countries 
have adopted a definition of extreme poverty which is at a much lower level. Similarly, human 
development poverty and social exclusion will have to be contextually defined, depending on the 
characteristics of each country&#8217;s social and economic structure. The definitions of poverty and 
extreme poverty mentioned above have two main advantages. First, they make it possible to 
establish indicators for these forms of poverty on the basis of existing data. Indeed, considerable 
progress has been made in the methodology of developing such indicators that not only captures 
the outcomes but also the processes, and not only the availability of goods and services, but also 
access to them. This progress in the development of indicators is very significant as it makes it 
possible to interpret results in terms of human rights deprivation that depend not only on the 
outcomes of activities, but also on the processes through which these outcomes are achieved. 
</p>
<p>11. The second advantage of this approach is its ability to enhance, in a political sense, a social 
consensus in a country that would enable the State and other social actors to accept the 
responsibility of adopting policies to eradicate poverty. Any society would recognize that 
poverty is something repugnant and unacceptable because it represents denial of human dignity. 
However, in order to make the eradication of poverty a human rights entitlement, there has to be 
a categorization of the social forces that would be prepared to make the necessary sacrifices by 
redistributing resources or by mobilizing special services and targeted programmes. The 
definition of extreme poverty may be sensitive to the requirement of developing a social 
consensus. However desirable it may be that the society take care of all the poor people in its 
country, it may be prudent to move step by step, to start by identifying the groups of people 
recognized as being extremely poor, i.e., those suffering from extreme forms of income poverty, 
human development poverty and social exclusion, to put in place appropriate policies to 
eradicate poverty and to mobilize institutional mechanisms to implement them. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CORE CHARACTERISTICS OF POVERTY 
</b></p>
<p>12. One of the experts who participated in the above-mentioned workshop on human rights 
and extreme poverty suggested that poverty should be taken simply as a failure of &#8220;basic 
capabilities&#8221;, and extreme poverty as severe failure of &#8220;basic capabilities&#8221;. Income poverty has 
no independent role in this framework, where poverty should be taken as a deprivation of such 
elemental freedoms as freedom from hunger, from avoidable diseases and premature mortality 
and from the curse of ignorance and illiteracy. This has been the main approach of the expert&#8217;s 
report on the Draft Guidelines on a Human Rights Approach to Poverty Reduction Strategies 
prepared for OHCHR in 2002. Some intensive debates on this issue took place in the workshop, 
and since this question frequently arises in different international forums, it may be useful to 
consider these arguments carefully. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>13. The capability approach was formulated by Amartya Sen in his books &#8220;Commodities and 
Capabilities&#8221;,<b>6</b> and &#8220;Inequality Re-examined&#8221;<b>7</b> as an alternative to the traditional income 
approach. The capability approach to social welfare is based on the idea that &#8220;living may be seen 
as consistent of a set of interrelated &#8216;functionings&#8217; consisting of &#8216;beings and doings&#8217;, such as 
being adequately nourished, avoiding premature mortality or simply being happy, as examples of 
functionings&#8221;. A person&#8217;s set of being is understood as a vector of functioning. In choosing what 
kind of life to live, a person chooses among such vectors. The set of such feasible vectors for any 
person is that person&#8217;s capability set; a capability set represents a person&#8217;s opportunities to 
achieve well-being. One may also say that it represents a person&#8217;s freedom.<b>8</b> It is important to 
note that Sen&#8217;s &#8220;Notion of Functioning&#8221; is derived, yet quite distinct from commodities. It is not 
just having food but the way that food is used and accessed that can determine the function of 
being adequately nourished. However, freedom is not identified within the set of feasible vectors 
of functioning, i.e., the capability set. There is no doubt that Sen&#8217;s approach has opened up a 
wide vista for analysing the conditions of the well-being of the poor and also of poverty. Sen&#8217;s 
&#8220;Notion of Capability as Freedom&#8221; brings it close to the human rights approach that makes 
selected freedoms a socially accepted human rights entitlement. In that sense, the proposition 
that poverty is the deprivation of basic capabilities is perfectly justified and links in quite a 
straightforward manner to the deprivation of certain basic freedoms which have now been 
accepted as human rights such as the right to food, the right to health, the right to education and 
the right to an adequate standard of living. This approach is perfectly consistent with the 
approach adopted by the Independent Expert on Extreme Poverty. 
</p>
<p>14. However, the problem with the capability approach lies in putting it into operation. 
Robeyns (2000) notes that despite the fact that Sen published &#8220;Commodities and Capabilities&#8221; as 
early as 1985, the number of empirical applications has been quite limited, mainly because it is 
hard to estimate and value functionings.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>15. Some differences arose in the Workshop regarding the inclusion of the notion of social 
exclusion in the definition of poverty. One European expert argued that adding social exclusion 
to the definition of extreme poverty, which has many different dimensions, might make it very 
difficult to estimate, since 90 per cent of any population can be regarded as excluded in one 
sense or another, especially if one included exclusion from the labour market, exclusion from 
basic services and social relations; moreover, there is currently no methodology to operationalize 
the concept on the basis of available statistics. This view was opposed by others who considered

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that the inclusion of social exclusion in the definition would shift the notion of extreme poverty 
to a holistic and more political level, and thus would serve to emphasize the political dimension 
of extreme poverty. Another expert underlined that social exclusion is a central element of 
extreme poverty in developed countries, where basic social services exist but do not reach the 
extremely poor due to their exclusion.  
</p>
<p>16. The independent expert considered that the inclusion of the notion of social exclusion in 
the definition of extreme poverty has a distinct value added because deprivation resulting from 
social exclusion may be quite different from deprivation of income and of human development. 
Measuring social exclusion may be difficult because it will have to focus on specific failures and 
social relations, which may be both context-specific and inter-temporal in nature. However, the 
difficulties in measuring social exclusion, should not lead to its omission from the notion of 
poverty, because it introduces a different dimension to the problem. Several attempts have been 
made in different countries of the European Union, notably Belgium and the United Kingdom, to 
estimate social exclusion, and to establish a relationship between social exclusion and other 
aspects of poverty which lead to the denial of basic freedoms or of security of different people. 
In many developing countries, statistics do exist of the number of people who are socially 
marginalized, excluded or ostracized as well as of their living conditions. In India, a substantial 
debate is taking place on the living conditions of people belonging to the lower castes and tribes 
who are socially excluded, and whether affirmative action treatment by the Government should 
be extended to all such people or be confined to those among them who are income poor. The 
independent expert maintained the view that accepting that people who are socially excluded are 
suffering from extreme poverty would add substantial value to the discourse in both developed 
and developing countries.  
</p>
<p>17. An exchange of views took place regarding the independent expert&#8217;s rationale of focusing 
on extreme poverty as constituting a deprivation of human rights, since this might be more 
politically acceptable to the authorities of different countries and therefore would strengthen the 
call for obligations to eradicate those conditions. One opinion was that poverty and extreme 
poverty are in a &#8220;continuum of scale&#8221; and the policies aimed at the removal of extreme poverty 
would be quite similar to those needed to eradicate poverty as such. This of course relates to 
empirical exercises of poverty eradication, for which policies have to be context-specific. Often 
the conditions of extreme poverty could be tackled more effectively through a limited number of 
policy instruments, than by applying the whole gamut of policies needed for the removal of 
poverty. Another argument suggested that the notion of extreme poverty as the intersection of 
income poverty, human development poverty and social exclusion might not always end up 
effectively benefiting the bottom rung of the poor. A preferred version, as indicated in the 
independent expert&#8217;s second report on extreme poverty,<b>10</b> is first to identify subsets of people 
suffering from the extreme forms of income poverty, human development poverty and social 
exclusion, by adopting a threshold determined by consensus. The union of these subsets of the 
extremely income poor, human development poor and socially excluded could then 
demonstrably deal with the most vulnerable sections of the population. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  E/CN.4/2006/43. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>18. Another expert believed that broadening the definition of extreme poverty could bring 
more interest groups into a possible coalition. This point was contested on the familiar grounds 
of its feasibility and the concern that vested interests for which state cooperation might be more 
desirable, could easily block reforms. A glaring example of such a problem in the exercise of 
social choice could be witnessed in the United States where there is &#8220;conflict between 
majoritarian public preference for policies that use unemployment to combat inflation, and the 
obligations of the Government to secure the right to work&#8221;.<b>11</b> This clearly demonstrates the 
possibility of conflict between efficiency maximization policies and human rights protection as 
public policy goals in a market economy.<b>12</b> Another major study by Peter Townsend with 
David Gordon for DFID entitled &#8220;The Extent and Nature of &#8216;Absolute&#8217; Poverty&#8221;, (2003), that 
followed upon the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen in 1995, recognized 
the difference between absolute (extreme) notions of poverty and overall poverty, and developed 
indicators of severe deprivation of human needs e.g. food, drinking water, sanitation, health, 
education and information. Data from 74 countries surveyed demonstrated that it is possible to 
design policies that first tackle those extreme/severe deprivation problems. Jos&#233; Bengoa&#8217;s<b> </b>final 
report to the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights<b>13</b> also 
emphasizes the need to give priority to those most in need in policies for extreme poverty 
eradication. While the independent expert&#8217;s approach by no means guarantees that disagreements 
will not arise between social groups as to the relevant elements of extreme poverty, most experts 
agreed that narrowing down the universe of the poor, to the extremely poor would most likely 
achieve greater political acceptance. In his second report, the independent expert drew attention 
to the Rawlsian principle of justice, which considers taking care of the most vulnerable segments 
of the society, summarizing it as &#8220;people suffering from extreme poverty would then be a small 
portion of the total number of people who are suffering from all forms of poverty, and the 
severity of conditions of poverty would be apparent to every member of society, inducing them 
to take action to eradicate those conditions&#8221;.<b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>19. In this situation, poverty reduction would receive a higher political priority not only from 
the national authorities but also from the international community thus increasing the possibility 
of expanding development aid as well as obtaining the participation of the poor in the design and 
implementation of anti-poverty measures. 
</p>
<p>20. The workshop addressed the issues raised by the independent expert as to whether extreme 
poverty, in itself, is a condition caused by a human rights violation or whether extreme poverty 
itself can be described as a violation of human rights. In the first view, human rights play an 
instrumental role in the creation of conditions of well-being for the rights-holders, which may

 <p> 
</p>
<p>lead to eradication of extreme poverty. In his first report,
<b>15
</b></p>
<p> the independent expert stated, &#8220;if the 
obligation of poverty eradication is derived from the instrumental role of human rights, then even 
if the latter are realized, there may be other factors or instrumental variables that prevent poverty 
eradication, and human rights obligations for state agencies and the international community 
would not necessarily entail policies to tackle those other instrumental variables&#8221;. However, if 
the eradication of poverty is itself seen as a human rights entitlement, the state agencies and the 
international community would have the obligation to adopt appropriate policies to remove 
extreme poverty. This would include not only the enforcement of the relevant human rights 
instruments already recognized, but also, other causes and variables that contribute to the 
creation of extreme poverty. As several experts pointed out, the poverty reduction programme 
would then be not a matter of charity but of duty, including the possibility to claim rights 
through the legal system and courts. It would make a government&#8217;s intervention &#8220;justiciable&#8221;, in 
that &#8220;violation&#8221; of this right would have a potential cost for the government, as cases could be 
taken to courts. One expert, giving the consequentialist argument of the value addition of the 
human rights approach, stated that when the interventions involved in the application of 
instruments to reduce poverty are opposed by the rich, the adoption of extreme poverty as a 
denial or violation of human rights would help to overcome their resistance (a) by increasing the 
cost to the rich and powerful of opposing those interventions, thereby implying a change in 
opportunity sets; and (b) by convincing the rich of the desirability of reduction in the incidence 
of poverty, implying a change in the preference of the rich. Countries may adopt policies to 
resolve internal conflicts or to reduce extreme poverty, as would be required by an international 
convention, without becoming parties. However, the peer group effect may be a very relevant 
consideration for many countries as they would not wish to be isolated as the only country not 
having ratified such a convention. In fact, the value added to poverty reduction of the existence 
of an international convention increases as a function of the importance of peer group pressures, 
and of the strength of its monitoring and &#8220;naming and shaming&#8221; provisions upon parties. 
</p>
<p>21. The acceptance of extreme poverty as a denial of human rights would thus create an 
obligation for a society to act, provided that the fulfilment of those obligations is feasible. It 
should be possible to identify the person and institution who as duty-bearers can take actions to 
fulfil these obligations. In this context a &#8220;violator&#8221; would be anyone who could have taken such 
action but failed to do so, or who has acted in a manner that engenders or worsens extreme 
poverty. Consequently, this notion of extreme poverty would force duty-bearers to adopt 
adequate anti-poverty policies.  
</p>
<p>22. In identifying the violator, however, it is necessary to closely examine the policies for 
eradicating poverty. Certain policies can be described as the &#8220;technical type&#8221; - for example 
whether countries should have an employment-oriented policy focus, or have a minimum wages 
law and a policy on how they should reallocate public expenditure. The other type of policies 
may be called &#8220;institutional&#8221;, dealing with the creation of appropriate institutions for 
formulating, monitoring and implementing the policies. The technical aspects of pro-poor 
policies are unlikely to differ much whether or not poverty is conceptually linked to human 
rights. The real difference would lie in the institutional aspect. The independent expert suggested 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  See E/CN.4/2005/49, p. 10, para. 28. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>in his second report
<b>16
</b></p>
<p> that concrete programmes of action that can alleviate poverty must first be 
identified, then they must first be proven to be not only technically feasible but also 
institutionally implementable, with some minor, but well-specified processes of institutional and 
legal reforms, supported by international assistance, both in terms of resources and rules and 
procedures of international transactions. 
</p>
<p>23. The most important feature of this institutional framework within which the removal of 
poverty is seen as a denial of human rights, would be that the institutions would ensure 
accountability of duty-bearers and would foster effective participation of rights-holders in the 
formulation, implementation and monitoring of policies. The right to participate in policy 
processes is an essential part of the process aspect of the human rights approach and a value in 
itself as recognized by the independent expert in his earlier report on the Right to 
Development.<b>17</b> Indeed he had referred to the concept of the right to development, that was 
recognized in international human rights law through the adoption of the Declaration of the 
Right to Development of 1986 and reiterated by international consensus in the Vienna 
Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993. &#8220;The right to development is a right to a process 
of improvement of well-being when all fundamental freedoms and human rights are realized.&#8221;<b>18</b> 
That process of progressive realization of this right must be based on the principles of equity and 
non-discrimination, as well as participation, accountability and transparency. In that sense, the 
condition of extreme poverty can be considered as the denial or violation of the right to 
development for a group of people identified as poor by society.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>24. During the above-mentioned workshop, there was an interesting discussion on the 
applicability of the notion of violation to the international community, once a human right is 
recognized as entailing both national and international obligations. The independent expert had 
earlier invoked the concept of &#8220;perfect and imperfect obligation&#8221;; perfect obligations are 
associated with duties that have a direct impact on the exercise of the right, while imperfect 
obligations have an indirect impact, contingent upon other duty-holders carrying out their 
obligations. The direct duties relate to perfect obligation and if those duties are not performed the 
duty-bearers may be regarded as a &#8220;violator&#8221; even if when performed, the duties may not, on 
their own, completely solve the problems of poverty. All duties are related to the outcome with a 
probability, as there is no certainty that any policy will always produce the intended result. 
Direct duties are those that if not performed, there is a high likelihood that the results would not 
be achieved, but whose impact could be clearly attributed to a duty-bearer responsible for 
contributing to the fulfilment of the objective. Indirect duties, however, are in the nature of 
imperfect obligations as their impact on the final outcome is very much dependent upon the 
activities of other agents, so that the non-fulfilment of the result, cannot be attributed to the 
non-performance of a specific duty-holder. In this sense, the obligations of the international

 <p> 
</p>
<p>community begin as imperfect obligations, because, even when the international community 
decides to act in a certain manner, if the state authorities and other local actors do not perform, 
the result may not be achieved. For instance, international agreements to liberalize trade as a 
means of stimulating economic growth may not reduce poverty unless there is a mechanism to 
redistribute the gains from such trade to poor people who may not have been able to draw benefit 
from the expanded trading opportunities. The international community still has the duty or 
imperfect obligation to pursue trade liberalization so as to provide such opportunities, but cannot 
guarantee that the poorer states will derive gains, nor that Governments will adopt the necessary 
measures to ensure that the benefits derived from expanded trade are shared by the poor. The 
non-fulfilment of poverty eradication cannot be regarded as a violation of the obligations of the 
international community. 
</p>
<p>25. However, if the state authorities adopt appropriate policies of redistribution of the 
increased income and adopt policies for removing poverty, the imperfect obligation of the 
international community would be converted into a perfect obligation, as there would be a very 
high likelihood that the conditions of poverty could not be removed in the absence of such trade 
liberalization. 
</p>
<p>26. One view expressed was that the international community should be held responsible for 
the violation of a right if it refuses to change the procedure of international transactions that 
create conditions of deprivation of the right, irrespective of whether the state authorities adopted 
the right policy. For example, an international regime that results in the increase of the cost of 
essential drugs would be considered as a direct violation of its obligations, because whether or 
not the state authorities adopt any policy, this increase would make it very difficult to protect the 
health of the poor in developing countries. 
</p>
<p>27. Indeed, Thomas Pogge in his book entitled &#8220;World Poverty and Human Rights&#8221; (2002) 
held the international community fully responsible for maintaining the rules and procedures of 
the international financial, trade and intellectual property regime, which worked against the 
developing countries, especially the conditions of the poorest amongst them. According to his 
calculation, a transfer of less than 1 per cent of the world income, most of which is accounted for 
by the industrial countries, would have been sufficient to abolish poverty throughout the world. 
The richer countries spend more than that amount in many other areas including armament and 
wasteful consumption. If eradicating poverty were accepted as a human right entitlement, their 
inability to mobilize a fraction of that amount for the purpose of taking care of the world&#8217;s 
poorest would be tantamount to their violating human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>IV.  PROGRAMMES FOR ERADICATING EXTREME POVERTY 
</b></p>
<p>28. In his previous two reports and his mission report on extreme poverty conditions in the 
United States, the independent expert had demonstrated various ways in which feasible policies 
can be designed and implemented to eradicate extreme poverty in different parts of the world. In 
fact, many of the programmes adopted in different countries including those carried out in 
collaboration with donor countries and multilateral agencies, have developed elements that have 
gone quite far towards adopting a rights-based approach for eradicating poverty. It would be 
useful to carry out a systematic survey of all such practical applications and policies for 
eradicating poverty, with the view to analysing the successes and failures in terms of human 
rights achievements. This would make it possible then to demonstrate how a human rights-based </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>approach to this problem would have had a superior impact, if it was designed and implemented 
in conformity with human rights norms. The independent expert analysed in depth some of these 
policies by examining the prevailing conditions in different countries, in recognition that both 
the policies and their results would be invariably context specific. If other analysts from different 
institutions and countries conducted similar exercises, it should be possible to build up a 
portfolio of case studies enabling a broad generalization to be made. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Poverty reduction in Africa 
</b></p>
<p>29. In the African Continent, considerable experience has been accumulated with the 
implementation of poverty reduction strategies initiated by the International Monetary Fund 
(IMF) and the World Bank. Such strategies were based on the recognition that engineering 
economic growth through structural adjustment programmes may exacerbate inequality and 
poverty, and in the absence of conscious efforts to mitigate these side effects, social resentment 
and popular discontent may increase to the extent that it negatively impacts on the growth 
process. Poverty reduction strategies incorporated in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) 
are meant to counter this tendency. There are usually three main features of all PRSPs, namely 
macroeconomic reforms and trade liberalization in order to stimulate economic growth; the 
redirection of social policy towards the provision of welfare services to the poor and the 
vulnerable and the emphasis on ownership and popular participation. The IMF estimated that 
GDP growth in PRSP countries averages nearly 5 per cent since the mid-1990s, a marked 
improvement over the performance between 1980 and 1995, outpacing the growth in non-PRSP 
countries. Living standards as reflected in the rate of growth of per capita income, which 
averaged 0 per cent in PRSP countries over the 1980s, and early 1990s, have risen nearly 
2.5 per cent per annum since the mid-1990s. Poverty reduction standard as a percentage of 
GDP has been rising more rapidly in Africa than in other regions and is projected to climb 
to 8.5 per cent compared to 2.5 per cent in non-African countries. In terms of real social welfare 
impact, country statistics show that PRSPs are making a visible difference. In Uganda, for 
example the budgetary allocation for primary education has increased from 19.8 per cent of the 
budget in 1994-1995, to 26.8 per cent at present; while primary school enrolment increased 
from 5.3 million in 1997 and is projected to rise to 7 million in 2010. In Tanzania, basic 
education was allocated an additional 52 per cent in the 2000-2003 budgets, during which net 
enrolments increased from 57 per cent to 85 per cent. It is noteworthy, however, that the PRSPs 
in most countries were based on ex post consultations that were not genuinely participatory. The 
programmes are prepared by technocrats in collaboration with IMF and the World Bank. 
Consultations with the civil society take place only after the main elements of the strategy 
have been determined. In the case of Ghana, for example, Fantu Cheru observes that, the 
interim-PRSP, which was drawn from the World Bank&#8217;s 2000-2003 Country Assistance Strategy 
Document, has nothing to do with poverty but was rather designed to secure additional donor 
assistance, after the 1999 elections, following the dramatic collapse in the economy&#8217;s terms of 
trade and escalating oil prices.<b>20</b> Apart from a few countries like Uganda and Ghana, civil society 
organizations, labour and trade unions and professional associations are sidetracked in the 
consultation process, and democratic institutions such as the Parliament and political parties are 
                                                 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>also not involved. As a result, PRSPs often undermine the growth of democracy, rather than 
strengthen it.<b>21</b> In several countries, the perception of people is that PRSPs simply increase the 
demands on the government in the structural adjustment process. In Zambia for example, the 
PRSP has been an extension of the earlier stabilization programme, without leading to any 
radical alteration in the macroeconomic regime. Said Adejumobi (2006) summarizes this by 
saying that &#8220;the experience of many African countries with respect to adjustment policy 
measures especially in the social sector is that it weakens governance capacity rather than 
strengthens it&#8221;.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>30. Despite all these criticisms, it is generally recognized that the PRSPs have brought 
anti-poverty programmes to the forefront of national development policies and have highlighted 
the nature of political regimes and governance in Africa. However, they have still failed to 
emphasize the importance and relevance of the human rights-based approach for addressing the 
problems of governance in an objective manner, that would invariably lead to the design of 
policies in conformity with human rights standards. In Uganda, the strengthening of democracy 
and decentralization constitute an element of the objectives of the PRSP, to be achieved through 
&#8220;promoting peaceful conflict resolution, respect for human rights, law and order, transparency 
and accountability in government&#8221;.<b>23</b> In Ghana, the PRSP emphasizes the notion of good 
governance by promoting rule of law, human rights, social justice and equity as well as 
transparency and accountability in public sector management. From the human rights point of 
view, it should be possible to build on these aspects of PRSP, since the formulation of a PRSP is 
now recognized as the goal not only just for stimulating economic growth, but also for 
promoting pro-poor governance by enlisting the poor in the decision-making process. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Poverty reduction in Asia 
</b></p>
<p>31. Over the last decade, poverty reduction has become a major concern in almost all Asian 
countries. Development policy now emphasizes the identification of priority areas by national 
Governments themselves to enable them to design their own national poverty reduction 
strategies within the context of social development. In line with this approach, many Asian 
countries have adopted PRSPs, with the broad participation of civil society, as the framework for 
their efforts at poverty reduction and as a basis for accessing loans and grants from international 
donors.  
</p>
<p>32. Most countries in the Asia-Pacific region focus their national poverty reduction strategies 
and programmes on the majority of the poor population. These programmes aim at reducing 
poverty, increasing access to basic services like education, health and safe drinking water as well 
as addressing the issues of equity, non-discrimination and participation through targeted safety 
net programmes.

</p>
<p>33. Although in many of these countries, the actual implementation process is still in its 
infancy, success in terms of overall poverty reduction is already becoming apparent. In Nepal, 
for example, the Central Bureau of Statistics (2005) reveals that the national poverty head count 
rate declined from 41.76 per cent in 1995/96 to 30.85 per cent in 2003/04. In urban areas in 
particular, the change was even more significant, from 21.55 per cent to 9.55 per cent, 
representing a decline of 56 per cent. The Poverty Gap analysis also shows a substantial decrease 
from 6.54 to 2.18 in urban areas and 11.75 to 7.55 at the national level. Similarly in Cambodia, 
in those areas (59 per cent) covered by both the 1993/1994 and 2004 Socio-Economic Surveys, 
over these 11 years the poverty index fell by 11 percentage points or about 1 percentage point a 
year, while the Food Poverty Line declined from 20 per cent to 14.2 per cent.<b>24</b> In Bangladesh, 
the incidence of poverty in households, using the direct calorie intake method, shows a 
significant improvement. The number of male-headed households suffering from hard core 
poverty (or less than 1,805 K.cal/day); declined from 27.7 per cent in 1988/89 to 19.6 per cent  
in 2000, while the corresponding change for women headed households was a decline from 
32.0 per cent to 26.4 per cent.<b>25</b> Viet Nam also has been able to meet significant poverty 
reduction targets through the implementation of its Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Strategy (CPRGS) adopted in 2000. The incidence of poverty in Viet Nam has declined 
from 17 per cent in 2000 to 7 per cent in 2005.<b>26</b> At the end of 2004, 2 out of 64 provinces in 
Viet Nam did not have any poor households, 18 provinces had poverty rates ranging from 3 to 
5 per cent, 24 provinces had poverty rates between 5 to 10 per cent and only 2 provinces 
recorded poverty rates of over 20 per cent.<b>27</b> Viet Nam has fulfilled its MDG targets 10 years in 
advance, and reduced the number of poor households from 58.1 per cent in 1993 to 24.1 per cent 
in 2004, measured against the international poverty line.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>34. Most Asian countries also attach considerable importance to providing social safety nets 
for targeted vulnerable groups in order to fulfil the criteria of equity and non-discrimination. 
Bangladesh, in particular, has had significant success in its social safety net programmes (SNP&#8217;s) 
of which 27 represent 4.4 per cent of public expenditure. These SNPs focus on every section of 
society, women, children, the disabled and the elderly and include programmes for employment 
generation, food security, heath, education and community development.  
</p>
<p>35. The success of these programmes, in particular with regard to women, is reflected in 
women&#8217;s increased participation in household decisions and income-generating activities, as well 
as in their improved health conditions. For example, infant mortality rates (per 1,000) in

<p>Bangladesh decreased from 92 in 1991 to 53 in 2001, with a notable decrease in the rural areas 
from 94 per cent to 57 per cent.<b>29</b> Programmes targeting community empowerment or 
elimination of social exclusion, such as the Rural Maintenance Programme (RMP) which aims at 
empowering women, particularly widows or single-headed households, and maintaining rural 
infrastructure, involve about 42,000 participants annually. Studies show that over 60 per cent of 
the phased-out RMP participants were able to maintain the standard of living they had enjoyed 
during their RMP period. Safety net programmes in Bangladesh have also become successful to 
a certain extent in alleviating human poverty. Similarly, the Vulnerable Group Development 
(VGD) programme, which focuses on developing life skills for women through training and 
motivating savings, has been successful in improving the socio-economic conditions of 
beneficiary women, enabling them to ameliorate their existing situation to sustain themselves 
and to rise above the level of extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>36. Findings from the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) show that 
about 70 per cent of children aged 5 to 14 years from beneficiary households are enrolled in 
schools, as compared to 64 per cent of those from non-beneficiary households. The different 
rounds of Labour Force Surveys indicate progress in employment generation as the employed 
population increased from 34.8 million in 1995/96 to 39.0 million in 1999/2000 and further 
to 44.3 million in 2002/2003. It is estimated that during the PRSP period (FY05-FY07), 
8.02 million new jobs will be created, of which 5.39 million in rural areas and 2.63 million in 
urban areas. In Viet Nam, the statistics of the Ministry of Labour demonstrate a consistent 
increase in job creation over the last five years, with 1.5 million jobs created in 2004. The 
proportion of unemployed labour in rural areas has declined from 6.42 per cent in 2000 to 
5.6 per cent in 2004.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>37. States and Governments are recognized and accepted as the principal providers of social 
services in Asian developing countries. With regard to basic education, public schools account 
for the bulk of primary school enrolment in the region (89 per cent), and their share of overall 
education expenditure is 79 per cent. Improvements in the public education systems are thus of 
primary importance. In Bangladesh, the implementation of stipend programmes, such as the 
Primary Education Stipend Project and the Female Secondary School Assistance Programmes, 
have contributed to an increase in literacy rates of the population (aged 7 years and above), from 
32.40 per cent in 1991 to 47 per cent in 2004. In particular there has been a significant increase 
in female primary literacy from 25.15 to 42.90 per cent.<b>31</b> In Cambodia, World Bank statistics

<p>indicate that the primary completion rate has increased from 51.90 per cent in 2001 to  
92.31 per cent in 2005.<b>32</b> Cambodia is also one of the few countries in which a very high 
proportion of the resources for primary education originates from the local community. 
</p>
<p>38. In contrast to education, the average share of the public sector in overall health expenditure 
is only about 52 per cent for developing Asian countries, and is particularly low in South Asian 
countries, reflecting the predominance of private and other forms of health-care provision in this 
subregion. The low quality of many public health systems lead even the poor to opt for private 
services. This is in particular the case in rural areas where the health systems are often 
administered by traditional doctors and under-qualified practitioners. The low quality of services 
in the public system can be attributed to weak administration, poor accountability and lack of 
oversight of facilities. It may also reflect a peculiar manifestation of power where unions of 
doctors, nurses and non-medical subordinate employees, each exercise collective power to 
extract rents from both the system and the patient, whilst maintaining their immunity from 
disciplinary action. However, in Viet Nam, the health situation is quite different. At the end 
of 2004, 65 per cent of health-care centres had doctors, 79 per cent of villages and hamlets 
had health-care practitioners and most of the communes and wards had built health-care centres. 
In 2004, the district health-care networks successfully provided health-care facilities to over 
60 per cent of the patients. Seventy per cent of the central provinces and cities had traditional 
medicine hospitals and nearly 50 per cent of the general hospitals had traditional medicine 
departments/sections. However, it must be noted that despite the implementation of its national 
health programme throughout the country, according to the latest health indicators, Viet Nam has 
not been able to bridge the widening gap between the rich and the poor. For example, the infant 
mortality rate is 14 per 1,000 among the richest 20 per cent of the population and 39 per 1,000 
for the poorest 20 per cent of the population,<b>33</b> and the maternal mortality rate is relatively high 
at 130 per 100,000 live births.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>39. In some cases, impact evaluation studies assessing the effectiveness of public health 
systems and health service delivery by NGOs found that contracting to NGOs can be both 
effective in terms of attaining higher improvements in health indicators, but also more equitable 
in terms of reaching the poor.<b>35 </b>In Nepal, for example, where the Government&#8217;s main strategy is 
to transfer the management of health services to promote community ownership and oversight, 
community management of health facilities was extended to 28 districts in 2004/2005. The total 
number of health institutions handed over to communities for management reached 1,412 by the 
end of 2004/05, including 1,303 sub-health posts, 77 health posts and 32 primary health-care 
centres. As Nepal has not had elected bodies since July 2002, the reform has been limited to 
assigning the management of health facilities to local Health Management Committees (HMC). 
The statistics of the Ministry of Health and Population indicate the major achievements of Nepal

during the design of the national poverty reduction strategy, as well as in terms of fostering 
community participation. In general, in most Asian countries the consultation process and the 
exclusion of civil society during the drafting of the PRSP has been the subject of criticism. In 
Bangladesh for example, despite some consultations on the draft PRS, observers noted that most 
of the document had been drafted by two consultants and little attempt had been made to 
integrate PRSP into existing government systems.<b>36</b> A civil society coalition was formed to 
challenge the PRSP process and complain about inadequate participation. The &#8220;Independent 
Review for Bangladesh&#8217;s Development&#8221; (2002)<b>37</b> noted that representatives of the civil society 
were not involved in the designing stage of the exercise, and as a result the policy space was 
limited. Similarly in Cambodia, the NGO forum was also concerned that the Participatory 
Poverty Assessment (PPA) which elicits non-NGO community or grass-roots level participation 
had not been considered in the drafting process of the PRSP;<b>38</b> moreover, indicators of 
participation in each section of the PRSP document and measurements of its level and quality 
were not included.  
</p>
<p>41. Experience of participation in PRSPs has shown that there is a need to establish a clear 
framework for participation that defines guidelines and benchmarks for determining who is 
involved, at what stage and with what &#8220;level of participation&#8221;, and for the methodology to be 
used in the process.  Most case studies demonstrate a general failure to directly involve poor 
people, and the absence of a clear and appropriate framework for participation. However, some 
success has been achieved in fostering community participation. In Nepal for example, social 
mobilization and community participation are emerging as the most-conflict resistant models of 
development. Evidence now suggests that when development activities are demand-driven and 
involve community participation, they are acceptable even to the parties in conflict. For example, 
community participation has been exemplary in rural drinking water projects. All the major 
projects in the sector, namely the Community-based Water Supply and Sanitation Project,

<p>Small Town Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project, and Rural Water Supply and Sanitation

resulted in 77.5 per cent of the population having access to drinking water in 2004/2005.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>42. Bangladesh has also made major achievements in this area, with 99 per cent of the urban 
population, 97 per cent of rural population and 97.4 per cent of overall population in 2003 
having access to safe drinking water. Moreover, the success of the Grameen Bank shows the 
importance placed on community participation.  
</p>
<p>43. Monitoring and accountability however, still remain the weakest aspects of the 
implementation of a rights-based approach to development. The existence, in most countries of 
the region, of democratic political systems makes possible the setting up of the monitoring and 
accountability procedures that are an essential ingredient of the rights-based approach to 
development. However, electoral democracy on its own is seldom enough to guarantee 
accountability. An extensive institutional framework needs to be in place, including a well 
functioning parliament and parliamentary committees, semi-judicial institutions such as a human 
rights commission and ombudsmen, and an effective system of decentralization. An example of a 
step in the right direction has been the setting up, by the Government of Nepal, of a Participatory 
Poverty Monitoring (PPM) mechanism for institutionalizing participatory monitoring whereby 
tools such as citizens&#8217; report cards, social audits, budget reviews by civil society groups and 
parliamentary reviews of programme and policy performance complement information generated 
by PMAS (Poverty Monitoring and Analysis System).

<p>44. Despite the overall image that prosperity and well-being prevail in the European Union 
(EU), nearly 16 per cent of the EU population is living at risk-of-poverty.<b>41</b> The &#8220;at 
risk-of-poverty rate&#8221; is defined as the &#8220;share of persons with an equivalized disposable income, 
before social transfers below the risk-of-poverty threshold, which is set at 60 per cent of the 
national median equivalized disposable income (after social transfers)&#8221;. Twenty per cent of 
children (under 16 years) in the EU are at risk of poverty.<b>42</b> Poverty reduction is one of the top

<p>priorities on the EU agenda. The Amsterdam Treaty mandated for social inclusion within the 
Union. The Lisbon Strategy that emerged from the Lisbon Summit in 2000 addressed the key 
issue of social exclusion, and set the goal for poverty eradication within the region by 2010, to be 
achieved through the open method of coordination (OMC). These objectives, if met, would help 
achieve the larger EU goal of a &#8220;socially cohesive Europe&#8221;. The objectives were to be fulfilled 
through the development of appropriate National Action Plans against Poverty and Social 
Exclusion (NAPS) subject to periodic reporting and monitoring of progress. Further 
improvements of the indicators for social inclusion were made at the Laeken Economic Council 
in December 2001.  
</p>
<p>45. The Human Poverty Indicator-2 (HPI-2), as devised by UNDP, measures human and 
income poverty in rich industrialized nations. It is a composite index of poverty that measures 
deprivation based on the following human development indicators, namely, long and healthy life, 
education and a decent standard of living and social inclusion. The 2005 HPI-2 index shows that 
Scandinavian countries rank very highly, with Germany, France and Spain occupying middle 
level ranks and the United Kingdom and Ireland featuring at the bottom of the list.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p>46. At the Laeken European Council, a set of 18 common standards and statistical indicators 
for social inclusion were endorsed and accepted by the Social Protection Committee of the 
European Council. These indicators can be categorized as follows:  
</p>
<p>&#8722; Primary indicators consisting of lead indicators of social exclusion such as financial 
poverty, health, education etc.; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Secondary indicators consisting of supporting indicators describing other aspects of the 
problem and commonly defined and determined by the member States; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Third level of indicators which can be included by member States themselves into their 
NAPs to highlight specific aspects of the problem and help interpret the primary and 
secondary indicators.  
</p>
<p>47. With a view to further improving the Laeken indicators, in June 2006 the Social Protection 
Committee adopted a new set of common indicators for social protection and social inclusion. 
This new set has streamlined the earlier indicators to give effect to the new monitoring 
framework for social protection and social inclusion in light of the common objectives set out in 
the Lisbon Summit, namely social cohesion, greater economic growth and good governance, 
transparency and involvement of stakeholders in the design, implementation and monitoring 
process. These new indicators for the overarching portfolios like social inclusion, pensions and 
long-term health care seek to be comprehensive, balanced and transparent for effective

<p>monitoring. They would contain commonly agreed EU indicators, national indicators based on 
commonly agreed definitions and assumptions and information better understood in the national 
context.  
</p>
<p>48. The Belgian Resource Centre For the Fight Against Poverty has conducted extensive 
research to refine the existing poverty indicators by involving those working in the field to 
combat poverty. Professor Nicaise from the Centre has emphasized in his communications with 
the independent expert, that a participatory process to eliminate conditions of social exclusion 
has been successfully initiated in Belgium. Mr. Nicaise highlights the fact that many of the grass-
roots organizations have agreed on a common method of operation based on principles of 
community development and poverty reduction and that dialogue groups , involving persons 
living in poverty and other stakeholders such as professionals, government agencies and other 
associations, have been set up. </p>
<p>49. Social protection systems are fairly well developed in the EU and they attempt to provide 
adequate coverage to at-risk-of poverty populations affected by unemployment, old age, ill 
health, inadequate income and parental responsibility. The member States are responsible for 
implementing and financing social protection programmes in their own countries. However, the 
EU coordinates these national social security schemes through EU legislation to ensure that 
persons may move freely within the region without adversely affecting their rights to social 
protection. It must be noted that the EU does not establish a common social security system for 
the region and allows the national security systems to operate on their own, so long as the basic 
principles of equality of treatment and non-discrimination are respected.  
</p>
<p>50. The EU has also been actively involved in the modernization of social protection systems 
in member countries. The Social Protection Committee established by the European Council 
after the Lisbon Summit in 2000, is mandated to work on policy challenges related to secure 
income, safe and sustainable pension systems, social inclusion and high quality health care. In 
March 2006, the European Council adopted a new framework for social inclusion and social 
protection which included the objectives of &#8220;ensuring access for all to the resources, rights and 
services needed for participation in society, preventing and addressing exclusion, and fighting all 
forms of discrimination leading to exclusion&#8221;. In 2005-2006, member States of the EU adopted 
legislative measures to incorporate the goals of the Lisbon Summit into their social protection 
systems. In 2005, the European Commission adopted the new Social Agenda 2005-2010, which 
focuses on two priority areas of action, employment and equal opportunities for all. In the 2005 
and 2006 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion, EU members pledged to 
develop policies in seven key priority areas as identified in the NAPS adopted by member States, 
namely, improving labour-market participation, modernizing social protection systems, tackling 
educational disadvantages, eliminating child poverty, improving housing standards, improving 
access to quality services and fighting discrimination and integrating ethnic minorities and 
immigrants. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. As of early 2006, 9.8 per cent of the EU-25<b>44</b> working-age adults were living in jobless 
households (i.e. where no member of the family was working). It was seen that families with 
children were worst affected by joblessness, and the share of children living in jobless 
households varied across member countries.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p>52. Employment does not necessarily eliminate poverty, as can be seen in the case of the EU. 
In 2004, 7 per cent of working EU citizens (above 16 years of age) were at risk of poverty (after 
social transfers). The existence of working poverty in the EU raises serious questions about the 
quality of work and the commitment of the EU to poverty reduction. The definition of the 
working poor as devised by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics and now widely 
accepted is &#8220;those persons who have devoted at least half of the year to labour market efforts, 
being either employed or in search of a job during that period, but who still live in poor 
families&#8221;.<b>46</b> Very limited research on working poverty has been conducted in the EU; France is 
the only member country to have initiated studies on the working poor. Working poverty should 
be studied both at the income and household levels to provide a more holistic understanding of 
the problem. A high rate of risk of poverty among self-employed persons was also recorded 
(15 per cent as of 2001). The EU has also studied the relationship between poor working 
conditions and working poverty to find ways to improve the quality of employment in the region.  
</p>
<p>53. Life expectancy in the EU-25 has increased over the last decade. Between 1995-2005, life 
expectancy for men has increased from 72.8 years to 75.8 years and for women from 79.7 years 
to 81.9 years. However, the healthy life years (HLY) indication at birth is much lower than the 
life expectancy.  According to Eurostat data, in 2003, in the EU-15,<b>47</b> women were expected to 
live healthy lives for 66 years and men for 64.5 years. In 2004, the total health-care expenditure 
in the EU-25 was 7.4 per cent of GDP (including both public health care and private insurance), 
with some countries like the Netherlands and Sweden recording more than 8 per cent health 
expenditure and Latvia, Lithuania and Poland recording a little more than 3 per cent. 
</p>
<p>54. The challenges to achieving effective health care are common across the globe, the most 
significant, being the health of ageing populations. As with increasing life expectancy, the share 
of old and very old persons in the population has increased. Ageing also increases the pressures 
to provide better curative and rehabilitative health care, and most of the EU member countries 
are presently ill equipped to provide such long-term care. No EU country has a specific 
legislation on long-term care; France and the Czech Republic are among the only countries to 
have incorporated long-term care into their social assistance programmes. If costs relating to

<p>long-term care are not covered by insurance, a great financial burden would be placed on older 
patients, whose right of access to health care would be severely restricted. The EU also 
recognizes the health-care sector as a potential generator of employment opportunities for skilled 
workers. With a greater number of older persons in need of care, the demand for health-care 
professionals is on the rise, but interestingly, with more professionals reaching the retirement 
age, the supply in this sector is shrinking. The shrinking supply of health-care professionals, in 
turn, raises health-care expenditure, thereby adversely affecting the financial sustainability of 
health care. This problem can be tackled by devising better human resource strategies.  
</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>55. This report has demonstrated how a human rights-based approach can apply both to the 
theoretical considerations in terms of developing a consensus on the core characteristics of 
extreme poverty, and to the practical application of policies for the eradication of extreme 
poverty. The applicability of the notion of extreme poverty within a human rights framework 
will now have to be examined with respect to different country experiences in carrying out their 
anti-poverty programmes. The independent expert proposes to do so systematically in his next 
report. While the context-specific nature of the problems will be brought out through this future 
exercise, the overall general conclusion is that a human rights approach is a distinct value added 
in dealing with extreme poverty.
