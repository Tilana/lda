<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report summarizes the scope and patterns of alleged corporate-related human rights 
abuse found in a sample of 320 cases posted on the Business and Human Rights Resource Center 
web page from February 2005 to December 2007. An initial coding of cases showed that all 
industry sectors were alleged to impact human rights, and impacts were alleged to occur in all 
regions.  
</p>
<p> Allegations of abuse were reviewed for the right or rights impacted, using the rights 
in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and 
the International Labour Organization core conventions. Environmental harms were also 
noted as they were often connected to claims of negative impacts on human rights. 
Allegations of corruption were recorded, recognizing that corruption can impede realization 
of all rights. Furthermore, persons affected by the alleged abuses were identified and 
organized into three groups: workers, communities, and end-users, e.g., consumers of goods or 
users of services. The form of company involvement in the alleged abuse was also classified, 
and noted as &#8220;direct&#8221; (direct forms of company involvement in alleged abuses) or &#8220;indirect&#8221; 
(indirect forms of company involvement) cases. Chapter I of this report presents an overview of 
the findings. Chapter II provides further context to the findings, including case examples from 
each sector.  
</p>
<p><b>Findings 
</b></p>
<p> Findings include: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Corporations are alleged to impact the full range of human rights (see below for the list 
of rights impacted), including civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural 
rights; and labour rights; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Labour and non-labour rights were both impacted (see table below). 
</p>
<p><b>Labour rights impacted 
</b></p>
<p>Freedom of association Right to equal pay for equal work 
Right to organize and participate in 
  collective bargaining 
</p>
<p>Right to equality at work 
</p>
<p>Right to non-discrimination Right to just and favourable remuneration 
Abolition of slavery and forced labour Right to a safe work environment 
Abolition of child labour Right to rest and leisure 
Right to work  Right to family life </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 3 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Non-labour rights impacted 
</b></p>
<p>Right to life, liberty and 
  security of the person 
</p>
<p>Right of peaceful 
  assembly 
</p>
<p>Right to an adequate standard of 
  living (including food, clothing, 
  and housing) 
</p>
<p>Freedom from torture or 
  cruel, inhuman or 
  degrading treatment 
</p>
<p>Right to marry and form 
  a family 
</p>
<p>Right to physical and mental 
  health; access to medical services 
</p>
<p>Equal recognition and 
  protection under the law 
</p>
<p>Freedom of thought, 
  conscience and religion 
</p>
<p>Right to education 
</p>
<p>Right to a fair trial Right to hold opinions, 
  freedom of information 
  and expression 
</p>
<p>Right to participate in cultural life, 
  the benefits of scientific progress, 
  and protection of authorial 
  interests 
</p>
<p>Right to self-determination Right to political life Right to social security 
Freedom of movement Right to privacy   
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Rights impacts were not discrete.</b> An alleged abuse often generated impact on 
multiple human rights. For example, in some cases, alleged use of child labour impacted 
the right to education and freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment and, in other cases, where children were performing tasks well beyond their 
physical capacity, the right to health and right to life; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Initial abuses seem to lead to further related allegations of abuses.</b> For instance, in 
cases where firms allegedly failed to provide safety training or protective gear for those 
working in hazardous work environments, the right to a safe work environment was at 
issue. However, continuing failure to address the latter opened a space for additional 
allegations of abuse, including scenarios where unsafe work conditions were alleged to 
cause employee injuries or death, impacting the right to health and right to life in some 
cases; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Environmental harms were connected to impacts on human rights.</b> Environmental 
concerns were raised in relation to all sectors and translated into impacts on a number of 
rights, including the right to health, right to life, rights to adequate food and housing, 
minority rights to culture, and the right to benefit from scientific progress. Access to 
clean water was also raised in 20 per cent of cases, where firms had allegedly impeded 
access to clean water or polluted a clean water supply; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Corruption issues were also raised </b>(appearing in roughly a quarter of cases), with 
transparency and alleged corporate acts to cover up impacts being most reported. 
Alleged failures in transparency, including failure to disclose political and trade 
activities, were viewed to impair stakeholder abilities to judge the public commitments 
made by firms. Confidential, inadequate or non-existent impact assessments were 
viewed to prevent affected communities and other stakeholders from assessing the 
impact and value of company activities. Numerous supplier level firms were alleged to 
falsify and destroy records and to coach employees during inspections; </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Alleged impacts on workers and communities occurred at equal rates</b>, at 
45 per cent each. Every sector was alleged to impact both groups. End-user impacts, 
while likely not fully captured by the sample for this study, occurred most frequently 
in relation to pharmaceutical firms alleged to impede access to essential medicines; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Near 60 per cent of cases featured direct forms of company involvement in the 
alleged abuses</b>, where the company is alleged to directly cause the abuse through its 
own acts or omissions; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Around 40 per cent of cases included indirect forms of company involvement in the 
abuse</b>, where firms were generally alleged to contribute to or benefit from the abuses of 
third parties, such as suppliers, individuals, States or arms of a State, and other business. 
Eighteen per cent of indirect cases involved company sourcing from suppliers alleged to 
abuse human rights; 23 per cent connected firms to the abuse of various other third 
parties, including States and other business. 
</p>
<p><b>Context for alleged corporate impact on human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Workers 
</b></p>
<p> The impact on workers includes notably that: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Thirty four per cent of direct cases of alleged abuse affected workers</b>, from all 
sectors and covering all regions. Cases alleged impacts on the full range of labour 
rights. They reinforced the traditional view that firms should respect such rights within 
the workplace but also highlighted instances where firms, sometimes through internal 
workplace policies, affect the rights of workers while outside of the workplace; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Around 60 per cent of indirect cases of alleged abuse affected workers</b>, reported in 
four regions - Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East. Nearly 
75 per cent of cases involved company sourcing from suppliers (operating in one of the 
aforementioned regions) alleged to abuse human rights, coming from five sectors: food 
and beverage; heavy manufacturing; IT, electronics and telecommunications; retail and 
consumer products; and a residual category &#8220;other&#8221;. Another 14 per cent of cases 
involved the financial service sector, alleged to hold shares in or finance companies and 
projects known for labour abuse. Finally, the remaining cases involved extractive sector 
firms connected to third-party security forces that were alleged to abuse workers. 
</p>
<p><b>Communities 
</b></p>
<p><b> Nearly 50 per cent of direct cases of alleged abuse affected communities</b>, covering all 
regions and eight sectors, only excluding the financial services sector, which was cited in 
indirect cases affecting communities. The majority of cases involved environmental harms that 
were alleged to negatively affect the livelihood and health of local populations. Impacts on water 
supplies were raised in 40 per cent of these cases. Additionally, numerous firms were criticized 
for not conducting impact assessments while others were alleged to poorly carry out the 
assessment process. Extractive sector firms were also cited here for alleged impacts on the rights 
of indigenous communities.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 5 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> Around 40 per cent of indirect cases of alleged abuse affected communities</b>, reported in 
four regions - Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East. Nearly all these 
cases (90 per cent) involved allegations that a firm contributed to or benefited from State abuse 
of human rights. These claims related to four sectors: extractives; financial services; heavy 
manufacturing; and infrastructure and utility firms. Other cases involved financial service firm 
support of company projects alleged to abuse human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>End-users 
</b></p>
<p><b> Alleged impacts on end-users were direct only, making up 16 per cent of direct cases. 
</b>These cases<b> </b>typically involved company actions related to its products and services. Almost all 
these cases centred on issues of access to essential medicines and industries&#8217; lack of research into 
diseases primarily affecting persons in poorer regions.  
</p>
<p> In sum, the presence of all sectors and regions in the allegations supports the need for 
all corporate actors to consider the human rights implications of their activities. Moreover, the 
study indicates that the subject of this consideration should not be a shortlist of rights but 
actually the full range of human rights. And given the number of allegations of indirect abuse, 
firms should also consider the human rights records and activities of those with whom they have 
relationships - the allegations show that a firm may be held accountable by stakeholders where it 
contributes to or benefits from third-party abuses.  </p>

<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In his 2006 report to the Commission on Human Rights, the Special Representative of 
the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other 
business enterprises presented findings from a survey of alleged corporate-related human 
rights abuses (see E/CN.4/2006/97, paras. 24-30).<b>1</b> The sample for that survey was relatively 
small (65 instances reported by NGOs), providing an overview of patterns of corporate impact 
on human rights. Since 2006, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General has conducted 
a number of other surveys, including a comprehensive review of over 300 firms&#8217; publicly 
available human rights-related policies and practices, which are contained in addendum 4 to the 
Special Representative&#8217;s report to the Human Rights Council in 2007 (A/HRC/4/35/Add.4).<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>2. At the fourth session of the Human Rights Council, held in March 2007, a group of NGOs 
questioned how the Special Representative intended to analyse patterns of corporate-related 
human rights abuses and their impacts on individuals and communities.<b>3</b> In response to this 
question, and wishing to complement the initial survey of alleged abuses with a more 
comprehensive study of the nature and scope of alleged corporate human rights abuse, the 
Special Representative is grateful for the resources provided by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to undertake the present study. In brief, it reviews 
320 cases of alleged corporate-related human rights abuse, providing a study that is equivalent in 
size to the above-mentioned review of corporate human rights policies and practices completed 
in early 2007.  
</p>
<p>3. Preliminary findings of this study were presented in December 2007 at a consultation 
convened by the Special Representative, in collaboration with the non-governmental 
organization (NGO) Realizing Rights: The Ethical Globalization Initiative, on the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights.<b>4</b> This paper is a presentation of the findings.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Context 
</b></p>
<p>4. Each day, allegations of human rights abuse make their way to the public through various 
channels. Increasingly, companies are the subjects of these allegations. Whether through official 
reports or more informal means, various parties - NGOs, trade unions, States, media outlets, 
communities, shareholders, and individuals - express concern over corporate-related human 
rights abuse. These allegations illustrate the scope of rights that companies from a variety of 
sectors are perceived to impact, as well as the contexts in which such allegations may arise. They 
may also serve as indicators for business as to what constitutes its social licence to operate and 
what is expected of it in the global marketplace. Without drawing any conclusions about the 
merits of the allegations, this report sets out the scope and patterns found in a set of 320 cases of 
alleged abuse reported in the public domain between February 2005 and December 2007.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p><b>Sample 
</b></p>
<p>5. The allegations for this study are drawn from a list of allegations maintained by the 
Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre (www.business-humanrights.org), showing cases for 
which the Resource Centre sought a company response.<b>6</b> The Resource Centre seeks a company 
response to reports that it plans to include in its Weekly Update when the company has not 
already publicly replied to the allegations. The Resource Centre does not usually seek company 
responses when a case is being handled in the courts or other formal forums. For the period used 
for this survey, the list contains nearly 400 entries. 
</p>
<p>6. In the absence of a universal database that stores allegations of abuse, the Resource 
Centre&#8217;s online library is the most comprehensive, objective source available. The list provided a 
useful, accessible sampling of the thousands of allegations on the Resource Centre&#8217;s website. 
However, the list is only a sample. Many more allegations exist (both in the Resource Centre&#8217;s 
online library and other sources) and resource constraints precluded looking into national 
jurisprudence. Nevertheless, the sample chosen was considered sufficient for illustrative 
purposes, providing a look into a large set of alleged abuses.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  At the time of writing (February 2008), two other such reviews were nearing completion, 
</p>
<p>one from Human Rights Watch (final report launched in February 2008, see 
http://hrw.org/reports/2008/bhr0208/) and another from ESCR-Net. Human Rights Watch drew 
from 10 years of its research to describe a wide variety of business-related abuses and obstacles 
to justice sought by victims of these abuses. ESCR-Net collected and reviewed a set of 
emblematic cases, some solicited and some located in public space, and is due to publish a report 
of findings this year. 
<b>6
</b>  Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre, &#8220;Companies we invited to respond to 
</p>
<p>concerns in our Updates&#8221;, document No. 1, see http://www.business-humanrights.org/ 
Documents/Update-Charts. The Resource Centre was used as source material for the study but 
the Resource Centre itself was not involved in designing or producing the study. The Resource 
Centre also posts reports of positive steps by companies. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 9 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7. The sample was narrowed to ensure that only cases of alleged human rights abuse were 
counted and that such cases were counted only once. At the outset, duplicate allegations were 
eliminated, e.g., a single company may be the subject of reports by different organizations on the 
same issue. However, updated reports on the same issue published six months or more after the 
original report were counted. In this instance, the issue was considered ongoing and not simply a 
duplication of other reports. In addition, entries that did not allege an actual abuse were 
eliminated. These included items such as concerns raised about a company&#8217;s lobbying activities 
in relation to labour rights legislation or its participation in collective initiatives - statements that 
do not accuse the corporation of abuse per se. After subtracting these, 320 entries remained. 
These entries connected alleged abuses to over 250 firms, ranging from small suppliers to 
Fortune Global 500 companies, to State-owned enterprises and their subsidiaries.  
</p>
<p>8. The final sample of allegations was sorted into nine industry sectors: extractive; financial 
services; food and beverage; heavy manufacturing, infrastructure and utilities; information 
technology, electronics and telecommunications; pharmaceutical and chemical; retail and 
consumer products; and a residual category (other). The allegations were also sorted into six 
regions, according to where the abuse was alleged to have occurred: Africa; Asia and the Pacific; 
Europe; Latin America; the Middle East; and North America. In addition, a &#8220;global&#8221; designation 
was assigned where it was alleged that a company action impacted rights in two or more regions 
simultaneously. Figures 1 and 2 below illustrate the breakdown of allegations by sector and 
region. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9. A number of factors contribute to which sectors, regions, and rights are the focus of 
allegations at any given time and those criteria may shift over time. Given this, caution should be 
exercised when drawing inferences about the concentration of allegations in a particular region 
or sector. However, the appearance of all regions and all sectors in the allegations is clear, and 
thereby the importance of all corporate actors considering human rights, wherever they operate. 
</p>
<p><b>Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>10. Each allegation was reviewed for the human right or rights to which it pertained, either 
expressly or implicitly. For purposes of this study, only alleged abuses were recorded and 
translated - the study did not attempt to predict what other concerns may have also existed in 
each case. In cases where the allegation stated that a specific right was violated, it was only 
necessary to record the alleged abuse of that right. Where an entry did not mention abuse of a 
specific right but provided a description of the abuse, that description was translated into human 
rights language. For example, where work-related injuries were described and it was alleged 
that the company contributed to or failed to prevent those injuries, it was translated into impact 
on the right to a safe work environment. Depending on the description, impacts on the right to 
health and the right to life might also be coded, e.g., where chronic injuries were sustained or 
work-related deaths were reported. Therefore, within the report, reference to alleged abuses or 
alleged impacts on human rights can mean those that were expressly alleged in rights language 
or those that contained descriptions of alleged abuses tantamount to impacts on human rights. 
</p>
<p>11. The universe of rights used for coding purposes are those expressed in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 11 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>International Labour Organization (ILO) core conventions. Environmental impacts with human 
rights implications were also recorded. And descriptions of corrupt corporate practices were 
noted, recognizing that such practices have the potential to impact the realization of all rights. 
Allegations that a company failed to take adequate steps in assessing and managing impacts on 
human rights were also noted. 
</p>
<p>12. Persons affected by the alleged abuse were also categorized. For each case, it was noted 
whether workers, communities, or end-users<b>7</b> were affected. In some cases, more than one group 
of persons was affected and it was necessary to record the primary party affected followed by 
other affected parties. The number of persons affected was also captured - each case was coded 
using the groupings 1-50, 50-100, or more than 100 (&gt;100) persons affected. 
</p>
<p>13. The dominant form of company involvement in the alleged abuse was coded. This included 
recording a brief description of the company actions alleged to cause the abuse and a 
categorization of the manner in which the company was involved - broadly classified as direct or 
indirect involvement. For direct cases, the company&#8217;s own actions or omissions were alleged to 
cause the abuse. Here, there was either no degree or a very minimal degree of separation between 
company actions and alleged abuses. In indirect cases, the company was perceived to contribute 
to or benefit from the violations of third parties, including suppliers, States or arms of a State, 
and other business. Some of these cases included specific allegations of corporate complicity in 
the abuse, e.g., State clearing of land for corporate use that violates indigenous rights in the 
process, or corporate finance of projects with records of abuse. Supply chain cases included 
allegations that were aimed at a buyer for abuses committed by its supplier.<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>14. This report is divided into two parts. Chapter I presents an overview of findings from the 
study, providing a view into what human rights companies are alleged to impact, the persons 
affected, and the dominant form of company involvement in the alleged abuses. First, labour and 
non-labour human rights impacts are discussed. This section also incorporates environmental 
harms and corruption as they were alleged to generate impacts on human rights. Next, data is 
presented on the persons affected by the alleged abuses, including workers, communities, and 
end-users. This section closes with data on the type of company involvement in the alleged 
abuses, broadly categorized as direct and indirect.  
</p>
<p>15. Chapter II contextualizes the findings, providing a view into how the human rights impacts 
presented in chapter I occurred. The contexts for alleged impacts on the rights of workers, 
communities, and end-users are presented. Each discussion includes a presentation of both direct 
and indirect cases of alleged impact on the rights of each group, highlighting the relevant sectors, 
regions, and corporate actions leading to allegations of abuse.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>7
</b>  For this study, end-users mean those persons who use or are intended to use products, goods, 
</p>
<p>or services. 
<b>8
</b>  Note that some cases made direct allegations against supplier firms. In these cases, the abuse 
</p>
<p>was recorded as a direct form of involvement on the part of the supplier. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>I.  OVERVIEW OF FINDINGS 
</b></p>
<p>16. The allegations of abuse reviewed for this study reveal that corporations are seen to impact 
a wide range of human rights - including civil and political rights; economic, social and cultural 
rights; and labour rights. This section first discusses alleged labour rights impacts and then 
non-labour rights impacts, incorporating consideration of environmental harms and corruption 
where alleged. Data on the persons affected by the alleged abuses is also presented, showing an 
equal number of allegations of impact on workers and communities. This section closes with a 
discussion of direct and indirect cases of company involvement in the alleged abuse. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Human rights impacted by business 
</b></p>
<p><b>Labour-rights impacts 
</b></p>
<p>17. Most cases raised multiple allegations in relation to labour contexts, translating a single 
case into alleged impacts on a number of labour-related rights. In addition, labour rights abuses 
were often not discrete. A single allegation of abuse was often claimed to generate impacts on 
other labour and even non-labour rights. For example, where a firm was reported to use child 
labour, the circumstances of the case might also give rise to alleged impacts on the right to 
education, freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the right to health, 
and even the right to life.

<p>18. Figure 3 illustrates the range of alleged impacts on labour-related rights in the sample. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19. Labour rights impacts showed up frequently, with some labour abuses alleged at almost 
double the rates of others. Labour rights most commonly claimed to have been impacted include, 
e.g., the right to work (34 per cent), right to just and favourable remuneration (30 per cent), the 
right to a safe work environment (31 per cent), and the right to rest and leisure (25 per cent). </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 13 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20. Corruption was also an issue raised in the labour context (17 of 86 cases of alleged 
corruption), most often connected to alleged corporate acts to cover up impacts on labour rights. 
A number of supplier level firms were alleged to have falsified or destroyed records prior to 
inspections and factory audits. They were also accused of coaching and forcing employees to lie 
during inspections.  
</p>
<p>21. Since many States have labour regulations in place for business that include formal 
adjudication channels for abuses, labour-related abuses might be underrepresented in the sample. 
This is because those cases may be more likely to have been taken to a formal mechanism for 
resolution and therefore would not have been captured in the sample (see discussion of the study 
sample, paragraphs 5-8 above). It was also apparent that some cases did not raise all available 
labour issues and instead chose to focus on key issues of concern, e.g., a media report that 
highlights only one or two labour issues in a factory - only issues presented were recorded - no 
inferences were made about what other concerns may have also existed in each case. 
</p>
<p><b>Non-labour rights impacts 
</b></p>
<p>22. Alleged impacts on non-labour rights were raised as frequently, and in some cases more 
frequently, than impacts on labour-related rights. Moreover, while some have viewed non-labour 
rights as a concern for only a few sectors, with the extractive sector being the most frequently 
used example, the cases reviewed for this study reveal that alleged impacts on non-labour rights 
occurred in relation to all sectors. 
</p>
<p>23. Figure 4 below shows the range of rights alleged to have been impacted negatively. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>24. While the allegations indicated that corporations could impact a broad range of non-labour 
rights, certain non-labour rights were mentioned more than others in allegations. For instance, 
the right to physical and mental health appeared as an alleged impact in nearly 75 per cent of all </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>cases. Impacts on this right occurred in a variety of contexts, e.g., where firms allegedly exposed 
individuals or communities to toxins, failed to provide medical treatment or medical insurance, 
or engaged in physical or mental abuse of individuals or communities (directly or indirectly). 
Additionally, alleged impacts on the right to physical and mental health often brought into 
question impacts on the right to life, liberty and security of the person and freedom from torture 
or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, appearing in 44 and 57 per cent of cases, respectively.  
</p>
<p>25. Impacts on the right to an adequate standard of living, including the right to adequate food, 
clothing and housing were alleged in near 40 per cent of cases and in relation to almost every 
sector. The right to social security, self-determination, privacy, and education were also alleged 
as impacts in between 20-25 per cent of all cases reviewed.  
</p>
<p>26. The allegations indicated that no sector or region was immune from contexts that may 
impact human rights. For example, allegations involving the rights to adequate food, clothing 
and housing were as likely to appear in cases concerning the living conditions of workers 
residing at a manufacturing facility campus as they were to appear in relation to communities 
affected by extractive or infrastructure projects. Regarding the right to education, a heavy 
manufacturing firm was alleged to have contributed to infringement of the right because it sold 
equipment that was subsequently used to block access to local schools while a supplier firm was 
alleged to employ children full-time in its factory without regard to their schooling. Alleged 
impacts on the right to privacy occurred where company-affiliated security forces arbitrarily 
attacked private homes and also in cases where companies set up surveillance systems and 
methods to intercept e-mail communications.  
</p>
<p>27. In addition to allegations concerning the rights listed in figure 4 above, nearly a third of 
cases alleged environmental harms that had corresponding impacts on human rights. 
Environmental concerns were raised in relation to all sectors. In these cases, various forms of 
pollution, contamination, and degradation translated into alleged impacts on a number of rights, 
including on the right to health, the right to life, rights to adequate food and housing, minority 
rights to culture, and the right to benefit from scientific progress. A number of environmental 
issues also prompted allegations that a firm had either impeded access to clean water or polluted 
a clean water supply, an issue raised in 20 per cent of cases.  
</p>
<p>28. Corruption issues were regularly raised in relation to the realization of non-labour rights, 
with transparency emerging as the key issue of concern. Transparency was expected but 
allegedly not delivered in relation to a number of issues, ranging from project impact 
assessments to corporate political and trade association payments. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Persons affected (workers, communities, end-users) 
</b>29. The allegations were divided according to whether they impacted workers, communities, 
and/or end-users. Alleged impacts on workers and communities occurred at equal rates, both 
at 45 per cent. This finding departs from traditional notions that business mainly affects the 
rights of workers. In the cases examined for this study, every sector was alleged to impact the 
rights of communities as well as those of workers. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 15 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30. Only about 10 per cent of the cases in this study alleged impacts on end-users; the majority 
of cases targeted pharmaceutical firms for impeding access to essential medicines in developing 
countries. It is beyond the scope of this report to speculate why the number of end-user-related 
cases is lower than those for workers and communities, though it is reiterated that the study did 
not include complaints before formal complaints mechanisms (see above discussion of the study 
sample), which may account for the absence of some of these cases from the sample.  
</p>
<p>31. A small number of cases (roughly 7 per cent) alleged impacts on more than one category of 
persons concurrently - some combination of workers, communities, or end-users. A few cases 
also stated that there were additional effects on reporters, activists, and, in one case, an NGO 
employee, including threats, violations of privacy, and impeding the right to hold opinions, 
freedom of information and expression.  
</p>
<p>32. Figure 5 below depicts the primary group alleged to have been affected in the cases - 
workers, communities, or end-users. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33. In some cases, a single instance of alleged abuse raised issues of impact on the rights of up 
to 60,000 persons. For those cases where a company action was seen to impact persons in more 
than one region, the numbers were even greater, for example, where a firm&#8217;s policy was alleged 
to generate impacts on persons in two or more of its areas of operation simultaneously.  
</p>
<p>34. While the reported magnitude of alleged impacts varied from case to case, almost all the 
cases involved impacts on more than 100 individuals. The allegations indicated that both 
unilateral and coordinated corporate actions have the potential to generate widespread impact on 
the human rights of various groups of persons. </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Dominant form of company involvement in alleged abuses 
</b></p>
<p>35. The study categorized each case by the dominant form of company involvement in the 
alleged abuses. Broadly classified, company involvement in the abuse was recorded as either 
direct or indirect, with both types of involvement present in some cases. Nearly 60 per cent of 
cases featured more direct forms of company involvement in the alleged abuses (&#8220;direct cases&#8221;). 
For direct cases, the company, through its employees or agents, was generally alleged to have 
committed the abuse, with minimal or no separation between the company and the abuse. 
</p>
<p>36. Forty-one per cent of cases included indirect forms of company involvement in the alleged 
abuses (&#8220;indirect cases&#8221;). Here, firms were generally alleged to contribute to or benefit from the 
abuses of third parties. Supply chain cases were coded separately as a subset of indirect cases, 
making up 18 per cent of all cases in the sample. Other indirect cases, accounting for 23 per cent 
of all cases in the sample, connected a firm to other third-party abuses, including individuals, 
State or arms of a State, and other business enterprises.  
</p>
<p>37. Figure 6 below breaks down the allegations of abuse by the dominant form of company 
involvement. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Direct cases 
</b></p>
<p>38. Direct company involvement in the alleged abuses was coded for all regions and in relation 
to all sectors. Moreover, direct cases contained allegations of abuse that impacted all groups of 
persons mentioned above - workers, communities, and end-users.  
</p>
<p>39. The dominant feature of direct cases was the claim that the company&#8217;s own actions or 
omissions had actually caused the alleged abuse. For example, a company refusing to hire 
persons because of their gender had an inherent and immediate impact on the right to </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination; no intermediate circumstance or third-party actor was required to connect 
the firm to the abuse. Or, in another example, a company chemical spillage that increases the 
instance of certain diseases amongst workers and communities has a direct impact on their right 
to health, with few or no intervening circumstances or third-party actors to connect the company 
to impact on the right.  
</p>
<p><b>Indirect cases 
</b></p>
<p>40. Indirect company involvement in the alleged abuses occurred in relation to eight of nine 
sectors, only excluding the pharmaceutical and chemical sector; and in four regions, Africa, Asia 
and the Pacific, Latin America and the Middle East. While the sample revealed no indirect cases 
of abuse in Europe and only one in North America, the majority of indirect cases made 
allegations that Western (European and North American) firms were contributing to or 
benefiting from third-party abuses abroad. Indirect cases affected workers and communities. 
There were no end-user-related cases in this grouping; however, as stated previously, the sample 
contained lower numbers of cases alleging impacts on this group.  
</p>
<p>41. Supply chain cases stood out from other indirect cases because the companies&#8217; connection 
to alleged abuses remained constant: firms, although a step removed, were viewed as responsible 
for human rights abuses in their supply chain. The allegations were primarily made against firms 
for the human rights abuses of first or second-tier suppliers.  
</p>
<p>42. Other indirect cases, connecting firms to the abuses of individuals, States or arms of a 
State, or other business enterprises, were more multidimensional; they set out descriptions of the 
activities of two or more actors - that of the third party or parties directly abusing rights and that 
of the firm perceived to contribute to or benefit from those abuses. Compared to supply chain 
cases, these indirect cases more frequently generated allegations of impact on the full range of 
rights, including both labour and non-labour rights. And alleged connections to abuse also 
varied, ranging from a firm&#8217;s mere presence in a region where abuses were occurring to a firm&#8217;s 
provision of loans to actors alleged to abuse human rights. Unlike direct and supply chain cases 
of abuse, these indirect cases frequently involved non-business actors, including States or arms 
of a State. The firm was viewed as contributing to or benefiting from the more direct violations 
of those State actors.  
</p>
<p><b>II. CONTEXTS OF ALLEGED CORPORATE  
IMPACT ON HUMAN RIGHTS 
</b></p>
<p>43. This section gives further context to the findings from chapter I. Alleged corporate impacts 
on the human rights of workers, communities and end-users are discussed. For each group, both 
direct and indirect forms of impact are presented. The discussion highlights the relevant sectors, 
regions, and corporate actions alleged to generate abuse of human rights. Where explicitly 
included in the allegations, the section also discusses company failures with regard to processes 
thought to facilitate respect of human rights, e.g., impact assessments, community consultations. 
Finally, case examples from various sectors are presented in each section, providing the alleged 
corporate actions and corresponding impacts.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Alleged impacts on workers 
</b></p>
<p>44. Forty-five per cent of all cases alleged impacts on the rights of workers, making 
up 34 per cent of direct cases and 60 per cent of indirect cases (see figure 7 below). The 
following provides a discussion of direct and indirect cases affecting workers.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Direct cases affecting workers 
</b></p>
<p>45. Thirty-four per cent of direct cases of alleged abuse affected workers, covering 25 countries, 
from all regions. The number of reported abuses was high considering that worker-related cases 
might benefit from judicial or other forums in many regions, and thus, may not be fully captured 
in our sample. Thus, this segment of abuses is more likely to represent those cases that are either 
not benefiting from a forum, although one may exist, including where claims may not be legally 
cognizable.  
</p>
<p>46. All sectors are alleged to violate the full range of worker rights (see figure 3) as well as a 
number of non-labour rights, such as the right to life, health, adequate food and housing, and 
security of the person. Even extractive firms, often associated with large-scale community 
impacts, are alleged to violate workers rights as much as those sectors more commonly cited for 
labour-related abuses.  
</p>
<p>47. Three cases are presented here to show what corporate acts were alleged to cause direct 
impacts on the rights of workers.  </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Extractive sector 
</b></p>
<p>48. Several extractive companies operating in South Africa were alleged to have a policy that 
prohibits subcontractors from accessing on-site medical facilities (including access to HIV/AIDS 
medications). This was alleged as a form of discrimination and also a violation of the 
subcontractors&#8217; right to a safe work environment and right to health. The companies were also 
alleged to discriminate against women in employment, reportedly failing to hire any women 
workers. It was stated that women then resorted to prostitution as a means to earn a living, 
generating impacts on the right to health of workers and the surrounding community because of 
the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the companies&#8217; area of operation. Contribution to HIV/AIDS 
infection was also seen to impact the right to work because those falling ill or sick were unable 
to continue employment. 
</p>
<p>49. Workers were also reported to have settled in shacks with no access to sewage, electricity, 
or piped water, prompting allegations that the companies impacted the right to adequate housing 
and raising issues of access to water. Finally, dust generated by firm&#8217;s operations were alleged to 
cause a long-term respiratory disease that had impacted its workers and possibly even the 
surrounding community, raising issues of impact on the right to health and right to work.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Food and beverage sector 
</b></p>
<p>50. A group of food and beverage firms from various regions were cited for abuse of the rights 
of female employees hired to promote the companies&#8217; alcoholic beverages (&#8220;beer promotion 
women&#8221;) in parts of Asia. In one Asian country, surveys found that beer promotion carries a 
strong social stigma. The common perception was that beer promotion was synonymous with sex 
work, putting beer promotion women at risk for abuse and harassment. It was alleged that up 
to 83 per cent of these women suffered harassment or abuse such as derogatory behaviour, 
unwanted sexual touching, physical and sexual abuse (including coerced sexual acts), and threats 
to personal safety. Several shootings were also reported where armed customers shot women 
workers, allegedly because they were not satisfied with the service. 
</p>
<p>51. The majority of beer promotion workers are employed on a commission-only basis, 
needing to meet quotas for sale of beverages to earn a wage. In order to earn enough to live, 
workers state that they need to sell enough to meet their targets, despite the risks to their safety. 
It is also alleged that quotas force women into prostitution with bar clientele to meet their sales 
targets, creating higher rates of exposure to and contraction of HIV/AIDS infections.  
</p>
<p>52. The allegations raised concerns over the workers&#8217; right to a safe work environment, right 
to life and security of the person as well as freedom from torture, cruel, and inhuman treatment. 
In addition, these allegations generated impacts on the right to health of workers and in some 
cases the right to work. The alleged increase in HIV/AIDS infections also raised concern of 
impact on the health of surrounding communities. The report called for the companies to provide 
HIV education and contribute to the cost of health care for workers who are HIV-positive.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  IT, electronics and telecommunications sector 
</b></p>
<p>53. An electronics firm was alleged to discriminate in hiring at its factory on the basis of 
gender, age, and marital status, violating the right to non-discrimination. The factory was also </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>alleged to impact the prohibitions against forced and child labour. Regarding forced labour, the 
company allegedly took workers&#8217; identity papers and made their return contingent upon worker 
performance. The factory also employed over 200 children under the age of 16, violating 
international prohibitions on child labour as well as local laws on the minimum age of 
employment. The latter also raised issues regarding freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment and the right to education. The company was alleged to pay less than a 
minimum wage after assigning extensive fines to its workers, withholding pay, and failing to pay 
overtime. It was also said to impact the right to a safe work environment by failing to provide 
safety training or provide safety equipment, including masks to prevent exposure to toxic fumes. 
The factory was furthermore said to violate local and international laws on work hours, 
with 70-90 work hours per week as commonplace. Company failures to approve requests to 
terminate employment were also cited as impacting the right to work because the employee was 
denied the freedom to seek other employment.  
</p>
<p>54. Moreover, company dormitories were reported to house 8-12 workers in one small room 
and to have no electrical appliances or ready access to water, impacting the right to adequate 
housing. Workers were also separated from family and not permitted leave, impacting the right 
to family life. The company provided no pension or work-related injury insurance in violation of 
local law, additionally impacting the international right to social security and right to health. 
Corrupt practices included falsification of documents for inspections and coaching workers on 
what to say during inspection interviews. 
</p>
<p>55. The three cases above reinforce the traditional view that companies should respect the 
rights of workers in the workplace. However, they indicate an additional expectation that 
companies also look outside the workplace to ensure respect of worker rights. Two of the above 
cases cited the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the area of a company&#8217;s operation and alleged company 
policies that put workers at further risk; they cite inadequate wages, sales quotas, and 
discrimination as company acts that raise worker exposure to external epidemics. Still another 
case shows that, where a company provides housing, this housing is expected to meet 
human rights standards.  
</p>
<p><b>Indirect cases affecting workers 
</b></p>
<p>56. Around 60 per cent of indirect cases of alleged abuse affected workers, 
covering 16 countries and four regions, with only one case reported in North America and 
none in Europe. Nearly three quarters of these cases involved allegations of abuse by company 
suppliers.<b>9</b> Supply chain cases came from five sectors: food and beverage; heavy manufacturing; 
IT, electronics and telecommunications; retail and consumer products; and a residual category 
&#8220;other&#8221;. Financial service firms were alleged to hold shares in or finance companies and projects 
known for labour abuse, accounting for 14 per cent of indirect cases affecting workers. The 
remaining cases were made against extractive-sector firms for connection to third-party abuse of 
workers.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  In the overall sample, 40 per cent of cases affecting workers were supply chain cases. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 21 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>57. Allegations of supply chain abuses were focused on incidents in the Asia and Pacific 
Region (40 of 57 cases), with a large number reported in China (17 cases) and Bangladesh 
(11 cases). Some reports of abuse in a company&#8217;s supply chain focused on only a few issues, for 
example, a report of child labour or forced labour, or a report on the overall health and safety 
conditions in a factory. Other cases provided more extensive reviews of the conditions within a 
factory, reporting on any abuse of worker rights - these cases often generated alleged impacts on 
the range of labour-related rights (see figure 3 above) as well as a number of non-labour rights 
(similar to the alleged impacts in direct cases).  
</p>
<p>58. Financial service firms were sometimes alleged as the primary financiers to companies 
linked with human rights abuse. One group of financial firms was alleged as the main investors 
in a company that used forced labour; another group was alleged to financially support a large 
retailer that is known for discrimination, forced and child labour, excessive work hours, unsafe 
work conditions, and frustrating employee efforts to organize.  
</p>
<p>59. Extractive firms were connected to alleged abuses of workers by contracted security forces 
that beat, killed, and tortured unauthorized workers. One country reportedly had over 100 such 
cases in a two-year period.  
</p>
<p>60. The following two examples illustrate allegations of abuse in a firm&#8217;s supply chain, 
allegations that made up the majority of indirect impacts on workers. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Retail and consumer products sector: supermarket retailers 
</b></p>
<p>61. A group of major supermarkets in the United Kingdom were alleged to benefit from 
sub-par working conditions and standards in their supply chains in Bangladesh, Costa Rica, and 
India. It was alleged that one of the supermarket&#8217;s suppliers obstructed employee attempts to 
organize, impacting the freedom of association and right to organize and participate in collective 
bargaining. The supplier was also alleged to discriminate in the employment of women, only 
hiring female workers for cheaper forms of labour. These allegations were accompanied by a 
report that a large number of contracted workers were abruptly fired and then rehired at a rate 
lower than the previously contracted rate. A number of workers were also shifted from 
permanent to temporary contracts. Both allegations generated impacts on the right to work. 
Wages were also reportedly under the minimum wage for hours worked, 12-15 hours a day, 
impacting the right to just and favourable remuneration and right to rest and leisure. In the light 
of these low wages, it was alleged that workers were unable to secure food, clothing and 
housing, impacting the right to all three. Finally, it was alleged that workers were routinely 
sprayed (aerial sprays) with chemicals and pesticides as they worked in the fields, impacting the 
right to a safe work environment and right to health.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Footwear manufacturers 
</b></p>
<p>62. The supplier to two major footwear retailers was alleged to require male employees to pay 
a fee for hire, resulting in discrimination against males in employment. This supplier&#8217;s workforce 
was reportedly 90 per cent female, alleged as both a result of affirmative discrimination and 
inability of men to pay the fee for hire. Workers were also paid per piece worked on, as opposed 
to hourly wages. The piece-rate wage was thought to lead to varying pay between work groups 
responsible for assembly of different pieces because the pace at which these pieces could be put </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>together varied. Yet, it was alleged that the work was essentially the same. This generated 
impacts on the right to equal pay for equal work. The wage scheme also impacted the right to 
work because it was alleged that when less orders were made, the workers were not able to work. 
Additionally, receiving a rate per piece verses an hourly rate was said to lead to periods where 
workers made less than a minimum wage. The supplier was further alleged to offer no paid leave 
of any kind, including holiday, maternity, wedding, or bereavement leave - impacting the right to 
rest and leisure and the right to family life.  
</p>
<p>63. The safety and health of workers was also at issue. Workers were allegedly using toxic 
chemicals without receiving any training on how to handle such substances, impacting their right 
to a safe work environment and right to health. And the supplier was alleged not to provide 
insurance for work-related accidents, impacting the right to health and the right to social 
security. Managers also allegedly conducted intrusive body searches of employees and subjected 
them to routine harassment and intimidation, impacting rights to security of the person, freedom 
from degrading treatment, and right to privacy. Workers were also reported to live in 
overcrowded spaces with 10 workers per room and to share a bathroom with 100 workers on the 
floor, impacting the right to adequate housing. Management was reported to regularly come into 
living spaces without permission, also impacting the right to privacy.  
</p>
<p>64. In indirect cases affecting workers, firms were mainly connected to supplier and other 
business abuses. For supplier abuses, the cases indicate an expectation that buyer firms not 
benefit from such abuse. They also indicate that buyers should know the environment from 
which they are purchasing goods, at least with regard to principal suppliers, the primary subjects 
of these cases.<b>10</b> For abuses committed by other business, the cases indicate an expectation that 
firms not contribute to or benefit from such third-party business abuse, for example, abuses of a 
client corporation, to which the firm has lent funds or provided other support, or abuses of a 
contracted service provider.  
</p>
<p><b>B.  Alleged impacts on communities 
</b></p>
<p>65. Forty-five per cent of all cases alleged impacts on the rights of communities, making 
up 50 per cent of direct cases and 40 per cent of indirect cases in the sample (see figure 8 below). 
The subsequent paragraphs provide a discussion of direct and indirect cases affecting 
communities.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>10
</b>  Several cases alleged that a buyer firm had actual knowledge of the conditions in its supply 
</p>
<p>chain yet failed to act in any way; one such assertion was made where a supplier factory 
collapsed killing 64 workers and injuring a number of others, stating that the firm gained 
knowledge through its inspections of the potential for the building to collapse. One case 
indicated that when there is knowledge of abuse, remediation is the preferred first course of 
action - in this case, the buyer knew of the abuse and chose to terminate the relationship with a 
supplier, it was alleged to fail to remediate, and also to contribute to the loss of employment 
of 800 workers. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 23 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Direct cases affecting communities 
</b></p>
<p>66. Nearly 50 per cent of direct cases of alleged abuse affected communities, covering 
over 30 countries from all regions. The complaints were made in relation to eight of the nine 
sectors, only excluding the financial services sector, whose involvement in alleged abuses was 
generally indirect (see below, indirect cases affecting communities). For direct cases affecting 
communities, impacts were alleged on the full range of non-labour rights (see figure 4 above) 
and in relation to at least one labour-related right, the right to work. In nearly 15 per cent of 
cases, the right to work was alleged to be impacted where there were negative impacts on the 
health of communities, unfulfilled promises to provide jobs, and taking or contamination of 
community land that was previously used for cultivating and selling crops.  
</p>
<p>67. The majority of allegations in this category involved company environmental impacts that 
were alleged to negatively affect the health and livelihood of local populations. Corporate 
impacts on water supplies were raised in almost 40 per cent of direct cases of abuse impacting 
communities. Another portion of complaints were made regarding the rights of indigenous 
communities and primarily focused on extractive sector operations.  
</p>
<p>68. In relation to the environment, a number of companies were cited as the top corporate air 
polluters, both in their regions of operation, and in some instances, the globe. This included 
companies from the following sectors: pharmaceutical and chemical; food and beverage; retail 
and consumer products; heavy manufacturing; infrastructure and utility; extractive; and 
agricultural (other). These cases were most frequently alleged to generate impacts on the 
community&#8217;s right to health. In addition, several firms in this grouping were alleged to have 
exceeded permitted production rates for carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon pollution is cited as the 
primary cause of climate change, which has been argued to have numerous human rights 
implications, including impacts on the rights to life and health.  </p>

<p>69. Other companies were alleged to release toxic chemicals into the environment surrounding 
their operations. This was alleged to poison local residents, grounds, and waters. The toxins were 
cited as the cause of cancers, reproductive diseases, and respiratory problems. In addition, the 
contamination of grounds and water supplies were alleged to kill both animals and aquatic life 
essential for sustenance in certain regions. These cases generated allegations of impact on the 
right to health, right to life, the right to food and the right to work, in cases where a farmer&#8217;s land 
was no longer cultivatable or locals suffered from toxin-related diseases that prevented them 
from working.  
</p>
<p>70. With regard to alleged impact on indigenous community rights (in this sample, these 
allegations were primarily made in relation to extractives), it was not always clear whether the 
dominant form of company involvement in the abuse was direct. Cases frequently coupled more 
direct forms of company involvement, for example, an alleged failure to obtain informed consent 
and environmental harms, with the abuses of third parties, whether private or public security 
forces or other arms of a State.<b>11</b> Nevertheless, impacts on indigenous community rights are 
included here because in many of these cases the overriding form of company involvement was 
direct. Some cases even alleged that firms made an express request for third-party abuse of 
indigenous rights, for example, requesting security forces to carry out abusive acts such as the 
offensive use of force and intimidation - a potentially direct form of involvement on the part of 
the company.  
</p>
<p>71. Additionally, this set of cases also alleged that environmental impact assessments (EIA) 
and environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA) were poorly carried out. Various 
concerns surrounded environmental impact assessments, including allegations that appropriate 
equipment was not used to carry out tests, that EIA results were not disclosed, that EIAs were 
not conducted in a timely manner, and that communities were not consulted and that informed 
consent (first requiring full information on environmental and other impacts) was not gained 
before commencing projects. A smaller number of cases alleged that no EIA was conducted; one 
alleged that the EIA was fraudulently certified.  
</p>
<p>72. The following examples provide views into alleged corporate abuse of community rights, 
the first highlighting allegations of environmental harms and resulting impacts on the human 
rights of communities, and the other highlighting alleged abuse of indigenous community rights.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Infrastructure and utility sector (environmental harms) 
</b>73. An infrastructure and utility company was involved in a joint project with two other firms. 
The firms allegedly caused a gas explosion that killed 8 people and caused a mud volcano that 
displaced over 15,000 persons, destroyed 10,000 homes, and additionally destroyed farmland, 
roadways, rail systems and other infrastructure. Furthermore, it was stated that the disaster

</p>
<p><b>11
</b>  Cases often alleged company failure to obtain informed consent, a direct company action (or 
</p>
<p>omission) that frequently led to alleged abuse of the right to self-determination as well as other 
rights. Sometimes in the same case a public security force was alleged to carry out killings and 
use intimidation to remove people from their land, a direct act of the security force and, where 
the removal related to a company project, an indirect form of involvement for the company. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>introduced toxins into the water supply, impacting fish and aquatic vegetation - a key source of 
income for area fisherman. This disaster was alleged to generate impacts on the rights to life, 
health, work, freedom of movement, adequate food and housing, and development-related rights. 
Company failure to compensate victims was viewed to sustain impacts on the above rights.  
</p>
<p><b>2.  Extractive sector (indigenous communities) 
</b>74. An extractive firm was alleged to fail to consult indigenous groups or gain informed 
consent before pursuing its projects, viewed to impact the right to self-determination in a number 
of regions. In one case, the company allegedly entered land despite protests of landowners, 
impacting the right to privacy. It was also alleged to contribute to the forced removal of 
indigenous peoples from their homes, the arrest of those who refused to leave, and the shooting 
of an individual during the demolition process, impacting the right to life, liberty, and security of 
the person and freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  
</p>
<p>75. Additionally, it was alleged that the company made no provision for the relocation and 
rehousing of indigenous peoples, impacting the right to adequate housing. The taking of land for 
company use was also alleged to impact the livelihood and culture of the indigenous group, 
depleting their ability to live off fisheries and pastures and impacting their right to culture. 
Pollution of fisheries, a primary food source, and ignoring requests to protect fisheries and 
pastures, was alleged to impact the right to food and self-determination.  
</p>
<p>76. Finally, it was alleged that the company failed to conduct an environmental impact 
assessment and failed to use appropriate equipment to detect toxins and other potentially harmful 
emissions, yet, used state of the art equipment to carry out its primary operations.  
</p>
<p>77. Impacts on local community rights such as those outlined above cover the range of civil 
and political, and economic, social and cultural rights. Key issues raised in relation to local 
indigenous communities are failure to seek informed consent, forced displacement, killings and 
violence, and environmental harms. These issues result in a range of impacts on the human rights 
of indigenous peoples, including rights to life, health, food, education, self-determination, 
privacy, freedom from torture, freedom of movement, minority rights to culture, and freedom of 
information. Allegations of abuse also occur in relation to other local communities surrounding 
company operations, for example, where a company releases chemicals and toxins into an area 
and causes visible deterioration of the health of inhabitants.  
</p>
<p>78. These allegations indicate an expectation that firms will incorporate community views in 
decision-making processes, gain informed consent, conduct impact assessments and otherwise 
respect community rights while carrying out projects.  
</p><p>79. Corporate actions are also connected to alleged impacts on the rights of the global 
community, poor records on pollution and other environmental harms are now being linked to 
impacts on the health of communities beyond those in the immediate area of a company&#8217;s 
operation - even where the effects are not immediately visible but the risk to health is imminent.  </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Indirect cases affecting communities 
</b></p>
<p>80. Around 40 per cent of indirect cases alleged impacts on communities, 
covering 16 countries and four regions, including Africa, Asia and the Pacific, Latin America, 
and the Middle East. Nearly all cases (almost 90 per cent) involved allegations that a company 
was contributing to or benefiting from State violations of human rights. These allegations came 
from four sectors: extractive; financial services; heavy manufacturing; and infrastructure and 
utility. The remaining cases concerned financial service firms&#8217; provision of loans to company 
projects that were alleged to abuse human rights.  
</p><p>81. Similar to direct cases, impacts were alleged on the range of non-labour rights (see figure 4 
above) as well as certain labour rights, such as the right to work.  
</p>
<p>82. The following paragraphs set out examples of contexts in which companies were alleged to 
contribute to or benefit from State abuse of human rights.  
</p>
<p><b>1.  Heavy manufacturing sector 
</b></p>
<p>83. A heavy manufacturing firm, which provides equipment and services for energy projects, 
was alleged to benefit from State abuses carried out to make way for construction of a dam. The 
State was alleged to displace around 50,000 individuals to make way for the project, failing to 
provide adequate compensation and resettlement options, generating impacts on the rights to 
adequate food, housing, and social security. The Government was also alleged to obstruct local 
community representation in meetings and negotiations related to the project, impacting the right 
to self-determination and right to hold opinions. Other allegations cited the State&#8217;s use of force 
and arbitrary arrests and detentions to quell voices opposing the project, noting that police forces 
killed two protesters and the whereabouts of those detained was unknown. These actions 
allegedly impacted the rights to life, to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment, and the right to a fair trial. The company was viewed to benefit from those violations. 
</p>
<p>84. Additionally, it was alleged that environmental-impact assessments were inadequate and 
that no assessment of the project&#8217;s destruction of cultural sites was undertaken, generating 
impact on minority rights to culture and potential future impacts on health as a result of 
environmental harms. Regarding the EIA, it was alleged that State agency approval was 
bypassed and no disclosures of the assessment were made, raising corruption questions. Lastly, it 
was stated that, overall, the project served as a development setback, leaving the community with 
less resources than before. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Financial services sector 
</b></p>
<p>85. One large financial institution provided loans to the Government for a project that was 
allegedly ousting indigenous communities from cultivated farmland. It was alleged that the bank 
contributed to the indigenous loss of land, homes, and ultimately, food and income from the sale 
of crops. In addition, it was stated that no provision for relocation of the indigenous community 
was made. The alleged actions generated impacts on the rights to work, self-determination, food, 
adequate housing, privacy and to social security. </p>

<p> A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
 page 27 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>86. Another case involved a group of financial institutions. It was alleged that the firms&#8217; 
provision of loans to a corrupt Government, one cited for extensive human rights violations, 
would frustrate efforts to make the Government more accountable. It was alleged that these firms 
would contribute to and fuel human rights violations and corruption. 
</p>
<p>87. The cases above suggest there is an expectation that business will not contribute to or 
benefit from violations of human rights, particularly by States, and that firms will not finance 
projects involving State or private actors known for abuse.  
</p><p>88. Business connection to State violations of human rights was alleged in various contexts, 
including where business provided the means for the State to commit the violation, whether 
physical means such as use of company products or property, or financial, by way of loans or 
revenues; and, where the State committed the violation in connection with the company&#8217;s 
project, violating rights in the course of making way for the project or during the project, in order 
eliminate or silence project opponents. This latter context gave rise to allegations that a 
company&#8217;s mere presence can fuel violations because some States were perceived to actively 
violate rights for gains from corporate investment.  
</p>
<p><b>C.  Alleged impacts on end-users 
</b></p>
<p>89. Ten per cent of all cases alleged that there were impacts on the rights of end-users (both 
actual and potential). Alleged impacts on end-users were present in the direct cases only, making 
up 16 per cent of direct cases in the sample (see figure 9 below). These cases occurred primarily 
as a consequence of company actions related to its own products or services. The following 
provides a discussion of direct cases affecting end-users. 
</p>
<p> </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Direct cases affecting end-users 
</b></p>
<p>90. Around 16 per cent of direct cases alleged impacts on end-users, categorized primarily in 
the &#8220;global&#8221; region because the alleged impacts occurred in a number of States and regions 
simultaneously. As discussed in the overview section of this report, end-user-related abuses 
might be underrepresented in the sample for this study. With the exception of two allegations in 
this group, all were made against pharmaceutical firms for policies and practices alleged to affect 
the right to health of end-users globally - and thus, also occupying a substantial portion of the 
&#8220;global&#8221; designation in the region of alleged incident chart (see figure 2 above). The remaining 
two cases involved a financial institution, which was alleged to have closed a client account on 
the grounds that the client was transgendered, and an electronics firm, alleged to use toxic flame 
retardants in its products.  
</p>
<p>91. Allegations against pharmaceutical firms centred on issues of access to essential medicines 
and lack of research into diseases primarily affecting people in poorer regions. These issues were 
connected to alleged impacts on a number of human rights, including the right to life, right to 
health, right to benefit from scientific progress, right to work, right to education, and the right to 
social security. The following example from the pharmaceutical sector illustrates the range of 
allegations made against pharmaceutical firms and resulting impacts on end-users.  
</p>
<p><b>Pharmaceutical sector (access to medicine) 
</b>92. An NGO report evaluated pharmaceutical firms&#8217; responses to health crises in emerging 
markets, reviewing 15 of the largest firms for their approaches to research, paediatric needs, drug 
accessibility, reporting, philanthropy, and political engagement. Firms were rated on access to 
essential medicine issues such as whether they conducted research on neglected diseases, 
formulated comparatively affordable and child friendly doses of medicines, sufficiently relaxed 
licensing and patents to permit introduction of generic medicines, and provided affordable 
pricing to low- and middle-income countries. In addition, companies were reviewed on the 
breadth of their reporting to shareholders, integration of philanthropic programmes into overall 
access-to-medicine programmes, and transparency of political contributions and trade 
association payments. Most firms received low ratings in one or more areas relating to access to 
essential medicine, impacting the right to life, right to health, and the right to benefit from 
scientific progress. Rights to education, work, and social security were also claimed as rights 
impacted by company restrictions on access to essential medicine or neglect in disease research.  
</p>
<p>93. With regard to HIV/AIDS, a number of firms received low scores on reports to 
shareholders; alleging that reports failed to make the business case for action, provide systematic 
reporting of goals and activities, or evidence of board level leadership. A lack of transparency of 
political contributions and trade payments was found for most firms, raising concerns over a 
firm&#8217;s public positions on public health issues as contrasted with their political and trade activity.  
</p>
<p>94. In regions facing health crises, the cases suggest that pharmaceutical companies producing 
vital drugs, such as HIV/AIDS medications, are at risk of allegations that they have prevented 
access to essential medicines. The allegations indicate that society expects global pharmaceutical 
firms to take additional steps in these circumstances, calling for positive steps such as research, 
relaxation of intellectual property restrictions, reduction of costs, or a thorough presentation of 
the business case for action to shareholders.  </p>

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Firms from a broad range of sectors have been alleged to abuse or contribute to the 
abuse of one or more human rights - covering the full range of human rights, including 
civil and political; economic, social and cultural; and labour-related rights. The sample 
reviewed for this study also included allegations that company actions or policies had 
impacts on the rights of persons in two or more of its areas of operations, generating 
impacts on a range of rights in a number of different regions and contexts simultaneously. 
Even the traditional notion of the workplace as the primary environment of concern for 
companies does not appear to hold in this sample of cases. Based on the allegations made 
over the past two years, it seems just as common for corporations to face accusations of 
impact on the rights of communities as it is for them to face accusations of impact on the 
rights of workers.</b> 
</p>
<p>96. <b>The alleged abuses also appear to have domino effects and point to the dangers of 
business taking a narrow look into impacts. While some company conduct does indeed 
have an immediately identifiable and discrete impact on human rights, such as where a 
firm engages in a single act of discrimination, abusive conduct more frequently indicates - 
or even creates - an environment where abuses multiply. For example, where a firm is 
alleged to fail in providing protective gear or training for employees handling toxic 
substances, the conduct in the first instance impacts the right to a safe work environment. 
But this conduct also provides the enabling environment for a multitude of other impacts 
on human rights, for example, impact on the right to life, right to health, and the right to 
work in cases where employees are injured and unable to continue employment.</b> 
97. <b>Company actions are also alleged to play into already existing social struggles, or 
worse, function to create new ones. In the cases, companies were urged to consider the 
consequences of actions and abuses in both the environments in which they occur and also 
in surrounding environments. For example, it was indicated that firms should consider the 
consequences of workplace policies on the rights of employees when they are outside of the 
workplace. This was apparent in cases where firms operated in environments facing high 
rates of HIV/AIDS infections, where some workplace policies were viewed to contribute to 
infection of workers, and ultimately, the community. The potential for magnification of 
impacts and abuse seemed particularly acute in already difficult operating environments. 
The cases show that taking actions without considering the full spectrum of potential 
impacts on rights may subject a firm to public scrutiny through campaigns and public 
reports of activities and related abuses.</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>Business may also face allegations for contributing to abuses carried out by other 
actors, whether suppliers, business partners or States. The allegations show that companies 
may face censure in the court of public opinion for contributing to or benefiting from such 
abuses and failing to take steps to stop it, even if actual courts might not necessarily find 
liability under current tests.</b></p>

<p>A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 
page 30 
 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>99. <b>In addition, a large number of environmental harms are now linked to alleged abuse 
of human rights. Given current global scale environmental concerns, corporations with 
poor environmental records are alleged to contribute to impacts on a range of rights in the 
communities surrounding their operations and, in some cases, the global community. 
Business is also scrutinized for its management of environmental impact assessment 
processes, viewed as a means to prevent impacts on both the environment and human 
rights.</b> 
</p>
<p>100. <b>Finally, based on this sample, corporate failure to respond to allegations of human 
rights impacts may result in further backlash and recurrence of complaints. A number of 
complaints that went without company response were resubmitted. At a minimum, this 
indicates that it is in a corporation&#8217;s interest to respond to these allegations without delay. 
Even though impacts can be complex and easily multiply, it is equally simple. Managing 
respect for human rights at the outset of company activities can eliminate or mitigate the 
unintended succession of abuses and accompanying risks.</b>
