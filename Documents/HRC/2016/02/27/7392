<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Since assuming his mandate in June 2014, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 as spared no effort to secure 
</p>
<p>cooperation of the concerned countries and to conduct a mission to Israel and the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, in order to have the opportunity of seeing, hearing and asking his own 
</p>
<p>questions directly to Palestinian victims and various witnesses regarding the situation of 
</p>
<p>human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. To that end, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>made great efforts to build a relationship of trust with representatives of both Israel and of 
</p>
<p>the State of Palestine.1  
</p>
<p>2. From the outset, together with thematic special procedures mandate holders, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur expressed serious reservations to the Government of Israel about the 
</p>
<p>nature of Israeli policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. Joint letters of 
</p>
<p>allegation and urgent appeals were sent on serious alleged violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and international human rights law. The concerns raised included the 
</p>
<p>alleged failures to abide by international legal principles leading to the killings of civilians 
</p>
<p>in the Gaza Strip during Israel&#8217;s 2014 military operation; the alleged excessive use of force 
</p>
<p>by Israeli security forces during a peaceful demonstration in the West Bank; and the steps 
</p>
<p>being taken by the Government of Israel, which would reportedly lead to the forced 
</p>
<p>eviction and forcible transfer of Palestinian Bedouin communities currently residing in the 
</p>
<p>central West Bank.2  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur appreciated the openness to dialogue shown by the 
</p>
<p>representatives of the Governments of Israel and Palestine in Geneva. In June 2014, 
</p>
<p>immediately after taking up his position, the Special Rapporteur informed them of his 
</p>
<p>intention to visit the Occupied Palestinian Territory. In response to a formal request to 
</p>
<p>undertake a country visit by the Special Rapporteur in August 2014, the Permanent 
</p>
<p>Observer Mission of State of Palestine expressed its willingness to assist with the mission, 
</p>
<p>including for consultations with relevant consultations and meetings with relevant 
</p>
<p>authorities. No formal response was received from the Permanent Mission of Israel. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur persevered in his efforts to seek access through informal dialogue with 
</p>
<p>the Permanent Representative of Israel in Geneva; as at late December 2014, however, none 
</p>
<p>had been granted.  
</p>
<p>4. Owing to the failure of Israel to provide full and free access to the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory, the present report is based primarily on information collected during 
</p>
<p>the first mission conducted by the Special Rapporteur to the region, including to Amman, 
</p>
<p>on 20 and 21 September 2014, and to Cairo, from 22 to 28 September 2014, to hold 
</p>
<p>interviews and briefings with, inter alia, victims, civil society representatives, human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and Palestinian officials. Representatives of United Nations entities and non-
</p>
<p>governmental organizations and Palestinian officials, including ministers, travelled to 
</p>
<p>Amman from the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to meet with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur.  
</p>
<p>5. Given the lack of access via Israel, the Special Rapporteur had hoped to visit Gaza 
</p>
<p>through the Rafah crossing; this was not possible, however, owing to circumstances beyond 
</p>
<p>his control. In order to hear directly from interlocutors based in Gaza, he held video and 
</p>
<p>teleconferences with those directly affected by the recent escalation of hostilities. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur extends his sincere appreciation to all those who provided him with 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 See A/69/301 and Corr.1. 
</p>
<p> 2 See A/HRC/28/85.  </p>


<p>testimony and information pertaining to the situation of human rights in the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory. He is also grateful for the full cooperation extended to him during the 
</p>
<p>mission by the Government of the State of Palestine and for the assistance given by the 
</p>
<p>Governments of Egypt and Jordan.  
</p>
<p>6. The report begins by addressing the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and the 
</p>
<p>impact of the latest round of violence between Israel, on the one hand, and Hamas and other 
</p>
<p>Palestinian armed groups, on the other, from 7 July to 26 August 2014. The information 
</p>
<p>recorded and provided by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) showed that 2,256 Palestinians were killed, of whom 1,563 were 
</p>
<p>civilians, including 538 children.3 The numbers speak volumes about the scale of the 
</p>
<p>devastation, but statistics alone cannot do justice to the intensity of human suffering or 
</p>
<p>explain the impact that the conflict will have on Palestinians living in Gaza for months and 
</p>
<p>years to come. It is hoped that the information and testimonies received by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur will provide a glimpse of the human narrative of those two tragic months and 
</p>
<p>illuminate some of the challenges and problems that lie ahead, particularly with regard to 
</p>
<p>health and education in Gaza.4  
</p>
<p>7. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur will also address a number of equally 
</p>
<p>important issues of serious concern affecting human rights in the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory and make a number of recommendations to the Government of Israel.  
</p>
<p>8. The present report is not an exhaustive account of the impact of Israeli occupation 
</p>
<p>policies and practices on the rights of Palestinians that were brought to the attention of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur. Indeed, there is a long list of pressing human rights issues that merit 
</p>
<p>attention: from the expansion of settlements to settler violence; discriminatory policies in 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem; and the involvement of businesses in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, to 
</p>
<p>name but a few. The Special Rapporteur intends to address these and other issues in future 
</p>
<p>reports. However, as a starting point, the Special Rapporteur has placed most weight on the 
</p>
<p>accounts he heard directly from the victims of the recent hostilities, and hopes to narrate 
</p>
<p>faithfully the ordeal of those who lived through the traumatic 51 days of conflict, focusing 
</p>
<p>in particular on the impact of children, who account for more than half the population of 1.8 
</p>
<p>million people in Gaza and represent the future of Palestine.  
</p>
<p>9. On a final introductory note, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that it is in Israel&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>own interest to grant the mandate holder full and unconditional access to Israel and the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory.5 The Special Rapporteur continues to believe that the 
</p>
<p>engagement of Israel would contribute to the effective and even-handed implementation of 
</p>
<p>the mandate. Cooperation with the mandate would be a manifestation of the responsibility 
</p>
<p>of a Member State to respect and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 erification of data continues.  
</p>
<p> 4 In the present report, the Special Rapporteur will not consider individual incidents of alleged 
</p>
<p>international law violations in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in the context of military operations 
</p>
<p>conducted since 13 June 2014, which a commission of inquiry was tasked to do by the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council in its resolution S-21/1.  
</p>
<p> 5 The request to enter Israel was made in order to meet with relevant Israeli authorities to discuss the 
</p>
<p>situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The Special Rapporteur is not 
</p>
<p>mandated to investigate the situation of human rights in Israel. </p>


<p><b> II. Situation of human rights in the Gaza Strip  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>10. As many Palestinians in Gaza reminded the Special Rapporteur, the seven-year 
</p>
<p>blockade by Israel, coupled with the access-restricted areas along its border often imposed 
</p>
<p>with excessive use of force by the Israel Defense Forces, forces the Palestinian people 
</p>
<p>living in Gaza to live in a perpetual state of humanitarian crisis.6 At the most basic level, 
</p>
<p>this has restricted Palestinian agriculture and fishing, and all too frequently impinged upon 
</p>
<p>the right to life of Palestinian farmers and fishermen. According to information provided by 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East 
</p>
<p>(UNRWA), the severe restrictions on imports and exports have also denied Palestinians in 
</p>
<p>Gaza the right to meaningful economic development and indeed dragged Gaza back 
</p>
<p>towards a state of de-development, leaving 80 per cent of the population chronically 
</p>
<p>dependent on aid. Frequent power shortages and periodic winter flooding have further 
</p>
<p>exacerbated living conditions for Palestinians in Gaza. Moreover, before the escalation of 
</p>
<p>hostilities during the summer of 2014, Palestinians in Gaza had lived through two previous 
</p>
<p>conflicts with Israel, in 2008 and 2009, and again in 2012, which led to destruction and 
</p>
<p>devastation. Israel may have withdrawn its soldiers from Gaza in the context of its 
</p>
<p>unilateral disengagement in 2005; in terms of the control over the territory it exercises, 
</p>
<p>however, it remains the occupying Power. 
</p>
<p>11. According to the OHCHR, in the latest round of violence between Israel on the one 
</p>
<p>hand, and Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on the other, from 7 July to 26 August 
</p>
<p>2014 (operation &#8220;Protective Edge&#8221;) 2,256 Palestinian fatalities were recorded, of whom 
</p>
<p>1,563 were civilians, including 538 children.
7
 This surpassed the combined number of 
</p>
<p>casualties of the two previous conflicts in Gaza. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and five 
</p>
<p>civilians were reportedly killed. The Special Rapporteur is aware that thousands of 
</p>
<p>indiscriminate rockets were reportedly fired by Palestinian armed groups from Gaza. The 
</p>
<p>stark disparity in casualty figures on the two sides, however, reflects the skewered balance 
</p>
<p>of power and the disproportionate cost borne by Palestinian civilians, raising questions as to 
</p>
<p>whether Israel adhered to the international law principles of distinction, proportionality and 
</p>
<p>precautions. The 51-day conflict, tempered only by fleeting humanitarian pauses, adversely 
</p>
<p>affected just about every human right, including the rights to adequate housing, health, 
</p>
<p>water, education, work and, last but not least, life. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Destruction of civilian homes and infrastructure  
</b></p>
<p>12. The most striking aspect of the military operations conducted by Israel was its 
</p>
<p>apparent deliberate targeting of civilian homes and multi-storey apartment blocks, which 
</p>
<p>resulted in entire families being buried under the rubble of their homes.8 In what many 
</p>
<p>witnesses cited as the most egregious example of disproportionality, a multi-storey 
</p>
<p>apartment block known as the &#8220;Gaza Twin Towers&#8221; was razed to the ground towards the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 The Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights have 
</p>
<p>consistently noted that the Israeli blockade of Gaza contravenes international law; see A/69/347, 
</p>
<p>paras. 30 &#8211; 34, and A/HRC/25/40, paras. 24 &#8211; 30.  
</p>
<p> 7 See Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance, Gaza Strip, Humanitarian Dashboard, 
</p>
<p>November 2014.

</p>
<p>2014. </p>


<p>end of Israeli military operations. Other apartment towers flattened by Israeli strikes 
</p>
<p>included the 12-storey al-Zafer tower 4, the Italian tower and the al-Basha tower. Countless 
</p>
<p>reports of schools, mosques and hospitals allegedly targeted during the military operations 
</p>
<p>were also received. An international non-governmental organisation reported that 25 
</p>
<p>ambulances of the Palestinian Red Crescent were also hit, including 12 that were either 
</p>
<p>destroyed or rendered inoperable. 
</p>
<p>13.  Prominent human rights defenders based in Gaza observed, &#8220;never in our lives have 
</p>
<p>we seen that level of destruction&#8221;, referring to certain neighbourhoods and towns that were 
</p>
<p>particularly hard hit, such as Shuja&#8217;iya, Khuza&#8217;a and Rafah. Even experienced humanitarian 
</p>
<p>workers, exposed to some of the worst conflict zones across the world, informed the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur that what they saw in Gaza was &#8220;shocking, by all accounts&#8221;. Three 
</p>
<p>months after the ceasefire, the impact of Israeli strikes on the water and sanitation facilities 
</p>
<p>in Gaza were still being felt, with 20 to 30 per cent of households, or 450,000 people, still 
</p>
<p>without access to municipal water because of the damage caused.9  
</p>
<p>14. UNRWA schools serving as emergency shelters for internally displaced persons, the 
</p>
<p>exact position of which had been notified to the Israeli Defense Forces, were allegedly 
</p>
<p>targeted by shells or other munitions on at least seven separate occasions, resulting in at 
</p>
<p>least 42 deaths, including 11 UNRWA staff members. In one incident involving a UNRWA 
</p>
<p>school in Jabaliya, on 30 July, Israeli shelling allegedly killed 16 people and injured 
</p>
<p>another 100. According to UNRWA, it had already informed the Israeli military authorities 
</p>
<p>of the location of the school 17 times, including once only a few hours prior to the attack. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur notes that the Secretary-General established, in November 2014, a 
</p>
<p>board of inquiry to review and investigate a number of specific incidents in which death or 
</p>
<p>injuries occurred at and/or damage was done to United Nations premises. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is also aware that Israel has established its own fact-finding assessment 
</p>
<p>mechanism and has opened a number of criminal investigations into certain selected cases 
</p>
<p>of alleged violations of international law. It remains to be seen if this can bring any measure 
</p>
<p>of meaningful accountability to Palestinian victims in the light of the criticism levelled by 
</p>
<p>observers to date.10  
</p>
<p><b> C. Mass displacement  
</b></p>
<p>15. At the height of the escalation of hostilities, an estimated 500,000 people were 
</p>
<p>internally displaced across Gaza, many of them forced to take shelter in UNRWA schools,11 
</p>
<p>government-run schools or with extended family or friends.12 Many of the school buildings 
</p>
<p>were not designed to serve as shelters, and the sheer number of internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>seeking shelter reportedly resulted in severe overcrowding and put a considerable strain on 
</p>
<p>sanitation facilities. According to a humanitarian aid worker who visited the schools, the 
</p>
<p>general overcrowding of schools with limited capacity had led to a lack of privacy for 
</p>
<p>families and inadequate hygiene and sanitation conditions that brought about various stress-

</p>
<p> 11 As at October 2014, 18 UNRWA school buildings still served as collective centres for approximately 
</p>
<p>38,346 internally displaced persons, an estimated 60 per cent of whom are children.  
</p>
<p> 12 As at November 2014, an estimated 100,000 people were still internally displaced in Gaza and in 
</p>
<p>need of immediate assistance. See Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance, &#8216;Gaza 
</p>
<p>Strip: Humanitarian Dashboard&#8217;, November 2014  </p>


<p>related ailments, including dermatological conditions. Beyond the school shelters, host 
</p>
<p>families were also reportedly rapidly overwhelmed by the burden of having to host as many 
</p>
<p>as 30 extended family members and relatives, putting considerable financial and 
</p>
<p>psychological strain on all family members. The desperation was summed up by a woman 
</p>
<p>who, exasperated, told a United Nations staff member distributing food items that, &#8220;I don&#8217;t 
</p>
<p>want food; I want a future for my children&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>16. A Palestinian human rights defender originally from Shuja&#8217;iya explained that &#8220;those 
</p>
<p>people&#8217;s minds were as hard as a rock and so attached to their land that they would never 
</p>
<p>leave so easily&#8221;. Nonetheless, within minutes of the Israeli assault on that particular 
</p>
<p>neighbourhood on 20 July, he recalled how the bombs, tank shells and naval artillery 
</p>
<p>&#8220;shook the ground like an earthquake and opened the gates of hell&#8221;. By 6 p.m., 150,000 
</p>
<p>people were reportedly trying to flee the area. A Palestinian staff member of a non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization, speaking also as a mother and former resident from Beit 
</p>
<p>Hanoun, described how the Israelis had called and ordered them to evacuate their home. 
</p>
<p>&#8220;We only had a few moments to gather important documents and to take the children out&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>she said. &#8220;When you look at the framed photos of family and friends on the wall and feel 
</p>
<p>the warmth of your own home, it&#8217;s not easy to just leave not knowing if you will ever come 
</p>
<p>back again.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>17. Israel reportedly gave warnings prior to some airstrikes by telephone, text messaging 
</p>
<p>and leaflet drops across the Gaza Strip. Palestinian human rights defenders, however, 
</p>
<p>explained that, in such a confined and densely populated area, for many people there was 
</p>
<p>simply nowhere to run, no safe passage or safe haven, not even in the United Nations 
</p>
<p>shelters. This was particularly the case for the most vulnerable residents: young children, 
</p>
<p>the elderly, pregnant women and the physically disabled. Some witnesses pointed out that 
</p>
<p>young Palestinians in Gaza would choose to go from one potential death in Gaza to another 
</p>
<p>by crossing the Mediterranean in rickety boats in an attempt to reach Europe, which showed 
</p>
<p>and how desperate people were to leave Gaza.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Civilian casualties: families and children  
</b></p>
<p>18. According to OHCHR, some 69 per cent of the Palestinians killed during the 
</p>
<p>hostilities in Gaza were civilians. An Israeli organization compiling its own statistics on 
</p>
<p>Palestinian fatalities has so far found the Palestinian civilian to combatant casualty ratio to 
</p>
<p>be somewhat lower, at 48 per cent.
13
</p>
<p> On both counts, serious questions arise with regard to 
</p>
<p>Israel&#8217;s adherence to the principles of international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>19. The most striking aspect of the most recent conflict was the way in which most 
</p>
<p>civilian victims were not simply bystanders on the street in the wrong place at the wrong 
</p>
<p>time. As the Special Rapporteur heard time and again, most victims were families killed in 
</p>
<p>missile strikes on their own homes, usually at night. Palestinian human rights defenders 
</p>
<p>noted that some entire families, including the Najar and Abu Kaware families, were 
</p>
<p>&#8220;simply wiped off the registries&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>20. In the non-exhaustive list of cases brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, 
</p>
<p>almost all of the families listed lost one or more infants or children, killed in attacks on 
</p>
<p>their homes. In some cases, pregnant women and elderly persons were also killed. This 
</p>
<p>non-exhaustive list includes the following names: Al-Haj, Al-Batsh, Al-Awdat, Shuheebar, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 13 This ratio is based on 54 per cent of verified fatalities. See Meir Amit Intelligence and Terrorism

<p>were killed in the vicinity of their houses, in some cases while attempting to flee.14  
</p>
<p>21. The most recent round of conflict was in fact far deadlier for children than the 
</p>
<p>previous hostilities in 2008 and 2009 and in 2012. On average, 10 children died every day 
</p>
<p>over a period of 50 days &#8211; an appalling statistic by any measure, which cannot be dismissed 
</p>
<p>as collateral damage. According to UNRWA, the conflict over the summer resulted in up to 
</p>
<p>1,500 new orphans, including at least 560 UNRWA students, who were in need of sustained 
</p>
<p>child protection and welfare support. Palestinian human rights organizations described the 
</p>
<p>reported high civilian toll as &#8220;a direct consequence of Israel&#8217;s large scale, deliberate and 
</p>
<p>systematic military attacks against family homes&#8221;. All the information received to date by 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur supports the validity of this claim.  
</p>
<p>22. Israel has justified its use of force against civilian infrastructure by noting that 
</p>
<p>Palestinian armed groups had fired rockets indiscriminately from the above-mentioned 
</p>
<p>facilities.15 However, the testimonies heard by the Special Rapporteur from human rights 
</p>
<p>defenders and victims from Gaza, collaborated by the sheer scale of destruction that can be 
</p>
<p>seen in satellite imagery made available by the United Nations, raises serious questions as 
</p>
<p>to whether the Israel Defense Forces adhered to principles of proportionality and 
</p>
<p>distinction.16 It is also relevant to recall that the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth 
</p>
<p>Geneva Convention affirmed in its declaration of 17 December 2014 that &#8220;no violation of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law by any party to a conflict can relieve the other party from its 
</p>
<p>own obligations under international humanitarian law&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>23. Long after the ceasefire, unexploded remnants of war continue to pose a threat, 
</p>
<p>particularly to children in Gaza. It is estimated that 7,000 unexploded ordinances are still 
</p>
<p>littered across the Gaza Strip under the rubble and debris of flattened neighbourhoods. At 
</p>
<p>the end of October 2014, the United Nations Mine Action Service reported at least seven 
</p>
<p>civilian fatalities as a result of unexploded remnants of war, and 14 others injured.17 In the 
</p>
<p>latest such incident, on 4 December 2014, four Palestinian women, including three children, 
</p>
<p>were reportedly injured (two of them with serious shrapnel wounds) at the home of the Abu 
</p>
<p>Mer&#8217;ie family when one family member picked up an oddly shaped piece of metal. The 
</p>
<p>family had just returned to their house in the al-Zaytoun neighbourhood in Gaza City a few 
</p>
<p>days earlier in order to carry out repairs.18

<p>24. In August 2014, the Special Rapporteur addressed a letter of allegation to the 
</p>
<p>Government of Israel on emblematic cases of alleged disproportionate or indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>attacks that had resulted in the killing of innocent civilians, including children. While no 
</p>
<p>response to the letter had been received as at 9 December 2014, the Military Advocate 
</p>
<p>General ordered a number of cases to be closed, including one of the cases raised by the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
</p>
<p>arbitrary executions regarding the killing of two disabled Palestinian women at a care 
</p>
<p>centre in Beit Lahiya on 12 July 2014.19 
</p>
<p><b> E. Right to health  
</b></p>
<p>25. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Heath, more than 11,100 Palestinians, 
</p>
<p>including 3,374 children, were injured during the hostilities in July and August 2014.20 
</p>
<p>Ministry officials noted that an estimated 3,500 patients were admitted to hospital requiring 
</p>
<p>surgical interventions. Many Palestinians, including children, are now struggling with life-
</p>
<p>long disabilities. An estimated 30 per cent of children in Gaza were exposed to high levels 
</p>
<p>of traumatic stress. Tens of thousands of men, women and children live with the trauma of 
</p>
<p>having witnessed the horrific killings of family members, friends and neighbours before 
</p>
<p>their own eyes.  
</p>
<p>26. Health professionals based in Gaza recounted to the Special Rapporteur that, while 
</p>
<p>treating dozens of patients every day in the emergency ward, the hospitals where they 
</p>
<p>worked also came under attack from Israeli airstrikes and shelling. A representative of the 
</p>
<p>World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 75 hospitals, primary health centres and 
</p>
<p>clinics were damaged and in need of repair or maintenance. One hospital (Al Wafa) and 
</p>
<p>five other primary health centres had been totally destroyed, while two others and five 
</p>
<p>clinics had sustained major damage; 63 health-care facilities suffered minor damage. In one 
</p>
<p>attack, on 19 July, the Shuhada al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza was hit by multiple rounds 
</p>
<p>of tank shells, reportedly killing one patient, a nurse and three medical staffers. The same 
</p>
<p>attack destroyed the operating theatres and life support units of the hospital, severely 
</p>
<p>hampering its ability to care for patients.  
</p>
<p>27. The right to health for the population in Gaza during the conflict was affected not 
</p>
<p>only by direct hits on hospitals and medical facilities (a total of 23 medical personnel were 
</p>
<p>reportedly killed), but also as a result of the lack of access to medical facilities. Health 
</p>
<p>professionals pointed out that the precarious security conditions made it difficult for staff 
</p>
<p>and patients alike to reach hospitals and clinics. Access was reportedly severely limited to 
</p>
<p>an estimated 60 per cent of primary health centres, while some 30 per cent of medical 
</p>
<p>personnel had no regular access to their workplaces. Palestinian doctors also explained to 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur that treating patients with pre-existing health conditions had been 
</p>
<p>complicated by the loss of patient records, destroyed following airstrikes on medical 
</p>
<p>facilities.  
</p>
<p>28. Around 600 patients were reportedly referred for treatment outside of Gaza, 
</p>
<p>including in hospitals in the West Bank, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey and Germany, given the 
</p>
<p>lack of medical equipment and specialised doctors available in Gaza. In September 2014, 
</p>
<p>many of these patients from Gaza were still being treated abroad, separated from their 
</p>
<p>families in a foreign environment in need of continuous monitoring following surgical

</p>
<p>during Operation 'Protective Edge' &#8211; Update No. 2, 7 December 2014 
</p>
<p> 20 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Gaza Crisis Appeal, September 2014 Update

<p>interventions. These relatively fortunate patients accounted for, however, only a fraction of 
</p>
<p>the thousands of Palestinians in need of treatment unavailable within Gaza, but not granted 
</p>
<p>permits by Israel to leave the territory. Palestinian doctors and health professionals in Gaza 
</p>
<p>explained that the inadequacy of their own medical facilities and the lack of trained 
</p>
<p>specialists were a consequence of the years of blockade that prohibited the import of 
</p>
<p>potential &#8220;dual-use&#8221; materials and the travel restrictions imposed by the Israeli authorities 
</p>
<p>that prevented young doctors and medical personnel from receiving advanced medical 
</p>
<p>training abroad. 
</p>
<p>29. In such circumstances, Palestinian health specialists pointed out that the presence of 
</p>
<p>a number of foreign doctors in Gaza during the conflict had helped considerably, but could 
</p>
<p>not compensate for the inadequate facilities available in Gaza. According to health 
</p>
<p>specialists in Gaza, the medical equipment most needed included radioscopy, ultrascan and 
</p>
<p>optical equipment, as well as drugs, vaccines and other basic disposables, such as gloves 
</p>
<p>and gauze. The electricity crisis that resulted from the strike on the only power station in 
</p>
<p>Gaza on 29 July, during Israeli military operations, also weighed heavily on the provision 
</p>
<p>of health care, as back-up generators were pushed to the limit.  
</p>
<p>30. On 21 September 2014, the Special Rapporteur visited King Hussein hospital in 
</p>
<p>Amman where a number of Palestinian patients from Gaza were being treated. One young 
</p>
<p>Palestinian woman had been injured when three Israeli missiles hit her family home near 
</p>
<p>Khan Younis without any warning on the evening of 8 July 2014. Her three brothers and 
</p>
<p>grandmother were killed instantly, and a total of 12 family members suffered injuries. She 
</p>
<p>suffered further injuries when the ambulance, which was evacuating her, was hit on route to 
</p>
<p>the hospital, resulting in a serious injury to her hip and shrapnel injuries across her body. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur also met with a 14 year-old girl from Beit Hanoun, who lost 
</p>
<p>both her legs and suffered shrapnel wounds and internal injuries when, on 25 July 2014, an 
</p>
<p>Israeli strike hit a UNRWA school, which was being used as a shelter. Her distraught father 
</p>
<p>recounted that she had lost her mother and three brothers in the same attack. According to 
</p>
<p>his testimony, they had decided to evacuate their home a week after the start of hostilities. 
</p>
<p>They first sought shelter at Beit Hanoun hospital, but had moved on to the UNRWA school 
</p>
<p>serving as an emergency shelter, which they thought a safe haven. Despite the visible pain 
</p>
<p>on the girl&#8217;s face, she expressed her eagerness to return to school, and shared her dream: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, I want to become a teacher&#8221;. Children with conflict-inflicted disabilities will 
</p>
<p>certainly require long-term care and support at both school and home. Doctors, health 
</p>
<p>professionals and teachers all highlighted the long-term consequences for the population at 
</p>
<p>large. 
</p>
<p>32. Community health workers in Gaza informed the Special Rapporteur that they were 
</p>
<p>already dealing with many new cases of children suffering from bedwetting, difficulties in 
</p>
<p>sleeping, nightmares, panic attacks, speech problems, a loss of appetite and alienation from 
</p>
<p>parents. Among other recent findings, the Special Rapporteur received an increasing 
</p>
<p>number of reports of physical violence against children within their families and 
</p>
<p>communities occurring in the context of increased stress faced by parents and relatives. 
</p>
<p>There were also reportedly cases of sexual abuse, particularly of adolescent girls in shelters 
</p>
<p>and in host communities.21  
</p>
<p>33. Israel reportedly justified its strikes on schools and hospitals in Gaza by claiming 
</p>
<p>that militants were firing rockets from inside those premises; according to the Palestinian 
</p>
<p>doctors from Gaza who spoke with the Special Rapporteur, no rockets had been fired from 
</p>

</p>
<p> 21 Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Humanitarian Bulletin, Monthly Report, 
</p>
<p>October 2014.    </p>


<p>within hospitals. The doctors added that, in any case, they should not be punished for what 
</p>
<p>occurred in the vicinity of hospitals. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>34. Two months of Israeli military operations in Gaza also had a profound impact on 
</p>
<p>access to education and disrupted schooling for children in Gaza. A total of 228 schools 
</p>
<p>(approximately one third) of all schools, including 83 UNRWA schools, were damaged 
</p>
<p>during the attacks; 26 schools were totally destroyed or damaged beyond repair. Schools in 
</p>
<p>Gaza reopened three weeks late, on 14 September 2014, and began with an initial period of 
</p>
<p>psychosocial support and recreational activities for children.22 With on average only one 
</p>
<p>counsellor per school, however, education experts in Gaza raised concerns about the 
</p>
<p>shortage of trained teachers qualified to offer adequate psychosocial support to children. 
</p>
<p>Education specialists added that teachers themselves had been victims of traumatic 
</p>
<p>experience and would also require appropriate support.  
</p>
<p>35. According to the Education Cluster, which brings together non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, United Nations agencies, academics and other partners under the shared goal 
</p>
<p>of ensuring predictable, well-coordinated and equitable provision of education for 
</p>
<p>populations affected by humanitarian crises, attendance at the start of the year was mixed as 
</p>
<p>a result of the massive internal displacement of Palestinian families. UNRWA and 
</p>
<p>Government-run schools allowed the transfer of displaced students to schools closer to their 
</p>
<p>current places of residence, but some 87 schools were still operating double shifts. A 
</p>
<p>number of teachers expressed concerns that overcrowded classrooms of up to 60 pupils 
</p>
<p>affected the quality of education. Education specialists also pointed out that many of the 
</p>
<p>schools that served as shelters during the conflict had valuable equipment damaged or 
</p>
<p>missing. 
</p>
<p>36. Schools in Gaza are already reportedly seeing more aggressive behaviour in pupils, 
</p>
<p>while mental health specialists have warned that the traumatic events experienced by 
</p>
<p>children during the conflict would have a lasting impact on cognitive development and have 
</p>
<p>broader social implications. Community health workers also expressed concern that, in 
</p>
<p>some children, their traumatic experience could nurture a desire for revenge. It was also 
</p>
<p>unclear whether schools would be able to cope with any influx of disabled children 
</p>
<p>requiring specialized educational assistance. 
</p>
<p>37. In Gaza, the higher education sector, which serves up to 95,000 students, was also 
</p>
<p>seriously affected by the hostilities. Many of the 28 higher education institutions in Gaza 
</p>
<p>were damaged during the conflict. The hostilities also affected the number of new 
</p>
<p>enrolments for the new term. Education specialists noted, however, that the blockade was 
</p>
<p>also responsible for changing the views of parents about the value of investing in higher 
</p>
<p>education for their children in the context of perpetually high unemployment rates and the 
</p>
<p>lack of job prospects for highly qualified graduates. Schools moreover lacked essential 
</p>
<p>equipment and resources to motivate students and were unable to offer opportunities for 
</p>
<p>academic exchanges or to bring in foreign expertise to contribute to the development of 
</p>
<p>students.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 22 UNRWA reportedly coordinated with the Ministry of Education to make use of its satellite television 
</p>
<p>channel and self-learning materials in order to make education accessible to all children in Gaza, 
</p>
<p>including those not residing in UNRWA shelters. </p>


<p><b> G. Recovery and reconstruction efforts 
</b></p>
<p>38. The rebuilding of lives and livelihoods following intensive bombardment, mortar 
</p>
<p>fire and ground operations across Gaza is a momentous task that will continue for some 
</p>
<p>time to come. The Palestinian Government of National Consensus reportedly estimated the 
</p>
<p>cost of relief, recovery and reconstruction for Gaza at $4 billion. The international 
</p>
<p>community pledged up to $5.4 billion for Gaza reconstruction at the donor conference held 
</p>
<p>in Cairo in October 2014, but many pledges have not been fulfilled. UNRWA had 
</p>
<p>estimated the total funding required for the provision of rental subsidies to families with no 
</p>
<p>alternative shelter, reconstruction of destroyed homes and repair for those with damage at 
</p>
<p>$720 million; as at December 2014, however, only $100 million had been pledged, leaving 
</p>
<p>a shortfall of $620 million. According to UNRWA, the impact of ceasing payments to 
</p>
<p>affected families would be dramatic, forecasting that tens of thousands of refugee families 
</p>
<p>would find themselves with inadequate shelter and no support during the harshest months 
</p>
<p>of winter.23 
</p>
<p>39. Some 100,000 people remain displaced and in need of continuing assistance; 
</p>
<p>450,000 are disconnected from the water network owing to damage and/or low pressure, 
</p>
<p>while approximately 22,000 housing units require rebuilding or substantial repair. Despite 
</p>
<p>the Gaza reconstruction mechanism brokered by the United Nations and that came into 
</p>
<p>effect in early November, the delivery of essential building materials has been painfully 
</p>
<p>slow. Four months after the ceasefire and with the onset of winter, the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process conceded, during a visit to Gaza in 
</p>
<p>December 2014, that the operating environment continued to face many challenges, 
</p>
<p>including a fragile and informal ceasefire that had not yet solidified and a lack of 
</p>
<p>empowerment of the Government of National Consensus in Gaza with no control over the 
</p>
<p>crossings. Such difficult issues, coupled with insufficient financial assistance from donors, 
</p>
<p>had only worsened the atmosphere in an already devastated Gaza. As the Special 
</p>
<p>Coordinator stated during his briefing to the Security Council a few days later, &#8220;this 
</p>
<p>temporary mechanism is not a substitute for the lifting of all closures on Gaza as laid out in 
</p>
<p>Security Council resolution 1860 (2009)&#8221;.24  
</p>
<p>40. After 51 days of bombardment, the conditions of life in Gaza have shifted ever 
</p>
<p>closer to the dismal forecast made in 2012 by the United Nations country team, which 
</p>
<p>questioned whether Gaza would be a liveable place by 2020.25 The shortages in 
</p>
<p>construction materials and related price hikes have contributed to an already high level of 
</p>
<p>unemployment generally, but particularly in the construction sector, which used to absorb 
</p>
<p>10 per cent of the Gaza workforce, and also increased rates of poverty and food insecurity. 
</p>
<p>In a report on assistance to the Palestinian people, the United Nations Conference on Trade 
</p>
<p>and Development found that Israeli constraints in general and restrictions on the mobility of 
</p>
<p>Palestinian workers in particular across the Occupied Palestinian Territory had had a 
</p>
<p>disproportionately high impact on Palestinian women.26 Information received by the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur also indicated that the widespread poverty and retreat of discouraged 
</p>
<p>Palestinian men from the labour market is a consequence of the lack of employment 
</p>
<p>opportunities. Human rights defenders in Gaza repeatedly stressed that the humanitarian

<p>crisis and the denial of basic human rights in Gaza was an entirely man-made result of the 
</p>
<p>prolonged occupation and blockade, arguing that people in Gaza have the skills, 
</p>
<p>knowledge, capability and determination to achieve sustainable peace based on human 
</p>
<p>rights and to pursue sustainable economic development without reliance on international 
</p>
<p>aid if only the blockade were lifted and the occupation ended.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of human rights in the West Bank  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Excessive use of force by Israeli security forces  
</b></p>
<p>41. According to OHCHR, in 2014 alone there were at least 50 Palestinian fatalities in 
</p>
<p>incidents involving Israeli security forces in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, a 
</p>
<p>figure almost double the 27 Palestinian fatalities reported in 2013 in similar 
</p>
<p>circumstances.27 Most worryingly, information available to the Special Rapporteur suggests 
</p>
<p>that these incidents are not isolated, but part of an increasing pattern whereby Palestinian 
</p>
<p>civilians (often children) who pose no serious threat to Israeli security forces are 
</p>
<p>deliberately shot and injured with rubber-coated steel bullets, or increasingly killed with 
</p>
<p>live ammunition by &#8220;trigger-happy&#8221; soldiers.28  
</p>
<p>42. The period of heightened tensions across the Occupied Palestinian Territory, from 
</p>
<p>12 June to 31 August 2014, also witnessed a striking increase in the lethal use by Israel of 
</p>
<p>force in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, leading to the death of 27 Palestinians, 
</p>
<p>including five children, the youngest of which was only 11 years old. These reported 
</p>
<p>killings have continued in recent months. On 16 October 2014, a 13-year-old child was shot 
</p>
<p>with live ammunition allegedly by Israeli security forces and killed in the village of Beit 
</p>
<p>Liqya in Ramallah governorate. The boy had reportedly been shot on his way back from the 
</p>
<p>village&#8217;s playground and was not participating in clashes involving stone-throwing by 
</p>
<p>Palestinian youths taking place at around the same time, some 150 metres away from the 
</p>
<p>site of the incident.29  
</p>
<p>43. The actions taken by the Israeli security forces appear to be at odds with the Basic 
</p>
<p>Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. The 
</p>
<p>plausibility of the use of firearms in self-defence or the defence of others against the 
</p>
<p>imminent threat of death or serious injury is questionable in many of the cases involving 
</p>
<p>Palestinians exercising their right to peaceful protest.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to peaceful protest 
</b></p>
<p>44. Concerns at the excessive use of force by Israeli security forces in the context of 
</p>
<p>peaceful demonstrations received, ironically, global attention on Human Rights Day in 
</p>
<p>2014, when a Palestinian Minister, Ziad Abu Ein, died following confrontations with Israeli 
</p>
<p>security forces during an olive tree planting ceremony celebrating Human Rights Day and 
</p>
<p>protesting against an illegal Israeli settlement outpost nearby the occupied West Bank 
</p>
<p>village of Turmus&#8217;aya. On the same day in Jalazone refugee camp in the West Bank, Israeli 
</p>
<p>security forces reportedly shot a 14-year-old Palestinian boy in the head with live

</p>
<p>45. According to a Palestinian non-governmental organization, in an incident on 31 
</p>
<p>August 2014, a 16-year-old Palestinian youth was allegedly shot in the head with a rubber-
</p>
<p>coated bullet and killed by Israeli security forces in the Wadi al-Joz neighbourhood of East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem. The youth was reportedly going to the mosque when he was caught up in 
</p>
<p>clashes between Palestinian youths and Israeli security forces. 
</p>
<p>46. Television audiences across the world witnessed closed-circuit television footage

<p>capturing the moments, on 15 May 2014 in the town if Beituniya in the West Bank, when 
</p>
<p>two Palestinian teenagers, Nadim Nuwara and Muhammad Salama, were shot and killed. 
</p>
<p>Neither of the teenagers posed any immediate threat to Israeli security forces, which were

<p>positioned more than 60 metres away. A member of the Israeli paramilitary border police

<p>No arrest has been made in connection with the killing of Muhammad Salama. 
</p>
<p>47. On 12 November 2014, the Government of Israel responded to a joint letter of 
</p>
<p>allegation addressed in August by the Special Rapporteur and several thematic mandate 
</p>
<p>holders regarding the case of the reported killing of civilians during peaceful 
</p>
<p>demonstrations in the West Bank in July, including that of Hashem Khader Abu Maria, 
</p>
<p>who worked as coordinator for Defence for Children International, and of two others. In its 
</p>
<p>response, the Government pointed out that the civilians had been &#8220;killed during violent 
</p>
<p>clashes between Palestinians and Israeli security forces &#8230; in the course of which Israel 
</p>
<p>Defense Forces soldiers were subject to severe acts of violence, including the throwing of 
</p>
<p>stones, Molotov cocktails, and improvised explosives&#8221;. The Government added that a 
</p>
<p>criminal investigation had been immediately opened into the incidents, but that, &#8220;in light of 
</p>
<p>the highest concerns given to the integrity of the investigation, and in accordance with the 
</p>
<p>law, the Criminal Investigations Department cannot disclose information regarding on-
</p>

<p>48. Over the past three years, the number of Israeli search operations in Palestinian

</p>
<p>considerably, from 293 operations in 2012 to 568 operations during the period from 
</p>
<p>January to September 2014. This has resulted in more Palestinian refugees injured and

</p>
<p>49. The repeated incursions by Israeli security forces into Palestinian communities have 
</p>
<p>not been without consequences. A needs assessment conducted by UNRWA on the mental 
</p>
<p>health of Palestine refugee children throughout the West Bank in October and November 
</p>
<p>2014 found that 37 per cent of sampled Palestine refugee children from camps, and 51 per 
</p>
<p>cent of sampled children from Bedouin communities, reported witnessing Israeli security 
</p>
<p>forces breaking into their homes, while some 13 per cent of sampled refugee and Bedouin 
</p>
<p>children reported witnessing the killing or injury of a relative or friend by explosive objects 
</p>
<p>and materials left behind by the Israeli security forces. It was found that 22 per cent of 
</p>
<p>sampled Palestine refugee children in camps and 44 per cent of sampled Bedouin children 
</p>
<p>were at greater risk of having a psychiatric disorder. Since February 2014, UNRWA has 
</p>
<p>been providing psychosocial counselling services to more than 15,000 children under the 
</p>
<p>age of 18 years in schools, health clinics in refugee camps and other localities. Children 
</p>
<p>reportedly comprise approximately 70 per cent of all counselling cases. The most widely 
</p>
<p>reported symptoms included enuresis and encopresis complaints (24 per cent), behavioural 
</p>
<p>problems (20 per cent) and anxiety complaints (13 per cent). Other issues affecting children 
</p>
<p>identified by UNRWA school counsellors included discipline problems, aggression and 
</p>
<p>poor academic achievement.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Punitive house demolitions 
</b></p>
<p>50. House demolitions ordered by Israel in response to a string of Palestinian attacks on 
</p>
<p>Israelis in recent months are of particular concern to the Special Rapporteur.33
 
Between 1 
</p>
<p>June and 30 November 2014, the Israeli authorities reportedly demolished or sealed five 
</p>
<p>homes, displacing 34 Palestinians, including 16 children. According to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator, as at 3 December 2014, another six 
</p>
<p>families in the West Bank and East Jerusalem were at risk. The home of Abd al-Rahman al-
</p>
<p>Shaludi, the Palestinian who allegedly killed a 22-year-old woman and a three-month-old 
</p>
<p>Israeli infant in a car attack in Jerusalem in October, was among those demolished.  
</p>
<p>51. The justification made by the Israeli authorities for home demolitions is that it serves 
</p>
<p>as a deterrent to prevent future &#8220;terrorist&#8221; attacks.34 The Special Rapporteur has not, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 33 OHCHR, &#8220;Palestinian homes must cease to be a target, UN human rights experts say&#8221;, 25 November 
</p>
<p>2014.  
34 Human Rights Watch, &#8220;Israel: Stop Punitive Home Demolitions&#8221;, 22 November 2014.  </p>


<p>however, come across any supporting evidence for this to date. Indeed, in 2005, a military 
</p>
<p>committee appointed by then chief of the Israel Defense Forces (and current Minister for 
</p>
<p>Defence) Moshe Ya&#8217;alon recommended a moratorium on home demolitions after it had 
</p>
<p>found little proof that they served as an effective deterrent to future terrorists.35 
</p>
<p>52. Aside from the questions of &#8220;effectiveness&#8221;, from an ethical and legal standpoint, 
</p>
<p>family members who have committed no crime should not be punished for the actions of a 
</p>
<p>relative. In short, punitive home demolitions are an act of collective punishment that 
</p>
<p>contravenes international law. It is therefore all the more disconcerting that the Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court of Israel continues to sanction the practice, which deprives innocent Palestinians of 
</p>
<p>the right to adequate housing.36
 
All those accused of being responsible for acts of violence 
</p>
<p>should be tried before a court of law and, if found guilty, sentenced for their crimes; the 
</p>
<p>State cannot, however, go beyond what is sanctioned by international law.  
</p>
<p>53. On 27 November 2014, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Israel responded to a joint 
</p>
<p>press release issued by this Special Rapporteur and the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
</p>
<p>housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination in this context, in which they called upon Israel to cease targeting 
</p>
<p>Palestinian homes. In its response, Israel sought to deflect attention from its resort to the 
</p>
<p>illegal practice of home demolitions by making unfounded accusations that &#8220;the mandate 
</p>
<p>holders have turned a blind eye to terrorism, incitement, celebrations of violence and 
</p>
<p>encouragement of extremism carried out by Palestinians and their leaders&#8221;. Any incitement 
</p>
<p>to hatred and violence must of course be condemned in all its forms, but genuine deterrence 
</p>
<p>needs to look at the root causes of violence. Punitive home demolitions only add to the 
</p>
<p>frustration and despair felt by people living under the prolonged Israeli military occupation. 
</p>
<p>It sows the seed of more hatred, particularly in children, that may fuel the cycle of more 
</p>
<p>violence in the future.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Arrest and detention of Palestinian children 
</b></p>
<p>54. Around 8,000 Palestinian children under the age of 18 have reportedly been detained 
</p>
<p>and prosecuted by the Israeli military courts since 2000. According to information provided 
</p>
<p>by a Palestinian non-governmental organization, as at October 2014, there were 201 
</p>
<p>Palestinian children held in Israeli prisons, 23 of whom were between the ages of 14 and 
</p>
<p>16. The ill-treatment of Palestinian children by Israeli security forces from the time of arrest 
</p>
<p>to the end of detention in Israeli military facilities has been well documented across the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, from the reports of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner, to 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), which in February 2013 reported that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>ill-treatment of children who come in contact with the military detention system appears to 
</p>
<p>be widespread, systematic and institutionalised throughout the process, from the moment of 
</p>
<p>arrest until the child&#8217;s prosecution and eventual conviction and sentencing.&#8221;37  
</p>
<p>55. The situation of Palestinian children has also received significant attention across the 
</p>
<p>United Nations human rights mechanisms, including during the consideration of the reports 
</p>
<p>submitted by Israel to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in June 2013,38 in the 
</p>
<p>context of the universal periodic review in October 2013,39 and most recently by the Human

<p>Rights Committee in October 2014.40 The key concerns related to cases of night-time arrest, 
</p>
<p>handcuffing, blindfolding, strip-searching, physical and verbal abuse, and denial of access 
</p>
<p>to a lawyer or to parents, and the fact that many children are forced to sign confession 
</p>
<p>documents in Hebrew, which they do not understand.  
</p>
<p>56. It appears that Israel has taken note of some of the recommendations made by 
</p>
<p>UNICEF in its report, including by introducing some procedural adjustments;41 for 
</p>
<p>example, in April 2013, Israel reduced the amount of time that children accused of what 
</p>
<p>Israel classes as &#8220;security offences&#8221; spend in detention prior to their first court hearing 
</p>
<p>(from eight days to four days, or even 24 hours, depending on the age of the child), 
</p>
<p>although this time may be doubled in special circumstances. These time frames are 
</p>
<p>nonetheless reportedly still twice as long as those prescribed in the laws applicable to 
</p>
<p>children from Israeli settlements. It was also reported that, in April 2014, Israel introduced 
</p>
<p>a pilot scheme of issuing summonses to children as an alternative to terrifying night-time 
</p>
<p>arrests; many summonses are, however, reportedly delivered after midnight, putting into 
</p>
<p>question the good faith application of the pilot scheme. Two years since the UNICEF 
</p>
<p>report, the information received by the Special Rapporteur suggests that the findings made 
</p>
<p>by UNICEF remain valid. 
</p>
<p>57. The Head of the Palestinian Commission for Detainees and ex-Detainees Affairs, 
</p>
<p>Issa Qaraqe, informed the Special Rapporteur that affidavits from many children released 
</p>
<p>from detention confirmed that beatings and torture were &#8220;commonplace&#8221; and resulted in 
</p>
<p>chronic psychological problems for young children. This was collaborated by the findings 
</p>
<p>of a non-governmental organization, which collected 105 sworn testimonies from children 
</p>
<p>between November 2012 and July 2014. Of the 105 testimonies, 99 children had had their 
</p>
<p>hands tied; 85 had been blindfolded; 72 had been shown or had signed documents in 
</p>
<p>Hebrew, which they did not understand; 63 had experienced physical abuse; 49 had been 
</p>
<p>arrested in the middle of the night (usually between midnight and 5 a.m.); 48 had been 
</p>
<p>transferred on the floor of a vehicle; 47 had received threats; 41 had experienced verbal 
</p>
<p>abuse; and 27 had been strip-searched. Only 13 had been informed of their right to silence; 
</p>
<p>and just six had received a summons in lieu of night arrest. Parents had been present 
</p>
<p>throughout interrogation in only six cases, and five children had been reportedly allowed to 
</p>
<p>consult a lawyer prior to interrogation. Three children had been placed in solitary 
</p>
<p>confinement at some stage of their detention.42 Most of these acts of ill-treatment reportedly 
</p>
<p>occurred during the first 24 hours following arrest.  
</p>
<p>58.  According to information received from a Palestinian non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization, the vast majority of Palestinian children brought before a military court 
</p>
<p>reportedly pleaded guilty under the pressure of interrogation, also because it was the fastest 
</p>
<p>way to be freed from Israeli custody. Of the 287 cases involving child detainees in 2012 
</p>
<p>and 2013, the conviction rate was an extraordinarily high 99.5 per cent among the 181 
</p>
<p>children charged.
 
 
</p>
<p>59. Moreover, according to information received by the Special Rapporteur, an 
</p>
<p>estimated 60 per cent of Palestinian child detainees from the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
</p>
<p>are held in prisons and detention facilities inside Israel, in violation of article 76 of the 
</p>
<p>Fourth Geneva Convention. For children, this mean that they receive fewer families visits 
</p>
<p>because of the time it takes to obtain a permit or due to the fact that permits are denied for 
</p>

<p>reportedly unspecified &#8220;security&#8221; reasons. Palestinian children are reportedly not allowed to 
</p>
<p>use a telephone while in detention. 
</p>
<p>60. A representative of a non-governmental organization described the approach taken 
</p>
<p>by Israel to the issue as having &#8220;moved on from its position of denial of the problem to 
</p>
<p>dealing with it as a press relations issue&#8221;. Evidence suggests that Israel has not taken 
</p>
<p>sufficient remedial action to make a real difference on the ground to improve the situation 
</p>
<p>of Palestinian children in detention. Many children come out of Israeli detention suffering 
</p>
<p>from post-traumatic stress disorder or other illnesses associated with experiencing deeply 
</p>
<p>traumatic events.  
</p>
<p>61. According to one testimony received from a Palestinian non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organization by the Special Rapporteur, on 6 January 2014, a 13-year-old Palestinian boy 
</p>
<p>from the village of Hizma in the Jerusalem Governorate was playing football with friends 
</p>
<p>in a field when clashes reportedly erupted between stone-throwing youths and Israeli 
</p>
<p>soldiers stationed in a hilly area opposite the playing field. As he and his friends attempted 
</p>
<p>to run away, they were reportedly stopped, beaten severely and subjected to an electric stun 
</p>
<p>gun by plain-clothed Israeli police officers before being taken away in a police vehicle to 
</p>
<p>Ofer prison near Ramallah. For one week, the boy was subjected to daily interrogation 
</p>
<p>sessions, which allegedly included further beatings, verbal abuse and the denial of the use 
</p>
<p>of the bathroom. He was issued with a two-year suspended sentence and a fine of 7,500 
</p>
<p>shekels. Since his arrest, his academic performance has deteriorated, and he no longer 
</p>
<p>leaves the house alone.  
</p>
<p>62. In another account received from a Palestinian non-governmental organization, a 14 
</p>
<p>year-old Palestinian youth was arrested on 11 March 2014 for the fourth time in two years 
</p>
<p>when clashes erupted between Palestinian youths and Israeli settlers. The youth was 
</p>
<p>transported to Maskoubieh detention facility, where he was repeatedly beaten and subjected 
</p>
<p>to verbal abuse. The court reportedly sentenced the youth to house arrest for five days and 
</p>
<p>ordered him to stay away from the Al Aqsa Mosque area for 30 days, in addition giving 
</p>
<p>him a fine of 3,000 shekels. The youth today suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, 
</p>
<p>and his academic achievements are reportedly deteriorating.  
</p>
<p>63.  The staggering number of Palestinian children subjected to similar experiences of 
</p>
<p>terrifying arrest and detention in Israeli custody and the trauma of the ill-treatment is of 
</p>
<p>serious concern. Impunity for these violations is likely to perpetuate the ill-treatment of 
</p>
<p>children in the future. It was noted that most Palestinian families reportedly do not file 
</p>
<p>complaints of mistreatment with the Israeli authorities for fear of retaliation or because they 
</p>
<p>have lost faith in the judicial system. Of the 23 complaints filed by Palestinian families in 
</p>
<p>2012 and 2013 with the assistance of Defence for Children &#8211; Palestine, the status of most of 
</p>
<p>the complaints were unknown as at September 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Forcible transfer of Palestinian Bedouins 
</b></p>
<p>64. The situation of thousands of Palestinian Bedouin and herder communities resident 
</p>
<p>in the central West Bank, including the East Jerusalem periphery, and the risk of their 
</p>
<p>forcible transfer to three government-designated township sites at Al-Jabal, Nuweima and 
</p>
<p>Fasayil in the Jerusalem and Jericho Governorates of the West Bank, is cause for deep 
</p>
<p>concern. If the plans of the Israeli Civil Administration, referred to as the &#8220;Bedouin 
</p>
<p>Regulation&#8221;, are approved, between 5,000 and 11,000 individuals from up to 46 rural 
</p>
<p>communities could be evicted from their current place of residence and relocated to these 
</p>
<p>sites. The implementation of the plans would entail the demolition of Bedouin homes and </p>


<p>schools, in clear violation of international law, and approximately two thirds of those 
</p>
<p>affected would be children.43  
</p>
<p>65. Although the Israeli authorities claim that the Bedouin communities wish for an 
</p>
<p>improvement in their living conditions and do not object to relocation, information received 
</p>
<p>from representatives of Bedouin communities and non-governmental organizations 
</p>
<p>suggests otherwise. Notwithstanding, the Israeli Civil Administration Higher Planning 
</p>
<p>Council approved the deposit of plans for the Nuweima and Fasayil transfer sites in June 
</p>
<p>2014, and opened them for public objection for a period of 60 days, beginning in August 
</p>
<p>and September respectively.44 All affected Bedouin communities reportedly also faced 
</p>
<p>pending demolition orders.  
</p>
<p>66. Information received by the Special Rapporteur suggests that there are a number of 
</p>
<p>problems with the plan, including the limited availability of grazing land in the designated 
</p>
<p>townships, the likelihood that traditional livelihoods and the culture of these communities 
</p>
<p>will be undermined, and the fact that one of the proposed sites is located next to a refuse 
</p>
<p>dump, raising serious health concerns. Most importantly, the communities themselves are 
</p>
<p>not willing to relocate. Some are also located in an area that has been allocated for the 
</p>
<p>expansion of Israeli settlements, including in the area known as &#8220;E-1&#8221;, which allegedly is 
</p>
<p>intended to create a contiguous built-up settlement area between the Ma&#8217;ale Adummim 
</p>
<p>settlement and Jerusalem.45 If that is realized, East Jerusalem would be further disconnected 
</p>
<p>from the rest of the West Bank and the territorial contiguity of the Occupied Palestinian 
</p>
<p>Territory further undermined. 
</p>
<p>67. Israel has reportedly been reinforcing its plans to transfer the Palestinian Bedouins 
</p>
<p>by creating a &#8220;coercive environment&#8221; through a number of policies and practices, including 
</p>
<p>by restricting access to grazing land and markets, the denial of access to basic services and 
</p>
<p>infrastructure, the rejection of applications for building permits, and the demolition and 
</p>
<p>threat of demolition of homes, schools and livelihood structures, including tents and 
</p>
<p>portable latrines &#8211; all of which have contributed to forcing Bedouin communities out of 
</p>
<p>their present areas. According to an international non-governmental organization, between 
</p>
<p>January 2008 and July 2014, more than 5,000 Palestinians were displaced as a result of 
</p>
<p>house demolitions and evictions in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>from 2009 to 2012, Palestinians reportedly submitted 1,640 building permit applications, of 
</p>
<p>which only 37 (or 2.3 per cent) were approved.  
</p>
<p>68. Part of this coercive environment has involved Israeli interference in the delivery of 
</p>
<p>international donor assistance. UNRWA reported that, in one such case, on 27 February 
</p>
<p>2014, a donation from a European Union diplomatic mission to the school of Khan al-
</p>
<p>Ahmar, comprising a swing set, a free-standing slide and two half-barrel climbing frames, 
</p>
<p>was reportedly confiscated and removed by the Israeli Civil Administration. Israel 
</p>
<p>reportedly stated that the items were confiscated because the metal legs of the swing set 
</p>
<p>would need to be sunk into concrete, which constituted &#8220;construction&#8221; requiring a building 
</p>
<p>permit. 
</p>
<p>69. An international non-governmental organization involved in the provision of 
</p>
<p>humanitarian aid to vulnerable Palestinian communities informed the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 43 See also UNRWA, &#8220;UNRWA urges donor community to take firm stand against mass forcible 
</p>
<p>transfer of Palestinian Bedouins&#8221;, 21 September 2014.

</p>
<p> 45 During an Israeli Parliamentary discussion on 27 April 2014, the head of the Coordination of 
</p>
<p>Government Affairs in the Territories reportedly discussed the plans to clear out the Bedouins from 
</p>
<p>the E-1 settlement area.  </p>


<p>that, since 2009, more than 1 million Euros worth of its humanitarian aid objects and 
</p>
<p>projects had been subjected to Israeli stop-work, demolition or seizure orders, reportedly 
</p>
<p>affecting 230 shelters, three schools and more than 135 water and sanitation structures.  
</p>
<p>70. The demolitions and evictions have a significant impact on the lives of Palestinian 
</p>
<p>families and their children, as frequent displacement disrupts livelihoods and reduces the 
</p>
<p>standard of living, with limited opportunities for access to basic services. The effect of 
</p>
<p>displacement on children has been particularly disruptive owing to frequent changes of 
</p>
<p>school and unsettling changes to their daily lives, resulting in symptoms including post-
</p>
<p>traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety and poor academic achievement.  
</p>
<p>71. International law prohibits the mass forcible transfer or forced eviction in an 
</p>
<p>occupied territory except under exceptional circumstances. Israel, as the occupying Power, 
</p>
<p>has the obligation to protect the civilian population in the occupied territory, and to 
</p>
<p>administer it for the benefit of that population. It is certainly not compatible with the 
</p>
<p>destruction and confiscation of private property, including homes, livelihood structures and 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation facilities, which deprive the Palestinian population of their basic social 
</p>
<p>and economic rights.

<p>addressed a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Israel regarding the alleged plans to 
</p>
<p>forcibly transfer the Bedouin communities. The mandate holders reminded Israel of its 
</p>
<p>human rights obligations and requested an explanation of the plans and the steps taken by 
</p>
<p>the Government to ensure that the areas affected by the relocation plans would not be slated 
</p>
<p>for settlement expansion or construction of the wall. They also requested information of the 
</p>
<p>mechanisms used to ensure adequate, informed and genuine participation by the Bedouin 
</p>
<p>communities and their representatives in the discussions and the decision on the three 
</p>
<p>&#8220;townships&#8221; planned by the Israeli Civil Administration. As at 15 December 2014, no 
</p>
<p>response had been received. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations and interactions with victims and witnesses 
</p>
<p>living in the Occupied Palestinian Territory in the several months since assuming his 
</p>
<p>mandate suggest that the protection that international humanitarian law and international 
</p>
<p>human rights law should be providing for civilians, including children, across the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Palestinian Territory is distressingly absent. It is especially deplorable that Palestinian 
</p>
<p>children are suffering the brunt of occupation policies and practices of Israel, whether as a 
</p>
<p>result of the blockade and hostilities in Gaza, the excessive use of force by Israeli security 
</p>
<p>forces in the context of legitimate protests and peaceful demonstrations, as well as search 
</p>
<p>operations in the refugee camps, and abuse and ill-treatment in Israeli prisons. Voices from 
</p>
<p>across the Occupied Palestinian Territory called in unison for accountability, an end to the 
</p>
<p>blockade and an end to the occupation. If another round of deadly violence is to be avoided, 
</p>
<p>the underlying problems perpetuating the conflict and the almost daily violation of the 
</p>
<p>human rights of the Palestinian people must be addressed and those responsible brought to 
</p>
<p>justice. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>With regard to the situation in Gaza, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Government of Israel: </b> </p>


<p><b>(a) Implement in good faith the Gaza reconstruction mechanism brokered 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the United Nations and allow delivery of construction materials, including cement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In accordance with Security Council resolution 1860 (2009), urgently lift 
</b></p>
<p><b>the blockade of Gaza, which constitutes a form of collective punishment that has a 
</b></p>
<p><b>disproportionate impact on the lives of innocent civilians and children;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Conduct prompt, thorough, effective, independent, impartial and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent investigations into all alleged incidents of killing of civilians during the 
</b></p>
<p><b>hostilities, and make public the findings and any steps taken regarding accountability.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>With regard to the situation of children in Israeli military detention, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Israel:</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(a)  Ensure that arrests of children only take place during daylight hours, 
</b></p>
<p><b>except in rare and exceptional circumstances; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Provide children and their legal guardians with a written statement in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Arabic informing them of their legal rights in custody; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Allow all children to consult with a lawyer of their choice prior to 
</b></p>
<p><b>questioning; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure that every interrogation is audio-visually recorded and a copy of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the tape provided to the defence counsel prior to the first hearing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Cease immediately the ill-treatment and abuse of children in detention, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including the practice of putting children in solitary confinement; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Exclude, in all cases, evidence obtained by the military courts as a result 
</b></p>
<p><b>of torture or ill-treatment. 
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>With regard to the excessive use of force by Israeli security forces, the Special 
</b></p>
<p><b>Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Israel:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that Israeli security forces comply with the Basic Principles on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Conduct thorough, effective, independent and impartial investigations 
</b></p>
<p><b>into all cases involving the lethal use of force, and make those findings public without 
</b></p>
<p><b>delay. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur furthermore recommends that the Government of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Israel</b> <b>cease immediately punitive home demolitions, and provide adequate 
</b></p>
<p><b>compensation to innocent family members whose homes have been unlawfully 
</b></p>
<p><b>demolished.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>With regard to the plans that would allegedly result in the forcible eviction and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfer of Palestinian Bedouin and herder communities in Area C of the West Bank, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Israel:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Abandon, and desist from implementing, plans entailing the forcible 
</b></p>
<p><b>transfer of Palestinian Bedouin and herder communities in the West Bank, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the East Jerusalem periphery; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Provide adequate compensation and restitution for individuals and 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities who have been forcibly evicted and had their property destroyed.  
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
