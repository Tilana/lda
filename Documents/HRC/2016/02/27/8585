<p>The paragraph <i>should read

<p>77. With regard to arrests, detentions and criminalization, the majority of the 
communications were sent to the Russian Federation (10), Belarus (8) and Uzbekistan (8). 
In this context, those most at risk of arrest appear to include women defenders working on 
human rights issues related to the conflict in the North Caucasus; pro-democracy advocates, 
particularly in Belarus; women&#8217;s rights defenders in Belarus and Uzbekistan; those 
denouncing violations to the European Court of Human Rights, particularly in the Russian 
Federation; and women journalists in all three countries. In other European countries, 
smaller numbers of communications concerning allegations of arrests and detentions were 
sent to, inter alia, Kyrgyzstan, Spain, Turkey and Turkmenistan. Communications regarding 
other forms of criminalization and judicial harassment were sent to Azerbaijan, France, 
Greece, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova and Turkey.
