<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> Since the global food crisis has put hunger at the top of the political agenda, important 
efforts have been put, at both international and national levels, into increasing the supply of food. 
Producing more food will not, however, reduce hunger if we neglect to think about the political 
economy of the food systems and if we do not produce and consume in ways that are both more 
equitable and more sustainable. Nor will increased production suffice if we do not ground our 
policies on the right to food as a means to ensure adequate targeting, monitoring, accountability 
and participation, all of which can improve the effectiveness of the strategies put in place.  
</p>
<p> In the present report the Special Rapporteur on the right to food seeks to explain why. He 
describes the current state of the global food price crisis and what the right to food has to 
contribute at the operational level. He goes on to argue that States should ensure that the 
reinvestment in agriculture will effectively contribute to combating hunger and malnutrition by 
assessing the contribution to the realization of the right to food of different modes of agricultural 
development. He also explains why we need to accelerate progress towards an international 
consensus on the production and use of agrofuels, and on large-scale land acquisitions or leases. 
He emphasizes the need to guarantee the right to social security and the role the international 
community could play in enabling countries to strengthen social protection. He discusses how 
countries may cope with increased volatility of prices on the international markets, and how 
international cooperation could combat the sources of such volatility. The Special Rapporteur 
ends the report with a plea to improve the global governance of food security. In times of crisis, 
more than ever, only by strengthening multilateralism can we hope to effectively realize the right 
to food. If we achieve this, the crisis can be made into an opportunity. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food submitted his first report on the global food 
crisis (A/HRC/9/23) in September 2008. The present report is submitted in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 9/6 on the follow-up to the seventh special session of the 
Council on the negative impact of the worsening of the world food crisis on the realization of the 
right to food for all, adopted by the Council at its ninth session. In the report,<b>1</b> the Special 
Rapporteur summarizes the efforts that have been made since by Governments and international 
agencies to build resilience against the risk of future crises. The Special Rapporteur thanks all 
Governments that submitted responses to the questionnaire that he addressed to them, on 
27 January 2009.<b>2</b> He also expresses thanks for the submissions received from additional 
sources. The inquiry was divided into four themes. The Special Rapporteur first describes the 
current unfolding of the global food crisis: the crisis is not over, it is having devastating 
consequences, and it is further aggravated by the financial, economic, and ecological crises we 
are currently witnessing. Next, he examines the role of the right to food in addressing the global 
food crisis, with a focus on the national level. He then analyses the impact of the renewed 
interest in agriculture and the choices that Governments are confronted with in this area, and 
considers the strengthening of social protection as a means to shield the poorest segments of the 
population from the impact of high food prices. While both these questions are primarily matters 
to be addressed through policies adopted at the national level, the Special Rapporteur argues for 
the need to support these efforts more actively by certain initiatives that could be adopted at the 
international level. He then considers possibilities for the regulation of the markets for 
agricultural commodities; in particular, he enquires how the volatility of prices of agricultural 
commodities, which discourages investment and production, and leads to higher prices for 
buyers of food, could be combated. Lastly, he examines the case for strengthening the political 
will to tackle hunger and acute malnutrition effectively by improving global governance. He 
concludes with a set of recommendations for the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. To date, we have failed to tackle hunger and acute malnutrition decisively. There are 
five reasons for this failure: (a) an almost exclusive focus on increasing agricultural production 
instead of the adoption of a more holistic view about the causes of food insecurity; (b) a failure

<p>of global governance to overcome existing fragmentation of efforts; (c) a still incomplete 
understanding of how to work in certain areas that have an impact on our ability to achieve 
food security for all; (d) a failure to follow up on commitments, itself a result of a lack of 
accountability; and (e) the inadequacy of national strategies for the realization of the right to 
food at the domestic level. In the present report the Rapporteur examines what, on each of these 
issues, the responses to the global food crisis have taught us; whether we have learned; and what 
to do with the understanding gained about what needs to be done. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE UNFOLDING OF THE GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS 
</b></p>
<p>3. In the face of growing uncertainty about the future market prices of agricultural 
commodities, we should have worked to increase the resilience of food systems. Instead, it is the 
crisis that has proven resilient. The dramatic effects of the surge in food prices of 2007/08 are 
well documented. High food and oil prices in 2007 and 2008 may have led to increasing the 
number of people living in extreme poverty by between 130 and 150 million.<b>3</b> Women and 
children who have special nutritional needs are particularly at risk. As households are forced to 
consume a less diverse diet, the risk of critical micronutrient deficiencies, such as iron and 
vitamin A, increases.<b>4</b> Thus, even though high food prices may be temporary, they could have 
long-lasting consequences on physical and mental growth if the coping strategies adopted by 
households cause reductions in the quantity and/or quality of diets at critical stages of child 
growth or during pregnancy. 
</p>
<p>4. The prices of agricultural commodities on international markets have dropped since 
July 2008. They have followed the prices of oil, with which they are traditionally correlated 
(see graph I below).

to the food security crisis: nature and preliminary implications of the policies pursued&#8221;, 
February 2009 (calculated by Bureau Issala on the basis of UNCTAD and FAO data). 
</p>
<p>5. However, despite record cereal production in 2008 and the policy responses adopted by 
many Governments following the food crisis of 2007 and 2008, the crisis is not over. In its Crop 
Prospects and Food Situation report of April 2009, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations (FAO) reported that food prices had remained at high levels in many developing 
and low-income food-deficit countries. Food emergencies persist in 32 countries. The analysis 
of domestic food prices for 58 developing countries included in the report shows that, in around 
80 per cent of cases, food prices were higher than 12 months earlier, and around 40 per cent 
higher than in January 2009. 
</p>
<p>6. The drop in prices of agricultural commodities on international markets since the peak of 
June 2008, combined with lower freight rates, may bring some relief to the cereal import bill for 
low-income food-deficit countries. But this decrease may also lead, perversely, to a loss of 
interest in reinvesting in agriculture, and to a disincentive for producers; the levels of wheat 
production are indeed expected to drop in 2009. Moreover, the global food crisis has not 
unfolded in isolation from the financial and economic crisis that has developed since late 2008. 
This crisis, according to the World Bank, confronts developing countries with a financing gap 
estimated at between $270 billion and $700 billion, depending on the severity of the crisis and on </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/31*

</p>
<p>the policy responses.<b>5</b> High-income countries will have to finance important recovery plans, 
issuing debts that could crowd out many developing country issuers. Remittance flows have been 
declining since late 2008. Developing countries might therefore find it increasingly difficult to 
finance agriculture and rural development, subsidize food to improve its affordability for the 
poorest, and establish or strengthen social protection programmes.  
</p>
<p><b>III. THE ROLE OF THE RIGHT TO FOOD IN ADDRESSING  
THE GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS 
</b></p>
<p>7. In the face of a crisis of such magnitude, it is tempting to see the right to adequate food as 
a long-term objective, clearly beyond reach for the moment, and thus of little immediate 
relevance. Such an attitude would, however, betray a fundamental misunderstanding of what the 
right to food is about. The role of the right to food is more central, not less, in times of crisis. It is 
not simply an objective; it also shows the way towards fulfilling it. 
</p><p>8. An approach grounded in the right to food requires that we address the root causes of 
hunger and malnutrition. The right to food should also serve as a signpost in order to achieve 
increased consistency across the different sectors relevant to the realization of the right to food; 
including not only food aid and agricultural and rural development, but also social protection, the 
protection of agricultural workers, land policies, health and education, or trade and investment. 
</p>
<p>9. Since the first report of the Special Rapporteur on the global food crisis (A/HRC/9/23), he 
has sought to convince interlocutors, both within and outside the United Nations system, of the 
importance of devising solutions to the global food crisis grounded in the right to food. At the 
international level, this implies strengthening multilateralism in order to address effectively the 
structural causes of hunger. The global governance of our food system needs to be reformed 
without delay and the revitalization of the Committee on World Food Security represents a real 
opportunity (see paragraphs 33-40 below). At the national level, the implementation of the right 
to food has an institutional dimension which this section explores. 
</p>
<p>10. Grounding our efforts in the right to food first requires targeting the most vulnerable, 
identified through systems mapping food vulnerability and insecurity. A number of countries, 
including C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Indonesia, Iraq and Panama, have regular mapping 
systems in place or have launched specific mapping exercises during the crisis period. Although 
a few tools for mapping vulnerability exist, vulnerability does not seem to have been identified 
fully, owing to the selective nature of coverage, which can exclude zones with good food 
production. Only a few countries seem to include urban areas in such mapping (Burkina Faso, 
Kenya). Some countries have used national maps of extreme poverty for food security purposes 
(El Salvador, Yemen). Despite these welcome efforts, some vulnerable groups are reportedly 
excluded from the mapping results. In order to be as well informed as possible, States should 
develop mapping systems through participatory means. 
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/12/31*

</p>
<p>11. Secondly, the right to food requires that accountability mechanisms be put in place so that 
victims of violations of the right to food have access to independent bodies empowered to 
monitor the choices made by decision makers. The right to food implies that victims must have a 
right to recourse mechanisms, that Governments must be held accountable if they adopt policies 
which violate that right, and that courts are empowered to protect that right. As in the case of 
Guatemala and India, an increasing number of countries, such as Argentina, Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of) and Ecuador are moving in this direction. 
</p>
<p>12. Thirdly, the right to food requires prioritization: trade and investment policies and choices 
in modes of agricultural production, for instance, should be subordinated to the overarching 
objective of realizing the right to food. To this effect, States should put in place national 
strategies for the realization of the right to food. Such strategies serve a number of purposes: they 
encourage participation, since their adoption and implementation should involve all stakeholders; 
they oblige Government to make clear, time-bound commitments; and they ensure that choices 
in other policy areas fit into a broader strategy aimed at realizing the right to food. The 
Comprehensive Framework for Action adopted by the High-level Task Force on the Global Food 
Security Crisis advocates in favour of &#8220;partnerships for food&#8221; at the national level, under clear 
and visible political leadership, in order to improve coordination across different sectors and 
participation of various segments of society and government. In several countries - Bolivia 
(Plurinatinal State of), Costa Rica, Indonesia and Togo - mechanisms coordinate the various 
actions taken in the field of food security. National and lower-level councils on food security 
exist in several countries, such as Angola, the Dominican Republic, Kyrgyzstan and Senegal. In 
the majority of countries surveyed, however, no specific body for the participation, consultation 
and coordination of all actors on issues related to the right to food seems to exist. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  REINVESTING IN AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
</b></p>
<p>13. One of the beneficial effects of the global food crisis is that Governments and international 
agencies have realized that there is an urgent need to put agriculture back at the centre of their 
development agendas, after 25 years of neglect. Many States and agencies have pledged to 
reinvest, sometimes massively, in agriculture. Recent indicators of this shift include the 
announcement, on 15 April 2009, of the creation of the Agricultural Investment Fund for Africa, 
established jointly by the African Development Bank, the International Fund for Agricultural 
Development (IFAD) and the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, with the support of the 
French Development Agency, which aims to collect &#8364;500 million to support agro-industries and 
farmers&#8217; cooperatives in Africa; the priorities defined for the United States Agency for 
International Development in May 2009 by the United States administration for the 2010 fiscal 
year, which includes $3.4 billion to address global food insecurity and $1.4 billion for agriculture 
development assistance; and the establishment by the European Union, in December 2008, of a 
new facility for a rapid response to soaring food prices.<b>6</b>

</p>
<p>14. While raising public spending on agriculture is necessary, changing the allocation of 
existing spending is equally vital. It is crucial that investments benefit the poorest, most 
marginalized farmers, often located in the least favourable environments. All too often, these 
farmers have been left out of support schemes, partly because of their disempowerment and 
partly because of the belief that the larger the farm, the more productive it will be. This was 
incorrect. Small producers contribute to greater food security, particularly in remote areas where 
locally produced foods preclude the high transport and marketing costs associated with many 
purchased foods.<b>7</b> As a result of past policies that favoured mostly large-scale agro-industrial 
production, certain public goods, the provision of which is sometimes vastly more efficient than 
that of inputs, have been under-supplied: these include storage facilities, access to means of 
communication and therefore to regional and local markets, access to credit and insurance 
against weather-related risks, extension services, agricultural research and the organization of 
farmers in cooperatives. The result of past policies that have neglected this dimension are 
reflected in the graph below.

</p>
<p><b>A.  Reinvesting in agriculture: the stakes 
</b></p>
<p>15. Considering self-sufficiency in food production to be the most efficient way to buffer 
fluctuations in international markets, several Governments (Cameroon, China, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, the Philippines and Senegal)<b>8</b> have declared this to be their strategic response to high 
food prices. In Asia, many countries, including China, India and the Philippines, have made 
important efforts to reinvest in agriculture. In Africa, Benin, Cameroon, the Central African 
Republic and Madagascar have taken short-term measures aimed at boosting production. In 
Latin America and Africa, a number of Governments have designed integrated national plans 
aimed at coordinating different measures to improve agricultural systems. Credits at low interest 
rates and subsidies have been provided to producers to buy seeds, fertilizers and agricultural 
equipment or to improve irrigation and power systems. Some Governments have distributed 
inputs to the smallest farmers, and taxes on fuel have been lowered as a way to facilitate product 
transportation and to allow for other expenditures for farmers. 
</p>
<p>16. When taking steps to increase investment in agriculture and rural development, 
Governments should be mindful of the need to ensure that investments truly contribute to the 
right to food.<b>9</b> It is striking however, that Governments hardly acknowledge the existence of 
different models of agricultural development - the &#8220;Green Revolution&#8221; model, the 
agro-ecological farming approaches (ecologically friendly farming systems) and a possible 
model based on genetic engineering - when formulating their public policies on agriculture. 
These models can be complementary at the crop field level; a very careful combination of 
fertilizers and agro-forestry, for instance, is successfully promoted in some regions. At the public 
policy level, however, a prerequisite for a balanced approach is that the very existence of several 
models is acknowledged. In the fierce competition for scarce resources, such as land, water, 
investment and human resources, the implications of supporting one paradigm over the others 
deserve serious consideration.  
</p>
<p>17. The right to food should guide Governments&#8217; choices between different modes of 
agricultural production. A number of United Nations agencies, including the United Nations 
Environment Programme (UNEP),<b>10 </b>FAO and the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development (UNCTAD), have underscored the potential of sustainable farming to meet the 
growth in demand.<b>11</b> The Special Rapporteur has developed further the links between sustainable

<p>agriculture and the right to food in his contributions to the interactive thematic dialogue of the 
General Assembly on the global food crisis and the right to food (New York, 6 April 2009) 
and the seventeenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development (New York, 4 to 
15 May 2009). The Commission adopted a declaration in which it recognized that sustainable 
agricultural practices and sustainable forest management could contribute to meeting climate 
change concerns and that sustainable soil, land, livestock, forest, biodiversity and water 
management practices and resilient crops were essential. It also called for the creation of an 
enabling environment for sustainable agriculture. 
</p>
<p>18. The development of more sustainable farming approaches is directly linked to the right to 
food. Agricultural productivity depends on the services rendered by ecosystems. Unless from 
being one of the main causes of climate change and soil degradation it is turned into a net 
contributor to the maintenance of the environment, agricultural production will undergo a 
significant decline in the future. Just like its availability, the accessibility of food depends on 
how it is produced. The more food production relies on oil, the more food commodities will be 
vulnerable to price shocks. The price of oil influences not only fertilizer costs and freight rates, 
but also the demand for agrofuels, which in turn exacerbates the competition for land, water and 
capital between the production of food and the production of fuel. By contrast, more sustainable 
forms of agriculture could better meet the needs of small-scale farmers. Low external input 
agriculture, polycropping and the use of green technologies limit the dependency of these 
farmers on the price of external inputs, thus improving the stability of incomes and avoiding the 
risk of debt spirals following a poor harvest. Finally, agro-ecological forms of production rely 
essentially on increasing knowledge-sharing among farmers through processes that are 
participatory, involving affected vulnerable groups, in order to identify the solutions best-suited 
to their specific circumstances and their complex environments. Such approaches are therefore 
empowering and mobilizing. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Disciplining large-scale land acquisitions or leases 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the past three to four years, private investors and Governments have shown a growing 
interest in the acquisition or long-term lease of large portions of farmland, mostly in the 
developing world and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, where underused 
arable land exists in large quantities. The development of large-scale land leases or acquisitions 
can be explained by (a) the rush towards the production of agrofuels, encouraged by fiscal 
incentives and subsidies in developed countries; (b) population growth and urbanization, 
combined with the exhaustion of natural resources in certain countries, where large-scale land 
acquisitions are seen as a means to achieve long-term food security; (c) increased demand for 
certain raw commodities from tropical countries, particularly fibre and other wood products; and 
(d) the subsidies expected for carbon storage through plantation and avoided deforestation.<b>12</b> 
While this phenomenon is not entirely new, it has accelerated since the onset of the global food 
crisis. A number of resource-poor but cash-rich countries have turned to large-scale acquisitions 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>12
</b>  This is particularly the case under the Clean Development Mechanism provided for in 
</p>
<p>article 12 of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change. </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/31* 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>or rent of land in order to achieve food security.<b>13</b> Private investors, including large investment 
funds, have also acquired land, sometimes for merely speculative motives, with the conviction 
that the price of arable land will continue to rise in the future.  
</p>
<p>20. There are opportunities in this development. For host States, the arrival of investment has 
the potential of creating employment, both on and off the farm (in associated processing 
industries, for instance). It may lead to transfers of technologies. It could improve the access of 
local producers to markets at domestic, regional and international levels. It could increase public 
revenues, through taxation and export duties. For countries purchasing or leasing land abroad, 
this implies greater food security, since they will be less dependent on international markets to 
acquire the food they need to feed their populations - although the risks of lower productivity in 
agriculture in subtropical regions owing to climate change and, in the future, higher freight costs, 
could partially offset this advantage. 
</p>
<p>21. Yet, the human rights challenges are real. In June 2009, the Special Rapporteur put 
forward a set of core principles and measures in order to frame the discussion on large-scale land 
acquisitions or leases in human rights terms. These principles are based on the right to food, but 
they also aim to ensure the respect of agricultural workers&#8217; rights and to protect land users from 
eviction that do not comply with certain conditions. They also call for the respect of the right to 
self-determination of peoples and on the right to development. They may be summarized as 
follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Negotiations leading to investment agreements should be conducted in full 
transparency, with the participation of the local communities, whose access to land and other 
productive resources could be affected as a result of the arrival of an investor;  
</p>
<p> (b) In principle, any shift in land use may only take place with the free, prior and 
informed consent of the local communities concerned. This is particularly important for 
indigenous communities, in view of the discrimination and marginalization that they have 
historically endured. Forced evictions should only be allowed in the most exceptional 
circumstances, when in accordance with the locally applicable legislation, when they are 
justified as necessary for the general welfare, and when they are accompanied by adequate 
compensation and alternative resettlement or access to productive land;

</p>
<p> (c) In order to ensure that the rights of the local communities will be safeguarded at all 
times, States should adopt legislation protecting those rights and specifying in detail the cases in 
which shifts in land use or evictions are allowed, as well as the procedure to be followed. 
Moreover, States should assist local communities in obtaining collective registration of the land 
they use, in order to ensure that their rights will enjoy full judicial protection. Such legislation 
should be designed in accordance with the Basic principles and guidelines on development-based 
evictions and displacement, submitted in 2007 by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as 
a component of the right to an adequate standard of living (A/HRC/4/18, annex I), and with 
general comment No. 7 (1997) of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on the 
right to adequate housing (art. 11.1): forced evictions;<b>14</b>  
</p>
<p> (d) Investment agreement revenues should be used for the benefit of the local 
population. Depending on the circumstances, arrangements under which the foreign investor 
grants access to credit and improved technologies for contract farming, or precluding the 
possibility of buying at predefined prices, a portion of the crops produced, may be preferable to 
long-term leases of land or land purchases; 
</p>
<p> (e) Host States and investors should establish and promote farming systems that are 
sufficiently labour-intensive to contribute to job creation and to the strengthening of local 
livelihood options; 
</p>
<p> (f) Host States and investors should cooperate in identifying ways to ensure that the 
modes of agricultural production respect the environment; 
</p>
<p> (g) Whatever the content of the arrangement, it is essential that the obligations of the 
investor are defined in clear terms, and that these obligations are enforceable, for instance by the 
inclusion of predefined sanctions in the event of non-compliance;  
</p>
<p> (h) In order to ensure that investor agreements do not result in greater food insecurity for 
the local population, particularly as the result of increased dependence on international markets 
or food aid in a context of higher prices for agricultural commodities, the agreements should 
include a clause providing that a minimum percentage of the crops produced be sold on local 
markets, and that this percentage may be increased, in proportions to be agreed in advance, if the 
price of food commodities on international markets reaches a certain level;  
</p>
<p> (i) Impact assessments should be conducted prior to the completion of negotiations in 
order to highlight the consequences of the investment on the enjoyment of the right to food 
through: (i) local employment and incomes, disaggregated by gender and, where applicable, by 
ethnic group; (ii) access to productive resources of the local communities, including pastoralists 
or itinerant farmers; (iii) the arrival of new technologies and investments in infrastructure; 
(iv) the environment, including soil depletion, the use of water resources and genetic erosion; 
and (v) access, availability and adequacy of food;

<p> (j) Indigenous peoples have been granted specific forms of protection of their rights on 
land under international law. States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous 
peoples concerned in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any 
project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the 
development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources; 
</p>
<p> (k) Waged agricultural workers should be provided with adequate protection, and their 
fundamental human and labour rights should be stipulated in legislation and enforced in practice, 
consistent with the applicable instruments of the International Labour Organization (ILO). 
</p>
<p>22. The principles and measures proposed are not simply a restatement of the human rights 
norms on which they are grounded; they are practical as well. They seek to assist both investors 
and host Governments in the negotiation and implementation of large-scale land leases or 
acquisitions, in order to ensure that such investments are balanced, work for the benefit of the 
population in the host country and are conducive to sustainable development. In this area too, a 
multilateral approach would be preferable to unilateral action by the States concerned. A 
multilateral framework would not only improve the protection of the human rights of the local 
population concerned; it could also avoid beggar-thy-neighbour policies, with countries 
competing against each other for foreign direct investment and thus lowering the requirements 
imposed on foreign investors. It could also provide greater legal certainty for investors and shield 
them against the risk of reputational losses if they comply with the principles. It is the hope of 
the Special Rapporteur that these principles will help to achieve a consensus on the 
establishment of such a framework. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Ensuring that agrofuels work for sustainable development 
</b></p>
<p>23. In his first report on the global food crisis (A/HRC/9/23), the Special Rapporteur discussed 
the impact of the increased production of agrofuels on food prices, and more generally, on the 
right to food. Rather than dismiss the use of liquid agrofuels in the transport sector outright, he 
proposed that a consensus be sought on international guidelines on the production and 
consumption of agrofuels. These guidelines should include environmental standards, since the 
expansion of the production and consumption of agrofuels results in direct and indirect shifts in 
land use and often has a negative environmental impact when the full life cycle of the product is 
taken into account. They should also incorporate the requirements of human rights instruments, 
particularly with regard to the right to adequate food, the right to adequate housing (given the 
risks of forced evictions and displacements for the production of agrofuels), the rights of workers 
(including in particular the right to a fair remuneration and the right to a healthy working 
environment), the rights of indigenous peoples and women&#8217;s rights. The international community 
has recognized the need to make progress towards such a consensus at the international level, 
particularly in the Declaration of the High-level Conference on World Food Security convened 
in Rome from 3 to 5 June 2008.<b>15</b> The World Bank recently noted that policies that subsidize 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  In paragraph 7 (f), the Declaration calls upon &#8220;relevant inter-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>including FAO, within their mandates and areas of expertise, with the involvement of national 
Governments, partnerships, the private sector and civil society, to foster a coherent, effective and 
results-oriented international dialogue on biofuels in the context of food security and sustainable 
development needs&#8221;. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/31* 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>production, impose high tariffs and mandate consumption of agrofuels had led to the rapid 
expansion of biofuel production from food crops, such as maize and vegetable oils, and had 
contributed to higher food prices as well as to environmental degradation.<b>16</b> Apart from certain 
voluntary schemes, however, no progress has since been made on disciplining agrofuels, despite 
these well-documented effects and the fewer opportunities that such policies afford to lower-cost 
developing-country producers to expand their production and exports. 
</p>
<p>24. Instead, unilateral measures have been taken. The European Union and Switzerland, for 
instance, have developed sustainability criteria, based on environmental and social concerns, for 
the use and import of agrofuels. Certain voluntary schemes are also being put in place. These 
measures are welcome, but they fail to address adequately the potential impact of the 
development of agrofuel production on food security. Such an impact would be felt both in the 
price of food and the structure of revenues in the agricultural sector of developing countries. In 
principle, developing countries have a strong comparative advantage in the production of 
agrofuels. As a rule, however, crops for fuel are grown by large agricultural producers or by 
multinational companies that own or rent land in developing countries; small-scale farmers are 
not involved in that production. Unless affirmative action is taken to ensure that smallholders are 
included in the production of agrofuels in a way that is beneficial to them, the development of 
agrofuels can only lead to greater inequality within developing countries. As stated in the 
preliminary conclusions of the International Conference on Biofuels, held in S&#227;o Paulo 
from 17 to 21 November 2008, there is a need for a &#8220;positive discrimination&#8221; for family 
agriculture, in order to encourage the increased inclusion of smallholder farmers in the market. 
In this regard, capacity-building, technical assistance and access to land and credit should be 
promoted.  
</p>
<p>25. Much of the current debate on the need for a new &#8220;green revolution&#8221; in Africa and on 
large-scale acquisitions or leases of land are a mimicry of the debate launched in 2008 on the 
development of agrofuels. In all these areas, unilateralism needs to give way to an agreement, at 
the multilateral level, on certain parameters or guidelines. Improvements to global governance 
are vital, because consensus needs to be reached on how sustainability and development can go 
hand in hand. Rules related to trade and investment must be reconciled with the requirements of 
human rights and with the need to slow down climate change. While developing countries should 
take into account these requirements as they move towards a more responsible governance of 
their land and other natural resources, industrialized countries should facilitate this through 
capacity-building and transfers of technologies and by controlling their investors and companies 
operating abroad, consistent with their obligation to protect human rights. In this section below, 
the Special Rapporteur argues that a reformed Committee on World Food Security is the 
appropriate forum where multilateralism can make progress on these issues.

<p><b>V.  PROTECTING THE ENTITLEMENTS OF THE POOREST:  
THE ROLE OF SOCIAL PROTECTION 
</b></p>
<p>26. The global food crisis is primarily the result not of too little food being available, but of 
food prices that are high in relation to the incomes of individuals. The recent sharp increase in 
food prices has occurred in a context in which the incomes of affected persons have not 
increased commensurately. The resulting decreases in real income and the ability to command 
food would have been less consequential had the individuals been more adequately shielded by 
social protection systems. In such circumstances, where food can be procured provided the 
purchasing power is sufficient, implementing the right to social security, as required by article 9 
of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,<b>17</b> may be the most 
effective means of ensuring food security when real income is so volatile. The provision of 
social assistance in the form of food vouchers, cash transfers, employment guarantees or other 
mechanisms may also contribute to this.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>27. A significant number of countries reacted to the global food crisis by establishing or 
strengthening safety net programmes, in particular, by raising their levels of support in order to 
help cope with the rising food prices.<b>19</b> Others relied on existing programmes.<b>20</b> In April 2009, 
the World Bank reported that funds granted under the Global Food Crisis Response Programme - 
the Trust Fund and the Additional Funding Grant - were designed to support safety-net 
programmes in Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kyrgyzstan, Madagascar, Nepal, the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, the Republic of Moldova, Sierra Leone and Yemen and social protection 
systems in general in Djibouti, Kenya and the Philippines. Nearly 36 of the 100-odd countries 
surveyed by the International Food Policy Research Institute in September 2008 had used social 
protection measures, particularly conditional cash transfers and midday meals, in order to protect 
their population from the higher prices of food commodities.<b>21</b> In the Philippines, a pilot 
conditional cash transfer programme, the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Programme, which was 
launched in February 2008 in four municipalities, was soon scaled up so as to reach 320,000 
beneficiaries by January 2009.

<p>28. Implementing social assistance programmes by using human rights principles can enhance 
their effectiveness significantly. Firstly, with regard to programmes that target the most 
vulnerable rather than being universal in scope, definition of beneficiaries on the basis of a prior 
mapping of food insecurity can improve targeting significantly, and thus the contribution of 
social assistance schemes to improving food security and poverty reduction as well. Secondly, 
the clear definition of beneficiaries in legislation - making access to social assistance a right for 
the beneficiaries - may limit the risk of resources being diverted as a result of corruption or 
clientelism and can improve accountability of the administration responsible for implementation, 
particularly if courts are empowered to monitor implementation. Thirdly, the definition of the 
programme benefit as deriving from a right held by all citizens (even where the programme is 
targeted) can reduce the element of stigma attached to participating in the programme, which 
could otherwise reduce significantly the participation of eligible persons. Fourthly, the 
participation of beneficiaries in the design and implementation of programmes can improve their 
effectiveness. Fifthly, the gender dimension needs to be taken into account in the design of 
conditional social assistance programmes in particular, since such programmes can have both a 
positive and a negative influence on gender stereotypes, depending on how well the programmes 
are framed.<b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>29. While the conditional provision of social assistance - in which specific eligibility criteria 
must be satisfied - may be desirable from various standpoints (for example, to reduce overall 
programme costs or to increase programme benefits per person), unconditional or universal 
social assistance has much to be recommended in conditions of widespread deprivation, 
particularly in poorer developing countries, where the vulnerable population is a large proportion 
of the total population and administrative capacities may be weak, so much so that the costs of 
targeting could outweigh the benefits. At the same time, however, as noted by the independent 
expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty in a report recently submitted on 
cash transfer programmes (A/HRC/11/9), there is a need for continuous attention to be paid to 
the accessibility and adaptability of schemes to different physical, geographical, social and 
cultural contexts, taking into consideration the constraints faced by groups particularly 
vulnerable to discrimination. Where targeting is chosen because of fiscal constraints, it can be 
achieved either by means testing (transfers of in kind food aid, food vouchers or cash transfers 
conditional on personal characteristics or resources), or by transfers conditional on individual 
actions, as in programmes providing food vouchers or cash against work (cash/food-for-work 
programmes), which are &#8220;self-targeting&#8221;. Whichever the targeting method used, it is essential 
that targeting processes and eligibility criteria be fair, effective and transparent and that they 
safeguard against discrimination.  
</p>
<p>30. Conditional programmes are generally designed to address &#8220;long-term, structural poverty 
rather than income shocks, particularly if those shocks are expected to be short-term ones&#8221;; they 
are not the ideal instrument for dealing with transient poverty.<b>23</b> The adoption in 2005, in India, 
of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act is worth noting because it presents features

</p>
<p>that are sensitive to human rights standards that have contributed to highlighting weaknesses in 
implementation and to redressing some persisting problems. The Act guarantees a legal 
minimum daily wage; workers who are unable to obtain employment through the scheme are 
entitled to unemployment benefit. Records of funds received and projects carried out through the 
Act are publicly available at the district level and can also be obtained through the right of access 
under the Right to Information Act of 2005. Although significant problems remain in the 
implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, this transparency requirement 
constitutes an important safeguard. In addition, the intervention of agricultural workers&#8217; trade 
unions, which organized workers participating in schemes under the Act, improved both levels of 
participation in the scheme and compliance with minimum wage requirements. 
</p>
<p>31. The strengthening of social assistance programmes has a fiscal cost. For developing 
countries, spending on safety nets has averaged from 1 to 2 per cent of GDP in recent years, but 
there are wide variations between countries, depending on the generosity of the programmes and 
the administrative costs involved,<b>24</b> and the quality of targeting. Because of these costs, questions 
about the fiscal sustainability of social assistance programmes can constitute an obstacle to their 
very adoption, and to their maintenance following a crisis, as a permanent safeguard against 
sudden loss of revenues for the poorest members of society. This is regrettable: one of the 
reasons why the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act has been generally more satisfactory 
than other programmes put in place as a response to the crisis is because it is a permanent 
programme, well known to its potential beneficiaries, and the implementation of which is easier 
in times of crisis because of the familiarity with the procedures of the local officials responsible. 
The establishment of standing social assistance programmes is also consistent with a 
rights-based approach; those in need of support should not have to wait until the Government 
declares an emergency and acts accordingly.  
</p>
<p>32. The international community can help overcome the uncertainty factor inherent in the 
strengthening of social protection in developing countries by ensuring them against the risk that 
social protection schemes, once put in place, do not become fiscally unsustainable following 
domestic or international shocks, such as a sudden loss of export revenue, sharp increases in the 
price of food commodities on international markets or poor harvests in the country concerned. A 
global reinsurance mechanism could be put in place, with premiums ideally paid in part by the 
country seeking insurance and matched by donor contributions, thus creating an incentive for 
countries to put in place robust social protection programmes for the benefit of their 
population.<b>25</b>

<p><b>VI. THE ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS:  COPING 
WITH AND COMBATING VOLATILITY 
</b></p>
<p>33. The impact of high food prices on international markets has been greater in countries with 
fewer domestic alternatives to internationally traded grains, the prices of which rose the most 
(maize, wheat and rice).<b>3</b> This is one of the reasons why, in the report on the mission to the 
World Trade Organization (WTO) and the right to food (A/HRC/10/5/Add.2), the 
Special Rapporteur emphasized the need for countries to avoid an excessive dependence on food 
imports and to avoid sacrificing their long-term interest in strengthening their agricultural sector 
for the production of food crops against their short-term interest in purchasing food at often 
artificially depressed prices on international markets. At the same time, since the pursuit of 
self-sufficiency in food is illusory for most countries, the risks associated with international trade 
should be better managed. It is for this reason that the Marrakesh Ministerial Decision on 
Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least 
Developed and Net Food-importing Countries, adopted as part of the WTO agreements (see 
A/HRC/10/5, paras. 20-25).  
</p>
<p>34. Indeed, the international markets proved particularly unreliable during the global food 
crisis of 2007/08. One of the characteristics of the crisis was that a significant number of 
countries (29, according to one count;<b>21</b> at least 20 developing countries according to another 
report)<b>26</b> resorted to export bans or restrictions, including the raising of export tariffs, to keep 
their domestic prices down. These measures were successful in a number of instances, 
particularly in larger countries, such as China or India, whose dependence on imports is limited 
given that they import no more than 1.5 per cent of their total grain requirements. However, to 
the extent that such restrictions were imposed simultaneously by a number of exporters 
representing a significant share of the market, it helped drive availability down and prices up on 
international markets, severely penalizing the low income net food-importing countries. In a 
number of countries, the Government therefore concluded agreements with importers or retailers, 
or imposed price regulations, in order to ensure affordability of food. 
</p>
<p>35. There are means that countries might use to protect themselves against the risk of sudden 
price increases on international markets. Some countries establish food reserves at the national or 
the local level to cushion the impact of price spikes on international markets,<b>27</b> as seen following 
the global food crisis. The establishment and management of food reserves may also be a means 
to ensure sufficiently stable and remunerative prices to smallholders; for instance, in Brazil, the 
programme for the acquisition of food (<i>Programa de aquisicao de alimentos</i>), conceived to 
support the marketing of family farmers&#8217; products, is also designed to establish a bridge between

</p>
<p>food producers and consumers, stimulate food production and provide access to food to 
food-insecure families. The Government, through the National Supply Company CONAB, buys 
food from family farmers, as long as the prices are not higher than those found on regional 
markets. This programme guarantees an income to family farmers, and has an annual limit 
of 3,500 reais.<b>28</b> 
</p>
<p>36. Another option is to conclude long-term supply arrangements, by which importing 
countries agree to buy a minimum amount of grain or other food crop each year in exchange for 
a commitment by the exporting country to meet larger imports when needed. Such arrangements 
make net food-importing countries less subject to the volatility of market prices for the crops 
they import, although there is a risk that the counterpart reneges on the arrangements, pleading 
altered circumstances. A viable alternative if food shortages do not arise simultaneously in a 
large number of countries is for Governments, fearing shortages, to resort to contingent option 
contracts, by buying options on future imports which, if exercised, would be realized by physical 
delivery (that is, in the event that harvests are as poor as initially feared). This is in essence the 
course of action taken by Malawi, with assistance from the World Bank and the Government of 
Great Britain, in 2005/06, using call options from the South African futures exchange to help cap 
the cost of managing an anticipated &#8220;hungry season&#8221; shortage of 60,000 tons of white maize 
valued at $17 million. Since the spot price of maize rose significantly in late 2005, ex post the 
option contract proved to be an efficient way to procure food and meet the needs of the 
population.<b>29</b>  
</p>
<p>37. All the above-mentioned options are means by which countries shield themselves from the 
impact of volatile prices on international markets. But volatility itself may be combated more 
effectively. Many observers of the global food crisis now agree that speculation by commodity 
index funds on the futures markets of agricultural commodities was a significant factor in the 
peak of 2007/08. In the period 2006-2008, the abundance of international liquidity coupled with 
a slowdown on financial markets drew a large amount of investment capital into agricultural 
commodities exchanges. Investors not active in the underlying commodity markets (such as 
farmers and producers) are not present on the futures markets for price discovery or hedging. 
Instead, they bet that prices will either rise or fall as part of an investment strategy, rather than as 
a way to manage risk related to the sale or purchase of commodities. The sale or purchase of 
futures is a mere portfolio decision, without any relation to the &#8220;fundamentals&#8221; of the economy - 
the underlying economic reality. This has been, in particular, the strategy of commodity index 
funds, which arrived massively on the futures markets of agricultural commodities in the period 
2006-2008. Such funds speculate on a basket of 20 or more commodities, agricultural 
commodities accounting for 10 to 20 per cent of the total. It has been reported that, at the end 
of March 2008, investors worldwide held an estimated $400 billion in commodity futures 
contracts - about $70 billion more than at the beginning of the year, and twice as much as in

<p>late 2005,<b>30</b> leading to the formation of a speculative bubble on markets for maize, wheat, 
soybeans and rice.<b>31</b> While speculation thus understood is not the immediate cause of price 
increases on the spot market (where commodities are effectively traded), it may nevertheless 
exacerbate volatility by encouraging hoarding by both private traders and Governments, and 
because of the relative slowness of supply and demand to react to price changes.<b>32</b> According to 
the World Bank, this had a significant impact on prices: &#8220;real-side speculation (the decision to 
hold stocks in anticipation of further price increases or to order more than needed now for the 
same reasons) likely contributed to the rapid increase in prices during 2007 and 2008&#8221;.<b>33</b> This is 
also the conclusion reached by UNCTAD in its report on the global economic crisis.<b>34</b>  
</p>
<p>38. A number of measures could be taken to limit the risks engendered by financial 
speculation. Certain measures would be of a purely regulatory or institutional nature; for 
instance, to dampen pure financial speculation, regulators could increase the margin (for 
example, from 10 per cent to 30 per cent as down payment), as this would force speculators to 
make a larger down payment for their speculation. The registration of funds trading on 
agricultural commodities on spot or derivative markets has also been proposed, in order either to 
exclude hedge funds from those markets or to allow for their activities to be better monitored, for 
instance by prohibiting certain highly speculative activities, such as short selling or dealing in 
over-the-counter derivatives.<b>35</b> The International Food Policy Research Institute has proposed the 
establishment of a fund managed independently by a high-level group of experts allowed to 
intervene on the futures markets when prices appear significantly higher than what would 
correspond to a reasonable margin within a dynamic price band. The group would execute a

<p>  In addition, higher prices on the futures markets may be misinterpreted by traders as 
incorporating new market information, thus leading to the formation of a bubble, because all 
traders will react in a similar way.

<p>number of silent short sells over a period of time in futures markets around the world at a price 
lower than the current spot price, thus increasing the supply of future sells and minimizing 
speculative attacks.<b>36</b>   
</p>
<p>39. Other measures could consist of improved management of grain stocks at the global level. 
Improved information about and coordination of global grain stocks could limit the 
attractiveness of speculation. Rebuilding stocks in order to minimize temporary shortages linked, 
for instance, to weather-related events, and thus to buffer sharp price movements, would also 
limit volatility. At a minimum, the establishment of an emergency reserve allowing the World 
Food Programme (WFP) to meet humanitarian needs through access to grain at pre-crisis market 
prices would be justified.<b>37</b>  
40. UNCTAD calls for &#8220;a new global institutional arrangement consisting of a minimum 
physical grain reserve to stabilize markets, to respond effectively to emergency cases and 
humanitarian crisis and an intervention mechanism&#8221;.<b>38</b> Despite numerous calls to this effect, 
however, no progress has been made on this issue in the past year. The systemic risks associated 
with the current organization of the global food system remain unaddressed. Like the failure of 
the international community to reach a consensus on agrofuels, it reveals a gap in global 
governance for which people are paying a very high price. In the final section of the present 
report, the Special Rapporteur examines how this gap could be bridged.  
</p>
<p><b>VII.  REFORMING GLOBAL GOVERNANCE 
</b></p>
<p>41. There is a common thread running through the different themes explored in the present 
report: the need to strengthen multilateralism to address effectively the structural causes of the 
global food crisis. International agencies have worked remarkably well together since April 2008 
as a result of the High-level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis set up under the 
leadership of the Secretary-General, which agreed on the Comprehensive Framework for Action 
that lists the operational measures that Governments could take with the support of the 
international community. Governments too have to act in a coordinated fashion in order to 
ensure that investments in agriculture, including as a result of transnational large-scale land 
acquisitions or leases, contribute to sustainable development; they have to act together to agree 
on guidelines for the production and use of agrofuels; and they have to act together to establish a 
reinsurance mechanism to make the strengthening of social protection an option that is both

</b>  J. van Braun and M. Torero, op. cit. Although in principle the future sells would not need to 
</p>
<p>be realized and the operation would remain a virtual one, the costs of a failure to stabilize 
markets would be potentially very high. 
<b>37
</b></p>
<p>  On the basis of the current emergency requirements of WFP, the International Food Policy 
Research Institute estimates that an emergency reserve of around 300,000 tons of basic grain 
would be sufficient for this purpose.

<p>desirable and fiscally sustainable for developing States, or to combat volatility on the 
international markets of agricultural commodities. Now is the time to achieve the reform of 
global governance that will allow us to define the realization of the right to food as a global 
common good.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged that the issue of the right to adequate food is 
increasingly raised in contexts in which it was much less visible in the past. In its draft strategic 
framework and medium-term plan for the period 2010-2013, FAO now considers adding 
governance and the right to food to its efforts to combat hunger. The right to food was also a key 
element of the High-level Meeting on Food Security for All, convened in Madrid on 26 and 
27 January 2009 by the Prime Minister of Spain and the Secretary General, who pleaded for 
inclusion of the right to food in the work of the High-level Task Force on the Global Food 
Security Crisis as a basis for analysis, action and accountability. Such a shift is essential, and it is 
not limited to institutional or governance components. The right to food should guide all our 
efforts, whether they relate to rural development and support for agriculture or to social 
protection.  
</p>
<p>43. On 27 April 2009, the contact group for the revitalization of the Committee on World Food 
Security held the first of a number of meetings, which should lead it to make proposals to 
transform the Committee into a body that could achieve this. The Committee, currently one of 
the committees listed in article 5, paragraph 6, of the Constitution of FAO, has the task of 
assisting the Council of FAO in its functions. It should transform itself into something far more 
ambitious: a forum in which Governments, international agencies and civil society organizations 
could discuss issues, such as those listed in the present report; which calls for more cooperation 
between States, to the extent required for the realization of the right to food; and which could 
lead to the adoption of guidelines revised at regular intervals on the range of issues that could 
contribute to this objective. The Committee should ensure improved coordination among 
Governments, international agencies and non-governmental organizations in implementing these 
guidelines; it could facilitate achievement of a consensus on emerging issues, as well as improve 
accountability, by monitoring the efforts of Governments and international agencies in the 
implementation of the guidelines.  
</p>
<p>44. As a member of the contact group, the Special Rapporteur proposed that the revised 
Committee on World Food Security should combine the three core functions of coordination, 
learning and monitoring progress. This could be achieved by transforming the Committee into a 
platform: (a) to adopt guidelines, based on the joint understanding of the obstacles to the 
realization of the right to adequate food; (b) to request Governments and international agencies 
to identify a set of targets to be achieved in the implementation of the guidelines; (c) to receive 
reports on the achievement of these targets, on which the Committee should comment with the 
assistance of a high-level panel of experts; and (d) to revise the guidelines in the light of the 
difficulties encountered in their implementation.   
</p>
<p>45. The above proposal is based on the diagnosis of the reasons for our failure to eradicate 
hunger and acute malnutrition, referred to in the introduction of the present report. A revitalized 
Committee on World Food Security could contribute significantly to addressing each of these 
problems. It would significantly increase accountability, particularly if the targets to be achieved 
by States are set at the national level, through participatory processes involving civil society 
organizations and leading to the identification of clear, time-bound priorities on the basis of the </p>

<p>A/HRC/12/31*

</p>
<p>mapping of food insecurity and vulnerability. For developed countries in particular, the targets 
could include levels of contribution to international assistance and cooperation with developing 
countries, in accordance with the priorities set by the guidelines adopted by the Committee.  
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>We can transform this crisis into an opportunity. But this requires that we ensure 
that the reinvestment in agriculture effectively contributes to combating hunger and 
malnutrition; we guarantee the right to social security; we enable countries to cope with 
volatility of prices on international markets while combating its sources at the same time; 
and we improve the global governance of food security.</b> 
</p>
<p>47. <b>With regard to agricultural investment the Special Rapporteur calls on the Human 
Rights Council:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To encourage the international community (States, international agencies, 
donor countries) to ensure that the reinvestment in agriculture and rural development 
effectively contributes to the progressive realization of the right to food, by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Accelerating the work for better implementation of relevant ILO 
conventions in rural areas, in order to guarantee that those working on 
farms can be guaranteed a living wage, adequate health and safe 
conditions of employment; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Undertaking rigorous comparative assessments of the impact of different 
agricultural modes of production on the right to food; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Channelling adequate support to sustainable farming approaches that 
benefit the most vulnerable groups and that are resilient to climate change 
and the depletion of hydrocarbons; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Prioritizing the provision of public goods, such as storage facilities, 
extension services, means of communications, access to credit and 
insurance, agricultural research and the organization of farmers in 
cooperatives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Encouraging States to locate their efforts in reinvesting in agriculture 
under national strategies for the realization of the right to adequate food 
that include mapping of the food insecure, adoption of relevant legislation 
and policies, and the establishment of mechanisms to ensure 
accountability, and which are adopted through participatory mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To promote the adoption of a multilateral framework that ensures that 
large-scale land acquisitions or leases are balanced, conducive to sustainable development 
and comply with human rights, including the right to food, the right to adequate housing 
and the right to development; </b></p>

<p>  A/HRC/12/31* 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p><b> (c) To encourage the international community to accelerate work on reaching 
international consensus on agrofuels that includes environmental standards and 
incorporates requirements of human rights instruments, paying attention in particular to 
the specific needs of smallholders. 
</b></p>
<p>48. <b>With regard to social protection, the Special Rapporteur calls on the Council: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To encourage States to guarantee the right to social security to all, without 
discrimination, through the establishment of standing social protection schemes, and to 
ensure that, when targeted schemes are adopted, they are based on criteria that are fair, 
effective and transparent; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To encourage the international community to put in place a global reinsurance 
mechanism, creating an incentive for countries to set up robust social protection 
programmes for the benefit of their populations. 
</b></p>
<p>49. <b>With regard to volatility on international markets, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages the international community to better manage the risks associated with 
international trade and to ensure least-developed and net food-importing developing 
countries better protection from the volatility of international market prices, and to 
combat volatility on international markets more effectively by:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) The full implementation of the Marrakesh Decision within WTO; 
 (b) Encouraging the establishment of food reserves at the local, national or regional 
levels; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Improving the management of grain stocks at the global level, including 
improved information about and coordination of global grain stocks to limit the 
attractiveness of speculation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Establishing an emergency reserve that allows WFP to meet humanitarian 
needs at pre-crisis prices; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Examining further the proposals for a minimum physical grain reserve to 
stabilize markets, and for other means to combat speculation on the futures markets of 
agricultural commodities by commodity index funds.  
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>With regard to the strengthening of global governance, the Special Rapporteur calls 
on the Council to encourage States to transform the Committee on World Food Security 
into a forum in which Governments, international agencies and civil society organizations 
can discuss issues that call for more cooperation between States, adopt guidelines revised at 
regular intervals and improve accountability by monitoring achievement of time-bound 
targets set by States and international agencies for the implementation of those guidelines.
