</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the principles and objectives of the Charter of the United Nations, the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenants on Human Rights,

in the context of the current situation, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>that the Israeli military attacks and operations in the Occupied Palestinian

rights of the Palestinian people therein and undermine international efforts towards achieving a 
just and lasting peace in the region based on the two-State solution,

closure of border crossings, leads to disastrous humanitarian, economic and environmental 
consequences, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Demands</i> that the occupying Power, Israel, end its occupation of the Palestinian land 
occupied since 1967, and to respect its commitments within the peace process towards the 
establishment of the independent sovereign Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, 
living in peace and security with all its neighbours; </p>
<p> 2.<i> Strongly condemns</i> the Israeli military attacks and operations in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, particularly the recent ones in the occupied Gaza Strip, which have resulted 
in the killing and injury of thousands of Palestinians civilians, including a large number of 
women and children, and also condemns the firing of crude rockets on Israeli civilians; </p>

</p>
<p> 3. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying Power, Israel, stop the targeting of civilians and the 
systematic destruction of the cultural heritage of the Palestinian people, in addition to the 
destruction of public and private properties, and the targeting of United Nations facilities, as laid 
down in the Fourth Geneva Convention; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also demands</i> that Israel, the occupying Power, cease immediately all current 
excavations beneath and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, and refrain from any act that 
may endanger the structure or change the nature of the holy sites both Islamic and Christian, in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory, particularly in and around Jerusalem; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls</i> <i>for</i> immediate protection of all civilians, including an international protection 
for the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in compliance with international 
human rights and humanitarian law, both applicable in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 
including East Jerusalem;

throughout the Occupied Palestinian Territory and of the firing of crude rockets by Palestinian 
combatants against southern Israel; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Demands</i> that the occupying Power, Israel, immediately stop its illegal decision to 
demolish a large number of Palestinian houses in the East Jerusalem neighbourhood of 
Al-Bustan in the Selwan area, near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which will result in the displacement of 
more than 1,500 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem;

detainees;
