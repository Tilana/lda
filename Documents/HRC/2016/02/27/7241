<p><b>  </b>Report of the Independent Expert on the situation of human

<p> 
</p>
<p> Summary </p>
<p> This report follows two visits made by the Independent Expert and presents an 
</p>
<p>overview of and major developments in the situation of human rights in the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic. 
</p>
<p> The Transitional Government has a number of significant achievements to its 
</p>
<p>credit, including the organization of national consultations and the Bangui Forum, 
</p>
<p>which resulted in the adoption of the Republican Pact for Peace, National 
</p>
<p>Reconciliation and Reconstruction. The Bangui Forum also led to the signing of an 
</p>
<p>agreement on the principles of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and a 
</p>
<p>further agreement under which the armed groups committed themselves to stop 
</p>
<p>recruiting children and to release all child soldiers from their ranks.  
</p>
<p> The Transitional President also took an unprecedented step in the fight against 
</p>
<p>impunity by promulgating a law establishing a Special Criminal Court competent to 
</p>
<p>investigate the serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>committed in the country since 1 January 2003, and to hear and rule in such cases.  
</p>
<p> The challenges faced by the Central African Republic include re-establishing 
</p>
<p>State authority, security and administration throughout the country; restoring the rule 
</p>
<p>of law and justice; reforming the security sector and implementing the disarmament, 
</p>
<p>demobilization, repatriation and reintegration strategy; co mbating impunity; achieving 
</p>
<p>reconciliation; strengthening peaceful coexistence and social cohesion; reviving the 
</p>
<p>economy; combating poverty; and, finally, protecting and assisting displaced persons 
</p>
<p>and refugees in their return and reintegration.  </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-12489 <b>2/22 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p> It is in this context that the Independent Expert reports on the main allegations of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations brought to her attention. These include violations of the right 
</p>
<p>to life, acts of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary arrests, rape, 
</p>
<p>racketeering and extortion, violations of the right to education, the right to health and 
</p>
<p>the right to food. Intercommunal tensions in the country remain high and require the 
</p>
<p>Government to take urgent measures to facilitate peaceful coexistence between the 
</p>
<p>communities and prevent intercommunal violence leading to serious human rights 
</p>
<p>violations. 
</p>
<p> Most of the human rights violations are committed by the armed groups that are 
</p>
<p>operating more or less freely in certain areas of the country or result from 
</p>
<p>shortcomings on the part of the State, which remains incapable of imposing its 
</p>
<p>authority throughout the territory, preventing violations or ensuring the rule of law and 
</p>
<p>the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p> Respect for the rights of the Muslim minority and the establishment  of a culture 
</p>
<p>of peaceful coexistence, two long-term aims of the people of the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic, must be reinforced and fostered by respect for human rights and for the 
</p>
<p>principles and rules of democracy.

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
</p>
<p>27/28 of 3 October 2014 whereby the Council extended the mandate of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert and asked her to submit a written report at its thirtieth session.  
</p>
<p>2. This report, which covers the period from May 2014 to the end of June 2015, is 
</p>
<p>based on two visits to the Central African Republic, the first of which took place from 
</p>
<p>3 to 14 February 2015 and the second from 16 to 24 June 2015. It presents the 
</p>
<p>conclusions of the Independent Expert and her recommendations to the Government of 
</p>
<p>the Central African Republic and to the international community.  
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert would like to thank the authorities of the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic and the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization 
</p>
<p>Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) for ensuring that her two visits 
</p>
<p>took place under optimum conditions. During the missions, the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>took care to listen to all stakeholders in order to gather their views and opinions on the 
</p>
<p>human rights situation and on the possible solutions to improve it. With this aim in 
</p>
<p>mind, she also met with the country&#8217;s most senior officials. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>would like to express her gratitude to the Transitional Head of State, Ms. Samba-
</p>
<p>Panza, for engaging in open and fruitful discussion with her.  
</p>
<p>4. The Independent Expert also spoke with the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, 
</p>
<p>Defence, Justice, Reconciliation, Social Affairs and Humanitarian Action, Territor ial 
</p>
<p>Administration and Tourism, as well as with senior representatives from the central 
</p>
<p>and territorial administration, including the Prosecutor of Bangui.  
</p>
<p>5. She held extensive discussions with the leadership and other sections of 
</p>
<p>MINUSCA, the Humanitarian Coordinator and specialized agencies of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, the force commanders of MINUSCA and Sangaris and representatives of the 
</p>
<p>diplomatic corps, including the African Group of Ambassadors, representatives of the 
</p>
<p>African Union and the mediator in the Central African Republic for the Economic 
</p>
<p>Community of Central African States (ECCAS). She also met with representatives of 
</p>
<p>the European Union, France, the Russian Federation and the United States of America.  
</p>
<p>6. In addition, she participated in talks with representatives of various civil society 
</p>
<p>organizations and associations, human rights organizations, women&#8217;s organizations 
</p>
<p>and youth organizations. She also met with leaders of the Interfaith Peace Platform 
</p>
<p>and other religious officials.  
</p>
<p>7. The Independent Expert spoke with representatives of political parties and with 
</p>
<p>the key representatives of the former S&#233;l&#233;ka forces and anti -balaka groups.  
</p>
<p>8. In addition to Bangui, she visited Berb&#233;rati and Boali, in the west of the country, 
</p>
<p>and Bambari and Bria in the eastern central region, as well as displaced persons&#8217; sites 
</p>
<p>in Yalok&#233; (north-west of Bangui) where she was accompanied by the Deputy 
</p>
<p>Emergency Relief Coordinator, Ms. Kyung-wha Kang, and the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, Mr. Chaloka Beyani. She also 
</p>
<p>visited the displaced persons&#8217; camp in M&#8217;poko, near to Bangui airport, and the PK5 
</p>
<p>Muslim enclave in Bangui. 
</p>
<p>9. The Independent Expert would particularly like to thank the Director of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Division of MINUSCA and his staff for their support in organizing her 
</p>
<p>visits.  
</p>
<p>10. The Independent Expert also participated in two interactive dialogues with the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council on the human rights situation in the Central African Republic 
</p>
<p>at its twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth sessions. During the interactive dialogue of 30 </p>

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>June 2015, the chosen format allowed more in-depth discussion on the efforts being 
</p>
<p>made to combat impunity in the Central African Republic, with the participation of the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Deputy Head of 
</p>
<p>MINUSCA, the Ministers of Justice and National Reconciliation of the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic, and Imam Kobine Layama, representing the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic Interfaith Peace Platform.1 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>II.<b> </b>General situation<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Political context<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11. The political transition that began on 18 August 2013 for an initial period of 18 
</p>
<p>months was extended on 22 December 2014 for an additional 6 months by Mr. Denis 
</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso, the mediator in the Central African Republic for the ECCAS and 
</p>
<p>President of the Republic of the Congo. The current political transition provides for a 
</p>
<p>constitutional referendum and presidential and legislative elections, which should 
</p>
<p>mark the end of the transition and a return to constitutional o rder by the end of 2015. 
</p>
<p>12. On 23 January 2015, in her speech marking the first anniversary of the transition, 
</p>
<p>President Samba-Panza noted that the Central African Republic was recovering slowly 
</p>
<p>but surely thanks to the joint efforts of the Central African people and the international 
</p>
<p>community. She stressed that security was gaining ground with the support of the 
</p>
<p>international forces and that State authority was gradually being restored through the 
</p>
<p>deployment of civil servants in the interior of the country. 
</p>
<p>13. The agreement on the cessation of hostilities in the Central African Republic 
</p>
<p>signed on 23 July 2014 provided for, inter alia, the holding of a national forum that 
</p>
<p>would pave the way for the restoration of peace and national reconciliation and the 
</p>
<p>holding of free, democratic and transparent elections to enable a return to a 
</p>
<p>constitutional system. The forum was to be preceded by local consultations so as to 
</p>
<p>restore the relationship between the State and its citizens and to lay the foundations 
</p>
<p>for a process of political dialogue. 
</p>
<p>14. These local consultations were held in January and February 2015, and the 
</p>
<p>following four areas of focus were defined: (a) dialogue, truth, justice, reparation and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation; (b) peace and security, disarmament, demobi lization and reintegration, 
</p>
<p>security sector reform and child soldiers; (c) governance and elections; and (d) 
</p>
<p>economic development and assistance for victims. A total of 28 facilitation teams of 
</p>
<p>10 to 15 persons each were deployed throughout the country and  in other countries 
</p>
<p>hosting large numbers of refugees or residents from the Central African Republic 
</p>
<p>(namely Chad, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Congo and 
</p>
<p>France) in order to hear and record citizens&#8217; main concerns and expectations. About 
</p>
<p>20,000 persons were consulted, 4,370 of whom were women. In areas controlled by 
</p>
<p>former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters, armed members of that faction threatened the government 
</p>
<p>delegations and facilitation teams, thereby disrupting and delaying the consultations. 
</p>
<p>However, thanks to the intervention of MINUSCA, Sangaris and the European Union 
</p>
<p>military operation in the Central African Republic (EUFOR RCA), consultations were 
</p>
<p>successfully held in all provinces.  
</p>
<p>15. The Bangui National Forum on National Reconciliation was held from 4 to 11 
</p>
<p>May 2015. The overall objective was to provide an opportunity for nationals of the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic to reflect on the root causes of the crisis and propose ways

</b></p>
<p>of addressing them. The idea was to establish a new social contract for the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic. 
</p>
<p>16. The Bangui Forum adopted the Republican Pact for Peace, National 
</p>
<p>Reconciliation and Reconstruction, which reaffirms, inter alia, the need to create 
</p>
<p>conditions conducive to holding a constitutional referendum and free and transparent 
</p>
<p>general elections throughout the country as soon as possible, and calls for the effective 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Special Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p>17. With regard to human rights and justice, the Republican Pact affirms the need to 
</p>
<p>strengthen and respect the constitutional provisions on the protection of human rights 
</p>
<p>and fundamental freedoms, without discrimination on the grounds of age, sex, 
</p>
<p>ethnicity or religion, and to guarantee freedom of movement throughout the country. It 
</p>
<p>calls for the establishment of a national human rights institution and a transitional 
</p>
<p>justice mechanism, including a truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation 
</p>
<p>commission. 
</p>
<p>18. The Bangui Forum also led to the signing of an agreement on the principles of 
</p>
<p>disarmament, demobilization and reintegration and a further agreement under which 
</p>
<p>the armed groups committed themselves to stop recruiting children and to release all 
</p>
<p>child soldiers associated with their groups.  
</p>
<p>19. In a press release issued on 13 May 2015, the Independent Expert welcomed the 
</p>
<p>adoption of the Republican Pact and urged all stakeholders to fulfil their commitments 
</p>
<p>in order to pave the way for reconciliation and the restoration of lasting peace.  
</p>
<p>20. The constitutional review process is also under way, and a preliminary draft was 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Transitional National Council on 17 February 2015. The Republican 
</p>
<p>Pact includes a number of important recommendations concerning the Constitution, 
</p>
<p>which should be taken into account by the Government and the Transitional National 
</p>
<p>Council. The new Constitution is expected to be adopted by referendum on 4 October 
</p>
<p>2015. 
</p>
<p>21. On 22 April 2015, the Transitional National Council adopted the law on the 
</p>
<p>establishment of the Special Criminal Court, which was then promulgated on 3  June. 
</p>
<p>Pursuant to this law, the Court has the power to investigate any serious violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the country since 1 
</p>
<p>January 2003 and to hear and rule in such cases.  
</p>
<p>22. In June, the Government announced a new electoral calendar, according to which 
</p>
<p>the first round of presidential and parliamentary elections is to be held on 18 October 
</p>
<p>2015 and the second on 22 November. In preparation for the elections, voter 
</p>
<p>registration will take place from 27 June to 27 July. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Security context<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23. The overall security situation has improved since the arrival of the MINUSCA, 
</p>
<p>Sangaris and EUFOR RCA forces. With regard to MINUSCA, the Security Council, in 
</p>
<p>its resolution 2217 (2015), authorized the deployment of 12,870 uniformed personnel, 
</p>
<p>including 2,120 police officers. Their deployment, initially in Bangui and then 
</p>
<p>progressively throughout the rest of the country, was followed by the deployment of 
</p>
<p>State civil servants, though on a small scale.  
</p>
<p>24. In Bangui, anti-balaka militias continued to threaten residents&#8217; safety on a 
</p>
<p>regular basis. The arrest by MINUSCA of one of their leaders, Rodrigue Ga&#239;bona (also 
</p>
<p>known as Andilo), on 17 January 2015 was followed by several hostage -taking 
</p>
<p>incidents in Bangui. A French humanitarian worker was kidnapped on 19 January and 
</p>
<p>subsequently released on 23 January; a MINUSCA employee was briefly abducted on </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-12489 <b>8/22 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>20 January; and the Minister of Youth and Sports, Armel Sayo, was kidnapped on 25 
</p>
<p>January and released on 10 February.  
</p>
<p>25. About 2,000 former S&#233;l&#233;ka combatants and their families remain billeted in three 
</p>
<p>military camps in Bangui, known as the R&#233;giment de d&#233;fense op&#233;rationnelle du 
</p>
<p>territoire (Regiment for the operational defence of the country) (RDOT), B&#233;al and 
</p>
<p>Bataillon du soutien et des services (Support and services battalion) (BSS) camps, and 
</p>
<p>they have at their disposal a large supply of war material and ammunition. However, 
</p>
<p>an agreement to clear the B&#233;al camp of its stockpile of explosives and ammunition 
</p>
<p>was signed with the armed groups at the end of May.  
</p>
<p>26. Security has gradually returned to the rest of the country, thanks to increased 
</p>
<p>patrolling by MINUSCA. However, there was still a very real presence of armed 
</p>
<p>groups throughout the year, with anti-balaka groups controlling the western part of the 
</p>
<p>country and former S&#233;l&#233;ka combatants controlling the northern and eastern areas. The 
</p>
<p>country is also still under threat of action by members of other armed groups, such as 
</p>
<p>the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army in the west or R&#233;volution et Justice and the Front 
</p>
<p>D&#233;mocratique du Peuple Centrafricain in the east. The Secretary -General of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations has also warned about the unconfirmed presence near the border with 
</p>
<p>Cameroon of members of Boko Haram who may be seeking to expand their terro rist 
</p>
<p>activities into the Central African Republic.  
</p>
<p>27. Given the virtual absence of State authority in the interior of the country, armed 
</p>
<p>groups continue to tax citizens illegally and profit from illegal mining activities. With 
</p>
<p>support from MINUSCA, the Government has begun stationing civil servants in posts 
</p>
<p>throughout the country, although only 8 out of 16 prefects have been posted thus far. 
</p>
<p>The Independent Expert also noted that the judiciary and the police and gendarmerie 
</p>
<p>forces still have only a limited presence or none at all in many areas, particularly in 
</p>
<p>the east of the country. 
</p>
<p>28. While the outline and strategy of the disarmament, demobilization and 
</p>
<p>reintegration programme were drawn up at the Bangui Forum, as at the end of June, 
</p>
<p>the Government and MINUSCA were still awaiting funds for its implementation.  
</p>
<p>29. Since the Bangui Forum, there have been several security incidents involving 
</p>
<p>members of armed groups, notably one in early June in which two peacekeepers were 
</p>
<p>injured in an ambush reportedly carried out by the anti-balaka. These incidents 
</p>
<p>highlight the lack of cohesion within the armed groups, as rogue elements continue to 
</p>
<p>commit acts that violate the agreements signed by their leaders.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Economic context<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30. The Central African Republic is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a 
</p>
<p>ranking of 185 out of 187 on the Human Development Index. 2  The country has 
</p>
<p>historically lacked infrastructure &#8212; a situation that results in the geographic and 
</p>
<p>spatial exclusion of its people and exacerbates rural poverty.3 In 2014, the country 
</p>
<p>experienced a modest economic recovery, which is expected to continue in 2015 and 
</p>
<p>2016 thanks to the improved security situation and the holding of credible presidential 
</p>
<p>and legislative elections. 
</p>
<p>31. In peacetime, the four generators of wealth are diamonds, timber, cotton and 
</p>
<p>livestock. Processing industries, which were just beginning to develop before the 
</p>
<p>crisis, were negatively affected but have subsequently experienced a partial recovery.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>Rampant corruption is severely hindering the development of the timber and diamond 
</p>
<p>industries. 
</p>
<p>32. The power wielded by armed groups poses a real obstacle to the resumption of 
</p>
<p>agropastoral activities and is seriously disrupting the trade in livestock and the supply 
</p>
<p>of beef. Livestock farmers are also victims of assault and extortion in some regions. 4 
</p>
<p>33. The country&#8217;s public finances are in a state of almost complete chaos, and 
</p>
<p>revenue is drying up. The Government has clearly established economic recovery as a 
</p>
<p>priority, with a view to promoting wealth creation and improving people&#8217;s living 
</p>
<p>conditions. It has taken steps to improve the social climate by ensuring that salaries 
</p>
<p>and pensions are paid on a more or less regular basis in 2015.  
</p>
<p>34. The Republican Pact calls on the Government to introduce a comprehensive 
</p>
<p>strategy for reconstruction and economic development that takes the most 
</p>
<p>disadvantaged regions of the country into consideration, as well as a legitimate 
</p>
<p>employment policy, particularly for young people, women and vulnerable population 
</p>
<p>groups. Such measures will be essential as a means of providing an alternative for 
</p>
<p>young people and enabling them to reintegrate into their communities. Juvenile 
</p>
<p>offenders who have been handed light sentences and those who have served their 
</p>
<p>sentences should also benefit from reintegration measures.  
</p>
<p>35. The decision, taken at the meeting of members of the Kimberley Process on 26 
</p>
<p>June 2015, to allow the authorities to once again export diamonds mined in the west of 
</p>
<p>the country should generate new tax revenues, which are sorely needed. Measures 
</p>
<p>must be taken to ensure that the country&#8217;s mineral resources are soundly managed, so 
</p>
<p>that henceforth the funds created by those resources will feed the State coffers rather 
</p>
<p>than trafficking and corruption.  
</p>
<p>36. The international community has come to the aid of the Central African Republic 
</p>
<p>since the start of the crisis, but the assistance given is not sufficient to provide 
</p>
<p>effective relief. 
</p>

<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Protection of civilians: violations committed by armed groups<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>37. Despite the agreement on the cessation of hostilities signed on 23 July 2014, 
</p>
<p>armed groups, particularly the anti-balaka and former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters, continue to 
</p>
<p>operate relatively freely throughout much of the country and co mmit atrocities against 
</p>
<p>civilian populations. The main allegations of human rights violations brought to the 
</p>
<p>attention of the Independent Expert include violations of the right to life, acts of 
</p>
<p>torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary arrest, rape, racketeering and 
</p>
<p>extortion, and violations of the right to education, the right to health and the right to 
</p>
<p>food. Taking advantage of the limited presence of the State, armed groups exert de 
</p>
<p>facto authority and plunder the country&#8217;s natural resources. 
</p>
<p>38. The conflict has exacerbated intercommunal violence. The anti -balaka and/or the 
</p>
<p>former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters continue to intimidate, threaten and attack individuals and local 
</p>
<p>communities because of their alleged collaboration or affiliation with the rival arm ed 
</p>
<p>group. These abuses have intensified during the migration of the Fulani herders and in 
</p>
<p>the context of conflicts over access to land and water resources.

</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>39. The most serious incidents took place in Bangui from 7 to 16 October 2014 and 
</p>
<p>were largely attributed to anti-balaka fighters. The clashes began on 7 October with 
</p>
<p>the murder of a man suspected of being a former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighter; he was killed by an 
</p>
<p>angry mob that claimed he had thrown a grenade into a crowded market area. The 
</p>
<p>incident degenerated into a series of attacks and counter-attacks, in which 11 civilians 
</p>
<p>were killed and another 229 injured, including members of both the Christian and the 
</p>
<p>Muslim communities. The clashes also led to the displacement of more than 7,100 
</p>
<p>civilians in the greater Bangui area and the looting and burning of at least 30 homes 
</p>
<p>and many shops. Humanitarian workers and their equipment were also the targets of 
</p>
<p>attacks and looting. A MINUSCA convoy was ambushed on 9 October, with two 
</p>
<p>soldiers killed and seven others injured.  
</p>
<p>40. In the territory under their control, the former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters have occupied 
</p>
<p>administrative buildings and exert de facto authority. Internal power struggles and a 
</p>
<p>lack of cohesion and discipline have led to new clashes among factions, which have 
</p>
<p>severely affected the civilian population.  
</p>
<p>41. In Bria, for example, the security situation deteriorated considerably in October 
</p>
<p>as a result of heightened tensions among the various factions of former S&#233;l&#233;ka 
</p>
<p>fighters. In January 2015, Bria fell under the control of former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters 
</p>
<p>belonging to the Front populaire pour la renaissance de la Centrafrique, who refused 
</p>
<p>to allow the presence of any representatives of the Bangui Government or the holding 
</p>
<p>of local elections in areas under their control. On 10 February, MINUSCA and 
</p>
<p>Sangaris forces launched a joint operation to drive these armed groups out of all 
</p>
<p>government buildings in Bria. Six former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters were killed in the operation, 
</p>
<p>several were injured and another 16 were arrested.  
</p>
<p>42. Attacks by armed groups continued in early 2015, causing many civilian 
</p>
<p>casualties. On 5 and 6 January, seven civilians, including a 6 -month-old baby and a 
</p>
<p>13-year-old child, were shot and killed near Ngakobo by former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters of the 
</p>
<p>Union pour la paix en Centrafrique. On 27 January, 14 civilians were killed in an 
</p>
<p>attack by former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters belonging to the Front populaire pour la renaissance 
</p>
<p>de la Centrafrique near Kaga Bandoro in Nana -Gr&#233;bizi prefecture. On 14 February, in 
</p>
<p>the PK5 area of Bangui, four civilians suffered serious injuries when they were 
</p>
<p>attacked by a former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighter, apparently in retaliation for the killing of a young 
</p>
<p>Muslim man. 
</p>
<p>43. The Independent Expert was also informed of several cases in which former 
</p>
<p>S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters had subjected civilians to ill-treatment and accused them of being spies 
</p>
<p>working for the anti-balaka or the international forces. For example, on 11 March 
</p>
<p>2015, two men accused of having ties with the anti-balaka were illegally detained and 
</p>
<p>subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment by former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters of the Union pour 
</p>
<p>la paix en Centrafrique. 
</p>
<p>44. Some Fulani groups have also allegedly committed human rights violations with 
</p>
<p>support from groups of former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters. For example, in the second week of 
</p>
<p>October, armed Fulani carried out an attack on the village of Batobadja in Ouaka 
</p>
<p>prefecture, killing 11 civilians. From 12 to 14 November 2014, also in Ouaka 
</p>
<p>prefecture, an unknown number of armed Fulani attacked the village of Pende and 
</p>
<p>killed seven people, including four children. Another attack by armed Fulani carried 
</p>
<p>out on 1 December in the town of Z&#233;mio, Upper Mbomou prefecture, left 3 people 
</p>
<p>dead and 2 injured, while some 40 houses were burned down and 2 shops were looted. 
</p>
<p>On 3 December in Bambari, armed Fulani with ties to the Union pour la paix en 
</p>
<p>Centrafrique attacked and killed 13 people and injured at least 33 civilians in 
</p>
<p>retaliation for the death of one of their members. During the attack, some 33 houses 
</p>
<p>were burned and looted. </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p><b>11/22 </b>GE.15-12489 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Independent Expert has received reports of fighting that took place in late 
</p>
<p>April and early May 2015 between the anti-balaka and the Union pour la paix en 
</p>
<p>Centrafrique former S&#233;l&#233;ka faction over control of Kouango sub -prefecture, as a result 
</p>
<p>of which many villages were destroyed and more than 32 people were killed. 
</p>
<p>MINUSCA has confirmed that 36 villages have been abandoned, 27 of them 
</p>
<p>completely or partially burned, and it has established a base in the prefecture to 
</p>
<p>effectively protect the population and prevent attacks and reprisals. 
</p>
<p>46. The Independent Expert has also received reports of several incidents involving 
</p>
<p>security forces, including cases of ill-treatment in places of pretrial detention or 
</p>
<p>during the arrest of suspected criminals. These reports include, in particular, 
</p>
<p>allegations against the Centre to Combat Crime. She has also been informed of cases 
</p>
<p>in which national security forces were reportedly reluctant to take action against 
</p>
<p>human rights violators, particularly when the latter were anti -balaka. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Minority rights<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>47. Before the conflict, the Muslim minority represented about 15 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>population,5 but most of the various Muslim communities in the west of the country 
</p>
<p>have either left or become isolated in enclaves.6 In response to systematic attacks by 
</p>
<p>anti-balaka groups on civilians identified as receiving or having received support from 
</p>
<p>the S&#233;l&#233;ka forces, or from the Fulani, or from Muslims in general, they gathered 
</p>
<p>together and were then forced to leave.  
</p>
<p>48. Religious buildings and schools have been systematically attacked. All mosques 
</p>
<p>between Bangui and Boali have been attacked and totally or partially destroyed, 
</p>
<p>including most of the mosques in Bossangoa, Bossemb&#233;l&#233; and Bouar. Most of the 
</p>
<p>mosques still standing are serving as shelters for civilians under attack; this includes 
</p>
<p>the central mosques in Boda, Bangui, Berb&#233;rati and PK12. 7 Of the 23 mosques in 
</p>
<p>Bangui, only 4 have escaped attack and destruction.  
</p>
<p>49. A year after the signing of the agreement on the cessation of hostilities, the 
</p>
<p>situation remains worrying, and the Independent Expert has observed only very 
</p>
<p>limited trade and return to peaceful coexistence between the religious communities. In 
</p>
<p>Bangui, Muslims living in the PK5 area cannot venture beyond their neighbourhood, 
</p>
<p>and most have not been able to find new jobs or any way of attending university or 
</p>
<p>school. Other citizens who have taken refuge in the PK5 area are unable to return to 
</p>
<p>their neighbourhoods of origin. In Berb&#233;rati, Muslims and Christians live on opposite 
</p>
<p>sides of the river, and the bridge is crossed only by the staff of the United Nations and 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs). In Boda, Muslim and Christian residents no 
</p>
<p>longer mix with each other at all.  
</p>
<p>50. The issue of the rights of Muslim minorities was discussed during the Bangui 
</p>
<p>Forum, and the Independent Expert took note of the decision to officially celebrate 
</p>
<p>Muslim holidays in the Central African Republic. This decision was welcomed by the 
</p>
<p>Muslim community as a new framework for social cohesion. At the time of the writing 
</p>
<p>of this report, however, no formal decision to that effect had yet been promulgated or 
</p>
<p>adopted. Protecting the Muslim minority&#8217;s identity is crucial for peace and social 
</p>
<p>cohesion.

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Refugees and internally displaced persons<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>51. Some 900,000 people have been displaced by the violence since the crisis in the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic began in December 2013. They have sought refuge in 
</p>
<p>Cameroon, Chad, the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. About 
</p>
<p>460,000 people are still today living as refugees in neighbouring countries (of whom 
</p>
<p>about 220,000 have become refugees since December 2013), and some 436,000 
</p>
<p>persons have been internally displaced. Humanitarian organizations estimate that more 
</p>
<p>than half of the population, that is, 2.7 million people, require emergency 
</p>
<p>humanitarian aid.8 
</p>
<p>52. The issue of internally displaced persons in the Yalok&#233; enclave has come to the 
</p>
<p>notice of the Independent Expert, who visited the area during her mission in February 
</p>
<p>2015. She found this enclave particularly worrying because of the very harsh living 
</p>
<p>conditions there. In addition, between April and December 2014, about 40 members of 
</p>
<p>the Fulani community who had taken refuge there died of disease and malnutrition. 
</p>
<p>During her visit to Yalok&#233;, 9 the Independent Expert noted that internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons had received increased attention and support in recent weeks and that their 
</p>
<p>living conditions had improved. However, in the face of the authorities &#8217; reluctance to 
</p>
<p>allow the Fulani to leave, the Independent Expert emphasized that the rights of 
</p>
<p>internally displaced persons, including their right to freedom of movement, must be 
</p>
<p>fully respected. 
</p>
<p>53. The Independent Expert stressed to all the persons she met with, including the 
</p>
<p>highest State authorities, that, under international law, internally displaced persons 
</p>
<p>were entitled to the same rights and freedoms as the rest of the population. The legal 
</p>
<p>principles governing internally displaced persons &#8212; notably the freedom to leave or 
</p>
<p>stay, the freedom of residence and the right of return &#8212; should apply at all times. 
</p>
<p>54. Following the joint visit, the Government relaxed its position and, as a first step, 
</p>
<p>allowed the departure of some internally displaced persons on the ground of family 
</p>
<p>reunification. Between 31 March and 4 April 2015, about 130 internally displaced 
</p>
<p>Fulani left the Yalok&#233; enclave on commercial trucks headed for Cameroon. The Office 
</p>
<p>of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and MINUSCA 
</p>
<p>helped to reunite 20 refugee families in Cameroon.  As at mid-April, an estimated 330 
</p>
<p>displaced Fulani were still living in the Yalok&#233; enclave.  
</p>
<p>55. The Central African Republic also plays host to Congolese refugees from the 
</p>
<p>north-eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo who have fled the 
</p>
<p>violence perpetrated by the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army. There are about 3,400 Congolese 
</p>
<p>refugees living in the Zemio refugee camp. Since the arrest of a senior Lord &#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Resistance Army commander in January 2015, the rebels belonging to that movement 
</p>
<p>have intensified their attacks on the villages near the border with the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo. According to an NGO report, the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army 
</p>
<p>carried out some 25 kidnappings in February 2015 in villages near Zemio. 10

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>individuals or members of armed groups, particularly in the west of the country. These 
</p>
<p>accusations of witchcraft are usually brought against members of the most vulnerable 
</p>
<p>population groups, including women, the elderly, children and persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. Persons with albinism are not immune either.  
</p>
<p>57. Persons suspected of witchcraft have also reportedly been victims of acts of mob 
</p>
<p>justice, which are often carried out by anti-balaka militias with the complicity of the 
</p>
<p>local authorities. The situation of conflict, instability and intercommunal hostility and 
</p>
<p>the absence of State authority encourage the emergence of such practices.  
</p>
<p>58. During her visit in February 2015, the Independent Expert received damning 
</p>
<p>information about cases of persons accused of witchcraft, particularly elderly persons 
</p>
<p>and children, and especially in Bouar, being tortured and murdered. They have 
</p>
<p>included individuals being horrifically burned and allegedly being buried alive. The 
</p>
<p>Bouar police and gendarmerie said that they were powerless against the armed anti -
</p>
<p>balaka fighters. 
</p>
<p>59. The Independent Expert also noted that a number of women have been 
</p>
<p>imprisoned because they have been accused of witchcraft, often without evidence. 
</p>
<p>This was particularly the case in the Berb&#233;rati prison, where a woman who had been 
</p>
<p>detained on the basis of allegations of witchcraft was finally released following the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert&#8217;s visit and follow-up monitoring by the Human Rights Division of 
</p>
<p>MINUSCA. 
</p>
<p>60. Under the pretence of witchcraft accusations, such practices are perpetrated by 
</p>
<p>armed individuals seeking to extort money from villagers. This is unacceptable and 
</p>
<p>constitutes a violation of national and international law, and the Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>has alerted the authorities to these practices. She has asked that they arrest those 
</p>
<p>responsible without further delay, publicly condemn these heinous crimes, and launch 
</p>
<p>an awareness-raising campaign to deter such acts. Although a few perpetrators of such 
</p>
<p>violence have been arrested, the Independent Expert noted that the Central African 
</p>
<p>authorities have thus far not responded appropriately and effectively to put an end to 
</p>
<p>mob justice. 
</p>
<p>61. Articles 149 and 150 of chapter XI of the country&#8217;s Criminal Code of 6 January 
</p>
<p>2010 criminalize such practices and establish penalties ranging from fines to life 
</p>
<p>imprisonment in cases where such acts result in death. When the Expert discussed this 
</p>
<p>matter with the authorities, the response provided was that witchcraft had been 
</p>
<p>criminalized in order to protect persons accused of witchcraft from mob justice and to 
</p>
<p>enable them to have a fair trial.  
</p>
<p>62. This argument is valid only if the State institutions, security forces and, in 
</p>
<p>particular, the judiciary function properly and implement the law. The security forces 
</p>
<p>should severely punish any armed militias that misuse the law to justify taking the 
</p>
<p>place of the courts and dispensing justice themselves.  
</p>
<p>63. MINUSCA has established a working group on charlatanism and witchcraft that 
</p>
<p>brings together United Nations bodies, NGOs and government officials to begin 
</p>
<p>reflecting on the root causes of violence connected with witchcraft and on ways of 
</p>
<p>addressing them. The actions considered include conducting awareness -raising 
</p>
<p>campaigns, training local and international stakeholders, reviewing and amending 
</p>
<p>existing legal instruments, and identifying and arresting the perpetrators of related 
</p>
<p>offences. 
</p>
<p>

<p>64. In his report of 23 March 2015 on conflict-related sexual violence (S/2015/203), 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General stated that, in 2014, a total of 2,527 cases of conflict -related 
</p>
<p>sexual violence had been reported in the Central African Republic. This violence 
</p>
<p>included rape perpetrated to terrorize civilians, with many victims being assaulted in 
</p>
<p>their homes or while sheltering in fields or in the bush. According to the report, the 
</p>
<p>alleged perpetrators are associated with armed herders from Fulani Mbarara 
</p>
<p>communities or members of the former S&#233;l&#233;kaanti-balaka, R&#233;volution et justice or 
</p>
<p>Front d&#233;mocratique du peuple centrafricain armed groups (para. 14).  
</p>
<p>65. The report notes that the number of cases of sexual violence seems to have 
</p>
<p>declined since the end of open hostilities, especially in response to the presence of 
</p>
<p>international troops, namely the MINUSCA, Sangaris and EUFOR forces. However, 
</p>
<p>such violence still persists in the most remote parts of the count ry, such as mining and 
</p>
<p>border areas. Moreover, the absence of State services, such as health -care and social 
</p>
<p>services, means that victims do not have access to proper care, including post -
</p>
<p>exposure prophylaxis to prevent the transmission of HIV (para. 15).  
</p>
<p>66. The Independent Expert encourages the transitional Government to adopt, 
</p>
<p>without delay, the decree on establishing a joint rapid response unit to combat sexual 
</p>
<p>violence. 
</p>
<p>67. The Independent Expert is also alarmed by reports of Fulani civilians &#8212; mostly 
</p>
<p>women and girls &#8212; being kept as slaves, and in some cases as sex slaves, by anti-
</p>
<p>balaka fighters. Some 40 Fulani were reportedly held hostage for about 14 months. 11 
</p>
<p>In April 2015, MINUSCA intervened and freed about 30 of the hostages. The Expert 
</p>
<p>urges the anti-balaka to release all the remaining hostages and urges the authorities to 
</p>
<p>bring those responsible to justice.  
</p>
<p>68. Even before the crisis, the Central African Republic had the third highest 
</p>
<p>maternal mortality rate in the world. One in three women never sees a health-care 
</p>
<p>provider during her pregnancy, and one in two gives birth without any qualified birth 
</p>
<p>attendants. Though there are no recent statistics available, organizations believe that 
</p>
<p>the situation has worsened since the start of the crisis.  
</p>
<p>69. Regarding the situation of children, the humanitarian community estimates that 
</p>
<p>more than 32,000 children in the Central African Republic will suffer from severe 
</p>
<p>malnutrition and 78,000 from moderate malnutrition in 2015.  
</p>
<p>70. The demobilization of child soldiers, which had already begun in 2014, saw 
</p>
<p>significant progress in May 2015 following the Bangui Forum and the agreement 
</p>
<p>signed by 10 armed groups on laying down their arms, renouncing armed struggle as a 
</p>
<p>means of imposing political demands, and releasing the children among their ranks. In 
</p>
<p>2014, a total of 2,807 children were removed from armed groups in the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic, including 2,374 from anti-balaka groups and 460 from the former 
</p>
<p>S&#233;l&#233;ka factions. On 14 May 2015, 357 children were released in Bambari by anti-
</p>
<p>balaka militia and former S&#233;l&#233;ka fighters. The United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
</p>
<p>(UNICEF) and its partners have established family reunification programmes, 
</p>
<p>psychological counselling and community reintegration programmes.  
</p>
<p>71. Save the Children recently published a study12 showing that nearly two thirds of 
</p>
<p>school-age children suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the

<p>violence they witnessed or experienced during the two years of conflict. The study 
</p>
<p>reports that more than 60 per cent of children in the Central African Republic have 
</p>
<p>witnessed or have been subjected to acts of extreme violence since March 2013.  
</p>
<p>72. This situation is cause for serious concern about the country&#8217;s future. There is an 
</p>
<p>urgent need to invest in the strategy for lasting peace and reconciliation in order to 
</p>
<p>enable these children to rebuild their lives in peace.

</p>
<p><b> </b>F.<b> </b>Economic and social rights<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>73. The rights to education, health and food remain a major concern in the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic. Available information indicates that 693 schools were affected 
</p>
<p>during the conflict, and 351 public schools across the country were looted or occupied 
</p>
<p>by armed groups or civilians, damaged by various types of explosives or directly 
</p>
<p>attacked. A further 342 private schools have also been affected in a similar manner. 
</p>
<p>Numerous schools remain closed and many pupils have not yet returned to their 
</p>
<p>studies. 
</p>
<p>74. Already fragile before the crisis, the health-care system has been shattered. In 
</p>
<p>some regions, more than 75 per cent of health-care centres are unable to provide the 
</p>
<p>most basic services, such as nutritional support, prenatal check -ups or treatment 
</p>
<p>against infections. Most health-care centres are short of medicines as a result of 
</p>
<p>looting by armed groups. Statistics for the Central African Republic indicate an 
</p>
<p>average life expectancy of 49.5 years in 2013. In response to the crisis, the 
</p>
<p>Government has undertaken to implement a policy of free health -care services with 
</p>
<p>the support of partners such as the World Health Organization. 
</p>
<p>75. The Independent Expert was alerted to the situation of persons with disabilities, 
</p>
<p>in particular the fact that they were often left behind during the conflict, given their 
</p>
<p>greater difficulties in travelling. When they could not reach s ites for internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons, they were often left without food, housing or appropriate medical 
</p>
<p>support. Human Rights Watch13 found that at least 96 persons with disabilities had 
</p>
<p>been abandoned or were unable to escape and 11 had been killed in Bangui, Boali, 
</p>
<p>Yalok&#233; and Bossempt&#233;l&#233;. The figure is likely an underestimate. Without mobility 
</p>
<p>assistance, many persons with disabilities are forced to move around by crawling and 
</p>
<p>thus are at risk of life-threatening infections. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>G.<b> </b>Violations committed by international forces<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>76. Several allegations of serious human rights violations committed by international 
</p>
<p>and MINUSCA forces have been reported in recent months. Following revelations by 
</p>
<p>the international press concerning allegations of sexual abuse of children by French 
</p>
<p>soldiers of the Sangaris force in Bangui, MINUSCA disclosed other cases of 
</p>
<p>inappropriate use of force and sexual abuse by some of its elements.  
</p>
<p>77. France announced in a statement at the highest level that it had opened a judicial 
</p>
<p>inquiry to shed light on the allegations concerning 14 French soldiers suspected of 
</p>
<p>sexually abusing children between December 2013 and May-June 2014. The 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert hopes that the results of the inquiry will be made known soon. She 
</p>
<p>has stressed the importance of taking all measures necessary to protect children 
</p>
<p>against violence and abuse, especially those who are vulnerable, as in the M&#8217;poko 
</p>
<p>camp for internally displaced persons, for example, which she has visited. When

<p>violations are reported, the authorities must protect victims against further harm, 
</p>
<p>prosecute the alleged perpetrators and provide reparations.  
</p>
<p>78. On 4 June, MINUSCA issued a statement according to which a member of its 
</p>
<p>forces deployed in the east of the country had been implicated in all egations of 
</p>
<p>exploiting and sexually abusing a young girl. The statement reports that MINUSCA 
</p>
<p>took immediate measures to protect the victim and provide appropriate care. The 
</p>
<p>statement also indicates that the United Nations requested that the Government of t he 
</p>
<p>troop-contributing country concerned open an investigation as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>79. On 5 June, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights (OHCHR) issued a statement 14  regretting the lack of progress in the 
</p>
<p>investigation of allegations of enforced disappearance, torture and extrajudicial 
</p>
<p>killings of at least 11 people, including 5 women and 1 child, concerning the 
</p>
<p>contingent of the Congo of the African-led International Support Mission to the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic (MISCA)15 in Boali, a small town about 80 kilometres north 
</p>
<p>of Bangui. OHCHR asked the competent authorities, including the African Union and 
</p>
<p>the Governments of the Central African Republic and the Republic of the Congo, to 
</p>
<p>carry out without further delay an impartial, effective and transparent investigation in 
</p>
<p>order to clarify the fate of the persons concerned, bring those responsible to justice 
</p>
<p>and provide reparation to the victims.  
</p>
<p>80. On 10 June 2015, MINUSCA issued a statement concerning the excessive use of 
</p>
<p>force by peacekeepers deployed in the west of the country. According to the statement, 
</p>
<p>United Nations soldiers allegedly beat four individuals suspected of criminal activities 
</p>
<p>and arrested them at the request of local authorities, resulting in the death of two of 
</p>
<p>the individuals and severe injuries to a third.  
</p>
<p>81. The Independent Expert welcomes the establishment by the Secretary -General of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations of a panel of experts to conduct an independent external review to 
</p>
<p>determine how the United Nations system followed up on those allegations. She is still 
</p>
<p>concerned about the lack of diligence shown by the authorities involved in following 
</p>
<p>up on these serious allegations of human rights violations, which are absolutely 
</p>
<p>prejudicial to the protection of vulnerable persons, and calls for faster action to 
</p>
<p>prevent abuses and, in cases where violations have been committed, hold the 
</p>
<p>perpetrators responsible and ensure that the victims are protected.

</p>
<p><b> </b>IV.<b> </b>Combating impunity<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>82. Significant strides were made in late 2014 and early 2015 in the fight against 
</p>
<p>impunity, with the arrest of three important leaders of rebel groups. With the arrest and 
</p>
<p>transfer of Baba Lad&#233; to Chad in December 2014, Dominic Ongwen to the 
</p>
<p>International Criminal Court in January 2015 and Rodrigue Ga&#239;bona, also known as 
</p>
<p>Andilo, who was detained on 17 January 2015, the transitional authorities have sent 
</p>
<p>strong signals of their willingness to combat impunity.  
</p>
<p>83. However, many challenges remain, particularly relating to the insufficient 
</p>
<p>staffing and resources of the police and gendarmerie, criminal police and the judiciary, 
</p>
<p>and the inadequate number of prisons. In addition, victims are reluctant to file 
</p>
<p>complaints with the police in situations where complainants are not of the same 
</p>
<p>religious or ethnic group as the law enforcement personnel.

<p> MISCA was deployed in December 2013 in conjunction with Operation Sangaris. On 15 September 
</p>
<p>2014, at the end of the mandate of MISCA, the mandate of the Force was transferred to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations under the name MINUSCA.  </p>

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>84. As a temporary emergency measure, MINUSCA has supported the authorities in 
</p>
<p>apprehending nearly 383 people since the beginning of its mandate in September 
</p>
<p>2014. Most are still in investigative detention pending trial. The Independent Expert 
</p>
<p>was also informed that criminal hearings had resumed on 29 June 2015, after more 
</p>
<p>than five years without any trials taking place. Nearly 60 cases will be heard by the 
</p>
<p>Court. 
</p>
<p>85. Justice and the fight against impunity were at the heart of the demands made 
</p>
<p>during the popular consultations and the Bangui Forum. The Republican Pact called 
</p>
<p>for the introduction of a constitutional clause prohibiting any possibility of amnesty 
</p>
<p>for crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of genocide committed in the 
</p>
<p>country. It also stressed the importance of effectively establishing the Special Criminal 
</p>
<p>Court, with the assistance of the international community, as well as ensuring 
</p>
<p>technical and operational capacity-building of the local courts and setting up 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for the protection of judges, witnesses and victims.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>A.<b> </b>Special Criminal Court<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>86. Following the signing of a memorandum of intent by the transitional authorities 
</p>
<p>and MINUSCA in August 2014, progress was made on the authorities&#8217; initiative to 
</p>
<p>create a special criminal court within the national judicial system. A bill was approved 
</p>
<p>by the Council of Ministers and submitted to the National Transitional Council on 6 
</p>
<p>February 2015. 
</p>
<p>87. The United Nations and other partners provided the authorities with technical 
</p>
<p>support for the development of the bill. This resulted in substantial improvements, 
</p>
<p>including the abolition of the death penalty as the maximum punishment and the 
</p>
<p>provision that international judges should form the majority at  the appeals level. 
</p>
<p>88. On 22 April 2015, the National Transitional Council adopted the Act creating the 
</p>
<p>Special Criminal Court, which was promulgated on 3 June by the transitional 
</p>
<p>President. The Court is composed of 21 judges: 10 international and 11 nati onal. The 
</p>
<p>Special Prosecutor is an international judge, who is assisted by a national Deputy 
</p>
<p>Prosecutor. The national and international members of the Court shall be persons of 
</p>
<p>high moral character who exhibit impartiality and integrity and possess the 
</p>
<p>qualifications required in their respective countries for appointment to the highest 
</p>
<p>judicial offices. International members are nominated by MINUSCA and appointed by 
</p>
<p>the authority assuming the duties of Chair of the Supreme Council of Justice.  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Criminal Court is competent to investigate serious violations of 
</p>
<p>human rights and international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic since 1 January 2003, and to hear and rule in such cases, 
</p>
<p>including in respect of the crime of genocide, crimes against humanity and war 
</p>
<p>crimes. Its jurisdiction is complementary to that of the International Criminal Court, 
</p>
<p>which has been investigating the situation in the Central African Republic since May 
</p>
<p>2014. The lifespan of the Special Criminal Court is five years, renewable if necessary 
</p>
<p>(art. 70). 
</p>
<p>90. The Independent Expert welcomed the adoption of the Act, which is a decisive 
</p>
<p>step in the fight against impunity. In particular, she is pleased to note that it sets out in 
</p>
<p>its article 56 that it applies to everyone equally, without any distinction based on 
</p>
<p>official capacity. This implies that it does not recognize immunity for representatives 
</p>
<p>of the State. 
</p>
<p>91. It is crucial that the Special Criminal Court be set up quickly so that it ca n begin 
</p>
<p>investigations. The Court can be established only with the financial support of the 
</p>
<p>international community. It is also important that the international community </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p>GE.15-12489 <b>18/22 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>continue to support the ordinary criminal justice system, as the courts of the Centra l 
</p>
<p>African Republic must be capable of trying persons accused of offences that do not 
</p>
<p>meet the definition of crimes covered by the Special Criminal Court. Ensuring the 
</p>
<p>safety of victims and witnesses as well as that of judges and national and foreign 
</p>
<p>investigators will be essential to the Court&#8217;s success. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>B.<b> </b>Reconciliation and other transitional justice mechanisms<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>92. In November 2014, the Government developed a comprehensive strategy for 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation. The goal of this strategy is to develop an extensive local, 
</p>
<p>regional and national network of mediators and peace facilitators responsible for 
</p>
<p>promoting and strengthening social, cultural, interfaith and intercommunity mediation 
</p>
<p>activities, so as to reduce violence in all its forms, ease tensions between communities 
</p>
<p>and initiate a participatory and inclusive dialogue for national reconciliation and a 
</p>
<p>lasting peace. The Independent Expert welcomes this initiative and encourages its 
</p>
<p>rapid implementation throughout the territory. She also notes the i mportant role of the 
</p>
<p>Interfaith Peace Platform in the prevention of violence and welcomes the courage of 
</p>
<p>those religious leaders who continue to take in displaced persons at churches and 
</p>
<p>mosques in order to protect them.  
</p>
<p>93. The Republican Pact also calls for the establishment of a transitional justice 
</p>
<p>mechanism and specifically for the establishment of a justice, truth, reparation and 
</p>
<p>reconciliation commission, with branches at the local level, which will be responsible 
</p>
<p>for identifying and investigating crimes and abuses committed in the country and 
</p>
<p>recommending that perpetrators be brought to justice or that the victims receive 
</p>
<p>reparations. 
</p>
<p>94. The Independent Expert welcomes the willingness of nationals of the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic to engage in a process of seeking the truth about the human rights 
</p>
<p>violations committed in the past and analysing their causes and consequences. Each 
</p>
<p>truth commission is a unique institution, but the activities of such commissions 
</p>
<p>generally comprise the collection of testimonies of victims and witnesses, as well as 
</p>
<p>thematic research, including analysis of violations, especially those based on gender 
</p>
<p>and those targeting children, in addition to analysis of their causes and their 
</p>
<p>consequences. Public hearings and other awareness programmes are then organized 
</p>
<p>and the commission concludes with the publication of a final report outlining findings 
</p>
<p>and containing recommendations. Developing a complete record of serious human 
</p>
<p>rights violations is an important step in the realization of the right to truth. 
</p>
<p>95. The Independent Expert recalls the central role of victims in transitional justice 
</p>
<p>programmes. She also recalls the importance of ensuring respect for the rights and 
</p>
<p>opinions of the victims and setting up appropriate procedures tha t ensure their safety 
</p>
<p>and dignity, as well as developing specific capacities to help, support and protect 
</p>
<p>victims and witnesses. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b> </b>C.<b> </b>Prisons<b> 
</b> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>96. The conditions of detention in prisons in the country generally do not meet 
</p>
<p>international standards and are often inhumane. Basic necessities such as food, 
</p>
<p>clothing and medicine are insufficient and inadequate and are often confiscated by the 
</p>
<p>prison authorities. 
</p>
<p>97. There is no centralized file on the total number of prisoners in the country, 
</p>
<p>though efforts are being made to remedy this, particularly in Bangui. There, men and 
</p>
<p>women are held in separate facilities. Elsewhere they are detained in the same </p>


<p> 
</p>
<p><b>19/22 </b>GE.15-12489

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>building, sometimes in different cells. At times, juvenile prisoners are kept with 
</p>
<p>adults, while persons in pretrial detention are held with convicted prisoners.  
</p>
<p>98. Prisoners do not have reasonable access to visitors. Despite having the right to 
</p>
<p>submit complaints in the event of ill-treatment, victims would be hesitant to do so 
</p>
<p>because the complaint submission mechanism does not function as it should and no 
</p>
<p>remedial measures are available.  
</p>
<p>99. In June 2015, the Independent Expert visited Ngaragba central prison in Bangu i, 
</p>
<p>where two-thirds of the 636 detainees were in pretrial detention. At least 10 of them 
</p>
<p>were minors, and several inmates had been seriously injured, apparently before their 
</p>
<p>detention. The majority of persons accused of serious crimes are held in this prison. 
</p>
<p>Although efforts have been made, security, overcrowding, health and nutrition remain 
</p>
<p>major challenges. The Independent Expert was able to meet at least eight sick 
</p>
<p>prisoners who did not have access to proper health care. She also went to the Bimbo 
</p>
<p>prison for women, which housed 17 inmates. The duration of pretrial detention can be 
</p>
<p>anything from 6 weeks to a year.  
</p>
<p>100. MINUSCA and United Nations specialized agencies and their partners have 
</p>
<p>implemented projects to rehabilitate the central prison and are working with the 
</p>
<p>authorities on a national strategy for reopening judicial and penal institutions and 
</p>
<p>deploying magistrates and prison personnel to locations outside Bangui where security 
</p>
<p>conditions have improved. MINUSCA has deployed 20 corrections officers  to support 
</p>
<p>the reform of the national prison system and offers regular training.  
</p>
<p>101. The Independent Expert was also informed that several assessment missions 
</p>
<p>have been organized with the Department of Prison Administration regarding the 
</p>
<p>situations in the prisons of Bouar, Bossangoa, Bossemb&#233;l&#233;, Bria and Berb&#233;rati, with a 
</p>
<p>view to funding and supporting their rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>102. Prison security remains problematic. The Independent Expert was informed of 
</p>
<p>the escape of Eug&#232;ne Nga&#239;kosset, known as &#8220;The Butcher of Paoua&#8221; because of the 
</p>
<p>atrocities he is alleged to have committed in the north-west of the country. The former 
</p>
<p>soldier managed to escape on the night of 17 May 2015 from the investigation unit in 
</p>
<p>Bangui. He had been arrested a few days earlier and transferred from Brazzaville to 
</p>
<p>Bangui prison. His escape gives rise to numerous questions.

</p>
<p>103. The Central African Republic has a unique opportunity to move decisively 
</p>
<p>toward peace, national reconciliation and justice. Although one major political 
</p>
<p>and military faction refused to participate in the Bangui Forum, in recent months 
</p>
<p>the country has shown its determination, which has materialized in the form of a 
</p>
<p>reasonable, far<b>-</b>reaching and consensual agreement. Effective follow<b>-</b>up and 
</p>
<p>implementation of the recommendations of the Bangui Forum will be essential for 
</p>
<p>the authorities to demonstrate to the population and the international community 
</p>
<p>that they are truly committed to peace and reconciliation. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>104. The coming months will be crucial. The authorities have announced an 
</p>
<p>ambitious electoral calendar, with registration for the electoral roll in July, a 
</p>
<p>referendum on a new Constitution in early October and legislative and 
</p>
<p>presidential elections set for mid<b>-</b>October. However, many challenges remain. The 
</p>
<p>ineligibility clauses of members of the transitional Government must be respected 
</p>
<p>in accordance with the peace agreements. It will also be necessary to find 
</p>
<p>solutions to enable displaced persons &#8212; both within and outside the country&#8217;s </p>

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>borders &#8212; to be registered for, and participate in, the elections. Measures must 
</p>
<p>be taken to allow those persons to exercise their political rights and participate in 
</p>
<p>the referendum on the Constitution as well as the presidential and legislative 
</p>
<p>elections. 
</p>
<p>105. The fight against impunity must also be effective, and it would be deplorable 
</p>
<p>if individuals responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>and human rights were to be reinstated in politics with impunity, as has happened 
</p>
<p>in the past. The Independent Expert notes that the first criminal hearings since 
</p>
<p>2010 began in Bangui on 29 June 2015. That is a positive sign of the commitment 
</p>
<p>of the State to re<b>-</b>establish the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>106. After the election set for October and a return to constitutional order, it will 
</p>
<p>be necessary to remain steadfast in pursuing efforts toward reconciliation. This 
</p>
<p>must be done through the promotion and protection of the rights of persons 
</p>
<p>belonging to minority groups. The protection of minorities has often been 
</p>
<p>demonstrated to be an effective way of preventing and resolving conflicts and 
</p>
<p>building societies that are stable and open to all persons in post<b>-</b>conflict 
</p>
<p>situations. The Interfaith Platform and other national and international 
</p>
<p>initiatives have played an important role in reconciliation and the protection of 
</p>
<p>minorities. 
</p>
<p>107. Finally, the Independent Expert recalls that the participation of women in 
</p>
<p>the decision<b>-</b>making process, in particular as candidates and voters, is essential, 
</p>
<p>as are efforts to help uneducated and jobless young people win back their place in 
</p>
<p>society and envisage a future without violence. <b>

<p>previous report (A/HRC/26/53) and calls on the Government, with the support of 
</p>
<p>the international community, to: 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> </b>Bring to justice all perpetrators of violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law and human rights, irrespective of their status or political 
</p>
<p>affiliation. She recalls in this regard that some of these acts may constitute crimes 
</p>
<p>under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, to which the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic is a party;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> </b>Take measures to prevent gender<b>-</b>based violence and especially sexual 
</p>
<p>violence on the part of all belligerents, and ensure the protection of civilians, 
</p>
<p>especially women;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> </b>Formulate a national strategy for combating impunity, so as to ensure 
</p>
<p>that perpetrators of serious human rights violations, including sexual violence,  
</p>
<p>are brought to justice; investigate all cases of violence against women and 
</p>
<p>prosecute and punish the perpetrators, restore and strengthen the judicial 
</p>
<p>system, improve judicial and prison infrastructure and ensure the security of all 
</p>
<p>courts and places of detention; proceed with the rapid redeployment of all judges 
</p>
<p>to their duty stations;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(d)<b> </b>Make every effort to ensure that the Special Criminal Court is 
</p>
<p>established without delay so that investigations may begin; ensure the selection 
</p>
<p>and appointment of judges and judicial personnel of the highest calibre who are 
</p>
<p>familiar with the legal culture of the country, and ensure that the judicial process 
</p>
<p>conforms to international fair trial standards; <b> </b></p>

</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(e)<b> </b>Make every effort to protect against any act of reprisal women and 
</p>
<p>girls who are victims of sexual violence, particularly those who turn to the justice 
</p>
<p>system, and raise awareness among the population to prevent those women and 
</p>
<p>girls being ostracized by their families and communities; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(f)<b> </b>Establish transitional justice mechanisms offering guarantees 
</p>
<p>concerning the need for justice, truth, the right to reparation and the non <b>-
</b></p>
<p>repetition of violations, including by involving traditional institutions whenever 
</p>
<p>possible. Special attention should also be paid to economic crimes committed in 
</p>
<p>the context of armed conflict;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(g)<b> </b>Prosecute and punish all those responsible for violations against 
</p>
<p>persons accused of witchcraft, and begin a national debate on the issue, including 
</p>
<p>in respect of existing legislation, to find real solutions that respect universal 
</p>
<p>human rights standards;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(h)<b> </b>Ensure that internally displaced persons and refugees have the right to 
</p>
<p>return to their places of residence and to enjoy other benefits as nationals of the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(i)<b> </b>Take measures to guarantee the safe return of internally displaced 
</p>
<p>persons and refugees, including by securing their places of origin and their 
</p>
<p>property;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(j)<b> </b>Encourage the participation of women at all stages of the peace process 
</p>
<p>as part of national reconciliation, in all initiatives aimed at reconstruction and in 
</p>
<p>the transitional justice process, and especially at the decision<b>-</b>making level;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(k)<b> </b>Arrange activities to raise awareness of the importance, for the whole 
</p>
<p>of society, of the participation of women in the decision<b>-</b>making process, 
</p>
<p>especially as candidates and voters;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(l)<b> </b>Encourage measures promoting social cohesion, in particular by taking 
</p>
<p>steps to encourage and facilitate the participation of refugees and displaced 
</p>
<p>persons in the electoral process and the constitutional referendum;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(m)<b> </b>Continue efforts aimed at deploying, with the assistance of MINUSCA, 
</p>
<p>local administrators and the police and gendarmerie forces throughout the 
</p>
<p>territory;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(n)<b> </b>Establish procedures to ensure the representation of minorities in 
</p>
<p>public institutions such as the parliament and in public service, including the 
</p>
<p>army, the police and the judiciary;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(o)<b> </b>Take all measures necessary to allow Muslim students to return safely 
</p>
<p>to schools and universities, and adults to return to work; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(p)<b> </b>Provide specific protection for women and children affected by armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, including through the deployment of child protection advisers and 
</p>
<p>women protection advisers; 
</p>
<p><b> </b>(q)<b> </b>Put in place a programme of disarmament, demobilization and 
</p>
<p>reintegration adapted to children; consider professional apprenticeships for the 
</p>
<p>reintegration of juvenile offenders who have been given light sentences and/or 
</p>
<p>who have served their sentences;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(r)<b> </b>Combat trauma and post<b>-</b>traumatic stress disorder in children by 
</p>
<p>establishing after<b>-</b>school support groups, training specialized school counsellors, 
</p>
<p>improving school security and ensuring that schools are not used by any armed 
</p>
<p>forces; and establish programmes to raise parents&#8217; awareness of the issue of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence against children;<b> </b></p>

</p>
<p>GE.15-12489 <b>22/22 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(s)<b> </b>Finalize without delay the bill establishing a national human rights 
</p>
<p>commission in accordance with the Paris Principles, and ensure that its mandate 
</p>
<p>covers equality and non<b>-</b>discrimination based on sex/gender and other 
</p>
<p>interrelated factors;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(t)<b> </b>Abolish the death penalty, in accordance with the recommendations of 
</p>
<p>the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the draft additional 
</p>
<p>protocol to the African Charter of Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights on the abolition of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty in Africa;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(u)<b> </b>In humanitarian assistance programmes and programming decisions, 
</p>
<p>take full account of the needs of people living with disabilities; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(v)<b> </b>Establish a system to guarantee a minimum representation of women 
</p>
<p>among members of parliament and offer incentives to political parties to put 
</p>
<p>forward women candidates.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>109. Following the commitment by the armed militias to release all children 
</p>
<p>associated with the conflict, the Independent Expert requests the authorities, with 
</p>
<p>the assistance of MINUSCA, to:<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> </b>Ensure that no child acts on behalf of a militia. Children released or 
</p>
<p>separated from armed groups are victims and should receive special protection; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> </b>Continue efforts towards reopening schools and rehabilitating 
</p>
<p>hospitals and health centres; protect those institutions and put an end to their use 
</p>
<p>for military purposes.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>110. The Independent Expert recommends that the international community: <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(a)<b> </b>Mobilize further to provide more assistance to the Central African 
</p>
<p>Republic so that it may make the transition to peace, national reconciliation and 
</p>
<p>combating impunity;<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(b)<b> </b>Commit itself to funding the Special Criminal Court and supporting 
</p>
<p>the criminal justice system in order to restore the chain of criminal prosecution; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>(c)<b> </b>Continue funding humanitarian assistance programmes and the 
</p>
<p>Central African Republic Regional Refugee Response Plan, which are 
</p>
<p>considerably underfunded.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>111. She appeals to the international community for urgent financing of the 
</p>
<p>disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programme, with special 
</p>
<p>attention to be paid to the needs of children associated with armed forces and 
</p>
<p>groups.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>112. The Independent Expert calls on the international community to provide 
</p>
<p>technical assistance to the Government for the purposes of sound management of 
</p>
<p>revenues from mineral resources.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>113. Finally, she calls on the United Nations and the troop<b>-</b>contributing countries 
</p>
<p>to shed full light on the allegations of sexual abuse committed in the Central 
</p>
<p>African Republic, to bring those responsible to justice and to provide reparations 
</p>
<p>to the victims. She urges all relevant authorities to take measures to strengthen 
</p>
<p>prevention of such abuses, including by deploying personnel who are trained, 
</p>
<p>qualified, equipped and commanded in such a way as to be able to fulfil their 
</p>
<p>responsibilities to protect civilians.<b>
