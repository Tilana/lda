Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
On October 11, 2005, pursuant to subscription agreements, we closed a
private placement to three investors of an aggregate of 3,150,000 units at a
price of US$0.40 per unit, for total gross proceeds of US$1,260,000. Each unit
consists of one common share and one common share purchase warrant, with each
warrant entitling its holder to acquire one share of our common stock at an
exercise price of US$0.60 per common share. The exercise price of the warrants
will be adjusted from time to time upon the occurrence of certain events, as
provided in the warrants. The warrants expire on October 11, 2008. The units
were issued pursuant to Regulation S ("Regulation S") under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act").
The subscription agreements provide that each holder of units will have
"piggy back" registration rights if we file a registration statement under the
1933 Act in connection with an offering of our securities.
In connection with the private placement, a finder's fee of US$36,000 was
paid to Nika Management S.A., resulting in total net proceeds to our company
from the private placement of US$1,224,000.

            to the knowledge of the Subscriber, proceeds obtained or derived,
            directly or indirectly, as a result of illegal activities; and
(hh)  the funds representing the total Subscription Price which will be
            advanced by the Subscriber to the Corporation hereunder will not
            represent proceeds of crime for the purposes of the Proceeds of

            not been identified to the Subscriber and the Subscriber shall

            of such representations cease to be true, and to provide the
            Corporation with appropriate information in connection therewith;
            and
(jj)  the Subscriber acknowledges that it has been encouraged to and
            should obtain independent legal, income tax and investment advice

            contained herein relevant to the Subscriber for purposes of giving
            representations, warranties and covenants under this Subscription
            Agreement.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Corporation
8. The Corporation hereby represents and warrants to the Subscriber that it has
been duly incorporated and is a valid and subsisting corporation under the laws
of the State of Nevada, United States, is extra-provincially registered in the
Province of Alberta, Canada and has full corporate power and authority to enter
into this Subscription Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder.
9. The Corporation hereby covenants with the Subscriber that it will take all
corporate action required to issue to the Subscriber the Units and the Common
Shares and the Warrants comprising the Units on the Closing Date.
Registration Rights
10. If the Corporation proposes to register, pursuant to any registration rights
agreement (a "Registration Rights Agreement"), for shareholders other than the
Subscriber, any of its Common Shares or other equity securities (or securities
convertible into equity securities) under the U.S. Securities Act in connection
with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than a
registration on Form S-8, Form S-4 or Form F-4), the Corporation will, at all
such times, promptly give the Subscriber written notice of such proposed
registration. Upon the written request of the Subscriber, given within 20 days
after the mailing of such notice by the Corporation, the Corporation will,
subject to the provisions of applicable Registration Rights Agreements, use its
commercial best efforts to cause a registration statement covering all of the
(i) Common Shares being acquired hereunder and (ii) Warrant Shares that each
such holder has requested to be registered to become effective under the U.S.
Securities Act. Only to the extent they apply to "piggy back" registrations,
such registration shall also be subject to the other provisions of each
applicable Registration Rights Agreement. For greater certainty, (i) such
registration shall not be subject to any provisions of any Registration Rights
Agreement that are applicable only to "demand" registrations, and (ii) the
Subscriber acknowledges that except as contemplated by this Section, the
Corporation is under no obligation hereunder to register any of its securities
or to complete any offering of its securities it proposes to make, and the
Corporation will therefore incur no liability (including any penalties that may
be incurred under a Registration Rights Agreement) to the Subscriber for its
failure to register any of its securities or to complete any offering of its
securities.

holder thereof or its legal representatives or its attorney duly appointed by an
instrument in writing in form and execution satisfactory to the Corporation in
accordance with applicable laws. The Warrants and the Common Shares issuable

satisfaction of the Corporation, with:
(a)   the conditions herein;
(b)   such reasonable requirements as the Corporation may require; and

ARTICLE 3
EXERCISE OF THE WARRANT
3.1   No Registration under U.S. Securities Act
The Warrants may not be exercised within the United States, or by or on
behalf of a "U.S. Person" (as defined in Regulation S under the United States
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act")), nor will
certificates representing Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants
be delivered in the United States, except pursuant to an exemption from the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and exemptions from
applicable state securities laws. Any person who proposes to exercise a Warrant
shall provide to the Corporation, as contemplated in Appendix 2, either (i)
written certification that the Warrant is not being exercised within the United
States or by or on behalf of a U.S. Person, (ii) a written opinion of counsel or
other evidence satisfactory to the Corporation to the effect that the issuance
of Common Shares upon exercise of such Warrant is not required to be registered
under the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or (iii)
written confirmation by the person exercising the Warrant that it is the
original purchaser thereof and reaffirming, as of the date of such exercise, the
representations, warranties made by it in the subscription agreement pursuant to
which it purchased the Warrant. Common Shares issuable upon exercise of Warrants
by a person in the United States or by or on behalf of a U.S. Person may, if so
determined by the Corporation in its sole discretion, bear a legend restricting
transfer.
5
<PAGE>
3.2   Method of Exercise of The Warrant
The holder may exercise the right hereby conferred on the holder to
acquire Common Shares (subject to the provisions of this Article 3) by:
(a)   duly completing and executing the Warrant Exercise Form attached hereto as
      Appendix 2; and
(b)   certifying that the holder or (if different) the recipient of the Common
      Shares to be issued upon exercise of the Warrant either: (i) is not (a) a
      "U.S. Person", (b) exercising the Warrant(s) on behalf of a "U.S. Person",
      and (c) in the United States at the time that the Warrant(s) are exercised
      and did not execute or deliver the Warrant Exercise Form in the United
      States; or (ii) at or prior to the time of such exercise, has delivered to
      the Corporation a written opinion of counsel or other evidence
      satisfactory to the Corporation to the effect that the issuance of Common
      Shares upon such exercise is not required to be registered under the U.S.
      Securities Act and applicable state securities laws; or (iii) is the
      original purchaser of the Warrants and confirms as of the date of such
      exercise, the representations, warranties and agreements made by it in the
      subscription agreement pursuant to which the Warrant was purchased by it;
and
(c)   surrendering this certificate, together with the holder's certified cheque
      or a bank draft, money order or wire transfer in the full amount of the
      total aggregate Exercise Price of the Common Shares being purchased,
      together with the duly completed and executed Warrant Exercise Form, to
      the Corporation at its offices,
at any time up until the Time of Expiry. This Warrant Certificate shall be
deemed to be surrendered only upon personal delivery thereof to, or if sent by
mail or other means of transmission, upon actual receipt thereof by, the
Corporation at its offices.
3.3   Effect of Exercise of the Warrant
(a)   Upon surrender and payment as aforesaid the Common Shares so subscribed
      for shall be issued as fully paid and non-assessable shares, free from all
      liens, charges and encumbrances and the holder shall become the holder of
      record of such Common Shares on the date of such surrender and payment;
(b)   Within ten (10) business days after surrender and payment as aforesaid,
      the Corporation shall forthwith cause the issuance of and mail to the
      holder a certificate for the Common Shares purchased as aforesaid;
(c)   Notwithstanding anything herein contained including any adjustment
      provided for in Article 4, the Corporation shall not be required, upon the
      exercise of any Warrants, to issue fractions of Common Shares or to
      distribute certificates which evidence fractional Common Shares. Any
      fractional Common Shares that would otherwise be issuable upon the
      exercise of Warrants shall be cancelled by the Corporation without
      compensation to the holder thereof; and
6
<PAGE>
(d)   Notwithstanding anything herein contained, no Common Shares will be issued
      pursuant to the exercise of any Warrant if the issuance of such Common
      Shares would constitute a violation of the securities laws of any
      applicable jurisdiction or the requirements of any applicable stock
      exchange, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the
      event that any of the Warrants are exercised prior to expiry of any hold
      period or other resale restriction placed thereon by such laws or
      requirements, the certificates evidencing the Common Shares thereby issued
      will bear such legend as is required under applicable securities laws and
      that, in the opinion of legal counsel to the Corporation, is necessary in
      order to avoid a violation of any such laws or requirements.
3.4   Subscription for Less than Entitlement
The holder may subscribe for and purchase a number of Common Shares less
than the number which it is entitled to purchase pursuant to the surrendered
Warrant Certificate. In the event of any purchase of a number of Common Shares
less than the number which can be purchased pursuant to the Warrant Certificate,
the Corporation shall forthwith issue and deliver to the holder a new Warrant
Certificate containing the same terms and conditions as disclosed herein to
purchase that number of Common Shares with respect to which such partial
exercise did not apply.
3.5   Resale Restrictions
As the Corporation is not a reporting issuer in any jurisdiction of
Canada, unless permitted under Canadian securities legislation, the holder of
this security must not trade the security in Canada and may have to hold the
security for an indefinite period.
3.6   Expiration of the Warrant
After the Time of Expiry, all rights hereunder shall wholly cease and
terminate and the Warrant Certificate and the Warrants shall be void and of no
further force and effect.
ARTICLE 4
ADJUSTMENTS
4.1   Adjustment of Number of Common Shares
The acquisition rights in effect at any date attaching to the Warrants
shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
(a)   If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Time of
      Expiry, any adjustment in the Exercise Price or in the calculation thereof
      pursuant to Section 4.2 shall occur as a result of:
7
<PAGE>
(i)   an event referred to in subsection 4.2(a);
(ii)  the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for an event referred
            to in subsection 4.2(b); or
(iii) the fixing by the Corporation of a record date for an event referred
            to in subsection 4.2(c) if such event constitutes the issue or
            distribution to the holders of all or substantially all of its
            outstanding Common Shares of:
(A)   Common Shares, or
(B)   securities exchangeable for or convertible into Common
                        Shares at less than the Current Market Price of the
                        Common Shares on such record date, or
(C)   rights, options or warrants to acquire Common Shares at
                        an exercise, exchange or conversion price per Common
                        Share less than the Current Market Price of the Common
                        Shares on such record date,
the number of Common Shares obtainable upon the subsequent
               exercise of the Warrant shall be adjusted simultaneously with the
               adjustment in the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 4.2 by
               multiplying the number of Common Shares theretofore obtainable on
               the exercise thereof immediately prior to such adjustment by a
               fraction of which the numerator shall be the total number of
               Common Shares outstanding immediately after such date and the
               denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares
               outstanding immediately prior to such date. To the extent that
               any adjustment in subscription rights occurs pursuant to this
               subsection 4.1(a) as a result of the distribution of securities
               convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares referred to in
               subsection 4.2(a) or as a result of the fixing by the Corporation
               of a record date for the distribution of rights, options or
               warrants referred to in subsection 4.2(b), the number of Common
               Shares purchasable upon exercise of a Warrant shall be readjusted
               immediately after the expiration of any relevant exchange,
               conversion or exercise right to the number of Common Shares which
               would be purchasable based upon the number of Common Shares
               actually issued and remaining issuable immediately after such
expiration, and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon
               expiration of any further such right. To the extent that any such
               adjustment in subscription rights occurs pursuant to this
               subsection 4.1(a) as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of
               a record date for the distribution referred to in subsection
               4.2(c) of rights, options or warrants or exchangeable or
               convertible securities, the number of Common Shares purchasable
               upon exercise of a Warrant shall be readjusted immediately after
               the expiration of any relevant exchange, conversion or exercise
               right to the number which would be purchasable pursuant to this
               subsection 4.1(a) if the fair market value of such rights,
               options or warrants or other exchangeable or convertible
               securities had been determined for the purposes of the adjustment
               pursuant to this subsection 4.1(a) on the basis of the number of
               Common Shares issued and remaining issuable immediately after
               such expiration, and shall be further readjusted in such manner
               upon expiration of any further right.

<PAGE>
(b)   If and whenever at any time after the date hereof and prior to the Time of
      Expiry there is a reclassification of the Common Shares or a capital
      reorganization of the Corporation other than as described in subsection
      4.2(a) or a consolidation, amalgamation or merger of the Corporation
      (including, without limitation, by way of plan of arrangement) with or
      into any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, or a
      sale or conveyance of the property and assets of the Corporation as an
      entirety or substantially as an entirety to any other body corporate,
      trust, partnership or other entity, any Warrantholder who has not
      exercised his right of acquisition prior to the effective date of such
      reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, merger,
      sale or conveyance, upon the exercise of such right thereafter, shall be
      entitled to receive and shall accept, in lieu of the number of Common
      Shares then sought to be acquired by it, the kind and number of shares or
      other securities or property of the Corporation or of the body corporate,
      trust, partnership or other entity resulting from such reclassification,
      reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation or merger, or to which such
      sale or conveyance may be made, as the case may be, that such holder would
      have been entitled to receive as a result of such reclassification,
      reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or conveyance,
      if, on the record date or the effective date thereof, as the case may be,
      the Warrantholder had been the registered holder of the number of Common
      Shares to which the holder was theretofore entitled upon exercise. If
      determined appropriate by the board of directors of the Corporation to
      give effect to or to evidence the provisions of this subsection 4.1(b),
      the Corporation, its successor, or such purchasing body corporate,
      partnership, trust or other entity, as the case may be, shall prior to or
      contemporaneously with any such reclassification, reorganization,
      consolidation, amalgamation, merger, sale or conveyance, enter into an
      agreement or new Warrant Certificate which shall provide, to the extent
      possible, for the application of the provisions set forth in this Warrant
      Certificate with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the
      Warrantholder to the end that the provisions set forth in this Warrant
      shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may
      reasonably be, with respect to any shares, other securities or property to
      which a Warrantholder is entitled on the exercise of its acquisition
      rights thereafter and upon entering into such new Warrant Certificate or
      agreement, the Corporation shall cease to have any obligations (including
      the obligation to issue any Common Shares) hereunder and the holder shall
      cease to have any rights hereunder. Any Warrant Certificate or agreement
      entered into pursuant to the provisions of this subsection 4.1(b) shall be
      an agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of Article 6. Any
      Warrant Certificate or agreement entered into between the Corporation, any
successor to the Corporation or such purchasing body corporate,
      partnership, trust or other entity shall provide for adjustments which
      shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
      provided in this Article 4 and which shall apply to successive
      reclassifications, reorganizations, consolidations, amalgamations,
      mergers, sales or conveyances.

4.2   Adjustment of Exercise Price
The Exercise Price in effect at any date attaching to the Warrants shall
be subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:
(a)   If and whenever after the date hereof and at any time prior to the Time of
      Expiry, the Corporation shall:
(i)   subdivide, divide or change its outstanding Common Shares into a
            greater number of Common Shares;
(ii)  consolidate, reduce or combine its outstanding Common Shares into a
            lesser number of Common Shares;
(iii) make any distribution, other than by way of Dividend Paid in the
            Ordinary Course, to the holders of all or substantially all of the
            outstanding Common Shares payable in Common Shares;
the Exercise Price in effect on the effective date of such events referred
      to in subsections 4.2(a)(i), 4.2(a)(ii), or 4.2(a)(iii) shall be adjusted
      to equal the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect
      immediately prior to such effective date by a fraction of which the
      numerator shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding
      immediately prior to such date and the denominator shall be the total
      number of Common Shares immediately after such date. Such adjustment shall
      be made successively whenever any event referred to in this subsection
      4.2(a) shall occur.
(b)   If and whenever at any time after the date hereof, the Corporation shall
      fix a record date which is prior to the Time of Expiry for the issue of
      rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of
      outstanding Common Shares under which such holders are entitled during a
      period expiring not more than sixty (60) days after the record date for
      such issue to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares, or securities
      convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares, at a price per Common
      Share or having a conversion or exchange price per Common Share less than
      the Current Market Price per Common Share on such record date, the
      Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately after such record date so
      that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Exercise Price
      in effect on such record date by a fraction of which the numerator shall
      be the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus
      a number of Common Shares equal to the number arrived at by dividing the
      aggregate price of the total number of additional Common Shares offered
      for subscription or purchase, or the aggregate conversion or exchange
      price of the convertible securities so offered, by such Current Market
      Price per Common Share, and of which the denominator shall be the total
      number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus the total
      number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase
      (or into which the convertible securities so offered are convertible or
      exchangeable). If by the terms of the rights, options or warrants referred
      to in this subsection 4.2(b), there is more than one purchase, conversion
      or exchange price per Common Share, the aggregate price of the total
      number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase,
or the aggregate conversion or exchange price of the convertible
      securities so offered, shall be calculated for purposes of the adjustment
      on the basis of the lowest purchase, conversion or exchange price per
      Common Share, as the case may be. Any Common Shares owned by or held for
      the account of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation shall
      be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation.
      To the extent that any adjustment in Exercise Price occurs pursuant to
      this subsection 4.2(b) as a result of the fixing by the Corporation of a
      record date for the distribution of rights, options or warrants referred
      to in this subsection 4.2(b), the Exercise Price shall be readjusted
      immediately after the expiration of any relevant exchange, conversion or
      exercise right to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect based
      upon the number of Common Shares actually issued and remaining issuable
      after such expiration, and shall be further readjusted in such manner upon
      expiration of any further such right.

<PAGE>
(c)   If and whenever at any time prior to the Time of Expiry, the Corporation
      shall fix a record date which is prior to the Time of Expiry for the issue
      or distribution to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding
      Common Shares of:
(i)      shares of any class other than Common Shares (excluding Dividends
               Paid in the Ordinary Course);
(ii)     rights, options or warrants (excluding those referred to in
               subsection 4.2(b));
(iii)    evidences of its indebtedness; or
(iv)     any other property or assets (excluding Dividends Paid in the
               Ordinary Course);
then, and in each such case, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted
      immediately after such record date so that it shall equal the price
      determined by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect on such record date
      by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total number of Common
      Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market
      Price on such record date, less the aggregate fair market value (as
      determined by the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive) of
      such shares, rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or
      assets so issued or distributed, and of which the denominator shall be the
      total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied
      by such Current Market Price, and any Common Shares owned by or held for
      the account of the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation shall
      be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation.
      Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is
      fixed, and to the extent that such distribution is not so made, the
      Exercise Price shall then be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would
      then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed or to the
      Exercise Price which would then be in effect based upon such shares,
      rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets actually
      distributed, as the case may be.

4.3   General Adjustments
(a)   If necessary, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the application of
      the provisions set forth in this Article 4 with respect to the rights and
      interests thereafter of the holders of Warrants to the end that the
provisions set forth in this Article 4 shall thereafter correspondingly be
      made applicable as nearly as may reasonably be possible in relation to any
      shares or other securities or property thereafter deliverable upon the
      exercise of any Warrant. Any such adjustments shall be made by and set
      forth in an amendment to this Warrant Certificate hereto approved by the
      directors of the Corporation and shall for all purposes conclusively be
      deemed to be an appropriate adjustment.
(b)   If any case in which this Article 4 shall require that an adjustment shall
      become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to
      herein, the Corporation may defer, until the occurrence of such event,
      issuing to the holder of any Warrant exercised after such event the
      additional Common Shares issuable upon such conversion by reason of the
      adjustment required by such event before giving effect to such adjustment;
      provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to such holder an
      appropriate instrument evidencing such holder's right to receive such
      additional Common Shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such
      adjustment and the right to receive any distributions made on such
      additional Common Shares declared in favour of holders of record of Common
      Shares on and after the relevant date of exercise or such later date as
      such holder would, but for the provisions of this subsection 4.3(b), have
      become the holder of record of such additional Common Shares as a result
      of the exercise of the Warrants.
(c)   No adjustment in the Exercise Price or in the number of shares to be
      issued pursuant to the exercise of the Warrants shall be required unless
      such adjustment would result in a change of at least 1% in the Exercise
      Price then in effect or unless the number of shares to be issued would
      change by at least 1/100th of a share, provided, however, that any
      adjustments which, except for the provisions of this subsection 4.3(c)
      would otherwise have been required to be made, shall be carried forward
      and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment.
(d)   The adjustments provided for in this Article 4 in the Exercise Price and
      in the number and classes of shares which are to be received on the
      exercise of Warrants are cumulative. After any adjustment pursuant to this
      Section, the term "Common Shares" where used in this Warrant shall be
      interpreted to mean the shares or other securities or property of the
      Corporation which, as a result of all prior adjustments pursuant to this
      Section, the Warrantholder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of his
      Warrant, and the number of Common Shares indicated in any subscription
      made pursuant to a Warrant shall be interpreted to mean the number and
      kind of securities or property which, as a result of all prior adjustments
      pursuant to this Article 4, a Warrantholder is entitled to receive upon
      the full exercise of a Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase
      the number of Common Shares so indicated.
(e)   All securities and property which a Warrantholder is at the time in
      question entitled to receive on the full exercise of his Warrant, whether
      or not as a result of adjustments made pursuant to this Section, shall,
      for the purposes of the interpretation of this Warrant be deemed to be
      securities and property which such Warrantholder is entitled to purchase
      pursuant to such Warrant.

<PAGE>
4.4   Notice of Adjustment
Whenever the number of Common Shares purchasable upon the exercise of each
Warrant or the Exercise Price of such Common Shares is adjusted, as herein
provided, the Corporation shall promptly send to the Warrantholder by first
class mail, postage prepaid, notice of such adjustment or adjustments.
ARTICLE 5
