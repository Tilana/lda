<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth 
session from 3 to 14 October 2011. The review of Haiti was held at the 17th meeting, on 13 
October 2011. The delegation of Haiti was headed by Jean-Claude Pierre, charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires 
a.i., and chef de d&#233;l&#233;gation. At its 19th meeting, held on 17 October 2011, the Working 
Group adopted the report on Haiti. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Haiti: Belgium, Burkina Faso and Mexico. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Haiti: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/HTI/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/HTI/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/HTI/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, the Czech Republic, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States of America was 
transmitted to Haiti through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the 
UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Haiti expressed their Government&#8217;s regrets that it had been unable 
to submit its national report by the initially planned date of 11 May 2010, on account of the 
terrible earthquake of 12 January 2010. The delegation reiterated their Government&#8217;s 
thanks to the Human Rights Council for having in the circumstances devoted an 
extraordinary meeting to Haiti and decided, in an unparalleled gesture of solidarity, under 
the terms of resolution S-13/1, to postpone the presentation of Haiti&#8217;s report to the last 
session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR). 
</p><p>6. The delegation reported that an inter-institutional committee had been set up to draft 
the UPR report. Before the report had been finalized, a national consultation had been 
organized for 16 June 2011, in which many regional organizations of civil society had 
participated. Some of their recommendations had been taken into account. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation referred to the 1987 Constitution, according to which the 
international conventions to which Haiti was a party took legal precedence. In addition, the 
1987 Constitution had abolished all laws allowing political repression. Several of its 
chapters concerned the fundamental rights of Haitians, such as the right to life, the right to 
health, the right to education, the right to information, the right to security, the right to 
property, the right to personal freedom, the right to freedom of expression, the right to 
freedom of conscience, the right of assembly and association and the right to work. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.11-17271 
</p>
<p>8. Haiti had also established a number of institutions that were connected to the 
protection of human rights, including the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office (Office Protecteur du 
Citoyen), the Ministry for the Status of Women and Women&#8217;s Rights, the Ministry of the 
Environment, the State Secretariat for the Integration of Persons with Disabilities, the 
National Identification Office, the National Office of Migration, the National Anti-Drug 
Commission, the Central Unit for Financial Information and the Anti-Corruption Unit. 
</p>
<p>9. Economic and social rights, which were complementary to civil and political rights, 
were enshrined in the preamble of the 1987 Constitution. Contrary to the latter rights, 
however, protection of the former depended on suitable economic circumstances. In that 
regard, a National Strategy for Growth and Poverty Reduction paper, prepared in 2007, 
highlighted the policies and the means required to help the country emerge from poverty 
and distress, while giving priority to the basic needs of the citizen. 
</p>
<p>10. Haiti ensured the promotion and protection of human rights. The death penalty had 
been abolished in 1988 and replaced by life imprisonment. Thus at trials held in 2001 and 
2002, law enforcement officers had been convicted of summary executions. Freedom of 
expression and freedom of opinion, which were enshrined in article 28 of the Constitution, 
were currently among the best defended rights in Haiti. For example, the perpetrators of the 
murder of the journalist Brignol Lindor in 2001 had been tried and convicted. Freedom of 
religion and freedom of association, enshrined in articles 30 and 31 of the Constitution, 
were freely exercised in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>11. Among recent actions, Haiti had ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and 
Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United 
Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. In addition, an Act concerning 
the prohibition and elimination of all forms of abuse, violence, ill-treatment or inhuman 
treatment against children had come into force in 2003. Further progress would be made 
when the preliminary bill on trafficking in persons was passed by Parliament. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to adoption, the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption was in the 
course of ratification and a new text amending the former 1974 Act, tabled before 
Parliament, had already been passed by the Chamber of Deputies. 
</p>
<p>13. Several administrative measures had been taken, including the establishment of a 
Brigade for the Protection of Minors within the National Police Force in May 2003 and the 
opening of a helpline for women and children in danger. 
</p>
<p>14.  The rights of migrant workers had been a source of concern for the Haitian 
authorities. In response, a Ministry for Haitians Living Abroad had been established to meet 
the requirements of Haitians living abroad and especially to serve as a facilitator and 
spokesperson vis-&#224;-vis the authorities. 
</p>
<p>15. A great deal of effort had been made by the authorities to promote children&#8217;s rights, 
including the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 23 December 
1994 and the decrees passed in 1995 and 2005 to facilitate late birth registrations, which 
had extended the scope of civil registration services. 
</p>
<p>16. The situation regarding street children had worsened following the earthquake of 12 
January 2010. Many steps had been taken to improve matters, including the placement of 
some of the children concerned in homes. 
</p>
<p>17. The right to food, enshrined in article 22 of the Constitution, was one of the chief 
priorities of the Haitian authorities. Despite the Government&#8217;s efforts in that respect, many 
Haitians were affected by malnutrition. </p>


<p>GE.11-17271 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>18. Regarding the right to health, infantile mortality and the prevalence of HIV/AIDS 
had been significantly reduced thanks to the efforts made by the Government between 1986 
and 2000. 
</p>
<p>19. The right to work was recognized in the 1987 Constitution and Haiti had ratified 
several conventions on workers&#8217; rights. Freedom of association and the right to strike were 
protected. Public institutions had been set up to deal with social security and currently 
offered social protection on favourable terms to workers who were interested. 
</p>
<p>20. In the area of the right to decent housing and the rehousing of those made homeless 
on 12 January 2010, three projects were currently under way. The Kay Pam project offered 
financing of up to 100 per cent for the purchase or construction of a residence, the purchase 
of land and the enlargement or improvement of housing. The 16/6 project, which concerned 
the rehousing of people made homeless on 12 January 2010, consisted in a proposal to 
close 6 camps and in return to rehouse 16 communities. The rehabilitation of the original 16 
quarters would be undertaken on the basis of the priorities decided by the inhabitants. 
Lastly, the 400 per cent project consisted in a plan to build 400 houses in the commune of 
Croix-des-Bouquets, a town close to the capital. 
</p>
<p>21. A Ministry for the Status of Women and Women&#8217;s Rights had been created in 1994 
in order to meet the various needs of Haitian women. According to a new constitutional 
amendment, a quota of 30 per cent should be reserved for women in appointive posts. 
</p>
<p>22. Education was a challenge the Haitian Government had faced for decades. President 
Michel Joseph Martelly had adopted a whole set of measures. By the end of the President&#8217;s 
term of office, 1.5 million children would be provided with schooling, which was 
unprecedented in the history of Haiti. 
</p>
<p>23. The population of Haiti was officially estimated at 8.1 million inhabitants, 55 per 
cent of whom lived in extreme poverty on an income of 1 dollar per person per day. In 
response, the Haitian Government had launched a fourfold policy to reduce poverty and 
inequalities. The first part consisted in strengthening institutions such as the State, the 
family and the school; the second promoted equal opportunities; the third sought the 
redistribution of income, and the fourth focused on the development of opportunities and 
capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>24. Despite the fact that holding a person in custody for more than 48 hours without 
being brought before a judge had been forbidden under the 1987 Constitution, pretrial 
detention continued to be practised for other reasons, and led to prison overpopulation. The 
judicial authorities had taken steps to resolve the problem and a bill on habeas corpus was 
currently awaiting parliamentary approval. 
</p>
<p>25. Under the constitutional reform currently under way, a Constitutional Court would 
be established to monitor the constitutionality of legislation. In addition three laws had been 
passed by Parliament in 2007, one setting up the Superior Council of the Judiciary, another 
concerning the status of the magistrature, and a third relating to the School for Judges. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

All. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Algeria noted the progress made in terms of child protection and the fight against 
hunger, disease, unemployment, illiteracy, human trafficking and inequalities between 
women and men. However, the lack of resources, natural disasters and political instability

scale of the challenges faced by the country. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Cuba noted Haiti&#8217;s obstacles to implementing human rights policies. Cuba

other countries and organizations willing to rebuild and develop its health system. Cuba 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>30. France welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Haitian authorities to overcome the

that all the fundamental rights were guaranteed by the Constitution and that a reform of the 
judiciary system had been carried out. However, it highlighted that 20 to 40 per cent of the 
Haitian do not have civil documents, which hampered the exercise of their fundamental 
rights. France made recommendations.

again sensitize the international community to the tragic effects of the 2010 earthquake for 
the Haitian population. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>34. Bangladesh commended the Government&#8217;s commitment and initiatives to ensure 
enjoyment of human rights by its citizens. It noted with appreciation the Action Plan for the

and assistance. </p>

would focus in supporting the areas that the Government of Haiti had already identified as 
priorities.

<p>65. Maldives noted that Haiti faced significant challenges in promoting and protecting 
human rights; the earthquake and its subsequent problems did only compound already 
existing challenges. One of the most serious issues in Haiti was discrimination and violence 
against women. The issue of &#8220;street children&#8221;, child labour and the state of children in 
internally displaced persons (IDP) camps remained also a concern. Maldives inquired about 
the steps taken to tackle this issue. Maldives inquired also about Haiti&#8217;s inclusive approach 
towards economic and developmental activities and reconstruction efforts. Maldives </p>

its participation in the review process. Slovakia acknowledged the devastating impact of

country had been faced. As a result, Slovakia noted that the overall security situation 
remained volatile and the level of respect for fundamental human rights was a cause of 
concern. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. United Kingdom believed that strengthening the judicial system would provide a 
foundation for improving Haiti&#8217;s ability to realize its human rights obligations. It was 
concerned about continuing human rights violations, in particular, gender-based violence in 
the IDP camps. The United Kingdom believed that Haiti had not only the opportunity to 
rebuild the physical structures that were lost but also to re-establish key institutions. It 
acknowledged that Haiti would need the support from the international community to fulfil 
its responsibilities and achieve the recommendations set out during the review. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Costa Rica acknowledged Haiti&#8217;s difficult socio-economic situation after the 
earthquake and its human rights commitment. It noted Haiti&#8217;s efforts to consolidate a 
democratic State, creating and strengthening its institutions, namely the Ombudsman,

mentioned the efforts made by the Government to support its people despite various 
challenges, and the actions done to combat poverty and promote easy access to health 
centres. It stressed the will of the Government to provide education for children by pointing 
out the presidential decision to set up a special fund for free education. However, the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo remained concerns about the life of children and women 
and gender-based violence. It made a recommendation. 
</p>

earthquake, noting its human rights commitment shown by creating and strengthening 
institutions. Honduras noted the vulnerability of Haitian children, congratulating Haiti for 
overcoming the violations of their rights, particularly in the area of trafficking; by updating 
its legislation, strengthening the Social Welfare Institute and creating a Minors Protection 
Brigade within the National Police. Honduras called on the international community to 
support the areas identified by Haiti. Honduras made recommendations. 
</p>

very difficult conditions. It expressed its concerns about the persistence of violence against 
women and girls, in particular against those who were living in camps for displaced persons 
and in remote areas. It indicated that, as underscored in the report, the right to food 
remained a major concern. Although measures had been taken to deal with the problem of 
child domestic labour, Luxembourg noticed that the vulnerability of children and teenagers

earthquake. It noted with satisfaction the preparation of a National Strategy for Growth and 
Poverty Reduction. Burkina Faso made a recommendation.

<p>74. The Dominican Republic recalled that it was fully committed to the reconstruction 
and development of its neighbour, Haiti. It considered that when reviewing the human 
rights situation in Haiti, it was necessary to take into account the catastrophic situation of 
the country and considered that the priority should be the return to normality, without 
neglecting human rights. It also recalled that a year and a half had passed since the 
earthquake and that Haitians were still waiting for the assistance agreed to by the 
international community. It encouraged the newly established Government to undertake all 
possible efforts to defend human rights. 
</p>
<p>75. Djibouti congratulated Haiti on the holding of the latest election and in particular for

of reconstruction by providing fresh impetus to the democratic institutions of the country. 
Djibouti made recommendations. 
</p><p>76. Senegal stressed that while Haiti had to rely on itself, it also relied on active 
solidarity of other countries and international community as a whole. Senegal took note of 
the goodwill of the Government to work constructively to promote and protect human 
rights. Senegal urged everybody at the international, regional and bilateral levels, including 
international financial institutions and civil society, to provide political, financial, material 
and technical support to the Government and people of Haiti, particularly in its priority 
areas. Senegal invited OHCHR to step up the level of assistance provided to the authorities 
and to the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti. 
</p>
<p>77. Barbados noted positively the Government of Haiti&#8217;s 2010 Action Plan for National 
Reconstruction and Development aimed at targeting priority areas critical to economic 
development and social-recovery efforts. Barbados noted that more work should also be 
done with regard to providing access to food and health care and protecting the basic 
human rights of vulnerable groups such as children. It called on the international 
community to continue its support for Haiti&#8217;s reconstruction efforts and policies aimed at 
promoting development, reforming the justice system and other priorities areas. Barbados 
made a recommandation. 
</p>
<p>78. The delegation of Haiti thanked all the delegations who had taken the floor to ask 
questions and make suggestions or recommendations to the Haitian authorities. 
</p>
<p>79. In response to the suggestions that some delegations had made for the establishment 
of a national human rights institution, they said that such an institution already existed, 
under the name of Office de la Protection du Citoyen. 
</p>
<p>80. The delegation also recalled that Haiti had already ratified the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>81. They said that a specialized service had been set up for sexually assaulted women, 
while criminal proceedings were initiated against the perpetrators. An awareness campaign 
was needed among the authorities and civil society in order to convince those who still 
tended to stigmatize women who had been subjected to rape and other sexual abuse to 
change their attitude. 
</p>
<p>82. The delegation stressed that Haitian women played a major part in Haitian society. 
They were represented throughout the power structure and had already occupied the highest </p>

</b></p>
<p>function of the State. The delegation gave the examples of judge Ertha Pascal Trouillot and 
Ms. Mich&#232;le Duvivier Pierre-Louis, who had served respectively as Head of State and 
Prime Minister, and Ms. Florence Elie, who currently held the post of Ombudsman 
(Protectrice du Citoyen). Several ministerial positions had been and were being held by 
women. Moreover, under the constitutional amendment that was awaiting approval a quota 
of 30 per cent of appointive posts were reserved for women. 
</p>
<p>83. President Martelly was also determined to look into the situation of street children in 
order to find appropriate solutions. One of the measures currently considered consisted in 
providing schooling for those children, who should be the first to benefit from the Head of 
State&#8217;s education programme. 
</p>
<p>84. The President had also proceeded to nominate the President of the Court of 
Cassation from a list of candidates put forward by the Senate. 
</p>
<p>85. The delegation reported that the establishment of a Haitian prison administration 
following the fall of the Duvalier family reflected the determination of the Haitian 
Government to pave the way for the establishment of the rule of law in Haiti. In its strategic 
development plan for the prison administration, the Haitian Government set out the rules 
that governed incarceration and was taking the necessary steps to implement them. In the 
very short term, the total area of cells in absolute terms was to be increased by 1,788 m2 to 
6,470.2 m2, which would mean an overall relative increase of 0.97 m2 per detainee. 
</p>
<p>86. The complaints lodged against Jean-Claude Duvalier, the former President of the 
Republic of Haiti, were currently being examined by the investigating magistrate. 
</p>
<p>87. The Haitian delegation once again reaffirmed the determination of the new Haitian 
authorities to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in Haiti, to consolidate 
the gains achieved in terms of civil and political rights and to promote the enjoyment of 
economic, social and cultural rights.
