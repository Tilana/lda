far to comply with Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and demanded that Israel withdraw 
</p>
<p>from all the occupied Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming once more</i> the illegality of Israel&#8217;s decision of 14 December 1981 to impose 
</p>
<p>its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan, which has resulted in the 
</p>
<p>effective annexation of that territory,  
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force in 
</p>
<p>accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the principles of international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with deep concern</i> of the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli 
</p>
<p>Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Territories (A/62/360) of 24 September 2007, in which the Committee refers to the grave 
</p>
<p>deterioration in the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied 
</p>
<p>Syrian Golan and, in this connection, deploring the Israeli settlement in the occupied Arab 
</p>
<p>territories and expressing regret at Israel&#8217;s constant refusal to cooperate with and to receive the 
</p>
<p>Special Committee, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the relevant provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, international law 
</p>
<p>and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming the applicability of the Geneva 
</p>
<p>Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 
</p>
<p>and the relevant provisions of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 to the occupied 
</p>
<p>Syrian Golan, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the importance of the peace process which started in Madrid on the 
</p>
<p>basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 
</p>
<p>22 October 1973 and the principle of land for peace, and expressing its concern at the halting 
</p>
<p>of the peace process in the Middle East and its hope that peace talks will be resumed on the 
</p>
<p>basis of the full implementation of Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) for the 
</p>
<p>establishment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming also</i> the previous relevant resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and the Human Rights Council, in particular resolution 2/3 of 27 November 2006, </p>

 1.  <i>Calls upon</i> Israel, the occupying Power, to comply with the relevant resolutions of 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly, the Security Council and the Human Rights Council, particularly Security 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 497 (1981), in which the Council decided, inter alia, that the Israeli decision 
</p>
<p>to impose its laws, jurisdiction and administration on the occupied Syrian Golan is null and void 
</p>
<p>and without international legal effect, and demanded that Israel should rescind forthwith its 
</p>
<p>decision; 
</p>
<p> 2.  <i>Also calls upon</i> Israel to desist from changing the physical character, demographic 
</p>
<p>composition, institutional structure and legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan, and

</p>
<p>allowed to return to their homes and to recover their property; 
</p>
<p> 3.  <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to desist from imposing Israeli citizenship and Israeli 
</p>
<p>identity cards on the Syrian citizens in the occupied Syrian Golan and to desist from its 
</p>
<p>repressive measures against them, and from all other practices that obstruct the enjoyment of 
</p>
<p>their fundamental rights and their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, some of 
</p>
<p>which are mentioned in the report of the Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices 
</p>
<p>Affecting the Human Rights of the Palestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied 
</p>
<p>Territories; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Calls upon </i>Israel to allow the Syrian population of the occupied Syrian Golan to visit 
</p>
<p>their families and relatives in the Syrian motherland through the Quneitra checkpoint and under 
</p>
<p>the supervision of the International Committee of the Red Cross, and to rescind its decision to 
</p>
<p>prohibit these visits, as it is in flagrant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention and the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Further calls upon</i> Israel to release immediately the Syrian detainees in Israeli 
</p>
<p>prisons, some of whom have been detained for over 22 years on the pretext of refusing to accept 
</p>
<p>Israeli citizenship, and to bring an immediate end to the mental and physical torture inflicted 
</p>
<p>upon them, which has resulted in the deterioration of their health and the endangerment of their 
</p>
<p>lives; 
</p>
<p>6. In this connection, <i>calls upon </i>Israel to allow delegates of the International 
</p>
<p>Committee of the Red Cross to visit Syrian prisoners of conscience and detainees in Israeli </p>

prisons accompanied by specialized physicians in order to assess the state of their physical and 
</p>
<p>mental health and protect their lives;

<p>7. <i>Determines</i> that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken or to be 
</p>
<p>taken by Israel, the occupying Power, that purport to alter the character and legal status of the 
</p>
<p>occupied Syrian Golan are null and void, constitute a flagrant violation of international law and 
</p>
<p>of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and have 
</p>
<p>no legal effect; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Again calls upon</i> the Member States of the United Nations not to recognize any of 
</p>
<p>the above-mentioned legislative or administrative measures; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General of the United Nations to bring the present resolution 
</p>
<p>to the attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations organs, the specialized 
</p>
<p>agencies, international and regional intergovernmental organizations and international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian organizations, to disseminate it as widely as possible and to report on the matter to 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council at its tenth session due to be held in March-April 2009; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Decides </i>to continue the consideration of human rights violations in the occupied
