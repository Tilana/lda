<p><i>Acknowledging</i> that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, play an 
</p>
<p>important role at the national, regional and international levels in the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of all human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the insufficiency of funding for the Social Forum, the Forum on Minority 
</p>
<p>Issues and the Forum on Business and Human Rights to ensure broad participation, 
</p>
<p>particularly from relevant parts of civil society that may not be able to finance their own 
</p>
<p>travel, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to establish a special fund for the 
</p>
<p>participation of civil society and other relevant stakeholders in the Social Forum, the Forum 
</p>
<p>on Minority Issues and the Forum on Business and Human Rights, to be administered by 
</p>
<p>  
 
</p>
<p>* Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in accordance with 
</p>
<p>the financial regulations and rules of the General Assembly, which would be used to 
</p>
<p>support the participation of civil society representatives and other relevant stakeholders in 
</p>
<p>the annual meetings of the Social Forum, the Forum on Minority Issues and the Forum on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights in accordance with the mandates of these forums, and requests 
</p>
<p>the Office of the High Commissioner to report thereon; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Decides</i> that the special fund should aim to facilitate the broadest possible 
</p>
<p>participation of civil society representatives and other relevant stakeholders, and to give 
</p>
<p>priority to the participation of local or national-level non-governmental organizations active 
</p>
<p>in the relevant fields, with particular attention being paid to participants from least 
</p>
<p>developed countries, and that the resources of the special fund should be utilized in such a 
</p>
<p>manner as to ensure equal or adequate levels of support for each of the forums; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to support the participation of civil society and other 
</p>
<p>relevant stakeholders in the Social Forum, the Forum on Minority Issues and the Forum on 
</p>
<p>Business and Human Rights and, to that end, to make voluntary contributions to the special 
</p>

<p>4. <i>Encourages</i> intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and 
</p>
<p>other private or public entities to make voluntary contributions to the special fund.
