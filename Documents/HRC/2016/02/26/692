<p><b>  Resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b>  28/16.  The right to privacy in the digital age 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and relevant international human rights treaties, including the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the universality, indivisibility, interdependence and interrelatedness of all 
</p>
<p>human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> its resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the Human Rights Council, 
</p>
<p>and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the Council, of 
</p>
<p>18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her duties in 
</p>
<p>accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and 
</p>
<p>69/166 of 18 December 2014 on the right to privacy in the digital age, and Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council decision 25/117 of 27 March 2014 on the panel on the right to privacy in the digital 
</p>
<p>age, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> its resolutions 20/8 of 5 July 2012 and 26/13 of 26 June 2014 on 
</p>
<p>the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights on the right to privacy in the digital age, noting with interest its report 
</p>

<p>thereon,1 and recalling the panel discussion on the right to privacy in the digital age held 
</p>
<p>during the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council,2 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note </i>of the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism3 and the report of the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
</p>
<p>expression,4 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with appreciation</i> general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of 
</p>
<p>honour and reputation,5 while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place 
</p>
<p>since its adoption, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that the General Assembly in its resolution 69/166 encouraged the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council to remain actively seized of the debate on the right to privacy in the digital 
</p>
<p>age, with the purpose of identifying and clarifying principles, standards and best practices 
</p>
<p>regarding the promotion and protection of the right to privacy, and to consider the 
</p>
<p>possibility of establishing a special procedure to that end, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the need to further discuss and analyse, on the basis of international 
</p>
<p>human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in 
</p>
<p>the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies, the 
</p>
<p>impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to 
</p>
<p>examine the principles of non-arbitrariness and lawfulness, and the relevance of necessity 
</p>
<p>and proportionality assessments in relation to surveillance practices, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be 
</p>
<p>subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or 
</p>
<p>correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and 
</p>
<p>recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of the 
</p>
<p>right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a 
</p>
<p>democratic society, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting </i>that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over 
</p>
<p>the world to use new information and communications technology and at the same time 
</p>
<p>enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake 
</p>
<p>surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in 
</p>
<p>particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is 
</p>
<p>therefore an issue of increasing concern, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> <i>also</i> that, while metadata can provide benefits, certain types of metadata, 
</p>
<p>when aggregated, can reveal personal information and can give an insight into an 
</p>
<p>individual&#8217;s behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that States must respect international human rights obligations 
</p>
<p>regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>
<p>annex VI. </p>


<p>and/or collect personal data and when they require disclosure of personal data from third 
</p>
<p>parties, including private companies, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights as 
</p>
<p>set out in the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights: Implementing the United 
</p>
<p>Nations &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; Framework,<footnote name="6">A/HRC/17/31, annex. </footnote> 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of 
</p>
<p>communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of 
</p>
<p>communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out 
</p>
<p>on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting with deep concern</i> that, in many countries, persons and organizations 
</p>
<p>engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms frequently 
</p>
<p>face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as well as unlawful or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>interference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and 
</p>
<p>protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their 
</p>
<p>obligations under international human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> <i>also </i>in that respect that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a 
</p>
<p>public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any 
</p>
<p>measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under 
</p>
<p>international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected 
</p>
<p>to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or 
</p>
<p>correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, as set 
</p>
<p>out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recognizes</i> the global and open nature of the Internet and the rapid

<p>(<i>c</i>) To identify possible obstacles to the promotion and protection of the right to
