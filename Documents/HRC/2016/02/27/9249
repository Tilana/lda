<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions documents the main activities undertaken during 2007 and the first three months 
of 2008 to address the grave problem of extrajudicial executions around the world.<b>1</b> He focuses 
on three issues of particular importance: (a) the role of national commissions of inquiry in 
impunity for extrajudicial executions; (b) the right to seek pardon or commutation of a death 
sentence; and (c) prisoners running prisons. 
</p>
<p>2. The report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council decision 1/102, and takes 
account of information received and communications sent in the period from 1 December 2006 
to 15 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>3. An overview of the mandate, a list of the specific types of violations of the right to life 
upon which action is taken, and a description of the legal framework and methods of work used 
in implementing this mandate can be found in document E/CN.4/2005/7, paragraphs 5 to 12. 
</p>
<p>4. I am grateful to the staff of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights for their highly professional assistance in relation to the mandate, to 
William Abresch, and to Sarah Knuckey and Jason Morgan-Foster of the Project on Extrajudicial 
Executions at New York University Law School, who provided invaluable expert assistance and 
advice. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>5. The present report covers communications sent and replies received 
from 1 December 2006 to 15 March 2008. The details of my concerns and the information 
provided in response by Governments are reflected in considerable detail in addendum 1 to the 
report, which is of crucial importance. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The term &#8220;extrajudicial executions&#8221; is used in this report to refer to executions other than those 
</p>
<p>carried out by the State in conformity with the law. As explained in my previous reports &#8220;[t]he 
terms of reference of this mandate are not best understood through efforts to define individually 
the terms &#8216;extrajudicial&#8217;, &#8216;summary&#8217; or &#8216;arbitrary&#8217;, or to seek to categorize any given incident 
accordingly&#8221;. Rather, &#8220;the most productive focus is on the mandate itself, as it has evolved over 
the years through the various resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission&#8221; 
(E/CN.4/2005/7, para. 6; A/HRC/4/20, para. 1, fn. 1). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>6. A brief statistical profile of the communications sent during the period under review 
shows that 127 communications were sent to 46 countries,<b>2</b> including 58 urgent appeals and 
69 allegation letters. The main issues covered in the communications were the death 
penalty (32), deaths in custody (23), the death penalty for minors (18), excessive use of 
force (15), impunity (11), attacks or killings (10), armed conflict (8) and death threats (6). 
</p>
<p>7. As in previous years, the proportion of Government replies received to communications 
sent during the period under review is problematically low. The precise percentage figures in this 
regard are provided in the communications addendum. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Visits 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Visits undertaken from 2007 to March 2008 
</b></p>
<p>8. Since I last reported to the Council, I have undertaken visits to the Philippines, Brazil and 
the Central African Republic. The final report on the Philippines is before the Council, and 
preliminary notes on the other two missions will be presented. In addition, follow-up reports on 
my previous missions to Nigeria and Sri Lanka are contained in A/HRC/8/3/Add.3. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Mission requests outstanding 
</b></p>
<p>9. As at March 2008, I had made requests to visit 32 countries and the Occupied Palestinian 
Territories. Only eight of those - Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, Guatemala, Israel, 
Lebanon, Peru, the Philippines and the United States of America - have actually proceeded 
with plans for a visit. The visit to Afghanistan is scheduled for May 2008 and the visit to the 
United States for June 2008. The visit to Peru was cancelled, and the Palestinian Authority 
issued an invitation. 
</p>
<p>10. The responses of the remaining 24 countries have ranged from complete silence through 
formal acknowledgement to acceptance in principle but without meaningful follow-up. In some 
cases, the relevant requests were first made some seven years ago. 
</p>
<p>11. States which have so far failed to respond affirmatively to requests for a visit are Algeria, 
Bangladesh, El Salvador, Guinea, India, Indonesia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Kenya, 
the Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, 
Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Togo, Uganda, the United States of America, Uzbekistan, 
Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam and Yemen. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The States are: Afghanistan, Algeria, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, China, 
</p>
<p>Colombia, Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, Ecuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, Fiji, Honduras, 
India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
Maldives, Morocco, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, 
Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, 
Thailand, United Kingdom, United States of America, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zimbabwe. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  ISSUES OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Role of national commissions of inquiry in  
impunity for extrajudicial executions 
</b></p>
<p>12. The duty arising under international human rights law to respect and protect life imposes 
an obligation upon Governments to hold an independent inquiry into deaths where an 
extrajudicial execution may have taken place.<b>3</b> While an independent police investigation will 
often suffice for this purpose, the creation of an official commission of inquiry with a human 
rights mandate is a time-honoured and oft-repeated response, especially to incidents involving 
multiple killings or a high-profile killing. These commissions vary greatly as to the terminology 
used, and their composition, terms of reference, time frames and powers. Even elementary 
Internet research provides the details of a plethora of examples of royal commissions, 
independent commissions, judicial commissions, parliamentary commissions and the like. While 
such inquiries are by definition established at the initiative of the government authorities, they 
are most often a result of concerted demands by civil society and sometimes also by the 
international community. Indeed it is now almost standard practice for a commission to be 
demanded in the aftermath of major incidents in which the authorities which would normally be 
relied upon to investigate and prosecute are feared to be reluctant or unlikely to do so adequately. 
</p>
<p>13. In historical terms, the technique of creating inquiries can be traced back to many 
examples in the early part of the twentieth century, including in colonial and immediately 
post-colonial contexts. More recently, the number and range of inquiries has been expanded 
significantly by two relatively new phenomena. The first is the considerable increase in 
internationally mandated inquiries, set up by bodies like the Human Rights Council or its 
predecessor. The second is the proliferation of transitional justice commissions, including truth 
and reconciliation commissions, designed to review historical injustices and help map a balanced 
response. The focus in the present analysis, however, is upon nationally mandated inquiries. 
</p>
<p>14. The thrust of the analysis is that the mere setting up of a commission of inquiry and even 
its formal completion will often not be adequate to satisfy the obligation to undertake an 
independent inquiry. Empirical inquiry, based on the many examples that have come to the 
attention of the Special Rapporteur and his predecessors, indicates that such inquiries are 
frequently used primarily as a way of avoiding meaningful accountability. The international 
human rights community needs to scrutinize such initiatives far more carefully in the future and 
to develop a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating their adequacy. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Reasons to establish inquiries 
</b></p>
<p>15. Whenever an arbitrary deprivation of life occurs, States are obligated to undertake a 
thorough, prompt and impartial investigation, to prosecute and punish the perpetrators and to 
ensure that adequate compensation is provided to the relatives of victims.<b>4</b> This would normally

</p>
<p>comment No. 31, CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.13 (2004). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>be assured through the regular functioning of the criminal justice system, including police, public 
prosecutors, courts and oversight mechanisms, such as ombudsmen. All too often, however, and 
especially in the case of large-scale or politically-charged killings, the system in place is unable 
to function effectively and extraordinary measures are needed in order to bring justice. 
</p><p>16. Such failings can occur in a variety of situations. First, the police may lack the necessary 
investigative capacities. The investigation required may be complex, far-reaching or require 
scientific and forensic resources that may not be available. Second, those charged with 
investigating the events might themselves be suspected, or closely connected to suspects. 
Relations between the police and the military or paramilitary groups are of particular relevance 
in this regard. Third, victims, relatives and witnesses might lack confidence in the police or other 
investigating authorities and be unprepared to cooperate with them. Fourth, political interference 
at the local, State or federal levels might be hindering an effective investigation. Fifth, the 
killings might be part of a broader phenomenon which needs to be investigated more broadly and 
not confined to a criminal investigation. Sixth, a solution to the problem, including the 
punishment of those responsible, might require the mobilization of a degree of public pressure 
and political will which require more than a regular investigation. 
</p>
<p>17. Whatever the reason for the shortcomings of the established system for carrying out 
investigations and prosecutions, States are obliged to take positive steps to ensure that their 
administrative and judicial institutions do in fact operate effectively, and to take measures to 
avoid the recurrence of violations. This may require the State to make changes to its institutions, 
laws or practices.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>18. National commissions of inquiry are a common response in such situations. The inquiry 
will often be set up to address the victim-specific violation by being tasked to investigate the 
alleged abuses, give a detailed account of a particular incident or series of abuses, or recommend 
individuals for prosecution. In an effort by the State to prevent future violations or to strengthen 
the criminal justice system, a commission may also be given a broader mandate to report on the 
causes of the violation and to propose recommendations for institutional reform. Use of this 
technique is by no means confined to any particular group or type of countries, but takes place in 
a great many countries regardless of their level of development or their legal system. 
</p>
<p>19. Paradoxically, the circumstances that lead to the creation of such inquiries very often carry 
with them the seeds of the initiative&#8217;s subsequent failure. In other words, Governments are 
pressured by the momentum of events, diplomatic pressures or for other reasons to do something 
which they perceive to be contrary to their own interests. Thus the initiative may, from the 
outset, be pursued in ways designed to minimize its ultimate impact. 
</p>
<p>20. The procedures and results of these inquiries have been a recurring concern throughout 
the 26 years of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate. Governments have frequently replied to a 
communication from the Special Rapporteur in relation to an alleged extrajudicial execution by

</p>

</b>  Ibid., para. 17. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>indicating that a special commission of inquiry has been set up to investigate the matter.<b>6</b> The 
Special Rapporteur has frequently welcomed this measure,<b>7</b> and in many cases where a State has 
not yet signalled its intention to create a commission, the Special Rapporteur has called on the 
State to do so.<b>8</b> Specific national commissions have also been studied in depth in a great many of 
the country reports of the Special Rapporteurs following in situ visits.<b>9</b> All too often, however, 
the commissions of inquiry are found wanting, and successive Special Rapporteurs have 
expressed the concern that commissions are frequently designed to deflect criticism by 
international actors of the Government rather than to address impunity.<b>10</b> Once the establishment 
of a commission has been announced, the State, in response to criticisms from the international 
community, often uses the special inquiry as evidence that it is currently taking action to address 
impunity. This often succeeds in defusing domestic or international criticism and preventing 
strong advocacy by international actors to promote accountability within the State; however, 
given that commissions of inquiry are often deficient and that attempts to use commissions to 
avoid rather than advance accountability often succeed, the international community must find 
more effective ways of engaging with them. 
</p>
<p>21. Thus, in my 2006 report to the Commission on Human Rights,<b>11</b> I signalled my intention to 
report to the Human Rights Council on the principal problems that had been experienced in 
relation to commissions of inquiry and to make recommendations in that regard.<b>12</b> To that end,

<p>  This report focuses on national, rather than international commissions of inquiry. For 
reporting on international commissions of inquiry, see E/CN.4/2006/89 examining the 
international commissions for East Timor (1999), Togo (2000), the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory (2001), C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (2004), and the Darfur region of the Sudan (2004). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the present analysis: (a) discusses the positive role that commissions of inquiry can play; 
(b) outlines the established guiding principles for a national commission of inquiry; (c) examines 
the principal problems that have been encountered in this regard in the work of the Special 
Rapporteur; and (d) proposes conclusions and recommendations based on lessons learned. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Positive role of commissions of inquiry in addressing impunity 
</b></p>
<p>22. In principle, commissions of inquiry can play an important role in combating impunity. 
First, the commission may be tasked with carrying out of some of the functions normally 
performed by criminal justice institutions. A commission will often be established to provide an 
independent investigation where the criminal justice institutions are seen to be biased or 
incompetent. This is often the case where key government agents, such as the police or military, 
are themselves involved in abuses and where there is no reliable system of police or military 
oversight.<b>13</b> It is also the case where there is long history of repeated abuses that police fail to 
investigate, public prosecutors fail to prosecute, or courts fail to punish due to incompetence, 
bias, or lack of expertise.<b>14</b> A commission may also be seen as desirable where one incident is 
particularly complex and significant, requiring sustained and focused investigation in order to be 
understood.<b>15</b> In such cases, a commission can help to explain or analyse a complex situation, 
and thus perform important functions normally beyond the scope of police investigations or 
judicial procedures. 
23. Second, a commission can provide informed advice to the Government on the institutional 
reforms necessary to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. It can perform an 
essential function that is generally unsuitable to police, prosecutors or courts, and explain the 
underlying causes for serious human rights abuses or the causes of impunity for those abuses. In 
addressing the causes of the abuses, a commission can be the first step in a Government&#8217;s effort 
to take measures to prevent the recurrence of violations and to ensure that its institutions, 
policies, and practices ensure the right to life as effectively as possible.<b>16</b> Importantly, where it 
appears that the regular institutions are incapable of combating impunity, a commission can 
propose structural or long-term reforms to address criminal justice institutional deficiencies. 
When used in this way, and when the commission&#8217;s recommendations are followed up by the 
Government, a commission can be an effective way for the State to reform its criminal justice 
institutions so that it will meet its obligation to investigate, prosecute and punish violations of 
human rights in the future.<b>17</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Guiding principles for a national commission of inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>24. The basic question that must guide an assessment of a commission is whether it can, in 
fact, address impunity. In Special Rapporteur Wako&#8217;s first report in 1983 for the extrajudicial 
executions mandate, he recommended that &#8220;[m]inimum standards of investigation need to be laid 
down to show whether a Government has genuinely investigated a case reported to it and that 
those responsible are fully accountable&#8221;.<b>18</b> Since then, and due in part to the work of successive 
Special Rapporteurs, the general standards which govern how a commission of inquiry should be 
conducted are now clear and well established.<b>19</b> I will not detail in full those standards again 
here, except to highlight the following. 
</p>
<p>25. In order for a commission to address impunity, it must be independent, impartial and 
competent. The commission&#8217;s mandate should give the necessary power to the commission to 
obtain all information necessary to the inquiry but it should not suggest a predetermined 
outcome. Commission members must have the requisite expertise and competence to effectively 
investigate the matter and be independent from suspected perpetrators and from institutions with 
an interest in the outcome of the inquiry. Commissions should be provided transparent funding 
and sufficient resources to carry out their mandate. Effective protection from intimidation and 
violence needs to be provided to witnesses and commission members. When it establishes the 
commission, the Government should undertake to give due consideration to the commission&#8217;s 
recommendations; when the report is completed, the Government should reply publicly to the 
commission&#8217;s report or indicate what it intends to do in response to the report. The commission&#8217;s 
report should be made public in full and disseminated widely. 
</p>
<p>26. As the examination below of the problems encountered in relation to commissions 
indicates, these standards are more than just desirable best practice. Experience shows that 
conformity with them is essential if a commission is to be effective. 
</p>

<p><b>4.  Problems encountered in relation to commissions of inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>27. A comprehensive review of the work of the Special Rapporteur since 1982 indicates that 
many commissions have achieved very little. They are often set up to show domestic constituents 
and the international community that the Government has the will and capability to address 
impunity. Subsequent assessments undertaken by the Special Rapporteurs, however, indicate that 
many of them have in fact done little other than deflect criticism. A review of the specific 
commissions reported on by the Special Rapporteurs indicates that they have consistently failed 
to meet the basic standards set out above. In order to understand more fully where commissions 
commonly fail and how international actors should engage with them, this section details the 
main problems encountered in relation to the conduct or outcomes of commissions of inquiry. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Inquiry fails to take place 
</b>28. Sometimes, commissions are announced with great fanfare, but an inquiry never actually 
begins its work.<b>20</b> Self evidently, in such cases, a commission is simply put forward to appease 
Government critics, but there is no actual Government will to use the institution to address 
impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Limited mandate 
</b>29. A commission may be limited in its effectiveness by the terms of its mandate. The mandate 
may be unduly narrow or restricted in a way that undermines its credibility or usefulness. This is 
particularly the case where the mandate preempts the outcome of the inquiry or where a mandate 
restricts who a commission may investigate (for example, by prohibiting it from investigating 
Government actors).<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(c) Insufficient funding or resources 
</b>30. In some cases, the lack of funding or provision of basic resources to a commission have 
been extremely detrimental to the ability of the commission to function, even where its members 
have the will to conduct investigations. This is more than simply a technical matter; the 
adequacy of resources provided to a commission upon its establishment can be a useful indicator 
of the good faith of the Government and perhaps also of its potential effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>31. In his 1987 report, for example, Special Rapporteur Amos Wako reported on his visit to 
Uganda.<b>22</b> In 1984 and 1985, the Special Rapporteur had sent allegation letters to Uganda, and in 
March 1986, Uganda promised the Commission on Human Rights that it would establish a 
commission to investigate violations of human rights. In August 1986, the Special Rapporteur 
visited Uganda to follow up the allegations he had received and to report on the work of the

<p>commission.<b>23</b> He reported that the commission was urgently in need of (a) basic human rights 
materials; (b) logistical support (vehicles and transport); and (c) stationery and office 
machinery.<b>24</b> He noted that strengthening United Nations support to the commission could 
&#8220;minimize its logistical problems and enhance its efficiency&#8221;.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(d) Lack of expertise 
</b>32. A commission needs the appropriate expertise to carry out the mandated investigations. 
For instance, in his mission report on Indonesia and East Timor, Special Rapporteur 
Bacre Waly Ndiaye observed that &#8220;[n]one of the members of the [commission] had the necessary 
technical expertise to correct the shortcomings found in the investigations carried out by the 
police&#8221;.<b>26</b> Similarly, in his report on Uganda, Rapporteur Wako noted that the commission 
&#8220;needed expert advice on several aspects of its work, particularly in regard to the definition of 
offences against human rights&#8221;.<b>27</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(e) Lack of independence 
</b>33. Where a commission is not independent from the parties to a conflict or from any 
institution or person with an interest in the outcome of the inquiry, its inquiry is unlikely to be 
capable of providing an unbiased assessment of the incident. Just as importantly, where the 
commission is not perceived to be independent, its work will lack credibility and its conclusions 
are unlikely to be trusted. Independence has often been a central concern of assessments of 
commissions made by special rapporteurs. It has three important aspects. 
</p>
<p>34. First, independence must be structurally guaranteed so that the commission is set up as a 
separate institution from the Government. This formal independence can often be assessed by 
examining the terms of the mandate before the commission begins its work, or through an 
examination of the early investigatory practices of the commission. For instance, a major 
Sri Lankan commission, established in November 2006, the progress of which I have followed 
closely,<b>28</b> has been criticized for its failure to secure formal independence. The commission was 
appointed by the President of Sri Lanka to, inter alia, investigate incidents of human rights 
abuses committed since August 2005, to report on the prior investigations into the abuses and to

<p><b>24
</b>  E/CN.4/1987/20, para. 8. He stated that &#8220;[N]o progress whatsoever could be achieved unless 
</p>
<p>certain clearly essential requirements were met. For example, the investigative functions of the 
Commission of Inquiry were paralysed without transport and office supplies, including 
photographic equipment.&#8221; (para. 13).

<p>recommend measures to prevent abuses in the future.<b>29</b> Sri Lanka also invited the formation of an 
International Independent Group of Eminent Persons to monitor the work of the national 
commission and to report on its conformity with international standards.<b>30</b> But following a year 
of public statements by the Group expressing concern about the functioning of the commission,<b>31</b> 
on 6 March 2008, the Group announced that it was terminating its functions because of the 
serious shortcomings in the work of the national inquiry and because of the lack of institutional 
support for the commission&#8217;s work.<b>32</b> The Group stated that the national inquiry had &#8220;fallen far 
short of the transparency and compliance with basic international norms and standards pertaining 
to investigations and inquiries&#8221;.<b>33</b> It noted that one of the many flaws in the commission was that 
there were structural conflicts of interest which seriously compromised the independence of the 
commission. The State Attorney-General&#8217;s Department provided legal counsel to the 
commission, playing a leading role in the panel of counsel to the commission. Given that the 
Attorney-General&#8217;s Department is also the chief legal adviser to the Government of Sri Lanka 
and had been involved in the original investigations into some of the cases being investigated by 
the commission, the Department was potentially going to be investigating itself.<b>34</b> In addition, 
Department members could be potential witnesses to the commission. As the Group noted, this is 
a serious conflict of interest.<b>35</b> A later assessment by the Group indicated that the formal conflict 
did in fact have a serious negative impact on the quality of the commission&#8217;s investigations.<b>36</b> 
</p>
<p>35. In some cases, it will be virtually impossible for the State to assure its citizens and the 
international community that a government-established commission can ever be truly 
independent. This may be the case where a commission is set up to investigate human rights 
abuses in the context of an internal armed conflict.<b>37</b> In such cases, it has been the experience of 
the Special Rapporteur that an international commission of inquiry may be necessary.

</p>
<p>36. Second, where formal independence has been established, actual independence may still be 
lacking. It is essential to look beyond the formal independence of the commission from the 
Government, and to assess whether the commission is capable in practice of carrying out its 
work independently. This may require the work of the commission to be monitored for the entire 
period of its operation. As Special Rapporteur Amos Wako noted in 1987, &#8220;in a number of 
countries, the investigating body, which was given an independent or quasi-independent status 
&#8230; did not, in reality, secure its independence&#8221;.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>37. An extreme example of Government interference is that of a commission established by 
Ethiopia in 2006 to investigate excessive force by Government forces in 2005 during 
anti-government demonstrations. It reportedly found initially that excessive force had in fact 
been used. However, government officials reportedly requested commission members to change 
their votes. The final report found that excessive force had not been used.<b>39</b> Another is provided 
in the report of Special Rapporteur Wako&#8217;s mission to Zaire in May 1991. Following allegations 
of a massacre between 8 and 12 May 1991, the Shaba Regional Assembly established a 
commission. It operated for one month, but &#8220;as its report was about to be presented, it was 
seized, reportedly on orders of the central authorities, and quashed&#8221;.<b>40</b> 
</p>
<p>38. Third, a commission&#8217;s members must also be judged to be individually independent and 
not be seen to have a vested interest in the outcome.<b>41</b> Where members are not in fact or are not 
perceived to be independent, the commission lacks legitimacy in the eyes of the public and its 
findings are unlikely to be accepted.<b>42</b> In addition, witnesses may be too afraid to come forward 
to the Commission for fear of bias by commission members.<b>43</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(f) Inadequate provision of witness protection 
</b>39. Inadequate protection provided to commission members or to witnesses appearing before 
the commission has severely hampered the work of some commissions.<b>44</b> The Sri Lankan 
national commission, ongoing at the time of the present report, has been strongly criticized 
by the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons for failing to have an effective

</p>
<p>witness-protection programme.<b>45</b> Witness protection within the commission was so poor that the 
possible whereabouts of witnesses was reported in a news article, which cited a commission 
member as the source of the confidential information.<b>46</b> The international independent group 
noted that this, together with the lack of a comprehensive witness-protection programme, would 
discourage critical witnesses coming forward which would inhibit &#8220;any effective future pursuit 
of the filing of indictments, convictions, and appropriate accountability for the alleged grave 
human rights violations under review&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>40. In some circumstances, it will be necessary to provide security to all members of the 
commission for it to function independently, or for it to function at all. An extreme example was 
provided in Special Rapporteur Wako&#8217;s report on his visit to Colombia in October 1989, in 
which he detailed the massacre of 12 of the 15 members of a commission on 18 January 1989.<b>47</b> 
The commission was said to have succeeded in identifying those responsible for a massacre in 
October 1987. Even after the massacre of most of the commission members, proper protection 
was not provided to the three surviving members or to the witnesses to the attacks.<b>48</b> The 
Special Rapporteur noted that this &#8220;[c]ontributes to the phenomena known as impunity. 
Witnesses cannot come forward to give evidence and even if they make statements, they are later 
retracted because of intimidation and fear of being killed. Proper investigations cannot be carried 
out and, therefore, many files are closed for lack of evidence&#8221;.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(g) Lack of power to have access to important evidence 
</b>41. Some commissions have been refused access to evidence necessary for the inquiry.<b>50</b> A 
commission needs to have the authority to obtain all information necessary to form fully 
informed conclusions, and this will often mean that a commission needs the power to compel the 
production of documents and witness testimony.<b>51</b> In my country report on Nigeria, for example, 
a commission was established to investigate alleged killings by the army, but the army did not

<p>acknowledge or reply to the commission&#8217;s correspondence.<b>52</b> A similar problem was experienced 
with the Sri Lankan commission, in which State authorities refused to fully cooperate with 
investigations.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(h) Failure to make public, respond to or follow up on commission findings 
</b>42. One of the most common problems encountered with a commission of inquiry is that, even 
where it has carried out its work effectively and submitted a timely report to the Government, the 
findings of the commission are simply never made public.<b>54</b> This has, for example, been the 
trend in Nigeria.<b>55</b> In a report on my visit to that country, I noted that there was a consistent 
pattern: violations are alleged; a commission is established; the reports are never published or are 
ignored.<b>56</b> After my visit, I reported that the &#8220;Apo 6&#8221; inquiry, set up to investigate killings by 
police, appeared to be exemplary. At the time of reporting in 2005, it was only slightly delayed, 
and I called for it to be made public immediately.<b>57</b> Unfortunately, nearly three years later, it has 
reportedly still yet to be made officially public. 
</p>
<p>43. Crucially, when a commission report is not made public, Government failure to officially 
respond to the report or to follow up on the commission&#8217;s recommendations usually follows. 
Lack of Government follow-up to completed commission reports has been a notable feature of 
cases observed by the Special Rapporteur.<b>58</b> During my mission to Nigeria, for example, 
although a commission recommended in 2004 that compensation be paid to the victims of 
violence, at the time of my visit in mid-2005, none had been paid.<b>59</b>

</p>
<p><b>(i) Inadequate prosecutions follow commission report 
</b>44. Frequently, one of the central purposes of establishing a commission is to investigate and 
report on the responsibility for alleged abuses. When a commission carries out an effective 
investigation, it will often be able to recommend directly the prosecution of individuals or to 
submit evidence to prosecutors for the same purpose. In some cases, arrests follow the 
submission of a commission report, but the suspects will later be released without being 
prosecuted.<b>60</b> Alternatively, prosecutions may follow the commission report, but the sentences 
handed down are grossly inadequate.<b>61</b> In other cases, those recommended for prosecution by the 
commission are never successfully prosecuted, or sometimes never even charged.<b>62</b> A State 
attorney-general in Nigeria, for example, told me during my country visit in 2005 that he could 
recall &#8220;no case of prosecutions&#8221; following an inquiry in that country, and that their main purpose 
was just to facilitate a &#8220;cooling of the political temperature&#8221;.<b>63</b> In one case, although the Nigerian 
commission had reported in detail on the identities of those security personnel responsible for 
serious human rights abuses, not one soldier was subsequently charged or disciplined in any 
way.<b>64</b> 
</p>
<p>45. In such cases, all that the commission achieves is a delay, often of many years, of the 
prospect of adequate prosecution of human rights abuses. In practice, this means that the 
international community has been deterred from pushing for prosecutions or from calling for the 
strengthening of regular criminal justice institutions, while the results of the commission are 
awaited. Once the commission has reported, it will usually be too late for meaningful pressure to 
be brought and the impetus or incentive for doing so will have greatly diminished in the 
meantime. 
</p>
<p>46. A related problem is that evidence is gathered by a commission in such a way as to 
compromise the possibility of successful subsequent prosecution. In a communication to Israel in 
September 2005, I wrote that there was no doubt that the Government commission had 
investigated at length whether the use of lethal force in question had been proportionate. The 
commission carried out its work for three years and produced an 800-page report, which 
concluded that, in some cases, the lethal force used had not been justified. During most of the 
period of the commission&#8217;s investigations, those undertaken by the Police Investigations 
Department were halted by the State prosecutor so that witnesses could testify before the 
commission without fear of criminal investigation. However, after the commission&#8217;s report was 
released, it was disavowed by the Department on the basis that it was no longer possible to 
&#8220;determine whether the use of lethal force was disproportionate and, if so, who is responsible for

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that disproportionate use of lethal force&#8221;.<b>65</b> The Department did not issue indictments. As I noted 
in the communication, this &#8220;outcome - and particularly the way in which the interplay of the 
commission inquiry and Police Investigations Department investigation have produced it - would 
appear to fall short of the international standards&#8221;.<b>66</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(j) The inquiry&#8217;s final report fails to adequately justify its conclusions 
</b>47. Some commissions appear on their face to be appropriately established, but a close review 
of the substance of the final report reveals a failure to conduct a meaningful inquiry.<b>67</b> Its 
conclusions may be untenable in the face of the available evidence. The commission may simply 
accept the Government version of events without explanation or analysis. It may reach 
conclusions without any apparent investigation having taken place to support them. 
</p>
<p>48. During my visit to Nigeria, for example, I reviewed a commission report into a &#8220;sectarian 
crisis&#8221; in Kano state in 2004. Credible and detailed civil society reports put the number killed at 
between 200 and 250; the commission, however, without providing any evidence whatsoever 
that it had conducted independent investigations into the number killed, recommended that the 
police figure of 84 be taken as the &#8220;official position&#8221;.<b>68</b> The commission, again without having 
undertaken any adequate investigation, also accepted the Government&#8217;s assessment of the overall 
damage caused by the crisis. In recommending the compensation that should be paid, the 
commission arrived at figures without any explanation or argument.<b>69</b> 
</p>
<p><b>(k) Lack of information about the conduct of or response to the commission 
</b>49. One significant problem encountered in the work of the Special Rapporteur in seeking to 
address widespread impunity for extrajudicial executions is a dearth of information on the 
conduct of established commissions of inquiry and of the Government response to the final 
commission report.<b>70</b> Rarely is the progress of most national commissions carefully monitored by 
the international community. Commissions often take many months or years to produce their 
reports, and it can take as long again before the Government issues an official response to the 
inquiry&#8217;s conclusions. Long-term monitoring is thus necessary in order to determine whether a 
particular commission was, at the end of the day, effective. But there is no centralized 
monitoring of commissions of inquiry worldwide accessible to view the progress of a 
commission or to judge its effectiveness.

</p>
<p><b>5.  Lessons learned from 26 years of reporting on commissions of inquiry 
</b></p>
<p>50. Experience demonstrates that, while commissions of inquiry tasked with examining 
alleged extrajudicial executions have much to recommend them in principle, in practice the 
balance sheet is often much less positive. Far too many of the commissions dealt with by the 
Special Rapporteur over the past 26 years have resulted in de facto impunity for all those 
implicated.  
</p>
<p>51. In essence, the problem is that commissions can be used very effectively by Governments 
for the wrong purposes: to defuse a crisis, to purport to be upholding notions of accountability 
and to promote impunity. The mere announcement by a Government of a commission is often 
taken at face value to mean that the Government is &#8220;doing something&#8221; to address impunity. 
Because a commission creates the appearance of government action, its announcement often 
prevents or delays international and civil society advocacy around the human rights abuses 
alleged. Moreover, an ineffective commission can be more than just a waste of time and 
resources; it can contribute to impunity by deterring other initiatives, monopolizing available 
resources and making subsequent endeavours to prosecute difficult or impossible. 
</p>
<p>52. These conclusions raise an important issue for the international community. How should 
international actors respond to announcements that commissions of inquiry are to be established? 
</p>
<p>53. The principal answer is that the international community should not, solely because a 
commission of inquiry has been established, suspend its engagement with the relevant 
Government when serious violations of human rights are alleged. International actors should 
assess from the outset whether the commission has been given the tools it would need to be able 
to address impunity effectively. The commission&#8217;s mandate, its membership, the process by 
which it was selected, its terms of appointment, the availability of effective witness-protection 
programmes and the provision of adequate staffing and funding should all be examined to 
ascertain whether the commission meets the relevant international standards. Experience 
demonstrates that the standards are more than just best practice guidelines: they are necessary 
preconditions for an investigation capable of addressing impunity. If they are not met in practice, 
a commission is highly unlikely to be effective. 
</p>
<p>54. If a commission is not established in accordance with international standards, the 
international community should not adopt a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach. Rather, it should promptly 
draw attention to the inadequacies and advocate implementation of necessary reforms. Where a 
Government appears to have a genuine will to establish an effective commission, but lacks the 
necessary expertise, funding or resources, international assistance will be appropriate. 
</p>
<p>55. A commission is not a substitute for a criminal prosecution.<b>71</b> It does not have the powers 
of a court to declare the guilt or innocence of a person. It usually cannot order punishment for a 
wrongdoer. A commission&#8217;s role in terms of the State&#8217;s obligation to prosecute and punish is to 
gather evidence for a subsequent prosecution, identify perpetrators or recommend individuals for 
prosecution. If the commission&#8217;s mandate overlaps significantly with that of the regular criminal

 <p> 
</p>
<p>justice institutions (for example, where it is tasked with investigating and identifying 
perpetrators, duties normally performed by police and public prosecutors), a sound rationale 
needs to be provided by the Government to justify the creation of the commission. Without such 
justification, the commission is likely to be a tool to delay prosecutions or deflect the 
international community&#8217;s attention from advocating for prosecutions. 
</p>
<p>56. If there is no sound rationale for the commission or if the commission&#8217;s mandate is 
inadequate to achieve its purpose, international actors should continue to focus on the need for 
prosecutions to progress through the regular criminal justice system and for reforms to that 
system to be made where necessary. Experience shows that, where the regular criminal justice 
institutions are biased, or lack expertise or competence, or are the subject of Government 
interference, it is unlikely that a commission of inquiry will be able to achieve the independence 
needed to address impunity effectively. Furthermore, even if the commission defies the odds and 
does its work effectively, there is no reason to expect the criminal justice system to do its part by 
way of follow-up. It might thus be better for the international community to insist from the outset 
that the system itself be reformed. 
</p>
<p>57. Where the international community determines that a commission of inquiry is an 
appropriate response, it should then track its progress closely. Failures to meet international 
standards in the functioning of the commission should be noted and appropriate steps taken in 
response. Inordinate delays and failures to publish reports should be matters of comment. Once a 
commission has reported, the Government should be pressed to respond formally and address the 
recommendations. Finally, the Government&#8217;s actual follow-up to those recommendations should 
be carefully monitored. 
</p>
<p>58. In sum, the announcement or establishment of a commission should not take the pressure 
off a Government to address impunity, and it should not silence international actors. Instead, the 
international community should monitor commissions actively, push for their compliance with 
international standards, offer assistance where appropriate and insist that a commission does not 
distract from the need to maintain strong criminal justice institutions. Governments and 
international actors should never lose sight of the substance of what a commission of inquiry is 
supposed to achieve: accountability for serious human rights abuses and underlying reform to 
prevent the recurrence of violations.

<p><b>B.  Right to seek pardon or commutation of a death sentence 
</b></p>
<p>59. Under international law, any person sentenced to death has the right to seek a pardon or to 
seek the commutation of a death sentence to a less draconian one. This right is reflected in 
international and regional instruments as well as in the domestic practice of almost every country 
that applies capital punishment. Indeed its recognition is so widespread that it would be difficult 
to deny its status as a norm of customary international law.<b>72</b> As with many human rights norms,

</b>  The Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Case of <i>Ferm&#237;n Ram&#237;rez v. Guatemala</i>, 
</p>
<p>Judgment of 20 June 2005 (Merits, Reparations and Costs), at http://www.corteidh.or.cr/docs/ 
casos/articulos/seriec_126_ing.doc, para. 109 concluded that &#8220;the right to grace forms part of the 
international corpus juris&#8221;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>however, the more pertinent question concerns the content of the right and, in particular, the 
extent to which States are required to respect certain procedural safeguards in order to ensure the 
integrity of the right. This question has been highlighted in recent years at the international and 
national levels and it is now timely to draw upon these developments in order to better 
understand the implications of the right concerned. 
</p>
<p>60. For present purposes, the formulation contained in article 6 (4) of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights can be considered to reflect accurately the formulation of 
the right: &#8220;Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the 
sentence. Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all 
cases.&#8221;<b>73</b> The right thus has two separate parts. The first is the right of the individual offender to 
seek pardon or commutation. This implies no entitlement to receive a positive response, but it 
does imply the existence of a meaningful procedure through which to make such an application. 
But this right can, with relative ease, be rendered illusory. This may be achieved through the 
adoption of various approaches that are designed to, or have the effect of, turning the relevant 
procedures into a formality as a result of which no genuine consideration is accorded to the case 
for pardon or commutation. The second part of the right is the need to ensure that amnesties, 
pardons and commutations are not precluded by actions taken by the legislature or other actors to 
eliminate the relevant possibilities from the spectrum of available remedies. This is a right which 
preserves the &#8220;sovereign&#8221; powers of the relevant State authorities and underscores the fact that, 
even when the judicial process has been exhausted, those authorities retain the right to opt for 
life over death for whatever reason. 
</p>
<p>61. It is pertinent to mention cases in which each of these component parts of the right have 
been threatened. The first part - the right to seek pardon or commutation - was raised by the 
Government of the United States in the <i>Avena</i> case before the International Court of Justice.<b>74</b> 
The Government argued that clemency procedures ensured that every person sentenced to death 
received a reconsideration of his or her case prior to execution. In response, while leaving open 
the possibility that a clemency process could be devised that would meet its requirements, the 
Court made clear that the procedures actually followed did not come close to providing the sort 
of safeguards required. Apart from their lack of procedural safeguards, the chances of a 
successful application in some States was close to zero.<b>75</b> The second part of the right has been 
jeopardized by developments in Guatemala, beginning with an initiative in 2000 which

<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>73
</b>  The same principle is reaffirmed in the Safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of 
</p>
<p>those facing the death penalty adopted by the Economic and Social Council in its 
resolution 1984/50, para. 7.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>eliminated the law governing clemency,<b>76</b> and has culminated in a determined congressional 
push in 2008 to adopt a law on presidential clemency, which lacks procedural safeguards and 
introduces a tacit rejection rule if the President fails to act on a petition within 30 days. 
62. Before examining the relevant international jurisprudence in this area, it is important to 
acknowledge the functions that a right to clemency, as it is sometimes called, plays within the 
legal system. Even though the right has been characterized as lying at &#8220;the borderland of 
legality&#8221;<b>77</b> because of the power it vests in the political authorities, it is nonetheless a part of the 
legal system in the broadest sense. Its serves: 
</p>
<p> (a) As a final safety valve when new evidence indicating that a conviction was erroneous 
emerges but in a form that is inadequate to reopen the case through normal procedures; 
</p>
<p> (b) To enable account to be taken of post-conviction developments of which an appeals 
court might not be able to take cognizance but which nevertheless warrant being considered in 
the context of an otherwise irreversible remedy; 
</p>
<p> (c) To provide an opportunity for the political process, which is rightly excluded from 
otherwise interfering in the course of criminal justice, to show mercy to someone whose life 
would otherwise be forfeited. 
</p>
<p>63. The key question then is: what procedural safeguards are required to be followed in order 
to ensure that the right to seek pardon or commutation is respected in practice? The Human 
Rights Committee had an opportunity to respond to this question when it considered a claim that 
the procedural guarantees of article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights must be followed. In rejecting that claim, it observed that &#8220;States parties retain discretion 
for spelling out the modalities&#8221; as indicated by the fact that article 6 (4) itself prescribed no 
particular procedure.<b>78</b> The Committee did not, however, endorse the view that the modalities 
followed were irrelevant, as underscored by the fact that it then held that the relevant procedures 
in place in the State concerned were not &#8220;such as to effectively negate the right enshrined&#8221; in 
article 6 (4). In other words, it left open the possibility that procedures could be deficient.

</p>
<p>64. In interpreting the relevant provision of the American Convention on Human Rights, the 
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has recognized that the right to apply for 
amnesty, pardon or commutation of sentence must be read to encompass certain minimum 
procedural protections for condemned prisoners, if the right is to be effectively respected and 
enjoyed.<b>79</b> It concluded that the condemned person&#8217;s procedural rights include rights (a) to apply 
for amnesty, pardon or commutation of sentence; (b) to be informed of when the competent 
authority will consider the offender&#8217;s case; (c) to make representations, in person or by counsel, 
to the competent authority; (d) to receive a decision from that authority within a reasonable 
period of time prior to his or her execution; and (e) not to have capital punishment imposed 
while such a petition is pending decision by the competent authority.<b>80</b> The Judicial Committee 
of the Privy Council reached largely the same conclusions concerning the content of this norm, 
adding that the condemned person should normally also be given access to the documents 
provided to the pardoning authority.<b>81</b> 
</p>
<p>65. The need for such procedural safeguards to be considered an integral part of the right itself 
has also been underscored by cases dealt with by the Special Rapporteur. In some instances, the 
process for considering pardons has proven to be cursory or illusory, with the designated 
decision-making body failing even to meet or deliberate.<b>82</b> Furthermore, since secrecy diminishes 
the likelihood of due process, requirements to provide the condemned person with basic 
information regarding the process, such as the date of consideration of the petition and notice of 
the decision reached, help to safeguard the integrity of the process.<b>83</b>

</p>
<p><b>81
</b>  &#8220;The procedures followed in the process of considering a man&#8217;s petition are ... open to

<p>judicial review ... [I]t is necessary that the condemned man should be given notice of the date 
when the [pardoning authority] will consider his case. That notice should be adequate for him or 
his advisers to prepare representations before a decision is taken ... The fact that the [pardoning 
authority] is required to look at the representations of the condemned man does not mean that 
they are bound to accept them. They are bound to consider them ... It is ... not sufficient that the 
man be given a summary or the gist of the material available to the [pardoning authority]; there 
are too many opportunities for misunderstandings or omissions. He should normally be given in 
a situation like the present the documents.&#8221; (<i>Neville Lewis, et al. v. Attorney General of Jamaica, 
et al.</i>, Privy Council Appeals Nos. 60 of 1999, 65 of 1999, 69 of 1999 and 10 of 2000, judgement 
of 12 September 2000.) See also the Judicial Committee in <i>Reckley v. Minister of Public Safety

<b>83
</b></p>
<p>  As the Special Rapporteur has observed previously: &#8220;The uncertainty and seclusion inflicted 
by opaque processes place due process rights at risk, and there have, unfortunately, been cases in 
which secrecy in the post-conviction process has led to a miscarriage of justice.&#8221; 
E/CN.4/2006/53/Add.3, para. 26. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>66. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur has encountered situations in which the Government has 
considered a clemency application solely on the basis of a written report by the trial judge rather 
than on submissions by the condemned person.<b>84</b> Reliance on a report from the trial judge 
reflects an unduly limited understanding of the reasons that pardon and commutation should 
sometimes be granted. Evidentiary and procedural rules mean that certain considerations central 
to matters of mercy are marginalized or even excluded in the trial and appellate process. For 
example, commutation may be thought to be warranted because a murder was triggered by 
events that make it relatively understandable even if they do not suffice to excuse criminal 
liability, because a society&#8217;s attitudes towards the death penalty have changed since trial, because 
exonerating evidence has arisen, or because a prisoner, though guilty of murder, has been 
successfully rehabilitated on death row. A trial judge&#8217;s report on a case will not speak to these 
and other reasons that might move a Government to show mercy. Indeed, sometimes the 
circumstance that might suggest the desirability of pardon does not even come to pass until after 
the trial has finished. The safest guarantee that the possibility of pardon or commutation will 
achieve their goals is for the condemned person to have the opportunity to invoke any personal 
circumstances or other considerations that might appear relevant to him or her. 
</p>
<p>67. In conclusion, both law and practice demand that the &#8220;right to seek pardon or 
commutation&#8221; be accompanied by essential procedural guarantees if it is not to be turned into a 
meaningless formality that does little or nothing to further the purposes for which the right was 
recognized. Those procedural guarantees include the right of the condemned person to 
affirmatively request pardon or commutation; to make representations in support of this request 
referring to whatever considerations which might appear relevant to him or her; to be informed 
in advance of when that request will be considered; and to be informed promptly of whatever 
decision is reached. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Prisoners running prisons 
</b></p>
<p>68. &#8220;There&#8217;s a small group that&#8217;s in charge within the prison; they beat people; they order 
killings; they control the drug trafficking.&#8221;<b>85</b> While this comment was made over a decade ago 
by a female prisoner in Brazil, it is a phenomenon that is common today in many prisons around 
the world, in both developed and developing countries.<b>86</b> It is also a problem that the Special 
Rapporteur has encountered first-hand in several country visits. Because extrajudicial killings 
frequently occur in such circumstances, it is an issue which demands the attention of the Council. 
</p>
<p>69. From the perspective of the authorities, the logic of handing the control of prisons to gangs 
is not difficult to understand. The gangs are close to the ground, well informed and provide their

<p>services free of charge. They can control trouble-makers, administer brutal punishment and 
mobilize free labour on a large scale. They might also reduce inter-gang violence, provide a 
system of rewards that keep some prisoners contented and encourage respect for certain prison 
facilities. The temptation to rely upon them to carry out the basic functions of maintaining order 
and imposing discipline is especially appealing to administrators who are grappling with 
shrinking budgets, staff shortages, overcrowded facilities, demanding gang-based populations 
and little public or Government support. 
</p>
<p>70. There are, however, major problems with opting for this choice. First, killings occur 
regularly and the authorities are poorly placed to do anything to prevent them or to punish the 
perpetrators. Second, the practice invariably leads to widespread violations of a wide range of 
other human rights. Third, the supposed benefits of an orderly and disciplined prison population 
almost always degenerate into a system in which violence rules, drugs dominate, gang-based turf 
battles are unleashed and various forms of economic, social and sexual coercion or intimidation 
are facilitated. 
</p>
<p><b>The process of abdicating responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>71. How does it come to pass that certain prisoners are placed in the position of maintaining 
order and imposing discipline on their peers, often arbitrarily and abusively, while the prison 
authorities stand idly by? The origins of this practice vary. In some cases, staff may have 
deliberately delegated power to particular prisoners, sometimes beginning by designating 
&#8220;trusties&#8221; or individuals who are trusted to behave responsibly, but then losing a degree of 
control over, or becoming in thrall to, the &#8220;trusties&#8221;. In other cases, inmates may have coerced 
the staff into recognizing their power. The extent to which control is surrendered also varies. 
Sometimes, the guards continue to monitor conditions and retain the capacity to intervene. In a 
remarkable number of cases, however, the guards have abandoned any attempt at regulating life 
within the prison and, instead, only secure the perimeter, preventing escapes and searching 
visitors for weapons and other contraband. 
</p>
<p>72. The violent death of some inmates is an almost invariable consequence of the abdication of 
authority to prisoners. There are several reasons for this. First, when prisoners run prisons, the 
&#8220;discipline&#8221; they impose is typically ruthless. Prisoners who fail to abide by their arbitrary rules 
risk beating, stabbing and other unlawful violence. Second, when prisoners run prisons, the 
strength of gangs will increase, as will the likelihood of fights between gangs. Third, when 
criminals run prisons, it is relatively easy for them to organize riots and uprisings. When guards 
exercise strong, continuous supervision, grievances can be addressed before they explode, and 
fights can be broken up before they escalate. However, once a full-blown riot has developed, the 
usual response is large-scale intervention by a military or police unit that too often resorts to 
overwhelming force and indiscriminate violence. On various occasions, scores of prisoners have 
died during the suppression of a single prison riot. 
</p>
<p><b>The obligations of States 
</b></p>
<p>73. The State&#8217;s duty to protect the lives of prisoners is clear. In all circumstances, States are 
obligated to both refrain from committing acts that violate individual rights and take appropriate </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>measures to prevent human rights abuses by private persons. As I have previously observed, this 
obligation has notably far-reaching implications in the custodial context.<b>87</b> In terms of the 
obligation to respect rights, the controlled character of the custodial environment permits States 
to exercise unusually comprehensive control over the conduct of government officials - such as 
police officers, prison guards and soldiers - in order to prevent them from committing violations. 
In terms of the obligation to ensure rights, the controlled character of the custodial environment 
also permits States to take unusually effective and comprehensive measures to prevent abuses by 
private persons. Moreover, by severely limiting inmates&#8217; freedom of movement and capacity for 
self-defence, the State assumes a heightened duty of protection. It is inconceivable that a State 
could fulfil this heightened duty of protection while permitting prisoners to run prisons. 
</p>
<p>74. The problems of prisoner violence and abdication of authority to prisoners have long been 
recognized by international human rights instruments. The oldest and most venerable among 
them is the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners,<b>88</b> which reflect customary 
international law in many respects and provide authoritative guidance in interpreting many 
provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other treaties. When 
prisoners run prisons, the provision of discipline by prisoners is integral to the practice. Yet the 
Standard Minimum Rules clearly prohibit this.<b>89</b> The broader issue of prisoner-on-prisoner

</p>
<p><b>The path to reform 
</b></p>
<p>75. States should develop plans to reassert responsible control over their prison populations 
and to effectively protect prisoners from each other. In some cases, such as when prisoner 
authorities are also gang-leaders, this is undeniably challenging: if prisoners are segregated 
according to gang affiliation, the perpetuation of gang control will be encouraged; if prisoners 
are not segregated, prisoners from rival gangs may kill each other. The complexity of the 
challenge is significant, and optimal solutions will no doubt vary from country to country. It is 
possible, however, to identify some of the basic tools Governments have at their disposal, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>90
</b> &#8220;Countries should take effective measures to prevent prisoner-on-prisoner violence by 
</p>
<p>investigating reports of such violence, prosecuting and punishing those responsible, and 
offering protective custody to vulnerable individuals, without marginalizing them from the 
prison population more than necessitated by the needs of protection and without rendering 
them at further risk of ill-treatment. Training programmes should be considered to sensitize 
prison officials as to the importance of taking effective steps to prevent and remedy 
prisoner-on-prisoner abuse and to provide them with the means to do so. In accordance 
with the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention 
or Imprisonment, prisoners should be segregated along the lines of gender, age and 
seriousness of the crime, as well as first-time/repeat offenders and pretrial/convicted 
detainees&#8221; A/56/156, para. 39 (i). 
</p>
<p><b>91
</b>  The European Committee has reached similar conclusions, although it has placed greater 
</p>
<p>emphasis on the role of supervision by staff: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tackling the phenomenon of inter-prisoner violence requires that prison staff be placed in 
a position, including in terms of staffing levels, to exercise their authority and their 
supervisory tasks in an appropriate manner. Prison staff must be alert to signs of trouble 
and be both resolved and properly trained to intervene when necessary. The existence of 
positive relations between staff and prisoners, based on the notions of secure custody and 
care, is a decisive factor in this context; this will depend in large measure on staff 
possessing appropriate interpersonal communication skills. Further, management must be 
prepared fully to support staff in the exercise of their authority. Specific security measures 
adapted to the particular characteristics of the situation encountered (including effective 
search procedures) may well be required; however, such measures can never be more than 
an adjunct to the above-mentioned basic imperatives. In addition, the prison system needs 
to address the issue of the appropriate classification and distribution of prisoners.&#8221;

<p>international standards that should guide the use of these tools and underlying factors that must 
be addressed to enable progress. 
</p>
<p>76. The Government&#8217;s legal power to determine which prisoners are confined to which cells, 
wings and prisons at which times provides one powerful example of the tools Governments have 
to retake control from prisoner authorities and prevent prisoner-on-prisoner violence. The power 
to control inmates&#8217; movements can be used to disrupt particular circumstances in which inmates 
attempt to become prisoner authorities, dominating and coercing fellow prisoners. Particularly 
vulnerable individuals, including ones who have been threatened by other prisoners, may be 
given protective custody. Prisoner authorities may themselves be moved and isolated from the 
rest of the prison population.<b>92</b> 
</p>
<p>77. In addition to these separation measures, staff can systematically classify and segregate 
new inmates in such a way as to reduce the opportunities and incentives for inmates to form 
violent organizations. International human rights treaties require that some groups of inmates be 
separated, providing that accused persons shall be segregated from convicted persons,<b>93</b> juvenile 
offenders shall be segregated from adults<b>94</b> and migrant workers held for migration-related 
violations shall be segregated from convicted persons or persons awaiting trial.<b>95</b> Other criteria 
for segregation are enumerated in standards instruments adopted by international bodies. These 
include the separation of men from women and of persons detained for civil offences from those 
detained for criminal offences.<b>96</b> International standards also suggest the importance of 
classification to encourage rehabilitation and discourage recidivism.<b>97</b> 
</p>
<p>78. These broad categories, however, provide only a starting point for national authorities. 
While Governments must avoid classifications that would be inconsistent with human rights law 
prohibitions on discrimination, there are numerous other country-specific criteria that may be 
relevant, including gang affiliation (whether as a criterion for grouping or separating), past 
behaviour in prison and the severity and character of the offence committed. To make any such 
effort effective, it must be approached systematically. First, the Government should develop a

<p><b> </b>Note, however, that sustained and comprehensive isolation can violate human rights law 
requirements that &#8220;persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with 
respect for the inherent dignity of the human person&#8221; and that &#8220;[n]o one shall be subjected to 
torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8221; (ICCPR, arts. 7, 10 (1). The 
&#8220;super max&#8221; approach of continuous single cell confinement for the worst perpetrators has, in 
particular, raised serious concerns.

<p>precise policy on how the various criteria interact to determine who should be detained together 
or apart. Thus, as a purely hypothetical example, one might separate inmates into age, sex and 
other groups required by law; further segregate each such group by the severity of the offence 
committed; then, among those responsible for violent crimes, separate persons from rival gangs; 
and finally separate out leaders of gangs. The system of classification and segregation that is 
required will vary according to the particular challenges facing each prison system, but too often 
Governments allow these decisions to be made on an ad hoc basis by individual officials; 
instead, they should be clearly spelled out and made known to all concerned. Second, the 
institutional means to implement this classification and segregation policy must be put in place. 
To effectively screen and sort new inmates, there will be a need for staff trained in interviewing 
new inmates and in reaching out to other law enforcement authorities to obtain and analyse 
information on the criminal histories and gang affiliations of individuals and on the relationships 
between gangs. Third, the policy must be continuously evaluated for its effectiveness in, 
inter alia, preventing prisoner-on-prisoner violence, the establishment of gang control and 
recidivism. 
</p>
<p>79. This brief discussion of one tool - developing a system for allocating prisoners to cells, 
wings and prisons - that Governments have for ending the hold of prisoner authorities and 
preventing prisoner-on-prisoner violence should not be taken to imply that preventing violent 
gangs from controlling prisons is straightforward. In any such effort, unintended consequences 
are common. Providing vulnerable prisoners with protective custody in response to gang threats 
can perpetuate gang control. Attempting to isolate gang leaders from the general population can 
spark violent riots. However, for all the difficulties of re-establishing Government control, it is 
clear that the necessary tools are available. 
</p>
<p>80. Even when prison officials do make serious and sensible efforts to prevent violence and to 
assert their legitimate disciplinary authority, reform may prove elusive unless certain underlying 
factors are addressed. Prisons run by prisoners are typically also characterized by understaffing, 
overcrowding and corruption. Governments that are serious about maintaining the monopoly of 
violence, which is a function belonging solely to the State, must address these underlying 
problems in relation to the use of violence in prisons. 
</p>
<p>81. Understaffing, or an insufficient ratio of staff to prisoners, makes it difficult and often 
dangerous for staff to supervise inmates effectively. In extreme cases, a small staff has no choice 
but to prioritize searching visitors and securing the perimeter against escapes while leaving 
inmates almost entirely unsupervised. However, even in more typical situations, understaffing 
increases the temptation to engage in corruption and to exercise power indirectly through 
prisoners. 
</p>
<p>82. Overcrowding makes it much more difficult to prevent prisoner-on-prisoner violence. Cells 
are difficult to monitor as effectively as common areas, and this inherent danger is made worse 
by the tendency for competition for space among a cell&#8217;s inmates to lead to violence. 
Overcrowding also makes it more difficult to take other preventive measures. Even in the rare 
situation in which overcrowding does not lead directly to an insufficient staff-to-prisoner ratio, 
the direct supervision of inmates is dangerous in a densely packed area. In addition, 
overcrowding can make it difficult or impossible to find the space for programming or to 
effectively classify and segregate inmates. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>83. There are two basic approaches available to reduce crowding: the first is to build additional 
prisons; the second is to provide alternatives to incarceration. Bail for persons held on remand 
and parole for persons serving sentences are particularly useful measures. 
</p>
<p>84. Corruption by staff routinely subverts other measures for reducing prisoner-on-prisoner 
violence. The most obvious downside is that prisoners can gain access to weapons. However, 
corruption also permits prisoners to buy transfers to other cells or prisons, defeating 
classification and segregation schemes. 
</p>
<p>85. There are a number of approaches to reducing corruption. In many situations, higher 
salaries will be essential. However, especially if gang control has already become significant, 
financial temptation is likely to be accompanied by fear that failing to comply with prisoner 
demands would result in violent consequences. For this reason, training and discipline are also 
key factors. Prison staff should be trained to detect and avoid manipulation by inmates. 
Disciplinary rules should be rigidly enforced against even petty corruption to forestall the 
dynamic of escalating manipulation by inmates. 
</p>
<p>86. These are only preliminary observations which do more to identify the problem than 
provide a solution. The Special Rapporteur would note, however, that even a preliminary review 
reveals that the problem is critical and that the tools required to solve it are available. What is 
lacking is the political will to address violence and repression against an almost universally 
disdained group (convicted criminals), especially in countries in which the problem has grown to 
the point of appearing intractable. The other side of the balance sheet is, however, now becoming 
more apparent to Governments. The consequences for national security of abandoning control of 
prisons to prisoners are potentially dire. They include (a) turning prisons into training grounds 
for more effective violence to be unleashed upon the society by inmates when they are released; 
(b) enhancing gang recruitment by compelling previously unaffiliated prisoners to join and 
leaving them with no options upon release but to remain loyal to the gang, whose markings they 
will often have received in prison; and (c) turning prisons into well-protected and effective 
command centres for individuals running drug dealing, prostitution, extortion and other criminal 
enterprises or promoting terrorist activities from the security of their prison cells. 
</p>
<p>87. In summary, the practice of prisoners running prisons amounts to an abdication of the most 
basic responsibility of Governments to uphold human rights and is an issue that demands urgent 
attention. Where a Government insists that a regular prison system run by trained, disciplined 
and humane authorities is beyond its financial means, the alternatives are to revamp the criminal 
justice system to institute other forms of punishment, to place less reliance upon imprisonment 
and to instigate a more efficient court system which processes cases more rapidly. The State has 
no right to imprison a person in order to subject him or her to the caprices and arbitrariness of 
thugs, whether in the name of necessity, realism or efficiency. The human rights of individuals 
do not cease to exist when they pass through the prison gates. On the contrary, the State assumes 
a particular and demanding set of obligations by virtue of its decision to deprive a person of 
liberty through imprisonment. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>88. The gravity and importance of the problem of prisoner-run prisons is one reason why the 
Human Rights Council should give urgent consideration to the appointment of a Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of detainees. This area constitutes a major gap in the existing coverage 
of the special procedures system and is one that should be remedied as soon as possible.<b>98</b> 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>89. This section is not designed to summarize the foregoing analysis. In addition to 
the measures recommended above, the Special Rapporteur makes three other 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>90. The Council should appoint a Special Rapporteur on the rights of detainees. 
</b></p>
<p><b>91. In recent months, the situation in Darfur has deteriorated yet again. During 2007, the 
Special Rapporteur was a member of the Group of Experts on Darfur, appointed by the 
Human Rights Council. The Council&#8217;s action in not renewing the mandate of the Group in 
December 2007, despite its conclusion that the Sudan had failed to meet many of the 
benchmarks that had been set, represented the triumph of politics over human rights and 
brought no credit to the Council. That step should be reconsidered. 
</b></p>
<p><b>92. The Council should acknowledge the vacuum that is created as a result of the ability 
of States in which serious concerns over extrajudicial executions have been identified to 
refuse to respond to requests to visit by the Special Rapporteur. The Council should look 
very closely at the failure in this regard of the countries named in paragraph 11 above.

</p>
<p><b>98
</b>  While the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment has done excellent work on those aspects of prison conditions which fall within his 
mandate, this covers only a limited area of the much broader range of problems that need to be 
addressed. In addition, it is unreasonable to expect a single mandate-holder to cover the entirety 
of two such broad-ranging and critically important sets of issues. </p>
