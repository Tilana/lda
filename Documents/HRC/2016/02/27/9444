<p><b>Report of the United Nations High Commissioner

</b></p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report updates the earlier report of the High Commissioner (E/CN.4/2006/77) 
and provides information on the principal developments relating to indigenous peoples in 2006 
under the aegis of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), 
including activities at the country level.  The report notes that indigenous peoples remain 
among the poorest sectors of society in the countries in which they live, notwithstanding 
progress in legal protection and recognition through national legislation and international norms.  
The implementation gap - the disparity between established rights and their practical 
application - constitutes a significant challenge for Governments and the international 
community, and is further analysed by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people in his present and previous reports 
(A/HRC/4/32 and E/CN.4/2006/78 respectively).  The report concludes by noting that 
indigenous issues are increasingly mainstreamed into the work of the human rights mechanisms 
and the technical cooperation activities of OHCHR.  It also acknowledges the ongoing 
discussions to develop universal standards on the rights of indigenous peoples.

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Indigenous peoples are among the poorest groups in the countries in which they live.  
Numbering some 370 million, they constitute 5 per cent of the population of the world but 
15 per cent of the poor.  Indigenous peoples have lower incomes than other communities, less 
access to health care, education, adequate housing and social services and generally face political 
and social exclusion.  A report by the International Labour Office (ILO), drawing on information 
provided by the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) of 14 countries, concludes that 
poverty is widespread and persistent among indigenous peoples.<b>1</b>  A World Bank study on 
indigenous peoples in Latin America finds that being indigenous increases the probability of an 
individual being poor and notes that few gains were made in poverty reduction among 
indigenous peoples during the International Decade of the World&#8217;s Indigenous People 
(1995-2004).  It asserts that, in certain countries, the poverty gap between indigenous peoples 
and the larger population has widened.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>2. The question of poverty and indigenous peoples was the focus of the Permanent Forum 
on Indigenous Issues at its fourth session and the subject of a paper by the Inter-agency Support 
Group on Indigenous Issues (IASG) that warned that the Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) were not bringing the expected benefits to indigenous communities.<b>3</b>  The Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people has 
underlined in both his thematic and country reports the disadvantaged condition of the majority 
of indigenous peoples in terms of income and access to basic services.  The Treaty Bodies, as 
noted in the present report, have repeatedly called upon Governments to develop programmes 
that address the disadvantages experienced by indigenous peoples.  All of the above-mentioned 
human rights mechanisms have underlined the need for reliable and culturally appropriate 
disaggregated data to determine the extent of poverty among indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>3. The information provided in the present report identifies some of the activities 
undertaken under the aegis of OHCHR aimed at addressing the disadvantages of indigenous 
peoples and assisting Governments in strengthening their policies and programmes for these 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  TREATY BODIES 
</b></p>
<p>4. In 2006, a number of the treaty bodies, namely the Committee on the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee on the Protection of

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women, specifically referred to human rights issues 
relating to indigenous peoples.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) addressed 
indigenous rights in its concluding observations to Botswana, Denmark, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Guyana, Mexico, Norway and South Africa and in various decisions relating to Australia, Brazil, 
Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic, Nicaragua, Peru, 
Suriname and the United States of America.  CERD highlighted persistently high rates of 
illiteracy, cases of domestic violence, low average life expectancy, low levels of schooling and 
acts of violence committed against indigenous persons in certain countries.  It identified other 
human rights issues, including the development of extractive industry projects without 
consultation with indigenous communities; the lack of legal recognition of the right of 
indigenous communities to ownership and possession of lands; the practice of granting land titles 
to indigenous communities excluding water and subsoil resources; the lack of access to their 
traditional lands for indigenous peoples; forced displacement; obstruction in the use of 
traditional sacred sites; and the lack of bilingual education. 
</p>
<p>6. CERD noted the progress that had been made in preventing racial discrimination in 
respect to indigenous rights in certain countries and welcomed specific national developments 
aimed at promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous peoples.  These included:  the 
establishment of the Presidential Commission on Discrimination and Racism against Indigenous 
Peoples and the promulgation of the Agreement on Identity and Rights of Indigenous People in 
Guatemala, as well as the intention of Guatemala to recognize indigenous legal systems; and the 
establishment of the General Act on the Linguistic Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the 
National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples in Mexico.  It also welcomed 
efforts made by certain States parties to ensure greater participation of indigenous peoples in 
political life and to improve their employment, housing and education.  CERD particularly 
expressed concern at the extent to which racism and racial discrimination are entrenched within 
the territory of certain States parties.  It also noted with concern the inadequacy of public policies 
in eliminating racial discrimination against indigenous peoples in the media, in developing 
national strategies or plans of action to combat racial discrimination, and in addressing 
inequalities faced by members of indigenous communities in the enjoyment of their rights.  It 
also drew attention to the issue of access to justice for indigenous peoples and their difficulties in 
accessing common law courts. 
</p>
<p>7. CERD recommended that States parties adopt policies to eliminate racism against 
indigenous peoples; undertake special measures to recognize and protect the rights of indigenous 
peoples to own, develop control and use their communal lands and territories; and compensate 
indigenous peoples affected by development projects on their lands.  The Committee also 
underlined the necessity of undertaking impact assessments prior to authorizing projects on lands 
occupied by indigenous peoples and commented on the rights of indigenous peoples to carry out 
their traditional economic activities. 
</p>
<p>8. The Human Rights Committee addressed indigenous issues in its concluding 
observations to Australia, Canada, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Honduras, Norway, 
Paraguay and the United States of America under the Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Among its concerns, the Committee raised the issues of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>high rates of domestic violence committed against indigenous women; discrimination in health, 
employment and education; the decline of indigenous languages; as well as the persistent 
marginalization and persecution of indigenous peoples and the possible negative impacts of 
extractive industry projects taking place on lands occupied by indigenous peoples.  The 
Committee recommended to certain States parties that they review their policies with regard to 
indigenous peoples, in order to preserve their cultural identity and give them greater influence in 
decisions affecting their natural environment and means of subsistence.  It also stressed the 
obligation of States parties to seek the informed consent of indigenous communities before 
adopting decisions affecting them, and to provide an effective restitution of ancestral lands. 
</p>
<p>9. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights addressed indigenous rights in 
its concluding observations to Canada and Mexico.  The Committee noted the progress made in 
Canada with regard to reducing disparities between indigenous peoples and the rest of the 
population, including decreasing rates of infant mortality and better access to secondary 
education, but remained concerned about persisting disparities, especially in the areas of poverty, 
access to water, health, literacy, housing and education. 
</p>
<p>10. The Committee on the Rights of the Child (CRC) addressed indigenous rights in its 
concluding observations to Colombia, Congo, Mexico, Peru and Thailand.  CRC raised the 
concern of stigmatization of and discrimination against indigenous children and noted that 
indigenous children continue to confront serious challenges and threats to the enjoyment of their 
rights.  It considered that rights-based policies to protect indigenous children were insufficiently 
applied.  It identified as concerns:  high infant and maternal mortality rates; low quality of life; 
malnutrition; low birth registration; physical and sexual abuse of children within and outside the 
family; occurrences of sexual exploitation and trafficking; child labour; regional disparities in 
access to health-care and education services, including insufficient bilingual intercultural 
education in indigenous areas; displacement of indigenous children; and environmental health 
problems mainly affecting indigenous children and arising from contamination by extractive 
industries. 
</p>
<p>11. CRC noted the efforts undertaken by some States parties to recognize the collective land 
rights of indigenous peoples and to increase their quality of education and notably welcomed in 
the Congo the establishment of the Inter-Ministerial Committee to coordinate actions on issues 
related to indigenous people.  CRC recommended to States parties that they increase their efforts 
and take affirmative action to prevent discrimination against indigenous children.  It also 
recommended that they provide indigenous children with special protection, including measures 
to address the gap in life opportunities; protect the rights of indigenous peoples to preserve their 
historical and cultural identity and customs, traditions and language; secure the physical integrity 
of indigenous peoples including children; disseminate information on legal policies in 
indigenous languages; and promote bilingual education. 
</p>
<p>12. In 2006, CRC adopted general comment No. 7 on implementing child rights in early 
childhood, which includes a reference to indigenous children and calls upon States parties to 
ensure that children, and particularly indigenous children, are granted full access to health-care 
and education services.  During the year, the Committee continued its consultations with 
indigenous representatives and other experts regarding a general comment on indigenous 
children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>13. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women made reference to 
indigenous peoples in its concluding observations to Australia, Guatemala, Guyana, Mexico, the 
Philippines, Thailand and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of).  The Committee expressed 
concerns about discrimination against indigenous women and pointed out the particular 
prevalence of domestic violence and sexual assaults against indigenous women, high rates of 
poverty, lack of access to adequate health services and education, and problems of access to 
justice.  The Committee stressed the need to adopt measures to accelerate the improvement 
of the conditions of indigenous women in all spheres of life.  It further recommended that 
priority attention be accorded to the effective enforcement and monitoring of legislation on 
domestic violence and to ensuring that women, including indigenous women, have access to 
immediate means of protection.  The Committee stressed the underrepresentation of indigenous 
women in political and public life and recommended that the number of indigenous women in 
decision-making positions in society be increased. 
</p>
<p>14. The Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of 
Their Families in its comments to Mexico noted the particular situation of indigenous migrants 
and women migrants, who suffer from dual discrimination in the enjoyment of their economic, 
social and cultural rights, and are more vulnerable to violations and abuse than other groups. 
</p>
<p><b>II. </b> <b>SPECIAL PROCEDURES 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people will present to the Council a thematic report reviewing and evaluating the 
principal developments affecting indigenous peoples in the course of his six-year mandate.  He 
will also present reports of country missions to Ecuador and Kenya and a study on good practice 
in relation to the follow-up to his recommendations.  The reports of the Special Rapporteur are 
contained in documents A/HRC/4/32 and Add.1-4.  As is pointed out by the Special Rapporteur 
in his report, one of the impacts of establishing a special procedure on indigenous peoples has 
been to stimulate awareness of indigenous issues among other human rights mechanisms and 
consequently increased attention in their thematic and country reports. 
</p>
<p>16. Indigenous issues have been taken up by other special procedure mandate holders 
including the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living; the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography; the Special Rapporteur on the right to education; the Special Rapporteur on 
extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; the Special Rapporteur on the right to food; the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health; the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and 
lawyers; the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, 
xenophobia and related intolerance; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism; the Special Rapporteur on 
the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and 
wastes on the enjoyment of human rights; the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences; the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression; the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances; the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders; the Representative of the</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on human rights of internally displaced persons; and the Special 
Representative on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living has linked the issue of adequate housing to the right to land and access to 
natural resources and recommended that States provide legal recognition of collective-based 
property rights.  The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography has noted that indigenous children are among the groups more exposed to 
trafficking and sexual exploitation, mainly because of social exclusion and discrimination.  The 
Special Rapporteur on the right to food has given extensive attention to indigenous perspectives, 
noting that indigenous peoples often see their subsistence activities such as hunting, fishing and 
gathering as essential to nurturing their culture and identity.  He also observes that levels of 
hunger and malnutrition among indigenous peoples are often disproportionately higher than 
among non-indigenous populations.  Among the recommendations he addresses to Governments 
is the need to recognize rights to land, resources and traditional subsistence activities, as well as 
intellectual property rights over genetic and knowledge resources.  The Special Rapporteur on 
contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance draws 
attention to the disadvantages and exclusion faced by indigenous peoples in several of his 
country reports, linking the phenomenon to prevailing levels of poverty, the legacy of 
colonialism and weak protection of land rights. 
</p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism notes that some States are applying definitions 
of terrorism that are designed in bad faith to outlaw political opposition, religious entities, or 
minority, indigenous or autonomy movements that have never resorted to violence against 
persons.  The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences in one 
of her country reports calls for funding for vocational training, adult literacy, credit schemes and 
provision of incentives for the employment of indigenous women to combat gender 
discrimination and violence emanating from it. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights 
defenders has, over the period of the mandate, sent 80 communications on human rights 
defenders working to promote and protect the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities.  
Several of these communications have been sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people.  The majority of these 
cases are concerned with indigenous peoples involved in struggles over land rights and rights to 
use and freely dispose of their natural wealth and resources.  The majority of such cases are 
reported from countries in Latin America (39 cases) and Asia (19 cases).  She has also expressed 
concern about human rights defenders being prosecuted under anti-terrorism legislation. 
</p>
<p>20. The independent expert for the study on violence against children has also acknowledged 
the special vulnerability of indigenous children and has called upon States to ensure that these 
children and their families are provided with culturally based support and care services, and that 
social workers have adequate training to work effectively with them. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. DRAFT UNITED NATIONS DECLARATION ON THE 
RIGHTS OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES 
</b></p>
<p>21. The eleventh session of the intersessional working group on the draft United Nations 
declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples was held from 5 to 16 December 2005 and 
30 January to 3 February 2006.  During the session 16 preambular paragraphs and 21 articles of 
the declaration were provisionally adopted by consensus; the remaining provisions did not enjoy 
support from all delegations.  The Chairperson-Rapporteur undertook to present his own 
proposals to the Commission on Human Rights, drawing on the different suggestions made by 
delegations, as a compromise text.  On 29 June 2006 in resolution 2006/2, the Human Rights 
Council adopted the declaration as elaborated by the Chairperson-Rapporteur with 30 votes in 
favour, 2 against and 12 abstentions.  On 28 November 2006, the Third Committee of the 
General Assembly adopted the amendments proposed by Namibia, on behalf of the Group of 
African States, to the draft resolution on the United Nations declaration on the rights of 
indigenous peoples by a vote of 82 in favour, 67 against and 25 abstentions.  By adopting the 
amendments, the Third Committee decided to defer consideration and action on the declaration 
and conclude its considerations before the end of the sixty-first session of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.</b>  <b>WORKING GROUP ON INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>22. The twenty-fourth session of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations was held 
from 31 July to 4 August 2006 with a focus on the utilization for military purposes of the lands 
of indigenous people by non-indigenous authorities, groups or individuals.  It also reviewed a set 
of draft principles and guidelines on the protection of the heritage of indigenous peoples and 
requested that OHCHR hold consultations and produce a final draft of the guidelines.  The 
Working Group also analysed the paper &#8220;Legal commentary on the concept of free, prior and 
informed consent&#8221; and recommended that OHCHR organize a technical workshop on the issue.  
The report of the Working Group (A/HRC/Sub.1/58/22) contains proposals to the Human Rights 
Council on a possible future mechanism to protect and promote the human rights of indigenous 
peoples which, together with its other recommendations, are for the consideration of the Council.  
A total of 583 participants were accredited to the twenty-fourth session of the Working Group.  
Documentation relating to the Working Group is contained on the OHCHR website 
(http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/groups/groups-01.htm). 
</p>
<p><b>V</b>.  <b>SEMINARS 
</b></p>
<p>23. OHCHR organized three seminars on indigenous themes during 2006.  The expert 
seminar on indigenous peoples&#8217; permanent sovereignty over natural resources and their 
relationship to land, organized at the request of the Economic and Social Council, was held in 
Geneva from 25-27 January 2006.  In its report (E/CN.4/Sub.2/AC.4/2006/3) the expert 
seminar recommends that States take legislative and administrative measures to ensure 
that indigenous peoples enjoy ownership of and benefit from their natural resources and 
manage and conserve those resources in accordance with their own laws and institutions.  
Documentation relating to the seminar is available on the OHCHR website 
(http://www.ohchr.org/english/issues/indigenous/sovereignty.htm). 
</p>
<p>24. On 14 to 17 November 2006, OHCHR organized an expert seminar on treaties, 
agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples on </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Maskwacis Cree Territory, Alberta.  More than 470 participants attended the meeting, including 
a large number of community-based indigenous representatives that live in treaty areas in 
the country.  Among the conclusions and recommendations made by the participants was 
the proposal to research and preserve oral histories, traditional knowledge and cultural 
understanding of treaties; a suggestion that the Human Rights Council include a consideration of 
treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements between States and indigenous peoples 
in its universal periodic review process; and a recommendation that further information be 
gathered on treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements in Asia and Africa. 
</p>
<p>25. The question of indigenous peoples living in isolation or voluntary isolation has been 
raised in various forums, including the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, as well as by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people.  In response to a recommendation 
made by the Permanent Forum, OHCHR in cooperation with the Government of Bolivia, the 
Bolivian Confederacy of Indigenous Peoples and the International Working Group for 
Indigenous Affairs organized a regional seminar on indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation 
and in initial contact of the Amazonian Basin and El Chaco, in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, from 20 
to 22 November 2006.  Participants reached an agreement and approved by consensus the 
&#8220;Llamamiento de Santa Cruz&#8221;, a nine-page document with more than 50 specific 
recommendations for States, international organizations and civil society.  The document reflects 
the high level of vulnerability of these isolated peoples and the need for urgent action.  
Participants made recommendations in relation to the principle of non-contact, the importance of 
protecting their lands and territories from trespass, the prohibition of damaging economic 
activities in the lands and territories of those peoples, and the importance of international and 
regional cooperation for their protection.  The report and the Llamamiento de Santa Cruz will be 
submitted to the sixth session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  TECHNICAL COOPERATION/COUNTRY ENGAGEMENT 
</b></p>
<p>26. Regional consultations held by OHCHR in preparation for its 2006-2007 programme 
identified indigenous peoples as an important, and in some regions, critical issue for inclusion in 
technical cooperation activities.  Hence, over the period, country offices and human rights 
advisers have incorporated projects addressing the human rights situation of indigenous peoples.  
Activities related to indigenous peoples have been or are being undertaken by OHCHR staff in a 
number of countries including Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Congo, Ecuador, 
Guatemala, Kenya, Mexico and Nepal.  In two countries, specific programmes to follow up on 
the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples are in place.  OHCHR provides a thematic unit to 
support mainstreaming of indigenous issues to both the human rights mechanisms and country 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>27. In Mexico, a programme for indigenous peoples is being implemented as a follow-up to 
the official visit of the Special Rapporteur to the country in 2003.  Activities include training of 
civil servants from the executive and judicial branches on human rights instruments and 
protection mechanisms relating to indigenous people, cooperation with the National Commission 
on the Development of Indigenous People, and informational programmes in human rights 
through a nationwide radio campaign on the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and other 
international protection mechanisms in more than 20 different indigenous languages.  OHCHR is </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>also implementing training activities to enhance the capacity of indigenous community 
organizations and local leaders to claim their rights and to monitor the implementation of 
international recommendations on indigenous people, with a special focus on the rights of 
indigenous women.  In this context, OHCHR has engaged in comprehensive research on the 
specific situation of the rights of indigenous women, and the results of this work are expected 
in 2007. 
</p>
<p>28. A project on access to justice for indigenous peoples has just been completed.  It provides 
an analysis, among other matters, of how indigenous customs and norms are taken into account 
in cases in the State justice system, the availability of interpreters or translators in indigenous 
languages and practices regarding the right to physical security and integrity.  The study also 
interviewed over 1,000 prisoners, of whom two thirds were indigenous, reviewed court files and 
interviewed judges, defence and prosecution attorneys, as well as indigenous authorities.  The 
study, which will soon be made public, makes various practical recommendations for action to 
implement human rights for indigenous peoples in the Mexican context. 
</p>
<p>29. Training workshops have been conducted with state and federal public defenders and 
judges in the states of Guerrero and Queretaro, and a study on litigation strategies to implement 
indigenous rights in Mexico is being prepared.  OHCHR has organized training activities for 
lawyers and anthropologists to strengthen multidisciplinary approaches for the implementation 
of indigenous rights in the criminal justice context.  It is likely that the report findings will form 
part of the mandatory training programme for staff of the office of the federal Public Defender 
in 2007. 
</p>
<p>30. In Guatemala, the visit of the Special Rapporteur from 15 to 17 May 2006 made a major 
impact.  The visit created opportunities for renewing contacts with key actors, officials, and 
representatives of civil society and indigenous communities, and contributed to a constructive 
dialogue, allowing for an analysis of the progress made and of the continuing challenges in 
relation to implementation of the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur following 
his mission in 2002.  As part of the follow up to his visit, OHCHR has undertaken activities with 
the Presidential Commission to Combat Discrimination and Racism against the Indigenous 
Peoples in Guatemala and provided assistance to the Office of the Ombudsperson for Indigenous 
Women to elaborate a report on &#8220;Access by indigenous women to administration of justice in 
Guatemala&#8221;.  OHCHR will be involved in disseminating the report and its recommendations.  
The project also includes a strategy to promote affirmative action for the education of indigenous 
women. 
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR in Colombia notes that indigenous peoples, in particular indigenous women, 
face serious human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law, as a result 
of the continuing internal armed conflict, the insecurity and the impact of massive projects in 
their territories.  During the year, OHCHR continued monitoring the human rights situation of 
indigenous communities and particularly communities which are facing a serious risk of 
extinction, such as the Nukak Mak&#250; of the department of Guaviare.  In collaboration with other 
agencies of the United Nations system, OHCHR assisted the National Indigenous Organization 
of Colombia (ONIC), which organized an international verification mission to five regions of the 
country.  The objective of the mission was to look into the humanitarian and human rights 
situation of the indigenous population and in particular to follow up on the recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>indigenous people.  OHCHR is currently increasing its focus on discrimination issues through 
support to NGOs by providing them with monitoring tools.  OHCHR has also advised the Office 
of the Ombudsman on drafting legislation and on creating a national action plan against 
discrimination.  A module on the rights of indigenous peoples has been included in the training 
provided to United Nations human rights country teams.  Given the importance of land issues, 
and especially in areas which are rich in natural resources, OHCHR in Colombia is preparing a 
technical cooperation project documenting cases of disputes and seeking, through the relevant 
governmental ministries, respect for the principle of informed consent prior to development 
projects affecting the community. 
</p><p>32. The technical cooperation programme for indigenous peoples and Afro-descendants in 
Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru (the Andean programme) has realized a number of activities in 
Ecuador including human rights training and preparations for the visit of the Special Rapporteur 
(from 25 April to 5 May 2006), through publications and the organization of meetings as well as 
cooperation with the office of the human rights Ombudsman and civil society partners.  The 
Andean programme has ensured a human rights approach to indigenous issues in the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) office, where OHCHR was instrumental in 
establishing an inter-agency group on indigenous peoples and afro-descendants, initiating a paid 
internship for an indigenous person, and bringing to a successful conclusion the participatory 
mechanism for indigenous organizations with UNDP/United Nations Country Team (UNCT).  
The Ecuador office also recruited a former member of the OHCHR Indigenous Fellowship 
Programme as a consultant, in line with OHCHR policy of employing indigenous experts 
whenever possible, and in particular former Fellowship Programme members.  During 2007, the 
focus of the Andean programme will be in Bolivia where OHCHR is finalizing the opening of 
an office.  OHCHR has also initiated, in cooperation with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF) regional office, and the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), 
a study on best practices and obstacles regarding the implementation of the thematic 
recommendations of the Special Rapporteur in Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru.  The study will also 
pay particular attention to the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and 
the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women concerning indigenous 
women and children in these countries.  The study, which is expected to be concluded in 2007, 
aims at promoting the mainstreaming of the recommendations of human rights mechanisms in 
policymaking and United Nations programming, including the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>33. During 2006, the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean strengthened 
contacts with several indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations and supported the seminar 
&#8220;Globalization, human rights and indigenous peoples&#8221;, held in Santiago on 28-29 November 2006. 
Moreover, the Regional Office included the follow-up of the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur in the Action 2 inter-agency project which is to be implemented during 2007 by the 
United Nations Country Team in Chile (Strengthening the capacity of UNCT Chile to promote 
and protect human rights). 
</p>
<p>34. OHCHR assisted the Government of the Republic of the Congo jointly with ILO to 
organize consultations to draft a new law on indigenous peoples.  The draft law draws on ILO 
Convention 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples and the draft United Nations declaration on the 
rights of indigenous peoples and is scheduled to be presented to the Parliament at its next 
session. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>35. In response to a request for technical assistance support from OHCHR Nepal, a needs 
assessment mission was undertaken in Nepal from 21 to 25 August 2005 to identify protection 
and empowerment gaps in support of Dalits and other national minorities, as well as indigenous 
peoples.  The main objectives of the mission were to contribute to the development of an 
integrated OHCHR Nepal policy and of strategies on issues of long-standing discrimination; to 
build the capacity of OHCHR staff in the regions on Dalit and ethnic issues; to carry out 
discussions and assess with affected communities their experience of State responses to 
problems of discrimination at the community level, and to explore and contribute to practical 
remedies for discrimination at the grass-roots level.  The mission paid particular attention to the 
situation of women and in this context a specific workshop to hear the voices of the Tharu 
women was organized in Nepalgunj in the Bardiya Banke District. 
</p><p>36. OHCHR also funded and participated in a training workshop for indigenous 
representatives of Cambodia held from 8 to 10 July 2006 in Phnom Penh in cooperation with 
the Asia Indigenous Peoples Pact Foundation.  Thirteen participants from various organizations 
and regions, including Ratanikiri, were given the opportunity to exchange experiences on issues 
such as land concessions and natural resource management.  Issues were discussed in light of 
the provisions of the draft United Nations declaration of the rights of indigenous peoples, the 
jurisprudence of the United Nations Treaty Bodies but also national laws and regulations which 
were not being enforced.  The training was conceived for local trainers who in turn provided 
another human rights training session in the region in November 2006.  OHCHR Cambodia also 
conducted a field visit to Ratanikiri with the objective of gathering general information about 
land issues, in particular issues affecting indigenous populations, economic land concessions and 
mining concessions. 
</p>
<p>37. Human Rights Strengthening (HURIST) is a joint programme of UNDP and OHCHR 
aimed at integrating human rights in development by building the capacity of UNDP country 
offices, preparing methodologies and toolkits on human rights and commenting on and 
disseminating good practices in the application of human rights in development.  HURIST also 
includes an indigenous component whose objectives are to contribute to the implementation of 
the UNDP policy of engagement with indigenous peoples and to create forums for dialogue at 
the national level to ensure participation of indigenous peoples in UNDP (and eventually UNCT) 
activities at both the policy and programme levels.  The underlying purpose of the programme is 
to promote the full participation of indigenous peoples in the planning, implementation and 
evaluation of projects that affect them.  The pilot programme component on indigenous peoples 
was concluded in December 2006, having established participatory consultative mechanisms in 
Bolivia, Ecuador and Kenya. 
</p>
<p><b>VII.  INDIGENOUS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAMME 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Indigenous Fellowship Programme (IFP) remains an important means of 
strengthening civil society.  In 2006, a total of 20 indigenous representatives (including 
11 women and 9 men) participated in the four linguistic components of the Indigenous 
Fellowship Programme (English, Spanish, French and Russian).  Communities and countries 
represented were:  Khomani San (South Africa), Chamling (Nepal), Arrente Clan (Aboriginal of 
Australia), Wayuu and Arhuaco (Colombia), Ogiek (Kenya), Miskitu (Nicaragua), Shuar 
(Ecuador), Maya (Guatemala), Amazigh (Morocco), Batwa (Burundi), Touareg (Algeria),  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Pygmy (Republic of the Congo), Udege, Dolgan, Shor and Veps (Russian Federation).  
In December 2006, an evaluation of the Indigenous Fellowship Programme was carried out by 
OHCHR.  The evaluation underlined the importance of the programme to indigenous peoples 
and its multiplier effect.  All those responding had undertaken training with their own 
communities and many had subsequently made use of the human rights mechanisms.  Some have 
subsequently taken up leadership positions, others have participated in expert seminars or were 
involved in negotiating with legislative bodies, and some had worked with UNCTs. 
</p>
<p><b>VIII.  VOLUNTARY FUND 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations assisted 46 indigenous representatives to 
attend the fifth session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues in New York (for a sum of 
US$ 244,000) and 50 representatives to attend the twenty-fourth session of the Working Group 
on Indigenous Populations (for a sum of US$ 148,900).  Further information is available in the 
report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the General Assembly on 
the status of the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Indigenous Populations (A/61/376). 
</p>
<p><b>IX.  PARTNERSHIP AND COOPERATION 
</b></p>
<p>40. Over the past years, inter-agency cooperation on indigenous peoples has grown, 
stimulated by the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues which is mandated to contribute to 
coordination of the United Nations system on indigenous issues.  The broadening of the 
membership of the Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues (IASG) to some 
30 United Nations agencies signifies an institutional commitment to promote greater integration 
of indigenous questions into country programmes.  In the course of the year, OHCHR undertook 
several activities with United Nations partners.  These activities included participation in the 
Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues, which in 2006 was organized by the 
International Fund for Agricultural Development and focused on a review of policies and 
programmes relating to indigenous lands and resources.  The decision by the United Nations 
Development Group to invite the IASG to develop guidelines for integrating indigenous issues 
into country programmes gives an opportunity to OHCHR and its partners to raise the visibility 
of indigenous questions, including the concern that efforts to implement the Millennium 
Development Goals are largely bypassing indigenous communities.  OHCHR and ILO were 
invited by IASG to elaborate the first outline for the guidelines. 
</p>
<p>41. OHCHR participated in the fifth session of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 
held from 15 to 26 May 2006 with a principal theme of the Millennium Development Goals and 
indigenous peoples and a discussion day on indigenous peoples in Africa.  Both the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples 
and the Chairperson/Rapporteur of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations took part 
and 10 members of the Indigenous Fellowship Programme were also present. 
</p>
<p>42. Prior to the session of the Permanent Forum, OHCHR contributed to an expert workshop 
on indigenous peoples organized by the International Organization for Migration and the 
secretariat of the Permanent Forum in Geneva from 6 to 7 April 2006.  The meeting brought 
together over 30 participants who agreed on a number of recommendations covering three main  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>areas:  State responsibility; information sharing; and the role of international organizations and 
United Nations agencies in addressing the nexus between indigenous peoples and migration.  
The recommendations addressed the need to recognize the broad impact on society of the 
migration of indigenous peoples, including positive as well as negative effects, and the urgency 
of strengthening the implementation of existing laws to protect indigenous migrants. 
</p>
<p>43. On 15 May 2006, the Programme of Action of the Second International Decade of the 
World&#8217;s Indigenous People was launched in New York.  The objectives of the Decade include 
the promotion of indigenous peoples in the design, implementation and evaluation of 
international, regional and national processes regarding laws, policies, resources, programmes 
and projects, as well as their full and effective participation in decisions which directly or 
indirectly affect their lifestyles, traditional lands and territories and their cultural integrity, 
considering the principle of free, prior and informed consent.  Among the recommendations of 
the Programme of Action relating to human rights, it is proposed that a global mechanism be 
established to monitor the situation of indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation or in danger of 
extinction; that human rights treaty monitoring bodies and thematic and country-specific 
mechanisms continue to address indigenous issues within their mandates; that educational 
programmes on the human rights of indigenous peoples be developed and strengthened, 
including the current Indigenous Fellowship Programme of OHCHR, in indigenous languages 
where possible, including relevant training materials that are culturally appropriate and should 
advocate against stereotypes and ethnic stigmatization; and that cooperation be developed with 
the Working Group on the Rights of Indigenous Populations/Communities in Africa of the 
African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, with a view to enhancing the 
understanding of indigenous issues in Africa. 
</p>
<p><b>X.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>A review of the Treaty Bodies and special procedures suggests that indigenous 
issues are largely integrated into their work.  This may be attributed to a number of factors 
that include the greater visibility, sensitivity and interest of these mechanisms brought 
about by the discussions on the draft United Nations declaration on the rights of indigenous 
peoples, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous peoples, the presence throughout much of the year of indigenous 
persons within the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) through 
the Indigenous Fellowship Programme, and the building of human rights capacity over 
many years that have stimulated interest by indigenous organizations in using human 
rights mechanisms.  As indicated in the report, activities relating to indigenous peoples are 
increasingly included in OHCHR country programmes. 
</b></p>
<p>45. <b>OHCHR is active in inter-agency cooperation to mainstream indigenous issues into 
programmes and projects.  The invitation by the United Nations Development Group to the 
Inter-Agency Support Group on Indigenous Issues to prepare guidelines on indigenous 
peoples, as well as a workplan for country-level activities will signal further integration of 
indigenous issues into the work of the United Nations.  The pilot indigenous component of 
the joint OHCHR/UNDP Human Rights Strengthening programme was successfully  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>concluded in December 2006, having established forums for consultation between 
indigenous peoples and United Nations country teams in three countries.  It is expected that 
these forums will provide opportunities for indigenous representatives to contribute to the 
programming cycle. 
</b></p>
<p>46. <b>States have increasingly taken an interest in indigenous issues and have 
acknowledged the need for universal standards on the rights of indigenous peoples, as 
witnessed by the discussions around the draft United Nations declaration on the rights of 
indigenous peoples.  The violations and exclusion faced by indigenous peoples justify the 
continuing concern of the international community and Human Rights Council.
