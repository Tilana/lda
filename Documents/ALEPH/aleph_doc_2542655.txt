ITEM 1.01         ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
On March 2, 2005, Dolphin Energy Corporation ("Dolphin"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Galaxy Energy Corporation ("Galaxy"), deposited $7,000,000 in
escrow as a condition precedent to an agreement to acquire an initial 58-1/3%
working interest in 4,000 net undeveloped mineral acres in the Piceance Basin in
Colorado. The terms of the acquisition are set forth in a Lease Acquisition and
Development Agreement with Apollo Energy LLC and ATEC Energy Ventures, LLC, the
Sellers. The Sellers were not willing to enter into the Agreement with Dolphin
without having some agreement regarding the remaining 41-2/3% working interest
in the subject properties. Since the management of Galaxy and its advisers had
previously decided that its maximum commitment should not exceed that provided
in the Agreement, it was necessary to find a third party to take the remaining
working interest, and Marc A. Bruner was willing to provide a guaranteed payment
of $2,000,000 to the Sellers and enter into an agreement with the Sellers to
acquire a 16-1/3% working interest for such $2,000,000 with the option to
acquire up to all of the then remaining 25% working interest in the subject
properties by investing an additional $3,000,000. If Mr. Bruner invests the
entire $5,000,000, his total working interest in the properties will be 41-2/3%.
Mr. Bruner and Dolphin entered into a Participation Agreement to address certain
rights and obligations as between them, pertaining to their acquisition
agreements with the Sellers. Marc A. Bruner is a significant shareholder of
Galaxy Energy Corporation, Chairman of Galaxy's Advisory Committee, and the
father of Marc E. Bruner, the president and a director of Galaxy.
Dolphin and Mr. Bruner entered into an Amended Participation Agreement dated
March 16, 2005, which set forth greater detail as to the performance by each
party and which specifically allowed Mr. Bruner to assign all of his rights and
obligations under the Amended Participation Agreement to Exxel Energy
Corporation, a British Columbia corporation. The Amended Participation Agreement
superseded the original Participation Agreement.
Under the Amended Participation Agreement, Marc A. Bruner had the right, but not
the obligation to deposit up to an additional $25,000,000 into escrow on or
before August 1, 2005, while Dolphin has the right, but not the obligation, to
deposit up to an additional $3,000,000 into escrow on or before December 1,
2005. Dolphin and Mr. Bruner have agreed that their respective ownership
interests shall be based upon the amounts deposited into escrow and used to
acquire the leases. Therefore, if both Dolphin and Mr. Bruner contribute their
maximum amounts, their ownership interests in the leases will be Dolphin 25% and
Bruner 75%.
On May 24, 2005, Exxel Energy Corporation and Dolphin entered into a Second
Amendment to Participation Agreement that extended from August 1, 2005 to
December 1, 2005, the date by which the deposit described above would have to be
made.
On October 4, 2005, Exxel Energy Corporation and Dolphin entered into a Third
Amendment to Participation Agreement that capped Dolphin's contribution at the
$7,000,000 already contributed and committed Exxel to contribute $21,000,000, in
total. These funds can be used for both acreage acquisition and operations.
Dolphin shall own a 25% working interest in the acquired acreage, while Exxel
will own a 75% working interest.

<PAGE>
In addition, Exxel has agreed to advance $1,000,000 within five business days of
Dolphin providing a proposed drilling contract for the initial test wells on the
acreage and an additional $1,000,000 within 30 days thereafter.
Under the acquisition agreements with the Sellers, Dolphin and Mr. Bruner are
obligated to drill one well by November 1, 2005 and nine additional wells by
August 22, 2006. If they should fail to drill any of the nine wells, they are
obligated to pay Sellers $500,000 for each well as liquidated damages or they
are to reassign to Sellers any of the acreage covered by the leases that remains
undrilled.
On May 31, 2005, the Sellers and Dolphin entered into an amendment to the Lease
Acquisition and Development Agreement that extended from November 1, 2005 to
December 31, 2005, the date by which the first well must be drilled.
Dolphin and Mr. Bruner have agreed that each shall be responsible for its/his
respective share of the cost of operations in accordance with the terms of the
operating agreement, with such share based on the ownership interest at the time
the cost is incurred.
Dolphin and Mr. Bruner had agreed that for the first 36 months of operations
under the operating agreement, Bruner would assign all of his rights and
obligations as operator, such that Dolphin would be the contract operator or
sub-operator under the operating agreement, and that Dolphin would be entitled
to a management fee of 10% of its costs as operator. Under the terms of the
Third Amendment to Participation Agreement, Exxel is being designated as
operator, but with Dolphin undertaking operations as sub-operator until March
16, 2008. Dolphin shall be entitled to a management fee of 10% of its costs as
sub-operator.
Funding for Dolphin's share of acquisition and project costs has been financed
through a private placement of $7,695,000 in senior subordinated convertible
notes due June 1, 2007. As of March 1, 2005, Galaxy had entered into Securities
Purchase Agreements with several accredited investors (the "Investors") pursuant
to which Galaxy agreed to sell, and the Investors agreed to purchase, in the
aggregate, up to $7,695,000 principal amount of Senior Subordinated Convertible
Notes and three-year warrants to purchase 1,637,234 shares of common stock at
$1.88 per share. The notes may be converted by the holders into shares of common
stock at a price of $1.88 per share.
Galaxy agreed to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in order to register the resale of the shares issuable upon
conversion of the notes and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants.
That registration statement was declared effective October 3, 2005.
This summary description of the financing described by the agreements does not
purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form
of the agreements and other documents that are filed as Exhibits hereto.
The press release issued by Galaxy on October 6, 2005 relating to the Third
Amendment to Participation Agreement is filed as Exhibit 99.2.

West  Hastings  Street,  11th  Floor,  Vancouver,   British  Columbia,  V6B  4W4
("Exxel"). Dolphin and Exxel may be referred to herein individually as a "Party"
and collectively as the "Parties."
RECITALS
A. Dolphin entered into that certain Lease  Acquisition and Development
Agreement,  dated February 22, 2005 with Apollo Energy,  LLC ("Apollo") and ATEC
Energy Ventures, LLC ("ATEC").
B. Exxel is a party to that certain Lease  Acquisition  and Development
Agreement,  dated  February  23,  2005 with  Apollo and ATEC (the  "Exxel/Apollo
Agreement").  The  Dolphin/Apollo  Agreement and the Exxel/Apollo  Agreement are
referred to herein collectively as the "Apollo Agreements."
C. Exxel (as successor in interest to Marc A. Bruner) and Dolphin,  are
parties to that certain  Participation  Agreement,  dated  February 23, 2005, as
amended by the Amended  Participation  Agreement,  dated March 16, 2005, and the
Second Amendment to Participation  Agreement,  dated May 24, 2005, each of which
are related to the Apollo Agreements.  The Participation  Agreement, the Amended
Participation Agreement, and the Second Amendment to Participation Agreement are
collectively referred to herein as the "Original Participation Agreement."
D. The Parties desire to amend the Original Participation  Agreement as
set forth herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties agree as follows:
1.  SECTION 3.  Section 3 of the  Original Participation  Agreement  is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
3.   EXXEL  ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL  CONTRIBUTION.  In  addition to the
         $5 million initial capital contributed  pursuant to Section 2(b), Exxel
         deposited  into the Escrow  Account Two Million  Dollars  ($2,000,000).
         Further,  notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  in the  Operating
         Agreement,  and subject to Section 5, below, Exxel shall pay all of the
         costs and expenses under the Apollo Agreements until Exxel has expended
         Fourteen  Million  Dollars  ($14,000,000)  of acquisition and operating
         costs in  connection  with the Apollo  Agreements,  in  addition to the
         above-described  $7 million  previously  contributed by Exxel. No later

         rig for the first test wells under the Apollo  Agreements,  and to meet
         any other immediate  commitments  necessary to move forward promptly on
         development activities under the Apollo Agreements). Within thirty (30)
         days thereafter,  Exxel shall deposit an additional One Million Dollars
         ($1,000,000)  to the Escrow Account (with all amounts to be credited to

<PAGE>
2.  SECTION 4.  Section 4 of the Original  Participation  Agreement  is
hereby  deleted in its entirety and not replaced.
3.  SECTION 5.  Section 5 of the Original  Participation  Agreement  is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
5.  OWNERSHIP INTERESTS.  Dolphin shall  own a  twenty-five percent
         (25%) undivided working interest in all of the Leases acquired pursuant
         to the Apollo Agreements.  Exxel shall own a seventy-five percent (75%)
         undivided  working  interest in all of the Leases acquired  pursuant to
         the Apollo  Agreements.  Commencing  September 1, 2005,  and continuing
         thereafter,  the  Parties  shall  execute  all  assignments  and  other
         documents and take any other action necessary to result in said 75%/25%
         ownership interest being reflected in the public records and applicable
         government  files with respect to all Leases  acquired under the Apollo
         Agreements  and within  the AMI.  Provided,  however,  in the event the
         Parties  enter into an amendment or  termination  of the  Participation
         Agreement,  as amended,  and/or the  Parties  and Apollo  enter into an
         amendment or termination of the Apollo Agreements, thereby resulting in
         a total  expenditure by Exxel (for acquisitions and operations) that is
         less than said additional $14 million (referenced in Section 3, above),
         the Parties shall execute all  assignments and other documents and take
         any other action necessary to adjust the percentage working interest to
         reflect the actual respective investment made by each Party,  including
         within such calculation of "the actual respective  investment" and such
         adjustment the net revenues,  if any,  received by each Party up to the
         effective date of such assignments.
4.  SECTION 6(A). Section 6(a) of the Original Participation  Agreement
is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
6(a)   SHARE  OF  COSTS.   Subject  to   Section  3,   above,   and
         notwithstanding  the  actual  dates of  signing  and/or  recording  the
         assignments  or cross  assignments  pursuant to Section 5, above,  each
         Party  shall be  responsible  for its  respective  share of all Project
         Costs  (as  defined  in the  Apollo  Agreements),  that is,  all  Lease
         acquisition and operating costs.
5.  SECTION 7(A). Section 7(a) of the Original Participation  Agreement
is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
7(a)  OPERATOR DESIGNATION.  Exxel shall  be designated as Operator
         under the Operating Agreement.  Provided,  however,  subject to Section
         7(c)  below,  Exxel  and  Dolphin  shall  enter  into  a  sub-operating
         agreement  pursuant to which  Dolphin shall be  sub-operator  for three
         years  from  the  date  of  the  first   amendment   to  the   Original
         Participation  Agreement (March 16, 2005). The sub-operating  agreement
         shall  provide  for  Dolphin,   as  sub-operator,   to  have  the  same
         obligations as the Operator has pursuant to the Operating Agreement. As
sub-operator,  Dolphin shall use its best efforts to cause commencement
         of the first test well (as  required  pursuant  to  Section  5.1 of the
         Apollo Agreements no later than December 31, 2005, and the commencement
         of drilling of the nine additional test wells required under the Apollo
         Agreements no later than August 22, 2006.
6.  SECTION 7(B).  The  portion of  the first  sentence in Section 7(b)
immediately  prior to Section  7(b)(i) is hereby  amended  and  restated  in its
entirety as follows:  "Notwithstanding
2
220659v2
<PAGE>
anything in the Operating  Agreement to the contrary,  Dolphin shall be entitled
to a management  fee of ten percent  (10%) of its costs as  sub-operator,  which
shall be applied to:"
7.  SECTION 7(C).  Section 7(c) of the Original Participation  Agreement is
hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
7(c)    CHANGE OF  OPERATOR.  Between  September 1 and  September 30 of
     each  year  during  the  term  of the  Operating  Agreement  commencing  in
     September  2006,  if all 10 of the test  wells  required  under the  Apollo
     Agreements  have been  drilled by August  31,  2006,  Exxel  shall have the
     right,  but not the  obligation,  on a one-time basis each year, to provide
     written notice to Dolphin  stating that Exxel elects to replace  Dolphin as
     sub-operator on the basis that Dolphin has not conducted  operations on the
     Leases in a reasonable and prudent  manner and in accordance  with accepted
     industry standards. Said notice shall include the specific basis, including
     relevant documentation,  supporting said determination.  In addition to the
     foregoing,  Dolphin  acknowledges  and  agrees  that it may be  removed  as
     sub-operator: (i) for any reason that the Operator may be removed or deemed
     to have resigned  under the Operating  Agreement,  or (ii) if Galaxy Energy
     Corporation,  Dolphin's parent entity,  becomes  insolvent,  bankrupt or is
     placed in receivership.  If Dolphin does not agree with such determination,
     the Parties  shall submit the issue to binding  arbitration  before a three
     arbitrator   panel  (each  Party  selecting  one  arbitrator  and  the  two
     arbitrators then selecting the third  arbitrator).  Such proceedings  shall
     commence in Denver, Colorado,  within sixty (60) days after Exxel's receipt
     of Dolphin's written objection to said determination, and shall be governed
     by the  rules of the  Judicial  Arbiter  Group,  Inc.  located  in  Denver,
     Colorado ("JAG").
8.  SECTIONS 7(D) AND 7(E).  New Sections 7(d)  and  7(e)  of the  Original
Participation Agreement are hereby added as follows:
7(d)    BUDGET.  The Parties shall use  their best efforts to  meet and
     agree upon a quarterly  budget (the  "Budget"),  with the fourth quarter of
     2005, as the first quarterly Budget, and continuing  quarterly  thereafter.
     Each  such  quarterly  Budget  shall  reflect,  at a  minimum,  the cost of
     operations  that are  required  under the Apollo  Agreements,  and may also
     include  Dolphins  and/or Exxel's  recommendations,  if any, for additional
     operations  and  expenditures.  Each AFE  shall  be  consistent  with  said
     requirements  under  the  Apollo  Agreements.  Acquisition  costs  shall be
     governed solely by the Apollo Agreements and the  Participation  Agreement,
     as amended, and shall not be included in any AFE.
7(e)    PAYMENT PROCESS.  Until Exxel has expended the next $14 million
     as  set  forth  in  Section  3,  above,   the  Parties  shall  process  all
     expenditures in accordance with the following procedure:
(i)  Dolphin shall prepare and provide to Exxel an AFE for  the
     proposed operation;
(ii) Exxel  shall  review  the  AFE  and  either  approve it or
     disapprove it on the basis that such AFE violates an agreed-upon  Budget in
     writing  within  thirty (30) days from  receipt  (with  Exxel's  failure to
     respond within said thirty days being deemed a disapproval);
(iii) If Exxel  approves the AFE,  Dolphin shall have the right
     and option
3
220659v2
<PAGE>
to request that Exxel  advance up to 100% of Exxel's share of such costs in
     order to make payment to third parties.  Early payment  discounts  shall be
     credited to the joint account.
(iv)    If  Exxel  disapproves   the   AFE,   the   non-consent
     provisions of the Operating  Agreement  shall control  (provided,  however,
     that  Dolphin  shall  have  the  right  and  option  to  initiate   binding
     arbitration  procedures  which shall be governed by the rules of the JAG as
     to the validity of the basis for such disapproval);
(v) Upon receipt of funds advanced by Exxel pursuant to Section
     7(e)(iii),  above,  Dolphin shall  segregate  such funds in a separate bank
     account identified as the "Exxel Account," and maintain such funds separate
     from  Dolphin's  operating  capital and from any accounts  unrelated to the
     AFE.  When the funds are needed for  expenditures  in  accordance  with the
     Budget,  Dolphin  shall  transfer  the funds out of the  Exxel  Account  to
     Dolphin's operating account.
(vi)    Dolphin  shall  provide  monthly  statements  to Exxel,
     reflecting the use and application of funds, advanced to the Exxel Account;
(vii)   Upon completion of each  operation,  Exxel  shall  have
     the  option of either  obtaining  a refund of any excess  balance  from the
     advanced  funds,  or applying such balance to amounts owed by Exxel for any
     other outstanding invoice related to the joint operations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Exxel shall not have the right to disapprove
an AFE and go non-consent  under the Operating  Agreement with respect to any of
the ten (10) test wells  required  to be drilled by August 22,  2006,  under the
Apollo Agreements.
9.   DEFINED TERMS. Except as expressly set forth herein, the terms defined
in the Apollo Agreements and the Original Participation Agreement shall have the
same meaning when used herein.
10.  EFFECT OF AMENDMENT.  Except  as  expressly  set  forth  in this Third
Amendment,  the Original Participation  Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.
IN WITNESS  WHEREOF,  the Parties have executed this  Third Amendment as of
the date first above written.

size=2>Denver, Colo. &#150; October 6, 2005 &#150; Galaxy Energy Corporation, 
(OTC Bulletin Board: GAXI) today provided an operations update for its Piceance 
Basin natural gas development project. The Piceance Basin project is the latest 
addition to the Company&#146;s portfolio of unconventional gas projects in the 
Rocky Mountains, Romania and Germany. </font></p>

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:0pt;text-align:left;'><font 
size=2>Galaxy, though its wholly owned subsidiary Dolphin Energy, and Exxel 
Energy Corp., its partner in the project, have accumulated over 5,000 
undeveloped acres since March 2005 at a cost of $14.5 million, which was shared 
about equally. </font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:0pt;text-align:left;'><font 
size=2>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:0pt;text-align:left;'><font size=2>The 
two companies have recently agreed to adjust their interests in the project to 
reflect their original intent giving Galaxy a 25% working interest and Exxel the
remaining 75% working interest. As a result of the amendment, funds contributed 
by the parties can now be employed for both acreage acquisition and operations. 
In addition, Dolphin&#146;s initial contribution is capped at the US$7,000,000 
already contributed to the project by Dolphin, and Exxel is committed to an 
initial contribution of US$21,000,000. Exxel has to date contributed 
US$12,000,000 to the project and the project escrow account, and is required to 
contribute the balance of US$9,000,000 as costs are incurred. To bring capital 
contributions in line with this working interest arrangement, Exxel and the 
project escrow account will fund 100% of the next $14.0 million of expenditures 
for land, drilling, completion and connection costs.
Operatorship has been revised under the amended agreement, with Exxel being 
designated operator, but with Dolphin undertaking operations as contract sub-
operator.</font></p>

158 million cubic feet through July 2005. Current production from this well is 
approximately 15 million cubic feet per month.  Galaxy has a working interest in
the well of about 5.6%, effective with first production and thus will now begin 
to receive first production revenues from its Piceance Basin oil &amp; gas 
properties.</font></p>
