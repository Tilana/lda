<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its sixteenth 
session from 22 April to 3 May 2013. The review of the Federal Republic of Germany was 
held at the 7th meeting, on 25 April 2013. The delegation of Germany was headed by Mr 
Markus L&#246;ning. At its 13th meeting, held on 30 April 2013, the Working Group adopted 
the report on Germany. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Germany: The Republic of the Congo, 
Kuwait and United States of America. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Germany: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph  15 (a) of the annex 
to resolution 5/1 (A/HRC/WG.6/16/DEU/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) Compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) of the annex to resolution 5/1 
(A/HRC/WG.6/16/DEU/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) Summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) of the 
annex to resolution 5/1 (A/HRC/WG.6/16/DEU/3 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Mexico, 
Montenegro, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Germany through the troika. These questions are 
available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The Commissioner for Human Rights Policy and Humanitarian Aid of the Federal 
Foreign Office (Commissioner) stated that the UPR was one of the key human rights 
mechanisms at the global level. Germany looked forward to the recommendations and 
views presented during the review, as well as the opportunity to respond to the questions 
asked. 
</p>
<p>6. As a member of the Human Rights Council, Germany was committed to sparing no 
efforts to promoting and protecting human rights, in accordance with pledges made during 
its candidature. Human rights mattered in Germany &#8211; for civil society as well as the 
Government and public service at all levels. It was noted that Germany had a strong 
institutional framework to protect and promote Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>7. The Government had consulted the German Institute for Human Rights and held a 
public hearing with major human rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs) when 
preparing its national report. In response to an advance question from Norway, the 
Commissioner stated that the public hearing had gone very well and had completed the 
constant exchange between Government and civil society. The Commissioner underscored 
the civil society organizations&#8217; deep understanding of human rights issues, from which the 
</p>
<p>Government was fortunate to benefit. </p>


<p>8. The Commissioner stated that Germany was aware of its deficits regarding the 
realization of human rights, but that all human rights violations and abuses would be 
subject to inquiry and would be taken up as part of the vibrant human rights debate. He 
cited, as an example, the failure of institutions to identify in a timely manner the 
perpetrators of a series of racially motivated murders for several years, the measures taken 
by Government, parliaments and the judiciary to address these failures, and the very intense 
debate on discrimination and racism in German society. 
</p>
<p>9. The Commissioner underlined those efforts made by Germany to strengthen the 
human rights environment and to implement recommendations from the first UPR cycle. 
He pointed to a number of international conventions that had been signed or ratified, 
including the following:  
</p>
<p>(a)  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(CRPD) and the Optional Protocol thereto, which entered into force on 26 March 2009. In 
2011, a national action plan to implement the Convention had been adopted and an 
Advisory Council established; 
</p>
<p>(b) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on 
the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, which had entered into force 
and the first report of which had already been submitted; 
</p>
<p>(c) The withdrawal of the reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child; 
</p>
<p>(d) The International Convention for the Protection of all Persons against 
Enforced Disappearance and the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime and the 
related Additional Protocol, both of which were intended to help fight acts of a racist and 
xenophobic nature; 
</p>
<p>(e) The Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human 
Beings; and  
</p>
<p>(f) The Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence 
against Women and Domestic Violence. 
</p>
<p>10. The Commissioner stated that new legislation had either entered into force or was in 
motion on issues of forced marriage and the right to &#8220;re-immigration&#8221;, excessive delays in 
criminal proceedings and investigations, and the strengthening of rights of victims of sexual 
abuse. 
</p>
<p>11. In response to an advance question from Montenegro, the Commissioner stated that 
the first action plan by the Federal Government &#8211; &#8220;Our Path Towards an Inclusive Society&#8221; 
&#8211; was to be extended over the following 10 years. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

and education. Namibia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Nepal welcomed the new legislation and institutions for the improvement of human 
rights and action on women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. The plan to implement CRPD and

commendable. Nepal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>23. The Netherlands congratulated Germany on the organization in December 2012 of a 
public meeting on UPR that was broadcast on the Internet and at which human rights 
organizations were present. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Nicaragua congratulated Germany on the ratification of international conventions. It 
asked about the causes of the phenomenon of street children and the action taken in this 
regard. Nicaragua made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>25. Norway emphasized the plan to implement CRPD, the law strengthening rights for

conventions on human rights. Paraguay made recommendations. 
</p>

</p>
<p>31. Poland requested to know about its recommendation made at the first review

recommendation. 
</p>

recommendation. 
</p>

including hate crime and violence against women. 
</p>

racism and religious intolerance, the use of racial profiling, and excessive use of force by 
law enforcement officials. It made recommendations. 
</p>

institutions, in particular the national preventive mechanism on torture, strengthening the 
institutional and legal framework for human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>

framework for the rights of migrants was also noteworthy. Senegal made recommendations. 
</p>

first UPR cycle, particularly the increase in overseas development aid. It made 
recommendations. </p>


<p>41. Slovakia noted significant resources dedicated to human rights nationally and 
internationally and welcomed accession to the third protocol to CRC. The German Institute 
for Human Rights had been awarded &#8220;A&#8221; status under the Paris Principles. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Slovenia welcomed ratification of international instruments, the withdrawal of

Germany for the attention paid to the gender pay gap, but noted that women were often 
expected to choose between career and family. Slovenia made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>43. South Africa noted the German vision for human rights and the priority given to 
meeting international human rights obligations. Despite progress in the prevention of 
racially motivated offences, it remained an area of concern. It made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>44. Spain noted human rights work at home and abroad, particularly joint action on 
rights to water and sanitation. It expressed concern that civil servants were obliged to report 
migrants with an irregular status to immigration authorities. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Sri Lanka noted human rights legislation and ratification of international 
conventions. It encouraged efforts to reduce obstacles to housing, health and education for 
immigrants and minority communities, and noted continuing discourse on the gender pay 
gap. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Sweden noted continued challenges to gender equality, despite progress. A 
comprehensive strategy on racial discrimination was lacking and it asked about measures to 
inform victims of discrimination of their rights and provide effective legal remedies.  
Sweden made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>47. The Commissioner stated that racism and prejudices were still present in some parts 
of German society. Actions undertaken by the Federal Government concerning xenophobia, 
racism and anti-Semitism followed a broad approach in order to reach all levels of society 
and to fight all forms of this scourge. Germany put great emphasis on the support of 
citizens&#8217; involvement and the creation of civil society networks in the implementation of 
the &#8220;National Action Plan to Fight Racism, Xenophobia and anti-Semitism&#8221;. The National 
Action Plan was handed over to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in 
2009 in pursuance of the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Plan of Action of 
</p><p>2001. 
</p>
<p>48. The Commissioner stated that 90 per cent of all racially motivated violence was 
committed by those with a politically right-wing background. A repressive strategy was 
applied when combating criminal acts within a xenophobe, racist or anti-Semite context, 
including criminal prosecution, and the prohibition of associations. Racial profiling was 
prohibited by law. 
</p>
<p>49. The Commissioner expressed deep appreciation for the immense contribution made 
by migrants and foreign workers to the economic and social development of Germany. 
Germany had worked continuously to improve the educational opportunities for children 
from migrant families. The number of foreign students acquiring a higher education 
entrance qualification increased by 36 per cent between 2005 and 2010. Also, the National 
Action Plan for Integration from 2012 contained concrete measures and actions regarding 
the issue of integration: among others, measures to raise professional qualification, to 
strengthen counselling opportunities for migrants, to enhance professional expertise and the 
improvement of language skills. In order to enhance access to the labour market, the action 
plan &#8220;Diversity as a Chance&#8221; was brought into being to create a work environment free of 
negative stereotyping. The recognition of professional qualifications acquired abroad still 
needed improvement. Furthermore, school attendance had become compulsory in almost all 
federal states for children whose deportation had been temporarily suspended or involved in </p>


<p>asylum procedures. National legislation had been amended to exempt schools from the 
obligation to inform authorities if children without legal status were attending school. 
</p>
<p>50. The Commissioner stated that with regard to cases of discrimination on the basis of 
religion, a series of concrete measures set out in the National Report was being taken to 
provide for better access to the labour market and to enhance social integration. The 
Commissioner stated that integration of migrants remained a process where both sides had 
to contribute in order to make it a success and that it was important to maintain the 
dialogue. Germany would not pursue ratification of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(ICRMW). The rights of migrant workers were already protected under existing law. 
</p>
<p>51. With regard to allegations of the use of excessive force by the police, the 
Commissioner stated that a fully functional internal complaints procedure accessible to all 
alleged victims was in place. Victims of this alleged abuse could take legal action as such 
conduct was covered by criminal law. The identification of policemen allegedly involved 
did not cause specific problems. There was no known case of any proceeding regarding 
police violence that had failed to take place on the grounds of lack of identification of the 
alleged perpetrator. 
</p>
<p>52. The Commissioner stated that hate speech was punishable under law. Any 
incitement to hatred against a specific group of persons, any call for action against such a 
group, and any act against human dignity is punishable by law with imprisonment from 3 
months to 5 years. The fight against hate speech on the Internet had been intensified as had 
national and international cooperation in this regard, also with the help of the centre to 
combat right-wing violence. 
</p>
<p>53. Switzerland welcomed significant measures taken to implement recommendations 
from the first UPR cycle. It supported the Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture 
regarding the need for additional resources enabling the national preventive mechanism to 
function effectively. Switzerland made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>54. Thailand noted ratifications of CRPD and optional protocols to CRC. It encouraged 
strengthened measures to prevent child sexual abuse. Action on discrimination against 
minority groups and the rights of migrant children were welcomed. Thailand made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia commended efforts to fight anti-
Semitism and eradicate racism and xenophobia. It welcomed the decision of the Federal 
Constitutional Court ensuring consideration of international human rights treaties when 
interpreting constitutionally guaranteed human rights. 
</p>
<p>56. Togo noted the national action plan to implement CRPD, the national preventive 
mechanism and the withdrawal of reservations to CRC. It welcomed measures to bring an 
end to racism, xenophobia and the activities of neo-Nazi groups. Togo made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Trinidad and Tobago noted strengthened rights for victims of sexual abuse, and 
ratifications of CRPD and the protocol thereto, and the Council of Europe conventions 
concerning violence against women and cybercrime, and the additional protocol thereto. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Tunisia highlighted ratification of international instruments, new human rights 
institutions and legislation, the national preventive mechanism on torture and national plan 
against racism. It encouraged efforts to allocate 0.7 per cent of gross national income to 
development aid. Tunisia made recommendations. </p>


<p>59. Turkey noted insecurity caused by growing xenophobia and the killing of 10 persons 
by the National Socialist Underground. It noted the separation of Turkish children from 
their families by the <i>Jugendamt</i> and criticism of that body&#8217;s actions. Turkey made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>60. The Commissioner stated, in response to the concern raised by Turkey on 
Germany&#8217;s commitment to solve the cases of homicides committed by the 
&#8220;Nationalsozialistischer Untergrund&#8221; (NSU), a right-wing extremist group that Germany 
took these cases very seriously and has strengthened efforts to fight all forms of 
discrimination and racism. The Federal President of Germany invited the families of the 
victims to meet with him and has extended an apology for the initial failure of law 
enforcement agencies to solve these cases. The Commissioner stated that there were on-
going investigations regarding the potential failures of the police as well as investigations 
regarding structural questions that might have contributed to not identifying the 
perpetrators, and explained some of the measures taken to prevent future such failures, such 
as the creation of a database on right-wing extremists as well as a joint centre to fight right-
wing extremism and terrorism. The Commissioner took the opportunity to once again 
apologize for the repulsive crimes committed by the NSU and for unjust suspicions raised 
against persons close to the victims. 
</p>
<p>61. Ukraine welcomed the national preventive mechanism and asked, given that it 
constituted two institutions, how they interacted and how the dual structure impacted on 
mechanism&#8217;s efficiency. It commended the National Action Plan against racism. Ukraine 
</p>
<p>made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>62. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland expressed concern that 
investigations into murders committed by the extremist National Socialist Underground 
may have been hampered by institutional racism. The development of a comprehensive 
strategy to combat racial discrimination was urged. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. The United States of America noted the commitment by Germany to address a broad 
spectrum of human rights, including the prosecution of officials in security services for 
abuses, efforts to prevent illegal access to personal computers by the police, and the 
creation of a central database for violent neo-Nazis. It remained concerned over attacks on 
ethnic minorities, and noted efforts to promote barrier-free access to persons with 
disabilities. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Uruguay emphasized institutional and legislative reforms and amendments. It noted, 
however, continued reports of incidents of right-wing extremism on the Internet. Uruguay 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Uzbekistan noted concerns about online racism, discrimination against migrants, and 
refugees and minorities, and the lack of legislation appropriately criminalizing torture. It 
asked for information about investigations into allegations of torture and ill-treatment 
committed by police. Uzbekistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Viet Nam commended achievements in socio-economic development, and 
highlighted progress in the fields of sexual orientation, freedom of religion, combating 
discrimination and coordinating work with civil society. Nonetheless, further action could 
certainly be taken. It made one recommendation. 
</p>
<p>67. Afghanistan noted the establishment of new independent human rights institutions 
and the ratification of a number of international conventions. It commended the withdrawal 
of its reservation to the Convention of the Child. 
</p>
<p>68. Algeria commended recent ratifications of international instruments and noted that 
the non-ratification of ICRMW was a source of concern for the German Institute for </p>


<p>Human Rights. It asked about concrete measures taken to fight &#8220;Islamophobia&#8221;. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Angola noted that Germany had adopted new legislation in order to strengthen its 
mechanism for promotion and protection of human rights, and had ratified or signed a 
number of regional and international instruments. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>70. Argentina congratulated Germany for the ratification of CRPD, and the creation of 
the National Institute for the Prevention of Torture. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>71. Armenia expressed its appreciation for Germany&#8217;s policy on the protection of 
national minorities and mentioned the positive experience of the Armenian community in 
Germany. Armenia also valued Germany&#8217;s courage to live in harmony with its past. It made 
</p>
<p>a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>72. Austria welcomed the adoption of the General Equal Treatment Act (AGG), in view 
of reports of violent attacks on minority groups, as well as the ratification of the CRPD and 
its Optional Protocol. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Australia welcomed improvements to educational outcomes for children at risk of 
exiting the education system early. It would welcome further information on programmes 
and policies to promote educational outcomes amongst vulnerable segments of the 
community. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>74. Bahrain commended the adoption of a National Action Plan to implement the 
CRPD. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Bangladesh commended Germany for ratifying CRPD. It requested to know how 
Germany planned to address the recommendations made by United Nations treaty bodies, 
particularly those relating to the cultural rights of minorities and the prevention of 
discrimination against migrants in relation to housing. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>76. Belarus underscored Germany&#8217;s insufficient cooperation with the Human Rights 
Council and Special Procedures. It pointed at the excessive use of force by the police and 
special measures against participants to demonstrations, and their cruel treatment. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Benin encouraged Germany to pursue its fight against racism, discrimination, 
xenophobia and anti-Semitism by adopting targeted measures that would strengthen social 
cohesion, and to protect children against violence and sexual exploitation. 
</p>

and extremist and racists speeches on the Internet. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. On dual citizenship, the  Commissioner explained that the Government did not see 
any specific reason to change the current legislation, which provided for dual citizenship in 
some circumstances, such as children under 18 years, and citizens from European Union 
member States. He emphasized, however, that there was an ongoing debate on this issue. 
</p>
<p>89. On the existing national preventive mechanism against torture established following 
the ratification of the OP-CAT, the Commissioner explained the two-level structure of the 
mechanism with one institution at the federal level and a second commission serving the 
level of the <i>L&#228;nder</i>. Germany was aware of discussions and criticism on whether the two 
institutions were adequately resourced and funded. This was also an issue raised during the 
visit of the Subcommittee to the Committee against Torture in April 2013. Germany was 
awaiting the recommendations of the Subcommittee and would respond once those 
recommendations had been received. Germany remained committed to fulfilling its 
obligations under the OP-CAT. 
</p>
<p>90. The Commissioner stated that a new child protection law had been put into effect in 
January 2012, which encompassed and clarified the roles and responsibilities of all actors 
and layers of society in this regard, including parents, health officials and personnel, public 
administration and institutions, and competent judicial organs. It provided for better
