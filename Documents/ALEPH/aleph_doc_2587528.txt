Description of Business
Atna is involved in all phases of the mining business including exploration, preparation of
feasibility studies, permitting, construction, development, operation and reclamation of mining
properties. The Company’s business model is principally one of developing and operating
precious-metal mines in the western United States (“US”). The Company conducts a portion of its
mineral exploration activities through joint ventures with other companies. The Company is a
reporting issuer in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Nova Scotia. Atna trades on the
Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol “ATN” and in the US on the over-the-counter Bulletin
Board under the symbol “ATNAF”.
The Company is presently operating the Briggs mine (“Briggs”) located in Inyo County,
California, which commenced commercial gold production in July 2009. In June 2014, the
company re-commenced underground mining at the Pinson gold mine (“Pinson”) near
Winnemucca, Nevada. Pinson consists of the Pinson-underground mine and the Mag-open-pit
development project. The Reward gold mine (“Reward”) near Beatty, Nevada is permitted for
construction and has been partially developed. The Columbia gold project (“Columbia”) located
near Lincoln, Montana, is a feasibility-study-stage project; and the Kendall Mine (“Kendall”),
located near Lewistown, Montana, is in the final stage of reclamation and closure activities.

ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Mining commenced at the Pinson Underground mine in June 2014 with a focus on testing new
mine designs and confirming resource modeling parameters, while expecting to generate cash
·
to offset care-and-maintenance costs. A new resource model and mine plan for Pinson
Underground is currently being finalized and will be used as a basis for future production
forecasts.
Pinson Underground is currently being mined by one crew operating on a four-day, 10-hour per
·
day schedule. Mined ore is being sold to Newmont’s nearby Twin Creeks mill. A pre-feasibility
study is being completed to determine the viability of an extension to the Mag open pit at Pinson.
Year-to-Date 2014 Highlights:
Financial Highlights
On January 31, 2014, the Company refinanced $22.0 million of current obligations with a 2-year
credit facility calling for a balloon payment of principal and fees at the end of the term and
·
interest-only payments over the term. Proceeds from this facility were utilized to retire an
existing, current, Canadian-dollar debt facility. A foreign-exchange gain of $2.3 million was
realized from this transaction.
Cash used in operating activities in the first half of 2014 was $0.8 million prior to using $1.5
·
million to increase inventory and reduce payables.
An operating loss of $3.5 million and a net, after-tax loss of $3.9 million, ($0.02) per weighted
·
average share, were recognized.
Operating Highlights
Revenues totaled $20.6 million in the first half of 2014 on the sale of 16,100 ounces at an
·
average gold price of $1,275 per ounce. Ounces sold increased 11 percent over in the first half
of 2013. The average selling price decreased 17 percent over the first half of 2013.
Briggs generated $2.9 million in operating cash flow in the first half of 2014, prior to using $0.2
·
million to increase inventory and reduce debt and payables. Briggs incurred a pre-tax loss of
$0.6 million.
In February 2014, Atna concluded an updated resource and reserve estimate for the permitted
Reward Gold Project, integrating new results from the 2013 drilling program and increasing
·
measured and indicated gold resources by 7 percent to 387,900 contained gold ounces. Inferred
resources increased 62 percent to 106,400 ounces.
Outlook and Strategy
Atna offers investors leverage to gold price through the development and operation of precious-
metal mines in the politically stable western United States. The Company owns or controls a gold
resource base that provides a call on future value which can be unlocked either through direct
development and production or through the sale of assets, to which value has been added. Atna
operates the producing Briggs gold mine and has commenced production at the Pinson-
underground gold mine. The Company owns the permitted and partially developed Reward gold
mine and also holds the Mag pit and Columbia gold projects for evaluation and development. We
believe that this strong asset base provides a rapid avenue for growth and profitability as gold
markets strengthen.
The Company’s primary focus for 2014 is gold production and cash flow generation at the Briggs
Mine. The gold sales outlook for Briggs has been reduced to 30,000 to 40,000 gold ounces for
2014, as actual ore tons and grades mined in the lower zones of the Goldtooth pit have been
lower than modeled. In addition, a localized slope failure in the bottom of the Goldtooth pit at the
end of June limited access to ore supply in the Goldtooth South pit during the month of July.
Stripping activities in the Briggs North pit have reached the top of the ore zone and will provide a
second ore supply in Third Quarter 2014. Mining in the Goldtooth pit is expected to be completed
by the end of Third Quarter 2014.

ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Mining commenced at the Pinson Underground mine in June 2014. The decision to commence
mining was based on the need to test new mine designs and confirm resource modeling
parameters that were updated based on experience gained during developmental mining in
2013. This mining is also expected to generate cash sufficient to offset care-and-maintenance
costs for the site. An updated resource and long-term mine plan is currently being finalized to use
as a basis for future production forecasts. Increases to current production levels will be justified
on the basis of market economics and profitability of operations.
A pre-feasibility study to evaluate development of the Mag open pit project at Pinson is nearing
completion and will be released in a combined technical report with the updated underground
study in Third Quarter 2014. Atna reviews acquisition and merger opportunities that could build
long-term shareholder value by providing capital to accelerate project development and achieve
additional operating synergies and operating capacity.
Mine Operations
Briggs Mine, California
Briggs was acquired by the Company in 1990 and the mine was initially operated in 1996;
production ceased in 2004 due to gold-market conditions, and commercial production
recommenced in 2009. Briggs is located on the west side of the Panamint Range near Death
Valley, in Inyo County, California. The mine is located on 156 unpatented claims, including 15
mill site claims, covering approximately 2,890 acres, on land administered by the BLM. No
royalties are payable at Briggs. All of the mining claims at Briggs are located on land prescribed
for multiple use management by the BLM.
Briggs is a conventional open pit mine that uses heap leach gold recovery. Ore is crushed in a
three-stage crushing circuit to a targeted 80 percent passing a 1/4 inch-screen prior to placement
on the leach pad. Gold is recovered from leach solutions in a typical carbon
absorption/desorption/recovery (“ADR”) process to produce a doré product for shipment to
refiners. Targeted gold recovery is 80 percent.
Gold ounces sold in Second Quarter 2014 by Briggs increased 6 percent over First Quarter 2014
and 21 percent over Second Quarter 2013. Briggs met target production goals in the Second
Quarter 2014 for total tons mined, but both ore grades and tons were below model, resulting in
lower than expected contained ounces being mined and placed on the leach pad. All of the ore
mined in the quarter originated from the Goldtooth pit where mineralization is controlled by
proximity to the Goldtooth fault structure. High grade ore zones associated with the fault were
modeled to be relatively continuous, but in actuality were found to be in pods, with limited
continuity, reducing average ore grades and the ore tons available. The Goldtooth pit is expected
to be depleted by the end of Third Quarter 2014, when the primary ore supply will be from the
lower grade, but more disseminated, Briggs Main North and Briggs Main pits.
Briggs produced $3.3 million in positive operating cash flow in Second Quarter 2014. Cash cost
and all-in sustaining costs per ounce increased marginally in the Second Quarter 2014 over First
Quarter 2014. Total direct operating costs at Briggs were virtually unchanged between these two
quarters, while the principal difference between quarterly per ounce costs was in accounting for
changes in inventory and deferred stripping.

Note: Cash cost per gold ounce sold is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated utilizing Gold
Institute Standards. All-in sustaining cost is also a non-GAAP measure and is calculated utilizing
guidance from the World Gold Council. A reconciliation of GAAP measures to these non-GAAP
measures follows later in this section.
Under IFRS, there is no standardized definition of cash cost per gold ounce sold and therefore
the measure may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other issuers. The
Company calculates cash cost per gold ounce sold using the Gold Institute Standards, and the
measure is calculated by subtracting depreciation, depletion, amortization, and silver by-product
credits from cost of sales. Cost of sales includes all mine-site operating costs, mine-site
overhead, production taxes, royalties, production stripping costs net of capitalization, secondary
development costs, changes in inventory, and mine-site depreciation, amortization, and
depletion. All-in sustaining cost per ounce is a non-GAAP performance measure developed by
the World Gold Council. This measure uses cash costs per ounce sold as its basis and adds
sustaining capital expenditures, general and administrative expenses, sustaining exploration and
evaluation costs, and accretion and depletion of reclamation provisions, all allocable to Briggs.
The following schedule reconciles cost of sales to cash cost per gold ounce sold for the periods
indicated.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Unit mining costs increased in the quarter, primarily due to longer haul cycles for ore and waste
from the Goldtooth pit and increased explosives use in the Briggs North pit as stripping activities
encountered more competent rock at depth. Leaching costs were also higher than expected due
to high cyanide consumption as a result of reduced pH levels in the leach pad caused by
leaching over older areas.

Briggs mining operations are planned to be conducted entirely within the existing permit
boundary area. Briggs operates under the requirements of the following significant permits and
agencies: (1) Plan of Operations, BLM; (2) Mining and Reclamation Plan, Inyo County; (3) Waste
Discharge Requirements, Lahontan; (4) Permits to Operate, Great Basin Unified Air Pollution
Control District; and (5) a stream bed alteration permit with California Fish and Game. The
Company, via sureties, has posted reclamation bonds with these agencies in the amount of $4.5
million. All surety bonds are subject to annual review and adjustment.
In June 2013, Briggs received a Notice of Violation (NOV) in connection with the fact that one of
its previously permitted four stationary diesel generators no longer met State of California
emission standards for diesel toxic control measures. The Company removed the subject
generator engine from service, the NOV was novated, and the Company has negotiated, but not
completed an agreement as to a financial penalty for this NOV. The Company recognized a
$225,000 expense in Second Quarter 2014 for this penalty, expecting 9 estimated quarterly
payments of $25,000 starting in August of 2014. Briggs received in Second Quarter 2014 three
additional NOV’s from the Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District in regards to its
Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) and exceeding Oxides of Nitrogen permit
standards also from its electrical generation plant. The CEMS equipment is being repaired and
updated, and changes to operating procedures are being developed to mitigate emissions issues
in the future. Removal of the fourth generator contributed to these exceedances as increased
demand was placed on the remaining generators. We have not recognized any expense for the
later three NOV’s, being unable to establish a probability of or an estimated amount for to-be-
negotiated penalties, if any.
Briggs is hosted by Precambrian quartz-rich gneiss and amphibolite which have undergone
ductile folding during Precambrian time and subsequently subject to brittle deformation by high
and low-angle faulting during Mesozoic and Tertiary time. High-angle faults and shear zones are
believed to have acted as conduits that channeled gold-bearing hydrothermal fluids upwards into
the Precambrian gneiss and amphibolites rock units. The principal gold mineralized high-angle
fault zone at the mine is the north-south trending Goldtooth fault. The Goldtooth fault was
developed historically by underground methods in the early 1900s and remains an important
source of ore at Briggs.
Pinson Mine Property, Nevada
Pinson is located in Humboldt County, Nevada, about 30 miles east of Winnemucca. The
property is located on the Getchell Gold Belt in north-central Nevada near its intersection with the
north end of the Battle Mountain-Eureka trend. Prior to 2000, Pinson produced over 987,000
ounces of gold from oxidized ore by open pit mining and oxide heap-leach and mill
recovery. Gold production came from decalcified, locally silicified and/or argillized, fine-grained,
limy sedimentary rocks of the Ordovician Period Comus Formation and is considered a Carlin-
type, sedimentary host gold system.  Mineralization is focused along and adjacent to the Getchell
Fault zone.

ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
In September 2011, Atna completed an Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement with Pinson Mining
Company ("PMC") a subsidiary of Barrick Gold to acquire PMC’s 70 percent interest in Pinson.
The site had previously been operated as a joint venture with PMC owning 70% and Atna
owning 30%. Atna now controls four square miles of land containing the historic Pinson Mine and
the related mineral resources. This includes 30 claims owned 100 percent, ownership of two
additional sections of fee surface and mineral lands, ownership of 41.66 percent of 18 additional
claims, and a lease interest in 18 full and two fractional mining claims. The Company owns an
additional 41.66 percent interest of an additional 120 acres of fee and mineral lands, and the
Company leases the remainder of those interests from local private landowners. In total, there are
2,545 acres of land in the Pinson package.
The Pinson property includes the Pinson-underground mine and the Mag pit development
project. The Mag pit project is discussed further below under “Development Properties”. Pinson
underground ores are subject to a 6.0% Net Smelter Return (“NSR”) royalty and the Mag open pit
will be subject to NSR royalties ranging from 2.0% to 6.0%. An NSR royalty is a defined
percentage of the gross revenues from a mining operation, less a proportionate share of
incidental transportation, insurance, refining and smelting costs. PMC also retained a 10 percent,
net profits royalty, that is payable after all development expenditures are recaptured and the first
120,000 ounces of gold have been sold. As of June 30, 2014, Pinson’s net carrying cost was
$34.2 million.
Pinson Underground
In June 2014, mining commenced at the Pinson Underground with one operating crew working
four days per week, 10 hours per day. The decision to commence mining was based on the need
to test new mine designs, including long-hole stoping, and confirm resource modeling
parameters which were developed based on experience gained during development mining in
2013. This mining is also expected to generate sufficient cash to offset care-and-maintenance
costs for the site. The contract miner committed to share in the risk of operations by waiting to be
paid for their work until proceeds from ore sales are received, thereby reducing the capital
required for this operation. By July 31, 2014, two ore shipments totaling over 1,500 tons have
been made to the oxide plant at Newmont’s Twin Creeks mill under a renewal of the 2013 Ore
Purchase and Sales Agreement. Receipts from the first sale of ore containing 125 ounces at a
grade of 0.358 gold ounces per ton were received in July.
Initial mining started in a previously developed oxide ore stope in the Ogee zone. Two additional
oxide stopes have been designed for mining over the next quarter with one of these stoping
areas to be mined by long-hole stoping, a bulk-mining method. The other stope will be mined by
the underhand cut-and-fill mining method previously used at Pinson-underground. Ore will be
screened on surface to eliminate waste and upgrade the average grade shipped as was learned
to be effective in prior operations. A reversal of prior impairment of developed infrastructure at
Pinson will be considered, once mine designs are completed and an assessment can be made
concerning the use of previously impaired workings.
Atna plans to mine previously developed ore zones at Pinson and to make regular small-lot ore
sales. Once detailed long-term mine designs have been completed, then an increase in the
production rate and further development will be assessed and implemented as may be justified.
In April 2014, the Company retained Practical Mining LLC of Elko, Nevada, to commence a
Technical Report to optimize underground mine design, costs, reserves and resources for the
Pinson Underground Mine. Practical Mining is highly experienced in Carlin gold systems and is
familiar with northern Nevada operating conditions and mining methods. Atna has re-modeled
geologic controls and grade shells for the Pinson-underground based on experience gained
during underground development. The revised resource model will be the basis for developing
an optimized mine plan. This updated mine plan is projected to be completed late in the third
quarter of 2014.

ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Pinson has entered into an agreement to license the operation of its assay lab to Klondex Gold &
Silver Mining Company, a subsidiary of Klondex Mines Ltd. Klondex will perform assay work on
samples from its nearby Midas Mine and will also perform assay work for Pinson at cost. This
synergistic relationship will benefit both companies.
Development of the Pinson underground mine commenced in early 2012 and mine ramp-up
began in late 2012. A total of 4,100 feet of primary and secondary development was completed
during 2012 and 2013. The primary spiral was driven to the 4530 level from the 4650 adit level
(120 feet below the mine portal) and both top cut and underhand ore mining occurred in three
Ogee-zone stope blocks during development. Additionally five stope blocks were partially
developed and may be completed from the existing spiral. A total of 30,150 tons of ore mined
during development was shipped to third party plant facilities for processing in 2012 and 2013.
This ore contained 7,915 ounces of gold, from which 6,834 ounces were recovered. The mine
was placed on care and maintenance in June 2013 due to weak gold prices and insufficient
development capital.
Pinson-underground contains numerous ore zones. The principal zones are the Ogee (OG),
Range Front (RF), Adams Peak (AP) and the CX. To date, ore has been developed and mined
only in the OG zone. The Pinson deposits are structurally controlled Carlin type deposits.
Mineralization is emplaced as karst fillings and carbonate replacements. Mineralization includes
oxide, mixed, and sulfide ores that require different types of processing for gold recovery. Mining
has not proceeded to the depth at Pinson where sulfide ores, unmixed with oxide, have been
encountered.
Pinson underground is permitted to extract by underground mining up to 400,000 tons of ore per
year for offsite processing and for the placement in waste dumps of approximately 1.0 million
tons of material. Atna provided the State of Nevada with approximately $0.8 million of bonding to
date and anticipates posting an additional $0.9 million of bonds in Third Quarter 2014.
DEVELOPMENT PROPERTIES
Reward Mine, Nevada
Reward is located in southwestern Nye County, Nevada, about 5.5 miles south-southeast of the
town of Beatty. The leases and patented claims carry a 3 percent net smelter return ("NSR")
royalty. In Second Quarter 2014, construction-level mine and waste-dump designs were
completed for Reward. Additional work is being undertaken to update estimated capital and cost
requirements.
Reward is planned to be a conventional open-pit mining operation with ore crushing and heap-
leach gold recovery. Mining operations at Reward will utilize conventional 100-ton open pit
trucks and 15-yard loaders. Mined ore will be crushed to minus 3/8 inch and placed on a lined
pad for leaching and gold recovery. Target gold recovery is 80 percent for the project. Process
solutions will be captured in solution tanks and circulated through activated carbon to capture
entrained gold. Loaded carbon will be processed at the Briggs Mine to produce a gold doré
product. Additional project detail may be found in the annual report on Form 20-F.

Substantially all permits required for mine development and operating activities have been
received. The US Bureau of Land Management signed the Record of Decision and Finding of No
Significant Impact approving the development of Reward in August 2009. In January 2010, the
Nevada Division of Environmental Protection issued a Reclamation Permit that became effective
February 7, 2010. This permit, subject to the placement of a total of $6.2 million in reclamation
bonds, will allow Atna to construct the Reward Mine. Approximately $0.9 million of the bonding is
in place, and the balance is expected to be placed prior to commencing final construction.
Reclamation bonds may be subject to inflation and other adjustments. Other major permits have
also been issued by the State of Nevada including the Class II Air Quality Operating Permit,
Water Pollution Control Permit, and a Permit to Change Point of Diversion, Manner of Use and
Place of Use of The Public Waters.
The Company expects to commence construction of the Reward mine when sufficient financial
resources are available to fund the development and working capital required. Once construction
is commenced, a nine-month construction period is anticipated, with gold production
commencing three months after construction is completed.
Gold mineralization at Reward is controlled principally by the Good Hope fault zone; a sheeted,
steeply dipping, north-south-trending quartz-vein zone. Adjacent to the Good Hope fault, the
phyllitic quartzite, siltstone, and shales dip moderately to the east (45 degrees) and are host to
more disseminated gold mineralization associated with narrow iron oxide veinlets (after pyrite)
and minor quartz veining.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Mag Open Pit at Pinson
The Mag pit deposit is adjacent to and separate from the Pinson underground deposit.
Pinson previously operated as an open-pit mine that produced gold from oxide ores by
heap-leach and oxide mill recovery. Between 2004 and 2011, the Pinson joint venture
conducted substantial drilling from surface in and around the existing open pits providing
new information and expanding the mineral resource base in and around the old pits. The
Company modeled the data and estimated that the deposit contains a measured and
indicated mineral resource containing 912,000 gold ounces amenable to open-pit mining
and heap-leach gold recovery.
Pre-feasibility work is underway to develop a mine plan for the Mag pit deposit. The study
is focused on the section 33 Mag pit extension, which resides on private property. The
Mag pit project is planned to be a conventional open-pit mining operation with ore
crushing and heap-leach gold recovery. Mining operations will utilize conventional 100-ton
open pit trucks and 16-yard loaders. Mined ore will be crushed to minus 2-inch size in a
two stage crushing plant and placed on a lined pad for leaching and gold recovery. Target
gold recovery is 55 to 80 percent for the project depending on level of oxidation within the
ores. We plan to use a conventional ADR process to produce a gold doré product. This
pre-feasibility study will be released as part of a property-wide report including the
updated underground resource and mine plan. Completion of this study is planned for late
in the third quarter of 2014.
Columbia Project, Montana
The Company wholly-owns or leases 24 patented and 162 unpatented mining claims at
Columbia, which is located approximately seven miles east of Lincoln and 45 miles
northwest of Helena, in Lewis and Clark County, Montana. The patented claims are subject
to NSR royalties that range from zero to six percent. Columbia is a ‘green-field’ site,
subject only to minor historic mining, and not previously having operated as a modern
commercial mine.
The Company engaged Gustavson Associates, LLC, an independent engineering to
complete the “NI 43-101 Technical Report and Preliminary Assessment on the Columbia
Project, Lewis and Clark County, Montana” dated June 2, 2010 (the “Columbia PEA”)
prepared by William J. Crowl R.G., MMSA SME-RM, Donald Hulse P.E., and Richard Moritz,
MMSA of Gustavson Associates, LLC. Each of the foregoing persons is an independent
qualified person in accordance with NI 43-101. Results of the Columbia PEA demonstrate
that the project may have favorable development potential. The preliminary assessment
includes inferred mineral resources within the pit boundary that are considered too
speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would
enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves, and there is no certainty that the
preliminary assessment estimates will be realized. Additional studies are required to fully
demonstrate the future economic feasibility of the project. This work, however, justifies the
funding of a feasibility level study to further define the economics of the project which may
potentially justify commencing the permitting process.
The Columbia PEA contemplates a conventional open pit truck/loader mining operation
with sequential pit waste backfill and a conventional 5,000 ton per day gravity and flotation
mill to produce both doré and a gold and silver concentrate. Concentrates would be sold
to third party processing facilities. The initial design seeks to minimize environmental
impact by incorporating dry tailings for pit backfill versus a conventional wet tailings dam.
Additional project detail may be found in the annual report on Form 20-F.
The Columbia PEA developed a number of recommendations for future work. These
include:
Additional metallurgical sampling to adequately test the various parts of the resource sufficiently
·
to refine the process flow and complete a plant design.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Additional drilling to confirm the resource and upgrade the ore classification of the Donnely
·
South area.
·An evaluation of the permitting requirements of the project.
·A geotechnical study to optimize pit slope angles and confirm waste dump stability and design.
·Feasibility and project optimization studies.
A second round of metallurgical test work was completed in February 2012. This work was
focused on optimizing flotation gold recovery and characterizing gold concentrate grade
and quality. This program focused on utilizing conventional gravity and flotation gold
recovery methods to produce concentrate products. Both rougher and cleaner floatation
circuits were utilized. Overall recovery was approximately 88 percent for gold and 50
percent for silver. Cleaner flotation upgraded the flotation concentrate to the range of 39
ounces per ton of gold and 125 ounces of silver. Cyanide leach test on flotation
concentrate produced a gold recovery of 98 percent and a silver recovery of 96 percent,
indicating a high level of oxidation.
Logging operations and timber sales are currently underway at Columbia and are planned
to harvest remaining accessible timber on the property during the summer season of
2014. Ongoing technical work on the property is currently limited to base-line
environmental data collection.
Gold mineralization at Columbia is considered a Tertiary-age, low-sulfidation, epithermal
volcanic-hosted quartz-adularia vein system. Mineralization is associated with two high-
angle fault zones which host the two principal vein and stockwork vein zones known as
the Columbia and Donnely veins. The veins are exposed on the surface for over 7,000 feet
(2,100 m) in a north-south direction and have been explored to a depth of over 500 feet
(150 m) vertically. Gold and silver mineralization is accompanied by broad zones of argillic
to propylitic alteration of the dominantly mafic volcanic flows which host the deposit.
Columbia is not currently permitted for development. Management’s goal is to collect
sufficient baseline data to commence a feasibility study and a “Mine Plan of Operations”.
Submission of this work will initiate the formal permitting process at Columbia. Columbia
is located on patented and unpatented mining claims within a US National Forest. As with
all mining projects, an environmental impact statement and permitting process must be
completed before a mine can be developed on the property.
Cecil R Project, California
Cecil R is located four miles north of Briggs. The Company completed an initial NI 43-101
compliant mineral resource estimate and technical report titled “NI 43-101 Technical
Report Mineral Resource Estimate Cecil R Gold Deposit, Inyo County, California USA”
dated March 2, 2010 (the “Cecil R Report”) prepared by Fred Barnard, PhD and Robert L.
Sandefur, P.E. of Chlumsky, Armbrust & Meyer LLC. Each of the foregoing persons is an
independent qualified person in accordance with NI 43-101.
Work at Cecil R leading up to the NI 43-101 resource estimate included over 94 drill holes,
surface geologic mapping, surface and underground sampling, and 3D geologic
modeling. Gold mineralization at Cecil R is hosted by the same geologic unit which hosts
the nearby Briggs gold deposit. The gently west dipping blanket-like zone of gold
mineralization dips beneath Quaternary gravel cover and is distributed over an area 1,500
feet by 1,200 feet and has a thickness of 10 to 60 feet.
In early 2014, a scoping level economic study was completed on the Cecil R project. This
non-NI 43-101 compliant report produced positive results, and the Company believes this
justifies continued work on the project. Additional drilling and technical work will be
required to advance this project to ore reserve status and readiness for the permitting
process. The Cecil R open-pit project may be required to comply with the California
Backfill Regulation and be permitted as a stand-alone project.

Summary of Mineral Reserves and Resources
The mineral reserve and resource figures below are estimates, subject to forward-looking-
statement limitations. All reserve and resource figures are considered current as of
reported dates indicated in the footnotes to the tables. The scientific and technical
information about the Company’s mineral properties contained in this Report has been
prepared under the supervision of, reviewed by and approved by William Stanley, a
Registered Member of the Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration, a Licensed
Geologist, and the Company's Vice President Exploration, a “qualified person” as that
term is defined in NI 43-101.
The mineral resources reported below, other than those declared as proven and probable
mineral reserves, have no demonstrated economic viability at this time. The quantity and
grade of reported inferred resources in these estimations are based on limited information
and should be considered conceptual in nature. It is uncertain if further exploration will
result in discovery of a measured or indicated mineral resource within those areas
classified as inferred.
Cautionary Note to US Investors concerning estimates of Measured and Indicated
Resources: This section uses the terms “measured” and “indicated” mineral resources.
The Company advises US investors that while those terms are recognized and required by
Canadian regulations, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) does not
recognize them. US investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral
resources in these categories will ever be converted into reserves.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Cautionary Note to US Investors concerning estimates of Inferred Resources: This section
uses the term “inferred” mineral resources. The Company advises US investors that while
this term is recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the SEC does not recognize
it. “Inferred” mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence,
and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that
all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category.
Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of
feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. US investors are cautioned not to
assume that part or all of an inferred resource exist, or is economically or legally minable.

The Company’s financial results are not significantly impacted by seasonality. Quarterly
expenses and income vary depending on the tons of ore mined and processed; ore
grades; stripping ratios; diesel, chemical, tire, and maintenance costs; realized and
unrealized gains and losses on derivatives; gains or losses on the sale of investments and
disposals of properties; and other factors. Significant operating costs include: labor and
benefits, fuel, maintenance and supplies, chemicals, explosives, and outside services. As
a capital intensive business, principal outlays and interest expense are also significant
costs. Competition for experienced mining personnel continues to be an issue and has
been a factor in increasing the costs of doing business. Fuel cost is a significant cost
factor at Briggs. In the first half of 2014 and the full years 2013 and 2012, diesel fuel
represented approximately 25 percent, 22 percent, and 21 percent of “Cost of sales,
excluding depreciation”, respectively.
Gold price trends indicated above reflect global market conditions. Average gold prices
decreased in the second and third quarters of 2013 and have been in the relatively narrow
range of $1,253 per ounce and $1,310 per ounce within the last four quarters. Ounces sold
relate directly to operating capacity and production. Production statistics, inclusive of
stripping ratios, grades and recoveries, and Briggs costs are discussed above under
“Briggs Mine, California” for the Company’s operating property.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Changes in the total cost of sales, excluding depreciation, by quarter have been generally
consistent with changes in the ounces sold. Gold ounces sold increased 7 percent
between Second Quarter 2014 and First Quarter 2014. The average cost per gold ounce
increased only marginally, 1 percent, in Second Quarter 2014. The average cost per gold
ounce increased 6 percent in First Quarter 2014 as fixed costs and slight increases in
maintenance and other operating costs were spread over fewer ounces sold than in
Fourth Quarter 2013. The Goldtooth South pit has a higher stripping ratio and involves
longer haul-cycles than does the Briggs Main pit, causing increased mining costs, partially
offset by higher average ore grades. The Goldtooth South pit was a principal source of ore
in the four quarters ended June 30, 2014. The average cost per gold ounce declined
significantly in both the third and fourth quarters of 2013 due to increased ore production
and lower stripping ratios. A focus on stripping of the Goldtooth South pit caused costs
per gold ounce to be at a relatively high level late in Fourth Quarter 2012 and through
Second Quarter 2013. Ore-mining productivity had decreased in Fourth Quarter 2012 due
to reduced working space in the bottom of the Main pit, the presence of water in the Main
pit, and the narrow approach to and bottleneck in the Goldtooth North Pit.
In each of the last five quarters, the Company adjusted inventory to its net realizable value
less estimated costs to complete the inventory, resulting in recoveries of $0.1 million in
Second Quarter 2014 and $0.6 million in Third Quarter 2013 and resulting in write-downs in
First Quarter 2014, Fourth Quarter 2013, and Second Quarter 2013 of $0.3 million, $1.8
million, and $1.4 million, respectively.
As the aforementioned write-downs of inventory to net realizable value less estimated
costs-to-complete were recognized as expenses prior to the inventory being sold, the
depreciation expense component of cost of sales in periods following the write-downs
was lower than it otherwise would have been. Without these adjustments, depreciation and
amortization per unit would have been as follows.

Total depreciation expense and capital-depreciation per ounce, unadjusted by inventory
write-downs, have been steadily increasing over the last four quarters. Depreciation and
amortization in each of the four quarters ended June 30, 2013 was relatively consistent on
a cost-per-unit basis.
In 2013, the Company recognized $33.1 million of impairments against long-lived, non-
operating properties in various stages of development. $0.1 million of this was reversed in
First Quarter 2014 upon the sale of a portion of land at the Kendall property. Please see
footnotes to financial statements for a complete description.
General and administrative expenses were relatively consistent between quarters,
although they declined to $1.1 million in each of the first and second quarters of 2014 as
the result of cost-reduction measures. General and administrative expenses were higher,
$1.7 million, in Fourth Quarter 2012, principally due to equity compensation and Company-
wide bonuses granted or paid in that period.
Exploration and property-maintenance expenses vary directly with projects undertaken
and the degree of certainty of future benefit. In the first and second quarters of 2014, a pre-
feasibility study was underway for the Mag open pit project at Pinson, and Pinson-
underground property-maintenance expenses were incurred. In the third and fourth
quarters of 2013, leaching tests and geological and pre-feasibility studies were principally
being conducted for the Mag open pit at Pinson, and Pinson-underground was
recognizing care and maintenance expenses. Third Quarter 2012 exploration expenses
were higher than in prior quarters as pre-feasibility drilling programs were undertaken at
Pinson open-pit and Columbia. Fourth Quarter 2012 exploration expenses were principally
for drilling at Briggs.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
The Company decreased its estimate for future reclamation costs to be incurred for the
Briggs mine and decreased the provision for that and other reclamation work by a net $0.6
million in Fourth Quarter 2013. In Fourth Quarter 2012, the Company recognized an
increase in the estimate for future reclamation costs, principally at Kendall, and
recognized a net provision of $0.4 million.
Interest expense was trending down through and including the Second Quarter 2013 as
debt was being reduced and interest on new debt, associated with the acquisition and
development of Pinson-underground, was instead capitalized. When debt, including
existing general corporate debt, is used to fund material capital projects such as the
development of the Pinson mine, accounting guidance (IFRS) requires the related interest
on the debt to be capitalized as part of the cost of the project. When Pinson-underground
was placed on care and maintenance at the end of June 2013, interest incurred began to
be expensed. In Fourth Quarter 2013, $1.1 million of loan-amendment fees, related to the
Sprott note replaced in January of 2014, was written-off effectively as interest expense.
Interest expense of $1.2 million and $1.3 million were recognized in Second Quarter 2014
and First Quarter 2014, respectively, principally being incurred or imputed on the Waterton
Note undertaken in January 2014. Interest expense also includes accretion of asset
retirement obligations, loan discount-fee amortization, and interest for equipment
financing.
Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives prior to December 31, 2013 relate
directly to market movements in the price of gold and the embedded forward sales in the
2009 Gold Bonds, which were retired in December of 2013. Unrealized gains and loss on
derivatives in 2014 resulted from mark-to-market accounting for open forward sales at the
quarter-ends.
Income tax benefits and expenses recorded relate to the current year’s results, to the
deferred tax provision related to changes in longer-term projections, and to updates in the
expected use of the Company’s deferred net operating losses (NOL’s). During 2013, the
Company updated and recognized reductions of $10.3 million in its deferred tax assets
(“DTA”) attributable to its US net operating loss carryforwards and all other sources. Until
the timing and magnitude of future taxable profits became clearer, the Company
determined that there was not a sufficient probability that future taxable profits would be
available to utilize tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences.
Results of Operations – Second Quarter 2014 versus Second Quarter 2013
Atna recognized a net loss of $3.0 million, $(0.02) per basic share for the Second Quarter
2014. These quarterly results compare to a net loss of $1.1 million, ($0.01) per basic share,
for the Second Quarter 2013. Significant elements of the $1.9 million additional loss
between the two quarters are presented below. A decrease in gold prices, increased
interest expense (interest having been capitalized in Second Quarter 2013), the absence of
a $1.0 million unrealized gain on derivatives recognized in Second Quarter 2013, and the
absence of a $0.7 million tax benefit recognized in Second Quarter 2013 figured most
prominently.
Gold and silver revenues increased $1.0 million, or 10 percent, to $10.8 million in the Second
Quarter 2014 compared to the Second Quarter 2013 with the gold ounces sold increasing from
·
6,775 ounces to 8,296 ounces, a 22 percent increase, and the average price realized per gold
ounce sold decreasing from $1,436 to $1,297, a 10 percent decrease.
Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and adjustments to inventory valuations, was $8.8 million
in Second Quarter 2014 and $7.7 million in Second Quarter 2013, an increase of $1.0 million
and 14 percent. Ounces sold increased 22 percent, so a net 8 percent decrease relates to
·
decreased per unit costs. A concentration on the pre-stripping of waste in the Gold Tooth –
South pit in Second Quarter 2013 tended to decrease operating leverage in that quarter,
increasing the costs per unit; whereas in Second Quarter 2014, there was a focus upon the
mining and processing of ore.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
In Second Quarter 2014, $0.1 million of prior write-downs of Briggs inventory value to net
realizable value less estimated costs of completion was recognized as recovered. The
adjustment was based on the quarter-end gold price of $1,315 per ounce of gold. In Second
·
Quarter 2013, a write-down of Briggs inventory value to net realizable value less estimated costs
of completion resulted in recognition of an expense of $1.4 million. The adjustment was based
on the gold price at the end of Second Quarter 2013 of $1,192 per ounce of gold.
Depreciation and amortization, cost of sales, increased $0.4 million, 26 percent, in Second
Quarter 2014 relative to Second Quarter 2013. The units-of-production method of calculating
depreciation caused depreciation to vary with the ounces sold, a 22 percent increase. The
·increase in depreciation and amortization exceeded the change in ounces by 4 percent due
principally to an increasing level of capital per reserve-ounce at Briggs. Please see the
discussion regarding the impact of adjustments to inventory values upon depreciation expense
in the “Summary of Quarterly Results” section above.
General and administrative expenses declined $0.1 million to $1.0 million in Second Quarter
2014 relative to Second Quarter 2013. This generally reflects cost reductions undertaken which
·
were partially offset by recognition of an estimated NOV penalty of $0.2 million in Second
Quarter 2014.
Exploration expenses increased $0.1 million to $0.2 million in Second Quarter 2014 compared
to Second Quarter 2013 principally as work continued on the pre-feasibility study for the Mag
·
open pit at Pinson and claim fees for exploration properties were expensed in Second Quarter
2014 whereas in Second Quarter 2013 work on the pre-feasibility study for the Mag pit was offset
in part by the sale of a small exploration property, Uduk Lake, for $0.1 million.
Property maintenance expense increased $0.3 million to $0.3 million in Second Quarter 2014 as
·
a result of Pinson-underground having a care and maintenance status in the quarter.
Interest expense increased $1.0 million to $1.2 million in the Second Quarter 2014, principally
as interest was no longer capitalized to Pinson-underground development after June 2013.
·
Effective interest rates and the amortization of loan discounts have also increased, also causing
an increase in interest expense. Interest paid in cash in Second Quarter 2014 was $0.7 million
whereas it was $0.6 million in Second Quarter 2013.
In Second Quarter 2013, a realized loss of $0.2 million and an unrealized gain of $1.0 million
were recognized for the embedded derivatives in the 2009 Gold Bonds. These bonds were
·
retired in December 2013. In Second Quarter 2014, there was only an unrealized loss of $0.1
million recognized for outstanding forward-sales positions.
The Company recognized a loss on the disposition of assets of $0.3 million in Second Quarter
2014, principally resulting from the sale of an idle rock crusher at the Pinson property. There
·
were no similar events in Second Quarter 2013, however, the Company realized a loss of $0.1
million on the sale of short term investments in the Second Quarter 2013.
As of June 30, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $0.7 million, a $1.1 million decrease
since March 31, 2014. The significant elements underlying the net decrease of $1.1 million
in cash in Second Quarter 2014 are presented below with comparisons to cash flows in
Second Quarter 2013.
Net cash provided by operating activities in Second Quarter 2014 was $1.4 million, inclusive of
$1.4 million provided through a decrease in working capital, principally decreases in prepaids
and inventory and an increase in trade payables. Net cash provided by operating activities in
Second Quarter 2013 was $3.5 million, inclusive of a $3.0 million decrease in working capital,
principally increases in trade payables. The total decrease in operating cash flows of $2.1
million resulted from the $1.4 million difference in the changes in working capital and a $0.7
million decrease in cash-flows provided through earnings. While lower gold prices drove a $1.2
·
million decrease in cash from revenues, this was more than offset by an increase in revenues of
$2.2 million from the production and sale of an increased number of gold and silver ounces. The
increased revenue from the number of ounces sold was offset by increased mining and
production costs. The net decrease in operating cash-flows, exclusive of working capital
changes, of $0.6 million largely resulted from the reclassification of interest expense payments
from investing activities in Second Quarter 2013 to operating activities in Second Quarter 2014.

Net cash used for investing activities in Second Quarter 2014 was $1.4 million and in Second
·
Quarter 2013 was $5.4 million. Significant components of these cash flows are noted below.
$1.5 million was spent for stripping of the North Main pit and $0.1 million was spent for
equipment rebuilds at Briggs in Second Quarter 2014. $10.8 million was spent on mine
development and capital equipment at Pinson and Briggs in Second Quarter 2013. Of the
$10.8 million, $2.1 million was spent at Briggs and $1.6 million of this latter amount was for
stripping of the Goldtooth South pit.
$0.5 million of capitalized interest was recognized for Pinson in Second Quarter 2013, but no
interest was capitalized in Second Quarter 2014.
$5.2 million of pre-production gold sales from Pinson-underground were netted with capital
development in Second Quarter 2013, but sales of $0.1 million by Pinson-underground in
Second Quarter 2014 were recognized as operating revenue.
Briggs expended $0.2 million on stripping activity assets in Second Quarter 2014 and $1.1
million on stripping activity assets in Second Quarter 2013. These relate to production stripping
within active pits and not to pre-stripping of new pits recognized as development.
Cash-collateral required by a surety in connection with outstanding reclamation bonds was
reduced by $1.7 million in Second Quarter 2013. There were no similar refunds in Second
Quarter 2014.
Proceeds from the sales of assets and investments totaled $0.4 million in Second Quarter 2014
and less than $0.1 million in Second Quarter 2013.
Net cash used in financing activities in Second Quarter 2014 was $1.1 million, and in Second
·
Quarter 2013, $1.8 million was used. Significant elements of these cash flows are noted below.
Repayments of equipment financing notes used $0.3 million in Second Quarter 2014 and $0.3
million in Second Quarter 2013.
The 2009 Gold Bonds were retired in 2013, so there was no payment for these in Second
Quarter 2014 and $0.9 million was paid in Second Quarter 2013.
Payments servicing financing leases used $0.8 million in Second Quarter 2014 and $0.6

Results of Operations – First Half 2014 versus First Half 2013
Atna recognized a net loss of $3.9 million, $(0.02) per basic share for the First Half 2014.
These results compare to a net loss of $0.3 million, ($0.00) per basic share, for the First
Half 2013. Significant elements of the $3.6 million decrease in net income between the two
quarters are presented below. A decrease in gold prices, increased interest expense
(interest having largely been capitalized in First Half 2013), realization of a foreign
exchange gain, and the absence of an unrealized gain on derivatives (recognized in First
Half 2013) figured most prominently.
Gold and silver revenues decreased $1.7 million, or 8 percent, to $20.6 million in the First Half
2013 compared to the First Half 2013 with the gold ounces sold increasing from 14,475 ounces
·
to 16,066 ounces, an 11 percent increase, and the average price realized per gold ounce sold
decreasing from $1,670 to $1,275, a 24 percent decrease. The difference in price times the
16,066 ounces sold in First Half 2013 yields a $6.3 million decline in revenue due to price.
Cost of sales, excluding depreciation and adjustments to inventory valuations, was $16.9 million
in First Half 2014 and $16.2 million in First Half 2013, an increase of $0.7 million and 4 percent.
Ounces sold increased 11 percent, so a net 7 percent decrease relates to decreased per unit

ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
In First Half 2014 and First Half 2013, Briggs inventory was written-down to net realizable value
·
less estimated costs of completion. The net write-downs were $0.3 million and $1.4 million,
respectively.
Depreciation and amortization, cost of sales, increased $0.5 million, 15 percent, in First Half
2014 relative to First Half 2013. The units-of-production method of calculating depreciation
generally causes depreciation to vary with the ounces sold, an 11 percent increase. The
increase in depreciation and amortization exceeded the change in ounces by 4 percent due
·
principally to an increasing level of capital per reserve-ounce at Briggs. Please see the
discussion regarding the impact of adjustments to inventory values upon depreciation expense
in the “Summary of Quarterly Results” section above.
General and administrative expenses declined $0.4 million to $2.1 million in First Half 2014
relative to First Half 2013. This generally reflects cost reductions undertaken which were
·
partially offset by recognition of an estimated NOV penalty of $0.2 million in Second Quarter
2014.
Exploration expenses increased $0.2 million to $0.5 million in First Half 2014 principally as work
·
continued on the pre-feasibility study for the Mag open pit at Pinson and due to the absence of a
$0.1 million gain on the sale of a small exploration property in First Half 2013.
Property maintenance expense increased $0.4 million to $0.6 million in First Half 2014 as a
·
result of Pinson-underground having a care and maintenance status for most of the period.
Interest expense increased $2.2 million to $2.5 million in the First Half 2014, principally as
interest was no longer capitalized to Pinson-underground development after June 2013.
·
Effective interest rates and the amortization of loan discounts have increased, also causing
some of the increase in interest expense. Interest paid in cash in First Half 2014 was $1.6
million, whereas it was $1.2 million in First Half 2013.
In First Half 2014, the Company recognized a foreign-exchange gain of $2.3 million. The gain
was realized upon settlement of the loan with Sprott, denominated in Canadian dollars, in
January 2014. $1.5 million of the gain had been recognized in prior periods as Other
·
Comprehensive Income (“OCI”) based on mark-to-market differences. This $1.5 million was
reclassified from OCI to Other income in First Quarter 2014 upon realization. No other material
foreign-exchange gains or losses were realized in recent prior periods.
In First Half 2013, a realized loss of $0.6 million and an unrealized gain of $1.6 million were
recognized for the embedded derivatives in the 2009 Gold Bonds. These bonds were retired in
·
December 2013, and there was only a negligible loss recognized for outstanding forward-sales
positions in First Half 2014.
The Company recognized a loss on the disposition of assets of $0.3 million in First Half 2014,
principally resulting from the sale of an idle rock crusher at the Pinson property. There were no
·
similar events in First Half 2013, however, the Company realized a loss of $0.1 million on the
sale of short term investments in the First Half 2013.
As of June 30, 2014, cash and cash equivalents were $0.7 million, a $0.1 million decrease
since December 31, 2013. The significant elements underlying this net decrease of $0.1
million in cash in First Half 2014 are presented below with comparisons to cash flows in
First Half 2013.
Net cash used in operating activities in First Half 2014 was $2.3 million, inclusive of a $1.5
million increase in working capital, principally an increase in inventory and a decrease in trade
payables, partially offset by a decrease in prepaids. Net cash provided by operating activities in
First Half 2013 was $6.9 million, inclusive of a $4.0 million decrease in working capital,
principally an increase in trade payables and a decrease in inventory. The total decrease in
operating cash flows of $9.2 million resulted from the $5.5 million difference in the changes in
working capital and a $3.7 million decrease in operating cash flows, exclusive of working capital
changes. Lower gold prices drove a $6.3 million decrease in cash from revenues; however, this
·
was partially offset by an increase in revenues of $4.6 million from the production and sale of an
increased number of gold and silver ounces. Briggs operating costs increased $1.5 million due
to higher costs in mining the Goldtooth South pit, due to the greater number of ounces
processed, and due to other factors, but roughly, only $0.4 million of this has as yet affected the
change in cash-flows. The reclassification of interest expense payments from investing activities
in First Half 2013 to operating activities in First Half 2014 led to approximately $1.6 million of the
$3.7 million decrease in cash-flows provided by operations.

and capital equipment at Pinson and Briggs in First Half 2013. Of the $22.4 million, $4.2 million
was spent at Briggs and $2.5 million of this latter amount was for stripping of the Goldtooth
South pit.
$1.2 million of capitalized interest was recognized for Pinson in First Half 2013, but no interest
was capitalized in First Half 2014.
$5.3 million of pre-production gold sales from Pinson-underground were netted with capital
development in First Half 2013, but sales of $0.1 million by Pinson-underground in First Half
2014 were recognized as operating revenue.
Briggs expended $0.7 million on stripping activity assets in First Half 2014 and $1.7 million on
stripping activity assets in First Half 2013. These relate to production stripping within active pits
and not to pre-stripping of new pits recognized as development.
Cash-collateral required by a surety in connection with outstanding reclamation bonds was
reduced by $1.7 million in First Half 2013. There were no similar refunds in First Half 2014.
Proceeds from the sales of assets and investments totaled $1.0 million in First Half 2014 and
$0.2 million in First Half 2013. The principal assets sold in First Half 2014 were an idle rock
crusher and a selection of mineral rights in Montana.
Net cash provided by financing activities in First Half 2014 was $3.8 million, and in First Half
·
2013, $5.9 million was used. Significant elements of these cash flows are noted below.
The note placed with Waterton provided a net $21.3 million in First Half 2014, principally
refinancing the note previously provided by Sprott and other current obligations.
Repayments of notes including principal repayments to Sprott in January 2014 of $15.6 million
and C$2.5 million in February 2013, and payments servicing equipment notes used $16.2

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the Company had no outstanding off-balance
sheet arrangements.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Atna expects that cash requirements over the next 12 months can be met through a
combination of cash flow from the Briggs operations; equipment financing; asset sales;
and existing cash. Supplemental financing, if required, may be generated from the
issuance of debt; equity; new lines of credit; asset sales; or combinations thereof. The
Company’s 2014 budget and recent forecasts indicate that supplemental financing will not
be required; however, this is principally contingent upon Briggs realizing operating cash
flow targets. Funding requirements could be significantly affected by the future price of
gold and any unforeseen, prolonged production disruptions at Briggs. As a result of the
debt refinancing in January of 2014, whereby payment of $22.0 million of current
obligations was deferred until January of 2016, the principal use of funds anticipated
within the next 12 months is the accumulation of cash to fund repayment of this debt.
Small scale operation of the Pinson underground mine commenced in June 2014. No new
capital has been invested in this start-up. The operation is being run in cooperation with
contract miners who are being paid on a “pay-as-you-go basis” from sales proceeds.
Production is initially focused on areas of the mine already developed. Capital is not
currently adequate to undertake significant development programs, however studies and
engineering are underway for Reward, Pinson-underground, and the Mag open-pit at
Pinson, and other projects may be undertaken as funds become available.
As of June 30, 2014, the Company had net working capital (current assets less current
liabilities) of $11.5 million. Current assets included recoverable, in-process gold
inventories of approximately 18,100 ounces at Briggs.
The Company’s net positive cash flow from operating activities in Second Quarter 2014
was $1.4 million; resulting principally from a decrease in working capital of $1.4 million.
The Company’s net cash outflow from operating activities in First Half 2014 was $2.3
million, inclusive of $1.4 million used to increase working capital and $0.9 million used to
sustain operations and resulting in large part from decreased gold prices relative to those
realized in First Half 2013. 8,296 ounces of gold were sold in Second Quarter 2014 at an
average price of $1,297 per ounce. As mining has progressed in the Goldtooth South Pit in
2014, average ore grades increased as mining extended to depth, but ore tonnages and
grades have fallen short of expectations based on geological models. In addition, a
localized slope failure at the bottom of the Goldtooth South pit is impacting ore availability
in July. As a result, forecasted full year gold production at Briggs has been reduced to
30,000 to 40,000 ounces of gold. Development of the Briggs Main North Pit is underway.
The top of the ore zone has been reached, and this pit is expected to be an ore source
commencing in July. Briggs’ total capital spending in 2014 is expected to be between $3.6
million and $4.2 million, inclusive of equipment rebuilds expected to be financed through
leases and equipment-notes.
Past cash requirements were met through the use of a combination of operating cash
flows, asset sales, and debt and equity transactions as fully discussed in the annual report
on Form 20-F.

In January 2014, as part of the consideration for structuring a new credit facility, Atna, after
receipt of approval from the TSX, issued to Waterton 10,000,000 non-transferable
common-share purchase-warrants (the “Lender Warrants”). Each Lender Warrant entitles
Waterton to acquire one common share of the Company at an exercise price of C$0.25 per
common share for a period of three years expiring on January 31, 2017. The Lender
Warrants are subject to a four-month hold period in Canada.
Options and RSU’s are granted and issued in accordance with the Company’s
compensation plans.
Debt Issuance: In First Half 2014, equipment-financing of $1.0 million was undertaken and
equipment-financing of $1.9 million was repaid.
Sprott was repaid in full in January 2014 upon the refinancing discussed below. The
Company had arranged the C$20 million line of credit with Sprott to finance the acquisition
of the remaining 70 percent interest of Pinson and to commence development of the
Pinson-underground mine in 2011. The line of credit with Sprott was reduced to C$17.5
million in February of 2013 via a C$2.5 million repayment.
On January 31, 2014, the Company entered into a $22.0 million credit facility agreement
(the “Agreement”) with Waterton Precious Metals Fund II Cayman, LP (“Waterton”). The
Company used this new credit facility to pay the current liability due Sprott of
approximately C$18.1 million under the Company’s existing secured credit facility, and the
balance for general working capital purposes including a reduction in trade payables.
Under the terms of the Agreement, the credit facility is a non-revolving, senior secured
facility, that bears interest at a coupon-rate of 10% per annum and matures on the earlier of
(i) the date that is 24 months following the date of the Agreement (or if the facility has been
accelerated in the event of a default, the date on which Waterton demands repayment),
and (ii) the date all amounts owing under the credit facility are voluntarily or mandatorily
prepaid in full, without a repayment penalty. On the maturity date, Atna will pay to Waterton
(i) a cash fee equal to 5% of the credit facility, and (ii) if the payment date occurs on or after
the first anniversary of the date of the Agreement, the Company will pay an additional cash
fee equal to 5% of the credit facility less any prepayments made during the first 12 months
of the Agreement. As consideration for structuring the credit facility, Atna paid to Waterton
a cash structuring fee of US$440,000 and issued to Waterton 10,000,000 non-transferrable
common share purchase warrants, previously described. Assets owned by Atna in
Canyon Resources Corp. (CRC) and assets owned by CRC in CR Briggs Corporation, CR
Montana Corporation, CR Reward Corporation, and Atna Resources Inc. were pledged as
security against the Waterton Loan. Covenants also restrict equipment financings to $12
million, preclude the issuance of new debt (other than Permitted Debt), and require
Waterton’s consent for material asset sales. The loan origination costs were capitalized
and will be amortized over the minimum contractual life of the loan facility.
Investing Transactions
Disposition of Assets: In First Half 2014, the Company received $0.1 million from the sale
of investments. The investments sold were stock in other mining companies acquired in
exchange for joint venture or property option interests.

ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
In First Half 2014, the Company received $0.9 million from the sale of non-core assets;
principally certain mineral rights and an idle rock crusher.
Capital Expenditures: Cash expended for mine development and property was $1.9 million
and for stripping activity assets was $0.7 million in First Half 2014. Capital expenditures are
approved for expenditure by the Company on a case-by-case basis, and capital spending
may be modified over time based on judgments as to potential benefits, project
requirements and the availability of funds.
Outstanding Warrants
As previously described, 10,000,000 non-transferable common share purchase warrants
were issued to Waterton in January 2014. The following table summarizes warrants
outstanding as of June 30, 2014.

Surety Bonds
All surety bonds are subject to annual review and adjustment. Additional permitting,
extension of mine life, areas of mining activity and changes in the regulatory environment
affect surety requirements.
Briggs operates under permits granted by various agencies including the BLM, Inyo
County, California, the California Department of Conservation, and the Lahontan Regional
Water Quality Control Board. The Company has posted reclamation bonds and cash with
these agencies in the amount of $4.5 million virtually all of which is supported by a surety.
Restricted cash held as collateral by the surety and a government agency amounts to $1.3
million at June 30, 2014.
The total bonding requirement for Reward was determined to be $6.2 million. In July 2010,
the Company posted with the State of Nevada an initial bond backed by surety of $0.9
million to cover development activities that include the installation of fencing, site road
improvements, in-fill drilling, water wells and related pipelines, other earthwork and
installation of power lines and facilities. The Company has placed $0.3 million into a
collateral account related to the surety bond. The remaining $5.3 million in bonding is not
expected to be required until mine development and construction are continued.
The total bonding requirement for Pinson is roughly $1.7 million of which Atna has already
placed one bond of $0.8 million. The Company has placed $0.2 million into a collateral
account related to the surety bond. The remainder of the bonds, approximately $0.9
million, is pending review by Federal and State agencies, and is expected to be placed in
Third Quarter 2014.
The Company has on deposit with the MDEQ $2.4 million in an interest-bearing account for
reclamation at the Kendall Mine. The Company placed an additional bond of $0.2 million
with the MDEQ in 2012 as a special purpose bond in connection with the 2011 approval of
the final leach pad capping plan. The surety of the latter bond is holding $0.1 million in
collateral.
Columbia and Clover, combined, have placed another $0.2 million in reclamation bonds
and have less than $0.1 million in collateral on deposit with the surety.

Related Party Transactions
During 2013, First Half 2014, and through the Report Date, the Company had no related
party transactions.
Financial Instruments
Held-to-maturity investments, loans, receivables and other financial liabilities are
measured at amortized cost. Held-for-trading financial assets and liabilities and available-
for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Derivative financial instruments are
classified as held-for-trading and are recorded at fair value, unless exempted as a normal
purchase and sale arrangement. Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments
are recorded in earnings unless the instruments are designated and meet the
requirements for accounting treatment as a hedge. The Company has not designated its
derivative contracts as hedges and therefore does not employ hedge accounting. The
Company has determined the estimated fair values of its financial instruments based on
appropriate valuation methodologies as of the balance sheet dates; however,
considerable judgment is required to develop these estimates. Realized gains and losses
on financial instruments are disclosed within operating cash flow.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
·Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either
·
directly or indirectly; and
·Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The following table provides a comparison of fair values and carrying values as of:

The value of warrants issued by the Company is a non-recurring, fair value estimate
determined using Level 3 inputs. The brokers’ warrants issued in 2012 were determined to
have a fair value of C$0.3 million using a Black-Scholes model and based on the
Company’s share price at issuance, an expected life of 1.5 years, expected volatility of 55
percent, and a risk-free rate of 0.22 percent. These brokers’ warrants expired unused in the
first quarter of 2014.
In the First Quarter 2014, the Company issued 10,000,000 common-share purchase-
warrants with an exercise price of C$0.25 per common share for a three-year term to
Waterton. The warrants were determined to have a non-recurring fair value of $0.5 million;
determined using a Black-Scholes model using the Company’s share price at issuance, an
expected life of three years, expected volatility of 60 percent, and a risk-free rate of 1.21
percent.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
The following table presents the Company’s non-financial liabilities that were measured at
fair value on a recurring basis by level within the fair value hierarchy as of the dates
indicated.

The Company uses estimated amounts and timing for expected future reclamation costs,
the current market-based discount rate in consideration of the risks specific to the liability,
and other assumptions to determine AROs. Accordingly, the ARO fair value is based on
unobservable pricing inputs and is included within the Level 3 fair value hierarchy. There
were no Level 1 or Level 2 fair value estimates.
Derivatives
At June 30, 2014, the Company had sold 1,600 ounces forward for September delivery at
an average price of $1,312 per ounce, and these forwards had a fair-value-liability of
$4,800. The Company entered into and used other forward-sales contracts within the First
Half 2014, but no other derivatives were outstanding at quarter-end. Embedded forwards
within the 2009 Gold Bonds were settled as part of the retirement of those bonds in
December 2013.
Financial Risk Management
The Company is exposed to a number of financial risks including market risks, credit risks
and liquidity risks. Market risks include commodity price risk, security price risk, foreign
exchange risk, and fair value interest rate risk. The Company has risk management
policies and programs that involve senior management and when appropriate, the Board
of Directors of the Company (the “Board”). The main purpose of these policies and
programs is to manage cash flow and raise financing as required and in a timely fashion
for the Company’s development programs. The Company may use various financial
instruments to manage related risks. It is the Company’s policy that no trading in
derivatives for speculative purposes shall be undertaken.
Gold price risk: The Company’s primary product is gold. The value of the Company’s
inventory and long-lived assets, its earnings and its operating cash flows are significantly
impacted by the market price of gold. The market price of gold and the value of mineral
interests related thereto have fluctuated widely and are affected by numerous factors
beyond the control of the Company. These factors include international economic and
political conditions, expectations of inflation, international currency exchange rates,
interest rates, global or regional consumptive patterns, speculative activities, changes in
production due to mine development and improved mining and production methods,
metal stock levels, governmental regulations, and central bank policies. The exact effect of
these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may
result in the Company not receiving a profit or acceptable rate of return on invested capital
or the investment not retaining its value.
For Second Quarter 2014, if the price of gold averaged 10 percent higher or lower per
ounce, the Company would have recorded an increase or decrease in revenue of
approximately $1.1 million, respectively. For Second Quarter 2013, if the price of gold
averaged 10 percent higher or lower per ounce, the Company would have recorded an
increase or decrease in revenue of approximately $1.0 million, respectively.
The Company may enter into gold derivative contracts (hedges) to mitigate the impacts of
lower gold prices on its operations. Management and the Board have set a gold hedge
limit of 50 percent of annual production plus a reserve tail of 25 percent of the life-of-mine
production. The gold derivative contracts may include the purchase of put options and the
sale of call options, which in some cases are structured as a collar, and forward gold
sales, including embedded derivatives. Derivative financial instruments are recorded at
fair value, and hedge accounting has not been employed.
-27-
ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Liquidity risk: Liquidity risk represents the risk that the Company cannot fund its current
operations and obligations. This risk arises in turn primarily from operating and business
risks that have the potential to disrupt cash flows, inclusive of risks of material changes in
gold prices, production schedules and outputs, operating costs, spending on or timing of
development, and changes in regulations. Cash flow forecasting is performed regularly in
aggregate for the Company with the objective of managing operating, investing, and
financing cash flows to maintain a continuity of funding.
Economic factors beyond the Company’s control may also make additional funding
temporarily unavailable. Should cash flows from operations and existing cash be
insufficient to meet current obligations, refinancing of debt obligations, the sale of assets,
or an equity issuance would be necessary, and there is no assurance that such financing
activities would be successful.
Under the credit agreement with Waterton, assets owned by Atna in Canyon Resources
Corp. (CRC) and assets owned by CRC in CR Briggs Corporation, CR Montana
Corporation, CR Reward Corporation, and Atna Resources Inc. were pledged as security.
Covenants restrict equipment financings to $12 million and require Waterton’s consent for
material asset sales. The Agreement precludes additional borrowings and guarantees of
debt, except for Permitted Debt and Liens, and allows early prepayments without
incurrence of a prepayment fee.
The tables below summarize the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities
based on contractual undiscounted payments as of the dates indicated. The note
refinancing subsequent to year-end 2013 has been reflected in the table as of December
31, 2013 by moving the C$17.5 million liability to the 1-3 year column, consistent with terms
under the Waterton Agreement. The amounts shown are based on payment obligations
and exclude unamortized discounts with which these amounts are combined on the
balance sheets.

ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Capital management: The primary objectives of the Company’s capital management are to
maintain healthy cash balances and healthy capital ratios in order to support its
operations and development, limit the risks of default on debt obligations, and maximize
shareholder value. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to
it in light of business and economic conditions. To date, the Company has not declared or
paid any dividends. The Company has issued new shares and may again in order to
maintain or adjust its capital structure. The Company has the practice of developing its
mines at a controlled and measured pace in order to manage cash and financial leverage.
Management principally considers the debt to total asset ratio as a measure of financial
leverage and overall capital structure; such ratio being 36 percent at June 30, 2014 and 32
percent at December 31, 2013. Long-term cash flow forecasts are prepared at least
annually for the Company with the objective of managing cash, debt levels, rates of
development, and the long-term capital structure.
Foreign exchange risk: A debt obligation of C$17.5 million was denominated in Canadian
dollars as of December 31, 2013. A foreign exchange gain of $2.3 million was realized in
the First Quarter 2014 upon settlement of this debt obligation. Other than for this debt, now
retired, the Company’s assets, liabilities, revenues and costs are primarily denominated in
USD, and are not significantly impacted by foreign exchange risks.
One of the market conditions that may affect the price of gold is the extent to which gold is
viewed as a safe-haven or hedge against fluctuations in major currencies such as the US
dollar and the Euro. Fluctuations in foreign exchange may therefore have a significant
indirect impact upon the Company.
Credit and customer risks: Credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if
counterparties failed to perform as contracted. Credit risks arise from market, industry,
and individual counterparty conditions. Concentrations of credit risk, on or off balance
sheet, exist for counterparties when they have similar economic characteristics that would
cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in
economic or other conditions. The Company manages counterparty credit risk by
monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties.
The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk in connection with maintaining its
cash balances primarily in U.S. and Canadian financial institutions in amounts in excess of
levels insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Canada Deposit
Insurance Corporation. Restricted cash held as collateral against surety bonds is invested
by the surety-trustee in certificates of deposit and US Treasury instruments.
Sales of gold by Briggs expose the Company to the credit risk of nonpayment by the
buyer. Briggs sells all of its gold to one or two customers with payment terms of 0 to 14
days. At any one time, the level of receivable is usually less than two percent of the
Company’s total annual revenues. Due to the global and liquid markets for gold,
geographic and customer concentrations are considered to pose immaterial risks.
Hedges, including forward sales of gold, expose the Company to a credit risk from non-
performance by the counterparties under the contract. To date, the Company has
undertaken little credit risk with counterparties for hedges, however this risk may increase
in the future to the extent more hedging is undertaken or prices of the underlying
commodities vary more dramatically during the term of the hedges. By agreement with
Waterton, the Company will not enter into hedges exposing it to more than a cumulative
$1.0 million credit risk.
Pinson-underground sells ore and/or doré and generates trade receivables that give rise
to credit risk. Pinson has a contract to sell oxide ore to Newmont Mining Corp. with 90
percent of the sales price being payable within 10 days and the 10 percent balance being
due within a month. Pinson has a life-of-mine contract to place, at its option, sulfide ore
with a separate third-party processor, Barrick Gold Corporation, who will also buy the
resultant doré under agreed upon terms.
Equity securities price risk: The Company is exposed to equity securities price risk
because of investments held as available-for-sale. These securities have typically been
received in payment from joint venture or other business partners for obligations due. The
fair value balances of available-for-sale securities at June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013
were nil and $56,400, respectively, representing the maximum potential losses from
changes in prices of equity investments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Fair value interest rate risk: The Company has only entered into debt agreements with
fixed interest rates. Fixed interest rates expose the Company to fair value interest rate
risks. There is the qualitative risk that a fixed rate liability will become uncompetitive in the
future as market rates decline or the Company’s credit position improves. There is a
quantitative risk that the interest rate will increase upon refinancing of debt obligations in
the future as market rates increase or the Company’s credit position deteriorates. The
Company’s other qualitative interest rate risk arises from the mismatch of fixed rate
liabilities and floating rate assets. Management of the fair value interest rate risk involves
taking into consideration the duration of debt agreements, refinancing penalties, options
to renew existing positions, the availability of floating–rate debt and other alternative
financing.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Controls over Financial Reporting
The Company's president and chief executive officer and vice president and chief
financial officer have designed, or caused to be designed under their supervision,
disclosure controls and procedures (“DC&P”) to provide reasonable assurance that: (i)
material information relating to the Company is made known to them by others within the
organization in a timely manner; and (ii) information required to be disclosed by the
Company in its annual filings, interim filings or other reports filed or submitted by it under
securities legislation is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified in securities legislation.
The chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the Company have designed, or
caused to be designed, under their supervision, internal controls over financial reporting
(“ICFR”) and have caused these controls to operate effectively under their supervision in
order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with IFRS.
There has been no change in the Company’s DC&P or ICFR that occurred during First
Half 2014 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s DC&P or ICFR. Internal and external audit tests were performed in 2013
providing reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of the Company’s DC&P or ICFR.
The Company and the certifying officers have concluded that DC&P and ICFR were
effective at June 30, 2014.
-30-
ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
Because of their inherent limitations, ICFR and DC&P may not prevent or detect
misstatements, errors or fraud. Control systems, no matter how well conceived or
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
controls are met.
Corporate Governance
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation and presentation of the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, Management Discussion and
Analysis (“MD&A”) and other information contained in public reports. Additionally, it is
management’s responsibility to ensure the Company complies with the laws and
regulations applicable to its activities.
The Company’s management is held accountable to the Board. Directors are elected to
the Board by the shareholders of the Company on an annual basis. The Board is
responsible for reviewing and approving the annual audited consolidated financial
statements and MD&A. Responsibility for the review and recommendation to the Board of
approval of the Company’s quarterly unaudited interim condensed financial statements
and MD&A is delegated by the Board to the Audit Committee, which is comprised of three
directors, all of whom are independent of management. Additionally, the Audit Committee
pre-approves audit and non-audit services provided by the Company’s auditors.
The auditors are appointed annually by the shareholders of the Company to conduct an
audit of the financial statements in accordance with IFRS. The external auditors have
complete access to the Audit Committee to discuss the audit, financial reporting and
related matters resulting from the annual audit as well as assist the members of the Audit
Committee in discharging their corporate governance responsibilities.
Executive officers of the Company are retained under Employment Agreements. These
Agreements have a one-year term and are automatically renewable unless the Company
provides notification that the contract will not be renewed at least 60 days prior to the end
of the Term.
Recently issued Financial Accounting Standards and their impact upon the Company
As noted in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2013
and 2012, the Company early adopted IFRS 9 and the amendments to IAS 36.
IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – On May 28, 2014, the ISAB issued
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This Standard outlines a single
comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue from contracts with
customers. It supersedes current revenue recognition guidance including IAS 18
Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and related interpretations. The key principle of
this Standard is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers for an amount that reflects its expected consideration. The
Standard introduces far more prescriptive and detailed implementation guidance than was
included in IAS 18, IAS 11 and the related interpretations. The effective date for the
Standard is for reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017, with earlier
adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact, if any.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Management is required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts
reported in the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures. By their nature,
these estimates and judgments are subject to measurement uncertainty and the effect on
the financial statements of changes in such estimates and judgments in future periods
could be significant.
-31-
ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
The more significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions
relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units-of-
production amortization; distinguishing deferred stripping costs related to development
and production from routine mining costs; future cash flow estimates and costs affecting
net-realizable-values of inventory, long-term asset impairments, and liquidity; the
recoverability and timing of gold production from the heap leach process affecting gold
inventories; costs to complete in-process inventories, environmental, reclamation and
closure obligations; fair value of share-based compensation; fair value of financial
instruments and nonmonetary transactions; future profitability affecting deferred tax
assets and liabilities; useful lives of assets; asset depreciation and amortization rates; and
provisions for any legal cases or governmental penalties.
Areas of judgment that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the
financial statements include: capitalization and impairment of exploration, technical and
feasibility studies, development expenditures, and other long-term asset expenditures;
recognition of deferred tax assets; the determination of contingent liabilities;
determination of commencement of commercial production; classification of leases as
finance or operating; classification of financial instruments; determination of functional
currencies and foreign exchange gains and losses within income; and the timing of
revenue recognition.
Risks and Uncertainties
Mining is a competitive and capital intensive business, characterized by a number of
significant risks including, among other things, unprofitable efforts resulting not only from
the failure to discover mineral deposits but from finding mineral deposits, which, though
present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production. The
extraction of minerals acquired or discovered by the Company may be affected by
numerous factors which are beyond the control of the Company and which cannot be
accurately predicted, such as the worldwide economy, the price of gold and other
minerals, the proximity and capacity of processing facilities, and such other factors as
government regulation, including regulations relating to royalties, changes in taxation
rates, increased fees, allowable production methods, controls over importing and
exporting minerals, and environmental regulations, any of which could result in the
Company not receiving an adequate return on invested capital.
The mining industry in general is intensely competitive and there is no assurance that,
even if commercial quantities of mineral resources are discovered, a profitable market will
exist for their sale. Factors beyond the control of the Company may affect the marketability
of any mineral occurrences discovered. The price of gold and silver has experienced
volatile and significant movement over short periods of time, and is affected by numerous
factors beyond the control of the Company, including international economic and political
trends, expectations of inflation or deflation, currency exchange fluctuations, interest
rates and global or regional consumption patterns, speculative activities, including
exchange traded funds, changes in supply due to new discoveries, and improved mining
and production methods.
All phases of the Company’s operations are subject to environmental regulation in the
various jurisdictions in which it operates. Environmental legislation is evolving in a
manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and
penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed
projects and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers,
directors and employees. There is no assurance that future changes in environmental
regulations, if any, will not adversely affect the Company’s operations or its ability to
develop its properties economically or in a timely fashion. Before production may
commence on any property, the Company must obtain regulatory and environmental
approvals and permits. There is no assurance such approvals and permits will be
obtained on a timely basis, if at all. Costs of compliance with environmental and other
regulations may reduce profitability, or preclude the economic development of a property.
-32-
ATNA RESOURCES LTD.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
In those jurisdictions where the Company has property interests, the Company makes a
search of mining records in accordance with mining industry practices to confirm
satisfactory title to properties in which it holds or intends to acquire an interest, but does
not obtain title insurance with respect to such properties. There is the possibility that title
to one or more of its properties might be defective because of errors or omissions in the
chain of title. The ownership and validity of mining claims and concessions are often
uncertain and may be contested. The Company is not aware of any challenges to the
location or area of its mineral claims. There is no guarantee, however, that title to the
Company’s properties and concessions will not be challenged or impugned in the future.
The properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or transfers, and title may
be affected by undetected defects.
The business of mineral exploration and extraction involves a high degree of risk and very
few properties ultimately achieve commercial production. The ability of the Company to
replace production in the future is dependent on its ability to conduct exploration,
development and mining operations. The Company may need to raise capital through the
use of equity, debt, asset sales, joint ventures, or by other means in order to fund
exploration, development and mining operations. In turn, the Company’s ability to raise
capital depends in part upon the market’s perception of its management and properties,
but also upon the price of gold and silver and the marketability of the Company’s
securities. Servicing existing debt, previously incurred to finance projects, may hamper
the Company’s ability to invest in new projects and obtain new financing. There is no
assurance that the Company’s production activities or financing activities will be
successful in providing the funds necessary to fund ongoing business activities.
Recovery of gold and silver from ore is impacted by many factors that create uncertainty.
Factors impacting gold and silver recovery include variation in crushed-ore size, ore
grade, rock type, solution concentration, lime addition, temperature, rainfall, irrigation time,
pressure stripping, refining, timely implementation of ore placement on the leach pad, third
party ore processing limitations or constraints, ability to deliver ores to third parties, and
other associated factors. The cost structure of recovering metal is also impacted by
numerous variables including ore grade and recovery, fuel and consumable costs, labor
and benefit costs, equipment operating and maintenance costs and numerous other
factors. Other production risk factors may include labor strife, slope or roof failure, lack of
skilled labor and management, equipment failures, availability of mining equipment,
availability of consumables, weather and other operational factors.
The Company operates in the US. As such, the Company’s business is subject to
regulation by numerous county, state and federal regulatory agencies that include, but are
not limited to, Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”), US Department of
Occupational Safety and Health (“OSHA”) Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land
Management (“BLM”), US Forest Service (“USFS”) US Department of Alcohol Tobacco
and Firearms (“BATF”), US Department of Homeland Security, US Environmental
Protection Agency (“EPA”), US Corp of Engineers, California Department of Occupational
Safety and Health (“CAL-OSHA”), Great Basin Unified Air Pollution Control District,
California Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Fish and Game,
California Environmental Protection Agency (“CEPA”), Nevada Division of Environmental
Protection (“NDEP”), Inyo County California, Nye County Nevada, and Humboldt County
Nevada. US legislation is trending toward giving regulatory agencies increased power and
rights to require stricter standards and enforcement, levy increased fines and penalties for
non-compliance, and to require a heightened degree of responsibility for companies,
officers, directors and employees. There is no assurance that stricter standards and future
changes in regulation, if any, will not adversely affect the Company’s operations.
Another form of regulatory risk is the potential change in income, severance, or other tax
rates and laws that could reduce future profitability and impair deferred tax assets. The
Company has only taken more-likely-than-not positions in determining its deferred tax
assets.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
For the Quarter Ended June 30th, 2014
The Company may enter into gold hedging contracts in order to protect the future
operating cash flows of its Briggs Mine. The Company also enters into purchase
agreements for its future diesel fuel consumption that may protect against the increasing
cost of diesel fuel. The Company’s goal is to protect the Company’s cash flows from
declining gold prices or increasing diesel prices. The Company’s primary risk related to
gold hedging may result from a shortfall of expected gold production that may compound
the potential reduction in cash flows. The Company’s primary risk mitigation for hedge
transactions is its policy to limit net hedge levels to 50 percent of its expected gold
production or diesel usage. Although a hedging program is designed to protect cash flow
from a decline in the price of gold or rise in the price of diesel fuel, it could also limit the
Company’s gold realizations during periods of increased gold prices or could increase
diesel costs during periods of low diesel prices.
For additional information on risk factors, please refer to the risk factors section of the
Company’s Form 20-F for 2013, which can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com.

Statements relating to mineral reserves and resources are deemed to be forward-looking
statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and
assumptions, that the mineral reserves and resources described exist in the quantities
predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future. Estimated values of
future net revenue do not represent fair market value. There is no certainty that it will be
commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources.
Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual
actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking
statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as
anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that forward-looking
statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ
materially from those anticipated in such statements. The Company’s forward-looking
statements are based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management as of the
date the statements are made, and the Company does not assume any obligation to
update any forward-looking statements if circumstances or management’s beliefs,
expectations or opinions should change, except as required by law. For reasons set forth
above, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Forward-
looking statements are made as of the Report Date and other than as required by
applicable securities laws, the Company assumes no obligation to update or revise such
forward-looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances.
Cautionary Note to US Investors – The SEC permits US mining companies, in their filings
with the SEC, to disclose only those mineral deposits that a company can economically
and legally extract or produce. We use certain terms in this report, such as “measured,”
“indicated,” and “inferred” mineral resources which the SEC guidelines generally prohibit
US registered companies from including in their filings with the SEC. US Investors are
urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F which may be obtained from us
or viewed on the SEC website at http://www.sec.gov.
