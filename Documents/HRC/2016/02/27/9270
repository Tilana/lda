<p><b>Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> At the heart of the right to the highest attainable standard of health lies an effective and 
integrated health system, encompassing health care and the underlying determinants of health, 
responsive to national and local priorities, and accessible to all. 
</p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/108, requested the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health to identify and explore the key features of an effective, integrated and accessible health 
system from the perspective of the right to health, bearing in mind the level of development of 
countries. This report is a response to that request.  
</p>
<p> There is a growing recognition that a strong health system is an essential element of a 
healthy and equitable society. In any society, an effective health system is a core social 
institution, no less than a fair justice system or democratic political system. However, according 
to a recent publication of the World Health Organization, health systems in many countries are 
failing and collapsing. 
</p>
<p> The report briefly identifies some of the historical landmarks in the development of health 
systems, such as the Declaration of Alma-Ata on primary health care (1978). Taking into 
account health good practices, as well as the right to the highest attainable standard of health, the 
report identifies a general approach to strengthening health systems (chap. II, sect. C). This 
general approach should be applied, consistently and systematically, across the numerous 
elements - or &#8220;building blocks&#8221; - that together constitute a functioning health system. By way of 
illustration, the report takes the general approach outlined in the report and begins to apply it to 
two of the health system &#8220;building blocks&#8221; (chap. II, sect. E). 
</p>
<p> Section F signals how the right to a fair trial has helped to strengthen court systems and 
argues that, in a similar way, the right to the highest attainable standard of health can help to 
strengthen health systems. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/29, extended the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health (&#8220;right to the highest attainable standard of health&#8221; or &#8220;right to 
health&#8221;) set out in the Commission on Human Rights resolutions 2002/31 and 2004/27. The 
present report is submitted in accordance with that resolution.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur submitted an interim report to the General Assembly (A/62/214) 
at its sixty-second session in October 2007, in which three issues were considered. The first is 
how to prioritize health interventions, given that budgets are finite. Second, the report outlines a 
right-to-health impact assessment methodology. Third, it highlights the vital importance of 
underlying determinants of health, with particular reference to safe water and adequate 
sanitation. The report also includes an overview of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities between 
November 2006 and July 2007.  
</p>
<p>3. Between July and December 2007, the Special Rapporteur undertook two missions - to 
Colombia (in September), focusing on aerial sprayings of illicit coca crops along the border with 
Ecuador, and India (in November) on maternal mortality. Reports thereon will be submitted to 
the Human Rights Council in September 2008. 
</p>
<p>4. In August 2007, as part of the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation 
International Lecture Series on Population Issues, the Special Rapporteur gave a lecture on &#8220;The 
Millennium Development Goals and the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health&#8221;, in 
Abuja, Nigeria.  
</p><p>5. On 19 September 2007, the draft Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies 
in relation to Access to Medicines were launched, initiating a lengthy process of public 
consultation. In the light of this ongoing process, the revised final draft Guidelines will be 
published in 2008. 
</p>
<p>6. While at the University of Toronto, the Special Rapporteur also gave a public lecture on 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health. During the same month, he also addressed a 
London conference organized by Action for Global Health.  
</p>
<p>7. In October 2007, the Special Rapporteur was a keynote speaker at the 8th International 
Health Impact Assessment Conference, which took place in Dublin, Ireland. The Special 
Rapporteur also held a consultation, hosted by the British Medical Association, on accountability 
and the right to health. In New York, the Special Rapporteur met with the Open Society Institute 
to discuss his work on HIV/AIDS. Furthermore, he participated in a consultation, organized by 
the Brazilian Permanent Mission to the United Nations, on the draft Human Rights Guidelines 
for Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to Medicines<i>.</i> Also in October, the Special 
Rapporteur spoke at the launch, which took place at the Women Deliver Conference in London, 
of the International Initiative on Maternal Mortality and Human Rights.</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>8. In November, the Special Rapporteur co-organized with the United Nations Population 
Fund (UNFPA) a workshop on mainstreaming sexual and reproductive health rights into the 
work of the United Nations human rights system. The workshop was hosted by the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Geneva.  
</p>
<p>9. In December, the Special Rapporteur gave the first annual lecture on malaria and human 
rights, co-organized by the UK Coalition against Malaria and the European Alliance Against 
Malaria. 
</p>
<p>10. Throughout the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur had a number of consultations, in 
addition to those already mentioned, on the draft Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical 
Companies in relation to Access to Medicines<i>, </i>including with the International Federation of 
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA) and the pharmaceutical company 
Novo Nordisk. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur is extremely grateful to all those who have given him the benefit 
of their advice, support and time. 
</p>
<p><b>II. HEALTH SYSTEMS AND THE RIGHT TO THE HIGHEST  
ATTAINABLE STANDARD OF HEALTH 
</b></p>
<p>12. The last six decades of international and domestic policy and practice have confirmed that 
health is not only a human rights issue but also a fundamental building block of sustainable 
development, poverty reduction and economic prosperity. Recently, there has also been growing 
recognition that a strong health system is an essential element of a healthy and equitable society. 
In any society, an effective health system is a core institution, no less than a fair justice system or 
democratic political system.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>13. Yet according to a recent publication of the World Health Organization (WHO), health 
systems in many countries are failing and collapsing. &#8220;In too many countries&#8221; health systems 
&#8220;are on the point of collapse, or are accessible only to particular groups in the population&#8221;.<b>2</b> 
Too often health systems &#8220;are inequitable, regressive and unsafe&#8221;. &#8220;Health outcomes are 
unacceptably low across much of the developing world, and the persistence of deep inequities in 
health status is a problem from which no country in the world is exempt. At the centre of this 
human crisis is a failure of health systems.&#8221;<b>3
</b></p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. WHO also confirms that sustainable development depends on effective health systems: &#8220;It 
will be impossible to achieve national and international goals - including the Millennium 
Development Goals - without greater and more effective investment in health systems and 
services.&#8221;<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>15. At the heart of the right to the highest attainable standard of health lies an effective and 
integrated health system, encompassing health care and the underlying determinants of health, 
which is responsive to national and local priorities, and accessible to all. Without such a health 
system, the right to the highest attainable standard of health can never be realized. 
</p>
<p>16. Thus, it is only through building and strengthening health systems that it will be possible to 
secure sustainable development, poverty reduction, economic prosperity, improved health for 
individuals and populations, as well as the right to the highest attainable standard of health. 
</p>
<p>17. In decision 2/108, the Human Rights Council requested the Special Rapporteur, when 
presenting his report, to consider the possibility of identifying and exploring &#8220;the key features of 
an effective, integrated and accessible health system&#8221;. He was asked to undertake this task 
&#8220;bearing in mind the level of development of countries and from the perspective of the right to 
the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>18. This report looks at health systems from the perspective of the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health, drawing on numerous consultations, as well as consideration of 
extensive literature from the fields of both medicine and public health.<b>5</b> Crucially, the chapter is 
informed by an understanding of health good practices, as well as the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health. All of the features and measures identified here are already found 
in some health systems, recognized in some international health instruments (such as the 
Declaration of Alma-Ata) or advocated in the health literature. But they are not usually 
recognized as human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>19. The report outlines how the right to the highest attainable standard of health underpins and 
reinforces an effective, integrated, accessible health system - and why this is important. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Health systems: some historical landmarks6 
</b></p>
<p>20. Health systems of some sort have existed as long as people have tried to protect their 
health and treat diseases, but organized health systems are barely 100 years old, even in 
industrialized countries. They are political and social institutions, and usually include the State, 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  Ibid., p. v. 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  This report has been enriched by consultations in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland, the United States of America, New Zealand, Australia, Switzerland, Italy and 
Zimbabwe. The consultations have included a wide range of stakeholders from developing and 
developed countries, including indigenous people. The Special Rapporteur is very grateful to all 
those who organized, and participated in, these meetings.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>private and voluntary sectors. Many health systems have gone through several, sometimes 
parallel and competing, generations of development and reform, shaped by national and 
international values and goals. 
</p>
<p>21. One of the first attempts to unify thinking about health within a single policy framework 
was embodied in the Declaration of Alma-Ata on primary health care, agreed by Ministers of 
Health from throughout the world and adopted on 12 September 1978 at the International 
Conference on Primary Health Care. This seminal Declaration does not seek to address health 
systems in their entirety;<b>7</b> instead, it focuses on some vital components of an effective health 
system and still remains very relevant to health systems strengthening. 
</p>
<p>22. The Declaration begins by affirming that the attainment of the highest possible level of 
health is a fundamental human right. Several principal themes recur throughout the Declaration, 
all of which are relevant to health systems in both developed and developing countries:<b>8</b> 
</p>
<p>(a) The importance of equity; 
</p>
<p>(b) The need for community participation; 
</p>
<p>(c) The need for a multisectoral approach to health problems; 
</p>
<p>(d) The need for effective planning; 
</p>
<p>(e) The importance of integrated referral systems; 
</p>
<p>(f) An emphasis on health-promotional activities; 
</p>
<p>(g) The critical role of suitably trained human resources; 
</p>
<p>(h) The importance of international cooperation. 
</p>
<p>23. In addition to these themes, the Declaration highlights a number of essential health 
interventions: 
</p>
<p>(a) Education concerning prevailing health problems; 
</p>
<p>(b) Promotion of food supply and proper nutrition; 
</p>
<p>(c) Adequate supply of safe water and basic sanitation; 
</p>
<p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>(d) Maternal and child health care, including family planning; 
</p>
<p>(e) Immunization against major infectious diseases; 
(f) Prevention and control of locally endemic diseases; 
</p>
<p>(g) Appropriate treatment of common diseases and injuries; 
(h) Provision of essential drugs. 
</p>
<p>24. Since 1978, a number of other issues - such as gender, the environment, disability, mental 
health, traditional health systems, the role of the private sector, and accountability - have been 
increasingly recognized as important. When revisiting the Declaration, they need to be taken into 
account. 
</p>
<p>25. One of the most striking characteristics of the Declaration is that it encompasses the 
interrelated domains of medicine, public health and human rights. For example, it includes 
medical care, such as access to essential drugs, and public health, such as community 
participation and access to safe water, all of which are major preoccupations of the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health. The Declaration is situated on the common ground between 
medicine, public health and human rights. This convergence is reinforced by Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health (art. 12), paragraph 43, according to which &#8220;the Declaration of 
Alma-Ata provides compelling guidance on the core obligations arising from&#8221; the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health. 
</p>
<p>26. Since its adoption, some of the elements of the Declaration have developed. The Ottawa 
Charter for Health Promotion (1986), for example, laid the foundations of modern health 
promotion. Looking beyond a curative-oriented health sector, the Charter emphasizes the vital 
role of multisectoral prevention and promotion in relation to many health problems. 
</p>
<p>27. For the most part, however, the central messages of the Declaration of Alma-Ata were 
obscured in the 1980s and 1990s. For a variety of reasons, there was a shift towards vertical (or 
selective) biomedical interventions. Driven by neoliberal economics, structural adjustment 
programmes led to reduced health budgets and the introduction of user fees. As WHO recently 
observed: &#8220;The results were predictable. The poor were deterred from receiving treatment and 
the user fees yielded limited income. Moreover, maintaining a network of under-resourced 
hospitals and clinics, while human and financial resources were increasingly pulled into vertical 
programmes, increased pressures on health systems sometimes to the point of collapse.&#8221;<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>28. This quotation is astonishing - and shaming. International and national policies were 
introduced that - predictably - brought health systems &#8220;to the point of collapse&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  <i>Everybody&#8217;s Business ...</i> (note 2 above), p. 9. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>29. As the health crisis deepened, efficiency became the watchword and health sector reform 
&#8220;focused above all on doing more for less&#8221;.<b>10</b> It was only around the turn of the century that the 
international community started to confront the reality that running health systems on US$ 10 
per capita, or less, is simply not a viable proposition. 
</p>
<p>30. In the last few years, there has been a significant increase in the amount of international 
funding available to health. Some States have also increased their domestic health funding. Much 
of the increase in investment by external partners, such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the GAVI Alliance (GAVI), has focused on specific 
diseases and conditions. However, these initiatives exposed (some would say aggravated) the 
degraded state of many health systems. There has been a dawning realization that these specific 
initiatives cannot thrive without effective, strengthened health systems. Recent years have also 
seen a growing appreciation of the seriousness of the health workforce crisis, including the skills 
drain from low-income to high-income countries, a perverse subsidy from the poor to the rich.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>31. In 2005, recognizing that inadequate health systems were impeding progress towards 
improved immunization coverage, GAVI decided to support health system strengthening with an 
initial commitment of US$ 500 million for 2006-2010.<b>12</b> Launched in 2007, the International 
Health Partnership - a global compact for achieving the health Millennium Development Goals - 
aims to build health systems in some of the poorest countries in the world. It is hoped that the 
Partnership will go beyond making better use of existing aid and also generate additional 
resources. 
</p>
<p>32. As increased resources are invested in health systems, the timeliness of the Human Rights 
Council&#8217;s decision 2/108 becomes apparent. It is important to clarify the relationship between 
health systems and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. In this way, the right to 
the highest attainable standard of health, informed by health good practices, can help to make a 
practical, constructive contribution to health system strengthening. 
</p>
<p>33. Additionally, States have a legal duty to comply with their binding international and 
national human rights obligations. Identifying the features of a health system that arise from the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health can help States ensure that their policies and 
practices are in conformity with their legally binding human rights duties. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Definitions 
</b></p>
<p>34. There are countless competing definitions of health systems. In an important publication 
brought out by WHO in 1991, Tarimo defines a health system as &#8220;the complex of interrelated 
elements that contribute to health in homes, educational institutions, workplaces, public places 
and communities, as well as in the physical and psychological environment and the health and 
</p>
<p>

</b>  See http://www.gavialliance.org/resources/HSS_Background.pdf. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>related sectors&#8221;.<b>13</b> In 2007, WHO adopted a narrower definition: &#8220;A health system consists of all 
organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain 
health.&#8221;<b>14</b> The literature reveals many other definitions, each with carefully nuanced differences. 
</p>
<p>35. For present purposes, there is no need to favour one definition over another because all the 
features and measures identified in this report should be part of any health system, however 
defined. 
</p>
<p><b>C. In general terms, a right-to-health approach 
to strengthening health systems 
</b></p>
<p>36. International human rights law signals the content and contours of the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health. In the last decade or so, States, international organizations, 
international and national human rights mechanisms, courts, civil society organizations, 
academics and many others have begun to explore what this human right means and how it can 
be put into practice. Health workers are making the most decisive contribution to this process. 
</p>
<p>37. Drawing on this deepening experience, and informed by health good practices, this section 
outlines the general approach of the right to the highest attainable standard of health towards the 
strengthening of health systems. Because of space constraints, this outline can only be brief and 
introductory. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  At the centre: the well-being of individuals, communities and populations 
</b></p>
<p>38. A health system gives rise to numerous technical issues. Of course, experts have an 
indispensable role to play in addressing these technical matters. But there is a risk that health 
systems will become impersonal, &#8220;top-down&#8221; and dominated by experts. Additionally, as a 
recent WHO publication observes, &#8220;health systems and services are mainly focused on disease 
rather than on the person as a whole, whose body and mind are linked and who needs to be 
treated with dignity and respect.&#8221;<b>15</b> The publication concludes, &#8220;health care and health systems 
must embrace a more holistic, people-centred approach&#8221;.<b>16</b> This is also the approach required by 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Because it places the well-being of 
individuals, communities and populations at the centre of a health system, the right to health can 
help to ensure that a health system is neither technocratic nor removed from those it is meant to 
serve.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Not only outcomes, but also processes 
</b></p>
<p>39. The right to the highest attainable standard of health is concerned with both processes and 
outcomes. It is not only interested in what a health system does (e.g. providing access to essential 
medicines and safe drinking water), but also how it does it (e.g. transparently, in a participatory 
manner, and without discrimination). 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Transparency 
</b></p>
<p>40. Access to health information is an essential feature of an effective health system, as well as 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Health information enables individuals and 
communities to promote their own health, participate effectively, claim quality services, monitor 
progressive realization, expose corruption, hold those responsible to account, and so on. The 
requirement of transparency applies to all those working in health-related sectors, including 
States, international organizations, public private partnerships, business enterprises and civil 
society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Participation 
</b></p>
<p>41. All individuals and communities are entitled to active and informed participation on issues 
relating to their health. In the context of health systems, this includes participation in identifying 
overall strategy, policymaking, implementation and accountability. The importance of 
community participation is one of the principal themes recurring throughout the Declaration of 
Alma-Ata. Crucially, States have a human rights responsibility to establish institutional 
arrangements for the active and informed participation of all relevant stakeholders, including 
disadvantaged communities.<b>17</b> These issues have been explored in several of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s reports, including on Uganda and mental disability.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Equity, equality and non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>42. Equality and non-discrimination are among the most fundamental elements of international 
human rights, including the right to the highest attainable standard of health. A State has a legal 
obligation to ensure that a health system is accessible to all without discrimination, including 
those living in poverty, minorities, indigenous peoples, women, children, slum and rural 
dwellers, people with disabilities, and other disadvantaged individuals and communities. Also, 
the health system must be responsive to the particular health needs of women, children, 
adolescents, the elderly, and so on. The twin human rights principles of equality and 
non-discrimination mean that outreach (and other) programmes must be in place to ensure that 
disadvantaged individuals and communities enjoy, in practice, the same access as those who are 
more advantaged.

<p>43. Equality and non-discrimination are akin to the critical health concept of equity. There is 
no universally accepted definition of equity, but one sound definition is &#8220;equal access to health 
care according to need&#8221;.<b>19</b> All three concepts have a social justice component. In some respects, 
equality and non-discrimination, being reinforced by law, are more powerful than equity. For 
example, if a State fails to take effective steps to tackle race discrimination in a health system, it 
can be held to account and required to take remedial measures. Also, if a health system is 
accessible to the wealthy but inaccessible to those living in poverty, the State can be held to 
account and required to take remedial action. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Respect for cultural difference 
</b></p>
<p>44. A health system must be respectful of cultural difference. Health workers, for example, 
should be sensitive to issues of ethnicity and culture. Also, a health system is required to take 
into account traditional preventive care, healing practices and medicines. Strategies should be in 
place to encourage and facilitate indigenous people, for example, to study medicine and public 
health. Moreover, training in some traditional medical practices should also be encouraged.<b>20</b> Of 
course, cultural respect is right as a matter of principle. But, additionally, it makes sense as a 
matter of practice. As Thoraya Ahmed Obaid, Executive Director of UNFPA, observes: &#8220;cultural 
sensitivity ... leads to higher levels of programme acceptance and ownership by the community, 
and programme sustainability&#8221;.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Medical care and the underlying determinants of health 
</b></p>
<p>45. The health of individuals, communities and populations requires more than medical care. 
For this reason, international human rights law casts the right to the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health as an inclusive right extending to not only timely and appropriate 
medical care but also the underlying determinants of health, such as access to safe water and 
adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational 
and environmental conditions, access to health-related education and information, including on 
sexual and reproductive health, and freedom from discrimination.<b>22</b> The social determinants of 
health, such as gender, poverty and social exclusion, are major preoccupations of the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health. In his work, for example, the Special Rapporteur has

 <p> 
</p>
<p>consistently looked at medical care and the underlying determinants of health, including the 
impact of poverty and discrimination on health. In short, the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health encompasses the traditional domains of both medical care and public health. 
This is the perspective that the right to the highest attainable standard of health brings to the 
strengthening of health systems. 
</p>
<p><b>8.  Progressive realization and resource constraints 
</b></p>
<p>46. The right to the highest attainable standard of health is subject to progressive realization 
and resource availability. In other words, it does not make the absurd demand that a 
comprehensive, integrated health system be constructed overnight. Rather, for the most part, 
human rights require that States take effective measures to progressively work towards the 
construction of an effective health system that ensures access to all. The disciplines of medicine 
and public health take a similar position; the Declaration of Alma-Ata, for example, is directed to 
&#8220;progressive improvement&#8221;.<b>23</b> Also, the right to health is realistic: it demands more of 
high-income than low-income States, that is to say, implementation of the right to health is 
subject to resource availability. 
47. These two concepts - progressive realization and resource availability - have numerous 
implications for health systems, some of which are briefly explored later in this chapter. For 
example, because progressive realization does not occur spontaneously, a State must have a 
comprehensive, national plan, encompassing both the public and private sectors, for the 
development of its health system. The crucial importance of planning is recognized in the health 
literature, the Declaration of Alma-Ata and Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
general comment No. 14 (2000) on the right to the highest attainable standard of health (for more 
on planning, see section E below). 
</p>
<p>48. Another implication of progressive realization is that an effective health system must 
include appropriate indicators and benchmarks; otherwise, there is no way of knowing whether 
or not the State is improving its health system and progressively realizing the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health. Moreover, the indicators must be disaggregated on suitable 
grounds, such as sex, socio-economic status and age, so that the State knows whether or not its 
outreach programmes for disadvantaged individuals and communities are working. Indicators 
and benchmarks are already commonplace features of many health systems, but they rarely have 
all the elements that are important from a human rights perspective, such as disaggregation on 
appropriate grounds.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>23
</b>  Paragraph VII (6). 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  For a human rights-based approach to health indicators, see the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report 
</p>
<p>E/CN.4/2006/48. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>49. A third implication arising from progressive realization is that at least the present level of 
enjoyment of the right to the highest attainable standard of health must be maintained. This is 
sometimes known as the principle of non-retrogression.<b>25</b> Although rebuttable in certain limited 
circumstances, there is a strong presumption that measures lowering the present enjoyment of the 
right to health are impermissible. 
</p>
<p>50. Finally, progressive realization does not mean that a State is free to choose whatever 
measures it wishes to take so long as they reflect some degree of progress. A State has a duty to 
adopt those measures that are most effective, while taking into account resource availability and 
other human rights considerations. 
</p>
<p><b>9.  Duties of immediate effect: core obligations 
</b></p>
<p>51. Although subject to progressive realization and resource availability, the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health gives rise to some core obligations of immediate effect. A 
State has &#8220;a core obligation to ensure the satisfaction of, at the very least, minimum essential 
levels&#8221; of the right to the highest attainable standard of health.<b>26</b> What, more precisely, are these 
core obligations? Some are discussed later in this report. Briefly, they include an obligation to: 
</p>
<p> (a) Prepare a comprehensive, national plan for the development of the health system; 
</p>
<p> (b) Ensure access to health-related services and facilities on a non-discriminatory basis, 
especially for disadvantaged individuals, communities and populations; this means, for example, 
that a State has a core obligation to establish effective outreach programmes for those living in 
poverty; 
</p>
<p> (c) Ensure the equitable distribution of health-related services and facilities, e.g. a fair 
balance between rural and urban areas; 
</p>
<p> (d) Establish effective, transparent, accessible and independent mechanisms of 
accountability in relation to duties arising from the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health. 
</p>
<p>52. Also, a State has a core obligation to ensure a minimum &#8220;basket&#8221; of health-related services 
and facilities, including essential food to ensure freedom from hunger, basic sanitation and 
adequate water, essential medicines, immunization against the community&#8217;s major infectious 
diseases, and sexual and reproductive health services including information, family planning, 
prenatal and post-natal services, and emergency obstetric care. Some States have already 
identified a minimum &#8220;basket&#8221; for those within their jurisdiction. Some international 
</p>
<p>

<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  Ibid., paras. 43-45. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>organizations have also tried to identify a minimum &#8220;basket&#8221; of health services. This is a 
difficult exercise, not least because health challenges vary widely from one State to another, 
which means that in practice, the minimum &#8220;basket&#8221; may vary between countries. In some 
countries, the challenge is undernutrition, elsewhere it is obesity. 
</p>
<p>53. Much more work has to be done to help States identify the minimum &#8220;basket&#8221; of 
health-related services and facilities required by the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health. However, that vital task is not the purpose of this report. This report is not attempting to 
provide a list of essential services and facilities that are needed for a well-functioning health 
system. Rather, the report is seeking to identify a number of additional, and frequently neglected, 
features arising from the right to the highest attainable standard of health, and informed by health 
good practices, that are required of all health systems. These include, for example, access on the 
basis of equality and non-discrimination, an up-to-date health plan, effective accountability for 
the public and private health sector, and so on. 
</p>
<p><b>10.  Quality 
</b>54. Health services and facilities must be of good quality. For example, a health system must 
be able to ensure access to good quality essential medicines. If medicines are rejected in the 
North because they are beyond their expiry date and unsafe, they must not be recycled to the 
South. Because medicines may be counterfeit or tampered with, a State must establish a 
regulatory system to check medicine safety and quality. The requirement of good quality also 
extends to the manner in which patients and others are treated. Health workers must treat patients 
and others politely and with respect. 
</p>
<p><b>11.  A continuum of prevention and care with effective referrals 
</b></p>
<p>55. A health system should have an appropriate mix of primary (community-based), secondary 
(district-based) and tertiary (specialized) facilities and services, providing a continuum of 
prevention and care. The system also needs an effective process when a health worker assesses 
that a client may benefit from additional services and the client is referred from one facility to 
another. Referrals are also needed, in both directions, between an alternative health system 
(e.g. traditional practitioners) and &#8220;mainstream&#8221; health system. The absence of an effective 
referral system is inconsistent with the right to the highest attainable standard of health. 
</p>
<p><b>12.  Vertical or integrated? 
</b></p>
<p>56. There is a long-standing debate about the merits of vertical (or selective) health 
interventions, which focus on one or more diseases or health conditions, and a comprehensive, 
integrated approach. By drawing off resources, vertical interventions can jeopardize progress 
towards the long-term goal of an effective health system. They have other potential 
disadvantages, such as duplication and fragmentation. However, in some circumstances, such as 
during a public health emergency, there may be a place for a vertical intervention. When these 
circumstances arise, the intervention must be carefully designed, so far as possible, to strengthen 
and not undermine a comprehensive, integrated health system. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>13.  Coordination 
</b></p>
<p>57. A health system, as well as the right to the highest attainable standard of health, depends 
on effective coordination across a range of public and private actors (including 
non-governmental organizations) at the national and international levels. The scope of the 
coordination will depend on how the health system is defined. But however it is defined, 
coordination is crucial. For example, a health system and the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health demand effective coordination between various sectors and departments, such 
as health, environment, water, sanitation, education, food, shelter, finance and transport. They 
also demand coordination within sectors and departments, such as the Ministry of Health. The 
need for coordination extends to policymaking and the actual delivery of services. 
</p>
<p>58. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience, health-related coordination in many States is very 
patchy and weak. Alone, the Cabinet is an insufficient coordination mechanism for health-related 
issues. Other coordination mechanisms are essential. 
</p>
<p><b>14. Health as a global public good: the importance  
of international cooperation27 
</b></p>
<p>59. Public goods are goods that benefit society as a whole. The concept of &#8220;national public 
goods&#8221;, such as the maintenance of law and order, is well established. In an increasingly 
interdependent world, much more attention is being paid to &#8220;global public goods&#8221;. They address 
issues in which the international community has a common interest. In the health context, global 
public goods include the control of infectious diseases, the dissemination of health research, and 
international regulatory initiatives, such as the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco 
Control. Although it remains very imprecise, the concept of &#8220;global public goods&#8221; confirms that 
a health system has both national and international dimensions. 
</p>
<p>60. The international dimension of a health system is also reflected in States&#8217; human rights 
responsibilities of international assistance and cooperation. These responsibilities can be traced 
through the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and 
several more recent international human rights declarations and binding treaties.<b>28</b> They are also 
reflected in the outcome documents of several world conferences, such as the Millennium 
Declaration, as well as numerous other initiatives, including the Paris Agenda on Aid 
Effectiveness (2005). 
</p>
<p>61. As a minimum, all States have a responsibility to cooperate on transboundary health issues 
and to &#8220;do no harm&#8221; to their neighbours. High-income States have an additional responsibility to 
provide appropriate international assistance and cooperation in health for low-income countries. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  This section draws extensively on <i>Health is Global: Proposals for a UK Government-Wide 
</i></p>
<p><i>Strategy</i>, Department of Health, 2007, especially at p. 46. 
<b>28
</b></p>
<p>  See S. Skogly, <i>Beyond National Borders: States&#8217; Human Rights Obligations in International 
Cooperation</i>, Antwerp/Oxford, Intersentia, 2006. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>They should especially assist low-income countries with the fulfilment of their core obligations 
arising from the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Equally, low-income States 
have a responsibility to seek appropriate international assistance and cooperation to help them 
strengthen their health systems. 
</p>
<p>62. The relationship between health &#8220;global public goods&#8221; and the human rights responsibility 
of international assistance and cooperation in health demands further study. 
</p>
<p><b>15.  Striking balances 
</b></p>
<p>63. Few human rights are absolute. Frequently, balances have to be struck between competing 
human rights. Freedom of information, for example, has to be balanced with the right to privacy. 
Moreover, there are often legitimate but competing claims arising from the same human right, 
especially in relation to those numerous rights that are subject to resource availability. In the 
context of health systems, finite budgets give rise to tough policy choices. Should the 
Government build a new teaching hospital, establish more primary health-care clinics, strengthen 
community care for people with disabilities, improve sanitation in the capital&#8217;s slum, improve 
access to antiretrovirals, or subsidize an effective but expensive cancer drug? A preliminary 
report of the Special Rapporteur submitted to the United Nations General Assembly addressed 
these challenging issues (A/62/214). Human rights do not provide neat answers to such 
questions, any more than do ethics or economics. But human rights require that the questions be 
decided by way of a fair, transparent, participatory process, taking into account explicit criteria, 
such as the well-being of those living in poverty, and not just the claims of powerful interest 
groups. 
</p>
<p>64. Because of the complexity, sensitivity and importance of many health policy issues, it is 
vitally important that effective, accessible and independent mechanisms of accountability are in 
place to ensure that reasonable balances are struck by way of fair processes that take into account 
all relevant considerations, including the interests of disadvantaged individuals, communities and 
populations. 
</p>
<p><b>16.  Monitoring and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>65. Rights imply duties, and duties demand accountability. Accountability is one of the most 
important features of human rights - and also one of the least understood. Although human rights 
demand accountability this does not mean that every health worker or specialized agency 
becomes a human rights enforcer. Accountability includes the monitoring of conduct, 
performance and outcomes. In the context of a health system, there must be accessible, 
transparent and effective mechanisms of accountability to understand how those with 
responsibilities towards the health system have discharged their duties. The crucial role of 
accountability is explored further in section E below. 
</p>
<p><b>17.  Legal obligation 
</b></p>
<p>66. The right to the highest attainable standard of health gives rise to legally binding 
obligations. A State is legally obliged to ensure that its health system includes a number of the 
features and measures signalled in the preceding paragraphs. The health system must have, 
for example, a comprehensive, national plan; outreach programmes for the disadvantaged; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a minimum &#8220;basket&#8221; of health-related services and facilities; effective referral systems; 
arrangements to ensure the participation of those affected by health decision-making; respect for 
cultural difference; and so on. Of course, these requirements also correspond to health good 
practices. One of the distinctive contributions of the right to the highest attainable standard of 
health is that it reinforces such health good practices with legal obligation and accountability. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  The &#8220;building blocks&#8221; of a health system 
</b></p>
<p>67. Informed by health good practices, the preceding section outlines the general approach of 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health towards the strengthening of health systems. 
This general approach has to be consistently and systematically applied across the numerous 
elements that together constitute a functioning health system. 
</p>
<p>68. What are these functional elements of a health system? The health literature on this issue is 
very extensive. For its part, WHO identifies &#8220;six essential building blocks&#8221; which together make 
up a health system:<b>29</b> 
</p>
<p> (a) Health services. &#8220;Good health services are those which deliver effective, safe, quality 
personal and non-personal health interventions to those who need them, when and where needed, 
with minimum waste of resources.&#8221; Non-personal health interventions include, for example, safe 
water and adequate sanitation; 
</p>
<p> (b) Health workforce. &#8220;A well-performing health workforce is one which works in ways 
that are responsive, fair and efficient to achieve the best health outcomes possible, given 
available resources and circumstances, i.e. there are sufficient numbers and mix of staff, fairly 
distributed; they are competent, responsive and productive&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (c) Health information system. &#8220;A well-functioning health information system is one 
that ensures the production, analysis, dissemination and use of reliable and timely information on 
health determinants, health systems performance and health status&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (d) Medical products, vaccines and technologies. &#8220;A well-functioning health system 
ensures equitable access to essential medical products, vaccines and technologies of assured 
quality, safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness, and their scientifically sound and cost-effective 
use&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (e) Health financing. &#8220;A good health financing system raises adequate funds for health, 
in ways that ensure people can use needed services, and are protected from financial catastrophe 
or impoverishment associated with having to pay for them&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (f) Leadership, governance, stewardship. This &#8220;involves ensuring strategic policy 
frameworks exist and are combined with effective oversight coalition-building, the provision of 
appropriate regulations and incentives, attention to system-design, and accountability&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>29
</b>  <i>Everybody&#8217;s Business &#8230; </i>(note 2 above), p. 3. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>69. Although some of these formulations may be subject to debate, for the purposes of this 
report these &#8220;building blocks&#8221; are a useful way of looking at a health system. Of course, each 
&#8220;building block&#8221; has generated a huge literature over many years. 
</p>
<p>70. For present purposes, three short points demand emphasis. First, these are not only 
&#8220;building blocks&#8221; for a health system, they are also &#8220;building blocks&#8221; for the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health. Like a health system, the right to health requires health services, 
health workers, health information, medical products, financing and stewardship. 
</p>
<p>71. Second, in practice, the &#8220;building blocks&#8221; might not have all the features required by the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health. For example, a country might have a health 
information system, one of the WHO &#8220;building blocks&#8221;. But the information system might not 
include appropriately disaggregated data, which is one of the requirements of the right to health. 
In short, an essential &#8220;building block&#8221; might be in place, but without all the features required by 
international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>72. Third, the crucial challenge is to apply - or integrate - the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health, as well as other human rights, across the six &#8220;building blocks&#8221;. The general 
approach outlined in the preceding section has to be consistently and systematically applied to 
health services, health workers, health information, medical products, financing and 
stewardship - all the elements that together constitute a functioning health system. 
</p>
<p>73. The systematic application of the right to health to the six &#8220;building blocks&#8221; is likely to 
have a variety of results. In some cases, the right to health will reinforce existing features of the 
&#8220;building blocks&#8221; that routinely receive the attention they deserve. In other cases, the application 
of the right will identify existing features of the &#8220;building blocks&#8221; that tend to be overlooked in 
practice and that require much more attention, such as the disaggregation of data on appropriate 
grounds. It is also possible that the application of the right may identify features that, although 
important, are not usually regarded as forming any part of the six &#8220;building blocks&#8221;.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p><b>E. Applying the general approach:  some specific measures 
for health system strengthening 
</b></p>
<p>74. Because of space constraints, it is not possible in this report to apply the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health across the &#8220;building blocks&#8221; that together constitute a health system. 
Such an ambitious undertaking must be the subject of further studies. However, the present 
section begins to apply the right to the highest attainable standard of health to two &#8220;building 
blocks&#8221; of WHO: (i) a health workforce and (ii) leadership, governance and stewardship. 
Although this is a brief application of the right to the highest attainable standard of health, it 
gives a sense of the practical implications of the general approach outlined in section C above in 
relation to the health system &#8220;building blocks&#8221; signalled in section D above. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>30
</b>  Such as ex ante impact assessments (see paragraphs below on planning). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>1.  A health workforce 
</b></p>
<p>75. While human resources in health have attracted increasing attention in recent years, the 
human rights dimensions of the issue rarely receive significant consideration. If the general 
approach outlined in section C were applied to health workers, the following points would be 
among those that need detailed examination. 
</p>
<p>76. A State should have an up-to-date development plan for human resources in preventive, 
curative and rehabilitative health; it should encompass physical and mental health. 
</p>
<p>77. When planning, the State should consider providing a role for mid-level providers, such as 
assistant medical officers and surgical technicians, as well as public health workers. Described as 
a key strategy to uphold the fundamental human right to health, mid-level providers are already 
an essential part of the health systems in some countries, such as Mozambique.<b>31</b> 
</p>
<p>78. Recruitment of health workers must include outreach programmes to disadvantaged 
individuals, communities and populations, such as indigenous peoples.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>79. Effective measures are required towards achieving a gender balance among health workers 
in all fields. 
</p>
<p>80. The State should ensure that the number of domestically trained health workers is 
commensurate with the health needs of the population, subject to progressive realization and 
resource availability. In this context, appropriate balances must be struck between, for example, 
the number of health workers at the community or primary level and specialists at the tertiary 
level. 
</p>
<p>81. The number of health workers should be collected, centralized and made publicly 
available. The data should be broken down by category, e.g. nurse, public health professional 
and so on. The various categories should be disaggregated, as a minimum, by gender. 
</p>
<p>82. Health workers&#8217; training must include human rights, including respect for cultural 
diversity, as well as the importance of treating patients and others with courtesy. This issue is 
explored in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report on health workers and human rights education.<b>33</b> 
</p>
<p>83. After qualifying, all health workers must have opportunities, without discrimination, for 
further professional training. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>31
</b>  See <i>Health Systems Strengthening for Equity (HSSE): The Power and Potential of Mid-Level 
</i></p>
<p><i>Providers</i> at www.midlevelproviders.org 
<b>32
</b></p>
<p>  &#8220;Health workers&#8221; include all those developing, managing, delivering, monitoring and 
evaluating preventive, curative and rehabilitative health in the private and public health sectors, 
including traditional healers. 
<b>33
</b></p>
<p>  A/60/348. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>84. Health workers must receive domestically competitive salaries, as well as other reasonable 
terms and conditions of employment. Their human rights must be respected, for example, 
freedoms of association, assembly and expression. They must be provided with the opportunity 
of active and informed participation in health policymaking. The safety of health workers, who 
are disproportionately exposed to health hazards, is a major human rights issue. 
85. There should be incentives to encourage the appointment, and retention, of health workers 
in underserved areas. When considering the situation of health workers in Uganda, this was one 
of the issues considered by the Special Rapporteur.<b>34 </b> 
</p>
<p>86. The skills drain raises numerous human rights issues, including in relation to the right to 
the highest attainable standard of health in countries of origin. Where relevant, both sending and 
receiving States must have policies in place to address the skills drain. In an earlier report, the 
Special Rapporteur examined the skills drain through the right-to-health lens.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Leadership, governance, stewardship 
</b></p>
<p>87. This is &#8220;arguably the most complex but critical building block of any health system&#8221;.<b>36</b> It 
encompasses many elements, including planning and accountability. 
</p>
<p><b>(a) Planning 
</b>88. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s experience, this is one of the weakest features of the 
development and strengthening of health systems. With a few honourable exceptions, the record 
of health planning is poor, while the history of health planning is surprisingly short. Many States 
do not have comprehensive, up-to-date health plans. Where they exist, plans &#8220;often fail to be 
implemented and remain grand designs on paper. Elsewhere plans may be implemented but fail 
to respond to the real needs of the population.&#8221;<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p>89. However, from the perspective of the right to the highest attainable standard of health, 
effective planning is absolutely critical. Progressive realization and resource availability - two 
inescapable components of the international right to health - cannot be addressed without 
planning.<b>38</b>

</p>
<p>90. Recognizing the critical role of effective planning, the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights designated the preparation of a health &#8220;strategy and plan of action&#8221; a core 
obligation arising from the right to the highest attainable standard of health. The Committee also 
encouraged high-income States to provide international assistance &#8220;to enable developing 
countries to fulfil their core &#8230; obligations&#8221;, including the preparation of a health plan.<b>39</b> 
According to the Declaration of Alma-Ata: &#8220;All governments should formulate national policies, 
strategies and plans of action to launch and sustain primary health care as part of a 
comprehensive national health system and in coordination with other sectors.&#8221;<b>40</b>  
</p>
<p>91. Health planning is complex and many of its elements are important from the perspective of 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health, including the following. 
</p>
<p>92. The entire planning process must be as participatory and transparent as possible. 
</p>
<p>93. It is very important that the health needs of disadvantaged individuals, communities and 
populations are given due attention. Also, effective measures must be taken to ensure their active 
and informed participation throughout the planning process. Both the process and plan must be 
sensitive to cultural difference. 
</p>
<p>94. Prior to the drafting of the plan, there must be a health situational analysis informed by 
suitably disaggregated data. The analysis should identify, for example, the characteristics of the 
population (e.g. birth, death and fertility rates), their health needs (e.g. incidence and prevalence 
by disease), and the public and private health-related services presently available (e.g. the 
capacity of different facilities). 
</p>
<p>95. The right to the highest attainable standard of health encompasses an obligation on the 
State to generate health research and development that addresses, for example, the health needs 
of disadvantaged individuals, communities and populations. Health research and development 
includes classical medical research into drugs, vaccines and diagnostics, as well as operational or 
implementation research into the social, economic, cultural, political and policy issues that 
determine access to medical care and the effectiveness of public health interventions. 
Implementation research, which has an important role to play with a view to dismantling societal 
obstacles to health interventions and technologies, should be taken into account when drafting 
the national health plan. 
</p>
<p>96. The plan must include certain features such as clear objectives and how they are to be 
achieved, time frames, indicators and benchmarks to measure achievement, effective 
coordination mechanisms, reporting procedures, a detailed budget that is attached to the plan, 
financing arrangements (national and international), evaluation arrangements, and one or more 
accountability devices. In order to complete the plan, there will have to be a process for 
prioritizing competing health needs. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  General comment No. 14 (see note 25 above), paragraphs 43-45. 
</p>
<p><b>40
</b>  Paragraph VIII. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>97. Before their finalization, key elements of the draft plan must be subject to an impact 
assessment to ensure that they are likely to be consistent with the State&#8217;s national and 
international legal obligations, including those relating to the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health. For example, if the draft plan proposes the introduction of user fees for health 
services, it is vital that an impact assessment is undertaken to anticipate the likely impact of user 
fees on access to health services for those living in poverty. If the assessment confirms that user 
fees are likely to hinder access, the draft plan must be revised before adoption; otherwise, it is 
likely to be inconsistent with the State&#8217;s obligations arising from the right to the highest 
attainable standard of health.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>98. Of course, planning is only the means to an end: an effective, integrated health system that 
is accessible to all. The main task is implementation. Evaluation, monitoring and accountability 
can help to ensure that all those responsible for implementation discharge their duties as planned, 
and that any unintended consequences are swiftly identified and addressed. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Monitoring and accountability 
</b>99. As already discussed, monitoring and accountability have a crucial role to play in relation 
to human rights and health systems. Accountability provides individuals and communities with 
an opportunity to understand how those with responsibilities have discharged their duties. 
Equally, it provides those with responsibilities the opportunity to explain what they have done 
and why. Where mistakes have been made, accountability requires redress. But accountability is 
not a matter of blame and punishment. It is a process that helps to identify what works, so it can 
be repeated, and what does not, so it can be revised. It is a way of checking that reasonable 
balances are fairly struck. 
</p>
<p>100. In the context of health systems, there are many different types of accountability 
mechanisms, including health commissioners, democratically elected local health councils, 
public hearings, patients&#8217; committees, impact assessments, judicial proceedings, and so on. An 
institution as complex and important as a health system requires a range of effective, transparent, 
accessible, independent accountability mechanisms. The media and civil society organizations 
have a crucial role to play. 
</p>
<p>101. Accountability in respect of health systems is often extremely weak. Sometimes the same 
body provides health services, regulates and holds to account. In some cases, accountability is 
little more than a device to check that health funds were spent as they should have been. Of 
course, that is important. But human rights accountability is much broader. It is also concerned 
with ensuring that health systems are improving, and the right to the highest attainable standard 
of health is being progressively realized, for all, including disadvantaged individuals, 
communities and populations. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>41
</b>  With Gillian MacNaughton, the Special Rapporteur co-authored a report on impact 
</p>
<p>assessments, poverty and the right to the highest attainable standard of health; for an outline see 
A/62/214 from paragraph 33. The full report is available from the website of Essex University, 
Human Rights Centre, Right to Health Unit (http://www2.essex.ac.uk/human_rights_centre/ 
rth/projects.shtm). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>102. In some States, the private health sector, while playing a very important role, is largely 
unregulated. Crucially, the requirement of human rights accountability extends to both the public 
and private health sectors. Additionally, it is not confined to national bodies; it also extends to 
international actors working on health-related issues. 
</p>
<p>103. Accountability mechanisms are urgently needed for all those - public, private, national and 
international - working on health-related issues. The design of appropriate, independent 
accountability mechanisms demands creativity and imagination. Often associated with 
accountability, lawyers must be willing to understand the distinctive characteristics and 
challenges of health systems, and learn from the rich experience of medicine and public health. 
</p>
<p>104. The issue of accountability gives rise to two related points. 
</p>
<p>105. First, the right to the highest attainable standard of health should be recognized in national 
law. This is very important because such recognition gives rise to legal accountability for those 
with responsibilities for health systems. As is well known, the right is recognized in the 
Constitution of WHO, as well as the Declaration of Alma-Ata. It is also recognized in numerous 
binding international human rights treaties, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
which has been ratified by every State in the world, except for two (the United States of America 
and Somalia). The right to the highest attainable standard of health is also protected by numerous 
national constitutions. It should be recognized in the national law of all States. 
</p>
<p>106. Second, although important, legal recognition of the right to the highest attainable standard 
of health is usually confined to a very general formulation that does not set out in any detail what 
is required of those with responsibilities for health. For this reason, a State must not only 
recognize the right to health in national law but also ensure that there are more detailed 
provisions clarifying what society expects by way of health-related services and facilities. For 
example, there will have to be provisions relating to water quality and quantity, blood safety, 
essential medicines, the quality of medical care, and numerous other issues encompassed by the 
right to the highest attainable standard of health. Such clarification may be provided by laws, 
regulations, protocols, guidelines, codes of conduct and so on. WHO has published important 
standards on a range of health issues. Obviously, clarification is important for providers, so they 
know what is expected of them. It is also important for those for whom the service or facility is 
intended, so they know what they can legitimately expect. Once the standards are reasonably 
clear, it is easier (and fairer) to hold accountable those with responsibilities for their 
achievement. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>107. In summary, there is a legal obligation arising from the right to the highest attainable 
standard of health to ensure that there is an up-to-date development plan for human resources in 
health; programmes to recruit from disadvantaged populations; an adequate number of 
domestically trained health workers (subject to progressive realization and resource availability); 
domestically competitive salaries for health workers; incentives to work in underserved areas; 
and so on. In the context of health planning, there is a legal obligation to ensure that the process 
is participatory and transparent; addresses the health needs of disadvantaged individuals, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>communities and populations; and includes a situational analysis. Before finalization, key 
elements of the draft plan must be subject to an impact assessment and the final plan must 
include certain crucial features. 
</p>
<p>108. These (and other) features are not just a matter of health good practice, sound management, 
justice, equity or humanitarianism. They are a matter of international legal obligation. Whether 
or not the obligations are properly discharged should be subject to review by an appropriate 
accountability mechanism. 
</p>
<p><b>F. The right to health helps to establish a health system in the same way 
as the right to a fair trial helps to establish a court system 
</b></p>
<p>109. How does it help to recognize that the right to the highest attainable standard of health 
underpins and reinforces the features and measures required to establish an effective, integrated, 
accessible health system? One way of answering this question is by using the analogy of a court 
system and the right to a fair trial. 
</p>
<p>110. Just as every State must have a health system, it must also have an effective court system. 
The key features of an effective court system include independent, impartial judges. A case must 
come to trial without undue delay. All parties to a case must be given an opportunity to give their 
version of events, call witnesses and make a legal argument. In serious cases, an impecunious 
defendant must be provided with legal aid. In some cases, an interpreter must be provided. The 
judge must give reasons for his or her decision. There must be an appeal process in case the 
judge makes a mistake. Usually, the hearing should be in public. 
</p><p>111. The human right to a fair trial requires a court system to have all these features. 
Significantly, many of these features have major budgetary implications.  
112. States have designed a range of mechanisms and measures to ensure that these features of a 
court system are available in law and fact. For example, judicial independence must be protected 
by a carefully constructed process of judicial appointment and dismissal and by judges enjoying 
reasonable terms and conditions of employment. 
</p>
<p>113. Of course, a State could construct an effective court system without any express reference 
to the right to a fair trial. Indeed, policymakers in the Ministry of Justice could construct an 
effective court system without even thinking about human rights. And if they do, so be it. What 
is important is that there is an effective court system, with the key human rights features, 
dispensing justice without fear or favour. 
</p><p>114. But the record shows that many court systems do not possess all the key human rights 
features and do not dispense justice. In practice, some right-to-a-fair-trial features are overlooked 
or compromised. In this context, human rights play a number of important roles, including the 
following two. 
</p>
<p>115. First, the right to a fair trial provides guidance to policymakers in the Ministry of Justice. 
Human rights law reminds them what are the key features of a court system that must always be 
respected. Also, if officials in the Ministry of Justice are under political pressure to introduce 
unfair trials, they can explain that the State has minimum, legally binding, human rights </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>obligations that cannot be compromised. In this way, human rights discourage backsliding. 
Sometimes human rights can stop the Government from introducing misconceived reforms to the 
justice system.  
</p><p>116. Human rights have a second function. Anticipating that policymakers and others 
sometimes make mistakes, human rights require an effective mechanism to scrutinize important 
decisions. As already discussed, they require that those responsible be held to account - at the 
national and international levels - so that if there is an error, it can be identified and corrected. 
On countless occasions, human rights have been used to challenge policymakers and others 
about unjust court systems. Crucially, human rights have been used to expose unfair systems of 
justice - and they have led to welcome reforms. 
117. Of course, sometimes human rights law fails and an unfair court system is uncorrected and 
unreformed. Sometimes policymakers reject the guidance provided by human rights, and 
accountability mechanisms prove too weak to provide redress. Human rights are only tools - and 
flawed tools to boot - and do not always work. But sometimes they do. Indeed, human rights 
have worked on many occasions and helped to establish court systems that are fairer and more 
just than they would otherwise have been. 
118. By analogy, these arguments also apply to a health system. 
</p>
<p>119. From the perspective of the right to the highest attainable standard of health, as well as 
health good practices, an effective health system must include a number of features and 
measures, some of which are signalled in this report. There must be, for example, an up-to-date 
health plan; outreach programmes for disadvantaged groups; publicly available data that is 
appropriately disaggregated; a minimum &#8220;basket&#8221; of health-related services and facilities; an 
up-to-date, national essential medicines list; meaningful regulation and effective accountability 
of the public and private health sector; and so on. 
</p>
<p>120. Of course, it is possible to build a health system that has these features without any express 
reference to human rights, even without taking human rights into account. But the record shows 
that very many health systems do not, in fact, have these (and other) features that are required by 
the right to the highest attainable standard of health, and suggested by health good practices. 
</p>
<p>121. In this context, the right to the highest attainable standard of health can play a similar role 
in relation to the health system as the right to a fair trial plays in relation to a court system. The 
right to health can provide guidance to health policymakers, reminding them what features of a 
health system must always be respected. If there is national or international pressure to introduce 
reforms that will hinder access to health services for children or those living in poverty, officials 
can explain that the State has minimum, legally binding human rights obligations that cannot be 
compromised in this way. 
</p>
<p>122. Also, because health policymakers and others sometimes make mistakes, the right to the 
highest attainable standard of health requires an effective mechanism to review important 
health-related decisions. Under the right to health, those with responsibilities should be held to 
account so that misjudgements can be identified and corrected. Accountability can be used to 
expose problems and identify reforms that will enhance health systems for all. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>123. Recent history is littered with misguided reforms that have brought many health systems 
&#8220;to the point of collapse&#8221;.<b>42</b> While the right to health is not a panacea, it can help to stop the 
introduction of such ill-conceived health reforms. Just as the right to a fair trial has been used to 
strengthen systems of justice, so the right to health can be used to strengthen health systems. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>124.<b> Health systems and human rights is a very large and complex topic. In a report of this 
length, it is impossible to address all of the important issues, such as the role of the State in 
relation to the private health sector. Elsewhere, the Special Rapporteur has looked at (and 
continues to examine) one dimension of this issue: pharmaceutical companies and access to 
medicines.43 
</b></p>
<p>125.<b> The report has identified urgently needed research, including detailed studies that 
consistently and systematically apply the general approach outlined in section C of the 
present report to all six of the WHO health system &#8220;building blocks&#8221; signalled in 
section D above. 
</b></p>
<p>126.<b> In resolution 60/251, the General Assembly has mandated the Human Rights Council 
to &#8220;promote the effective coordination and the mainstreaming of human rights within the 
United Nations system&#8221;. All those responsible for strengthening health systems should 
recognize the importance of human rights. Moreover, they should embark on the 
integration of the right to the highest attainable standard into their work. This applies 
equally to those focusing on a component of health systems, such as the health workforce. 
</b></p>
<p>127.<b> Today, there are numerous health movements, perspectives and approaches, 
including health equity, primary health care, health promotion, social determinants, health 
security, continuum of care, gender, development, biomedical, macroeconomic and so on. 
All are very important. The right to the highest attainable standard of health recurs 
throughout them all. It is the only perspective that is both underpinned by universally 
recognized moral values and reinforced by legal obligations. Properly understood, the right 
to the highest attainable standard of health has a profound contribution to make towards 
building healthy societies and equitable health systems.
