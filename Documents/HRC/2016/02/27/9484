 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar was 
established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1992/58 and extended most 
recently by the Human Rights Council, in its decision 1/102, in which the Council decided to 
extend, exceptionally for one year, the mandates and mandate holders of the special procedures 
of the Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p> The third holder of the mandate on Myanmar, Paulo S&#233;rgio Pinheiro was appointed in 
December 2000 and has fulfilled his mandate to the best of his ability for the last six years, 
despite having been denied access to the country since November 2003. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur, in the present, final report on the situation of human rights in 
Myanmar to the Human Rights Council, reiterates the findings contained in his last report to the 
sixty-first session of the General Assembly (A/61/369 and Corr.1). 
</p>
<p> During the course of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, the reform process proposed 
in the &#8220;seven-point road map for national reconciliation and democratic transition&#8221;, after 
showing some readiness to become open to various relevant actors, has been further strictly 
limited and delineated.  As a result, the political space has been redefined in narrower terms.  In 
addition, obstructions in the past couple of years have held back the pace and inclusiveness of 
the reforms that are required for democratization.  The work of the National Convention has 
been adversely affected by this development. 
</p>
<p> Over the decades, the space for the establishment of civilian and democratic 
institutions has been seriously curtailed.  The exercise of fundamental freedoms has been 
severely restricted.  The house arrest of Aung Sang Suu Kyi, which was further prolonged for 
one year on 27 May 2006, illustrates well this state of affairs.  As of 16 December 2006, the 
number of political prisoners was estimated to be 1,201.  The Special Rapporteur has 
consistently indicated that national reconciliation requires meaningful and inclusive dialogue 
with and between political representatives.  He firmly believes that the national reconciliation 
and the stability of Myanmar are not well served by the arrest and detention of several political 
leaders or by the severe and sustained restrictions on fundamental freedoms.  The persecution of 
members of political parties in the opposition and human rights defenders shows that today, the 
road map for democracy faces too many obstacles to bring about a genuine transition.  In the 
past, the Special Rapporteur has acknowledged that the road map could play a positive role in the 
political transition.  Sadly, the positive momentum of the early years of his mandate has 
apparently stalled. 
</p>
<p> The capacity of law enforcement institutions and the independence and impartiality  
of the judiciary have been hampered by sustained impunity.  This situation has contributed to 
reinforcing inequality and has increased the gap between the poorest and the richest. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur remains particularly concerned about impunity, which has 
become systematic and must be urgently addressed by the Government of Myanmar.  It has 
become increasingly clear that impunity stems not only from a lack of institutional capacity.  
Impunity has allowed those who have oppressed voices that question existing policies and 
practices to avoid being held accountable.  Several individuals and groups responsible for </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>committing serious violations of human rights, in particular members of the military, have not 
been prosecuted.  There is also little evidence that these serious crimes have been investigated by 
relevant authorities. 
</p>
<p> Grave human rights violations are committed by persons within the established structures 
of the State Peace and Development Council and are not only perpetrated with impunity but 
authorized by law.  In that respect, the Special Rapporteur is also very concerned about the 
continued misuse of the legal system, which denies the rule of law and represents a major 
obstacle to securing the effective and meaningful exercise of fundamental freedoms by citizens.  
He considers the criminalization of the exercise of fundamental freedoms by political opponents, 
human rights defenders and victims of human rights abuses to be a matter of particular concern. 
</p>
<p> During the course of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has been very concerned about 
the 10 years of intensified military campaigns in ethnic areas of eastern Myanmar and its impact 
on the humanitarian and human rights situation, especially on civilians who have been targeted 
during the attacks.  The situation should be considered in connection with the widespread 
practice of land confiscation throughout the country, which is seemingly aimed at anchoring 
military control, especially in ethnic areas.  It has led to numerous forced evictions, relocations 
and resettlements, forced migration and internal displacement.  Given the scale of the current 
military campaign, the situation may lead to a humanitarian crisis if it is not addressed 
immediately.  The Special Rapporteur therefore welcomes the recent appointment of the 
Resident Coordinator as Humanitarian Coordinator.  He believes that the formal engagement of 
the humanitarian sector of the United Nations Secretariat will provide stronger, essential support 
in ensuring the integrity and independence of ongoing efforts. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur takes note with great satisfaction of the recent release of political 
prisoners, including the five &#8220;88 generation&#8221; student leaders arrested last September.  He 
expresses the hope that other prominent political prisoners will benefit from the amnesty granted 
in early January 2007.  He therefore welcomes the statement made by the Secretary-General on 
8 January 2007 on this issue and commends the work done by the United Nations within the 
&#8220;good offices&#8221; mission. </p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar was 
established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1992/58 of 3 March 1992 and 
extended in resolution 2005/10.  By its decision 1/102, the Human Rights Council decided to 
extend all mandates and mechanisms transferred to it by the Commission on Human Rights 
pursuant to resolution 60/251 of the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of his mandate, which started in December 2000, the Special 
Rapporteur was authorized by the Government of Myanmar to visit the country on six occasions.  
However, the Special Rapporteur has not been allowed to conduct a fact-finding mission to 
Myanmar since November 2003.  While he has not been granted access to the country during the 
period covered by this report, he has continued to fulfil his mandate to the best of his ability 
based on information collected from a variety of independent and reliable sources. 
</p>
<p>3. Throughout the six-year period of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate, substantiated 
reports of grave human rights violations continued to be received on an ongoing basis.  With the 
vast majority of his communications to the authorities not receiving a response, little evidence 
was available to the Special Rapporteur of a commitment by the Government to respond to these 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur, however, takes note of recent replies by the Government to 
official communications by the special procedures of the Council.  He finds this development 
encouraging and urges the Government to continue its dialogue with the Special Rapporteur and 
other special procedures. 
</p>
<p>5. Building on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s last report to the General Assembly (A/61/369 
and Corr.1), the present and final report of the Special Rapporteur focuses on the main pattern 
of human rights violations he has identified in the course of his mandate.  The report covers the 
period from February 2006 to 10 January 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  ACTIVITIES OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>6. In view of the fact that he continued to be prevented from visiting Myanmar, the 
Special Rapporteur visited neighbouring countries in the region where he received the support 
of all United Nations country teams.  From 11 to 26 February 2006, the Special Rapporteur 
visited India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand where he conducted consultations with 
representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, diplomats, parliamentarians (in India), the 
Inter-Parliamentary Caucus of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as 
non-governmental actors. 
</p>
<p>7. In Jakarta, the Special Rapporteur held meetings with the Secretariat of ASEAN, the 
former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia and scholars.  In Kuala Lumpur, he held a 
meeting with the former Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to Myanmar.  In Bangkok, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>consultations were also conducted with representatives of United Nations agencies operating  
in Myanmar and Thailand, members of the diplomatic community, and non-governmental 
organizations operating in Myanmar, Thailand, and on the Thai-Myanmar border. 
</p>
<p>8. In May 2006, the Special Rapporteur met with the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees in Geneva and staff members from his Office. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur presented his report (E/CN.4/2006/34) to the Human Rights 
Council in September 2006.  While in Geneva, he met with representatives of the Permanent 
Mission of Myanmar and held consultations with representatives of Member States, officials of 
United Nations agencies, representatives of civil society organizations and members of the 
academic community. 
</p>
<p>10. At the request of the Special Rapporteur, the desk officer for Myanmar of the Office of 
the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), who assists the mandate, conducted a 
mission to the region from 22 August to 3 September 2006 to collect updated information, with 
the support of the OHCHR Regional Office, United Nations agencies, civil society organizations 
and experts. 
</p>
<p>11. In September 2006, the Special Rapporteur met with the officials of the European Union 
(EU) in Brussels.  He had consultations in Strasbourg, France, with representatives of the 
member States of the Council of Europe and the Deputy Secretary-General of the Council and 
addressed the Committee of Ministers.  He also had a discussion with directors of the EU 
Council Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) and made a presentation to the EU 
Asia-Oceania Working Party (COASI). 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur presented his last report to the General Assembly 
on 21 October 2006.  While in the United States, he met representatives of the Government of 
Myanmar and held consultations with representatives of States Members of the United Nations 
and of ASEAN, officials of United Nations agencies, civil society organizations and members of 
the academic community. 
</p>
<p>13. During the reporting period, the Special Rapporteur continued to have regular contacts 
with the Permanent Mission of Myanmar to the United Nations Office at Geneva.  He also 
continued to share his findings with the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva, the 
Executive Office of the Secretary-General, the Department of Political Affairs of the Secretariat 
and the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide and his team. 
</p>
<p>14. Following the submission of this report, the Special Rapporteur, after the one-year 
extension of his mandate until June 2007, will be stepping down, in accordance with the six-year 
term limit.  He wishes to thank very warmly all the Member States, resident coordinators and 
United Nations country teams, in particular the United Nations Country Team in Myanmar, civil 
society organizations and scholars who have supported his mandate and shared with him their 
observations on the situation of human rights in Myanmar. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>III. OVERVIEW OF THE SIX-YEAR MANDATE  
OF THE SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur in his previous report to the Human Rights Council 
(E/CN.4/2006/34, paras. 9-22) presented an overview of his activities during his six-year term 
which he does not wish to reiterate in the present report.  In this last precious opportunity to 
address the Council as Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, he 
prefers to share some reflections on his experiences during the last six years. 
</p>
<p>16. At the time he was appointed in December 2000, the Special Rapporteur decided to 
propose to the Government that he undertake a three-day visit to prepare his first official 
mission.  This was somewhat unconventional, but the political situation in the country was 
already very tense.  For five years, his predecessor, Rajsoomer Lallah, had not been allowed to 
visit the country, and the Special Rapporteur thought that this would be a way to engage with the 
Government in a new form of dialogue on human rights. 
</p>
<p>17. The Government of Myanmar has affirmed - and the Special Rapporteur agrees - that the 
five missions which followed that first visit were an important indicator of its cooperation with 
the Commission on Human Rights.  The Special Rapporteur regrets that the same kind 
cooperation has not taken place during the last three years and two months, seriously curtailing 
his ability to report.  The Special Rapporteur has tried to explain to the Government of Myanmar 
that official visits would give an opportunity to the Special Rapporteur to verify allegations of 
human rights violations and would allow the Government to have its views reflected in the 
report.  Since his last mission to Myanmar in November 2003, the Special Rapporteur has 
written on many occasions to the Government seeking an invitation to visit the country, without 
success.  He has not even received a written reply. 
</p>
<p>18. During the course of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has maintained regular contacts 
with representatives of Myanmar in Geneva and New York, and with its ambassadors in many 
capitals.  The Special Rapporteur has made every effort, particularly in the last three years, to 
convince the Government of Myanmar to work towards the protection and promotion of human 
rights and to fulfil its international obligation of cooperation in the field of human rights.  The 
representatives of Myanmar - despite their urbane treatment of the Special Rapporteur, which it 
is only fair to acknowledge - have preferred to denounce the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s findings as 
inaccurate, biased or politically motivated instead of simply investigating the allegations 
reported by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur reaffirms that he has maintained his independence, impartiality 
and objectivity in weighing the information provided by various sources.  During his 11 years of 
association with the United Nations human rights mechanisms, the Special Rapporteur has done 
his best to report honestly on the progress made and obstacles faced by Governments in 
promoting and protecting human rights.  At this end of his endeavours, the Special Rapporteur is 
distressed to conclude that the Government of Myanmar has decided to refuse to cooperate with 
the mandate and with the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>20. The duties of the Special Rapporteur include analysing problems and trying to find 
solutions.  Constructive criticism is more easily accepted than tongue-lashing, especially when 
such criticism is accompanied by concrete gestures of cooperation.  Achieving progress in a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>particular human rights situation requires that responsibility be shared between the special 
rapporteur, the Government, opposition forces and civil society.  Special rapporteurs expect 
reciprocal cooperation, openness, and a serious commitment manifested by deeds and not merely 
words; special rapporteurs can only report progress backed by hard evidence. 
</p>
<p>21. Throughout the six years of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has maintained a 
constant dialogue within the diplomatic community.  In Asia, he has systematically sought the 
views of Myanmar&#8217;s neighbours in order to verify his own impressions and analyses.  He has 
reflected on their perspectives in his reports, having held consultations in Bangkok, Beijing, 
Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore and Tokyo with Governments, parliamentarians, the 
Secretariat of ASEAN, research centres and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Political developments 
</b></p>
<p>22. In the past two years, the reform process proposed in the &#8220;seven-point road map for 
national reconciliation and democratic transition&#8221; - whose potential for political transition the 
Special Rapporteur had recognized at the outset - has been strictly limited and delineated.  The 
work of the National Convention has been adversely affected by this development.  First 
convened in 1993, the National Convention was adjourned in May 1996 until it was reconvened 
for an eight-week period from 17 May to 9 July 2004.  Having again been suspended for a 
further nine months following its 17 February-31 March 2005 session, the National Convention 
reconvened on 5 December 2005.  On 31 January 2006, after having met for nearly two months 
without significant progress, the National Convention adjourned once more.  It resumed its 
activities on 10 October and recessed on 29 December 2006 after more than 10 weeks of 
deliberations which were not genuinely open to all political parties and ethnic groups.  The 
Special Rapporteur remains convinced that the announcement of a timetable for the 
implementation of the road map would be a clear demonstration of a commitment to the 
realization of a political transition. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur regrettably notes that the recommendations put forward on 
several occasions by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights calling for 
the National Convention to be placed on a solid democratic foundation have been disregarded by 
the Government.  The National League for Democracy (NLD) and ethnic parties have not been 
effectively and meaningfully associated with the National Convention.  The drafting process of 
the Constitution has been marked by a lack of transparency. 
</p>
<p>24. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur takes note of the resolution adopted by consensus 
on 18 October 2006 at the 179th session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union Governing Council 
convened in Geneva, which stated:  &#8220;the National Convention, in its present form, is designed to 
prolong and legitimize military rule against the will of the people as expressed in the 1990 
elections, and that any transition towards democracy will fail so long as it is not genuinely free, 
transparent and reflective of the people&#8217;s will, and preceded by the unconditional release of all 
political prisoners and the lifting of all restrictions on human rights and political activity&#8221;.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>25. Persecution and harassment of members of NLD continue.  On 16 December 2006, the 
number of political prisoners was estimated to be 1,201, a figure that does not include prisoners 
reportedly detained in ethnic areas and secret jails.  The Special Rapporteur took note with 
satisfaction of the decision by the Government of Myanmar on 3 January 2007 to grant amnesty 
to 2,831 prisoners and, further, of the release of more than 40 political prisoners the same month, 
including the 5 &#8220;88 generation&#8221; student leaders (Min Kop Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, Pyone Cho, 
Min Zeya and Htay Kywe) who were arbitrarily arrested last September.  On 10 January 2007, 
the Special Rapporteur requested the Government to provide a detailed list of prisoners who had 
been released following this announcement.  
</p>
<p>26. The house arrest of NLD Secretary-General Aung Sang Suu Kyi was further prolonged 
by 12 months on 27 May 2006 in spite of various appeals.  The terms of detention of other 
prominent NLD leaders, including Tin Oo, Than Nyein and May Win Myint, were also 
extended.  Several leaders of ethnic political parties, including the Chairperson of the Shan State 
NLD, have been detained and given extraordinarily severe prison terms of 100 years or more.  A 
report, &#8220;Eight Seconds of Silence&#8221;, released in May 2006 by the Assistance Association of 
Political Prisoners documents allegations of the deaths of 127 democracy advocates and human 
rights defenders since 1988 while in detention or shortly after their release.  
</p>
<p>27. While NLD members in Myanmar had been subjected to serious harassment, the Union 
Solidarity and Development Association (USDA), established by the State Peace and 
Development Council (SPDC) in 1993, recently announced its intention to become a political 
party and field candidates in the next election.  The Special Rapporteur believes this 
development to be a matter of grave concern.  Over the years, the Special Rapporteur has 
received various allegations of involvement by USDA in acts of political and criminal violence.  
There is a perception among many observers that USDA may be used to legitimize a transition 
from a military regime to a civilian Government which could be not genuine.  These allegations 
also seriously question the political will of the Government to work towards a legitimate 
democratization process in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>28. In spite of the severe restrictions imposed on communities and their representatives, the 
Special Rapporteur has noted with great appreciation the strong democratic aspirations among 
various groups who continue to struggle to exercise their fundamental freedoms.  For example, 
last December, the &#8220;88 generation&#8221; student group initiated a new campaign to urge the people of 
Myanmar to speak up about the political and social problems facing the nation.  The campaign, 
called &#8220;Open Heart&#8221;, is scheduled to run from 4 January to 4 February and will call on all 
citizens of Myanmar to write to their government leaders urging reform in politics, the economy 
and social affairs. 
</p>
<p>29. Some countries of the region have reacted to the current state of the political process and 
human rights situation in Myanmar.  Unprecedented pressure from ASEAN compelled Myanmar 
to decline its first opportunity to chair ASEAN in 2006.  When the ASEAN envoy was finally 
authorized to visit the country in March 2006, he interrupted his mission when the Government 
refused to allow him to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi.  Several ASEAN members afterwards 
issued very critical public statements highlighting the significant absence of progress in terms of 
democracy and human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>30. In May and November 2006, the United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Political 
Affairs, Mr. Ibrahim Gambari, visited Myanmar as an emissary of the Secretary-General within 
the context of the &#8220;good offices&#8221; mission entrusted to him by the General Assembly and at the 
invitation of the Government.  Democratization and human rights were part of the terms of 
reference of his mission.  He briefed the Secretary-General and the Security Council three times 
on the outcome of his two visits, which were seen as a positive step for the resumption of a 
dialogue with Myanmar.  The Special Rapporteur commends the important work of the 
Under-Secretary-General within the framework of the Secretary-General&#8217;s &#8220;good offices&#8221; 
mission.   
</p>
<p>31. In early September, the United States formally requested the Security Council to put 
Myanmar on its agenda.  On 15 September, the Council voted, by 10 votes in favour, 4 against 
and 1 abstention, to do so.  The Special Rapporteur viewed this decision as a step that may allow 
Security Council members, individually or collectively, to formally discuss the issue of 
Myanmar and to request regular reports on the situation in the country from the United Nations 
Secretariat, including from OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>32. On 12 January 2007 a draft resolution on the situation of human and political rights in 
Myanmar (S/2007/14) was tabled by the United States of America and the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur hopes that the debate on Myanmar in the Security Council will 
provide an opportunity to facilitate the transition process towards democracy.  It can contribute 
to finding ways to promote convergence among the different approaches of the members of the 
Council towards the country, building an effective and authentic partnership with the countries 
of the region, tackling protection issues while improving the level of humanitarian action, 
including humanitarian access, and ensuring the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur takes note that at its 297th session, held in November 2006, the 
Governing Body of the International Labour Organization (ILO), as a result of the lack of 
political commitment by the Government of Myanmar to comply with its international 
obligations, stated in its Conclusions that &#8220;the Myanmar authorities should, as a matter of utmost 
urgency and in good faith, conclude with the [International Labour Office] an agreement on a 
mechanism to deal with complaints of forced labour&#8221;.  In addition, the Governing Body said that 
a specific item would be placed on the agenda of its March 2007 session to enable it to move on 
legal options, which would include requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court 
of Justice.  The Special Rapporteur would like to commend this decision as an important step 
towards fighting the culture of impunity in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>35. In November 2006 the Special Rapporteur welcomed some progress in the area of forced 
labour.  He noted that three cases concerning people who had been arrested after filing 
complaints of forced labour practices were recently resolved by the Government in collaboration 
with ILO.  He also welcomed as a positive development the six-month moratorium declared by 
the Government on prosecuting people who lodge complaints of forced labour.  The Special 
Rapporteur was informed by representatives of Myanmar that further negotiations with ILO were 
in progress with a view to establishing a mechanism in the area of forced labour and that a new 
ILO mission was being considered for the near future. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Systematic human rights violations and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>36. In his last report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur noted that &#8220;the culture 
of impunity remains the main obstacle to the efforts in view to safeguarding and securing respect 
for human rights in Myanmar and creating a favourable environment for their realization&#8221; 
(A/61/369, para. 27).   
</p>
<p>37. During the course of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur has received reports of 
widespread and systematic human rights violations, including summary executions, torture, 
forced labour practices, sexual violence and recruitment of child soldiers.  These violations have 
not been investigated and their authors have not been prosecuted.  Victims have not been in a 
position to assert their rights and receive a fair and effective remedy. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur regrets that in the discussions in the Commission on Human 
Rights and in the General Assembly the Myanmar authorities have preferred to deny the 
allegations and to denounce the accuracy of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s findings.  As the 
Government has not invited the Special Rapporteur to visit Myanmar, he cannot be blamed for 
not having been able to verify the accuracy of these allegations. 
</p>
<p>39. As the Special Rapporteur noted:  &#8220;The mob attack targeting Aung San Suu Kyi in 
November 1996 and the brutal Depayin massacre in May 2003 are striking examples of the 
culture of impunity prevailing in the country.  In spite of several appeals, including by the 
Special Rapporteur, the Government of Myanmar did not investigate these cases and have not 
brought those responsible to justice&#8221; (ibid., para. 28). 
</p><p>40. Under international law, Myanmar has an obligation to thoroughly investigate grave 
violations of human rights, to prosecute those responsible for their perpetration and, if their guilt 
is established, to punish them.  This means that those responsible for human rights violations 
must stand trial and that victims must obtain reparations. 
</p>
<p>41. Another noteworthy illustration of the consistent and continuing pattern of impunity is 
the high number of allegations of sexual violence against women and girls committed by 
members of the military that have been regularly documented since 2002.  In 2006, the Special 
Rapporteur received information about 30 cases of rape of Chin women.  In late November 2006, 
he received additional reports of abuses by the military, including sexual abuses, and their 
impact in Kayin State.  As noted by the Special Rapporteur:  &#8220;This trend of sexual violence is 
particularly alarming, bearing in mind that the figures provided are likely to be far lower than the 
reality as many women do not report incidents of sexual violence because of the trauma attached 
to it.  Moreover, some reports may also not have reached the Special Rapporteur, as information 
on human rights abuses in these areas is mainly collected from refugees arriving at the 
Thai-Myanmar border&#8221; (ibid., para. 30).  The Special Rapporteur is not aware of any initiatives 
by the Government of Myanmar to look into these serious human rights abuses with a view to 
identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice.  The failure to investigate, prosecute 
and punish those responsible for rape and sexual violence has contributed to an environment 
conducive to the perpetuation of violence against women and girls in Myanmar.  As the 
Government has denied the Special Rapporteur access to Myanmar, he was not in a position to 
verify these allegations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. Cases of forced labour represent another manifestation of the culture of impunity.   
The Government of Myanmar has acceded to the ILO Forced Labour Convention, 1930  
(No. 29) and in 2000 it issued an order outlawing the practice.  However, there have been  
serious shortcomings when it comes to effective implementation.  
</p>
<p>43. Following a damning 1998 report on forced labour in Myanmar by an ILO Commission 
of Inquiry, a process of dialogue commenced between ILO and the Myanmar authorities in 2000 
on ways to address the problem.  This led to a visit by a high-level team to the country in 2001 to 
provide a detailed assessment of recent developments on the ground and of the obstacles to the 
elimination of forced labour - the first time such an assessment was able to be carried out on the 
territory of Myanmar (the Commission of Inquiry having been denied access to the country).  
Two key recommendations of the team were the establishment of a permanent ILO presence in 
the country and the development of a mechanism for credibly and effectively dealing with 
complaints from victims of forced labour.  In 2002 the Myanmar authorities agreed to the 
appointment of an ILO liaison officer in Yangon.  Discussions then began on a concrete plan of 
action to address forced labour, including the establishment of a complaint mechanism for 
victims.  Although negotiations initially made reasonable progress, there were a number of 
obstacles which prevented the plan of action from being implemented, including death sentences 
pronounced against three people for alleged contacts with ILO (all were eventually released).  
Following the removal from office of then Prime Minister Khin Nyunt together with a number of 
key ministers, with whom the plan of action had been negotiated, the Myanmar authorities 
indicated that they would no longer consider the plan.  Despite intensive negotiations since that 
time, the Myanmar authorities have demonstrated little concrete cooperation with ILO, and have 
not so far agreed to any alternative formulations.  This has led ILO to resort increasingly to other 
measures to try to secure Myanmar&#8217;s compliance with its obligations, including calls for ILO 
members to review their relations with Myanmar, as well as various international legal measures. 
</p>
<p>44. As regards developments in the practice of forced labour, the assessment of the 
high-level team and subsequent evaluations by the ILO liaison officer have been that there has 
been only a very moderate positive evolution in the situation since the Commission of Inquiry.  
The main significant development has been that the authorities are apparently no longer 
requisitioning labour for major national infrastructure projects.  However, forced labour 
continues to be widely imposed by local authorities for smaller-scale infrastructure work.  The 
situation remains most serious in border areas, where there is ongoing insecurity and a large 
Army presence.  In these areas, the Army continues to impose forced labour on a widespread and 
systematic basis for a range of military and infrastructure-related purposes, including the use of 
civilians as porters for the Army during patrols and military operations.  In addition to the very 
dangerous and arduous nature of the tasks, forced labour imposed by the Army is routinely 
accompanied by other forms of serious human rights abuse.  Major obstacles to the elimination 
of forced labour include the apparent lack of political will to seriously address the problem or to 
develop acceptable alternatives, and the continued impunity for the government officials and 
Army officers responsible. 
</p>
<p>45. In 2005 the Government announced a policy of prosecuting people who lodged what it 
considered to be &#8220;false complaints&#8221; of forced labour, leading to a situation where it is the victims 
rather than the perpetrators who are punished.  The State-controlled press has also published 
articles attacking the ILO.  The effect of this has been to strengthen the impunity enjoyed by 
those government officials who continue to impose forced labour. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>46. The recruitment of child soldiers is another human rights abuse committed within  
the culture of impunity.  The Special Rapporteur has received various reports of the Army 
continuing to recruit child soldiers at an alarming rate.  These reports allege that child 
recruitment continues even after the Government created a high-level committee that  
promised to address the problem.  The Committee for Prevention of Military Recruitment of 
Under-Age Children was formed in January 2004 after the Secretary-General reported to the  
Security Council that Myanmar was violating international law prohibiting the recruitment and 
use of children as soldiers.  The report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict 
confirms this development.  It says that &#8220;there are reliable reports of continued forcible 
recruitment and training of children for the Government armed forces (Tatmadaw Kyi) and 
non-State armed groups.  However, owing to access limitations, the United Nations country team 
has not been able to systematically verify these allegations&#8221;.  (A/61/529-S/2006/826, para. 57). 
</p>
<p>47. As noted by the Special Rapporteur in his previous reports, the serious human rights 
violations described above have been widespread and systematic over the last decade, suggesting 
that they are not simply isolated acts of individual misconduct of middle- or low-ranking 
officers, but rather the result of a system under which individuals and groups have been allowed 
to breach the law and violate human rights without being called to account. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur also believes that impunity is one of the main underlying causes 
of the degrading economic and social conditions of rural farmers, who represent the majority of 
the population of Myanmar.  The militarization of rural areas has created a vicious circle of 
impoverishment of villagers.  The military rely on local labour and other resources as the result 
of the incapacity of the Government to deliver any form of support for their activities (the 
self-reliance policy).  The Special Rapporteur has received many allegations of villagers being 
severely punished outside the framework of the law because they refused to perform forced 
labour and of the unlawful appropriation of their land, livestock, harvest and other property.  
While Myanmar has increased the number of its battalions nationwide since 1988, the 
implementation of self-reliance policies by the local military during the past decade has 
contributed to undermining the rule of law and damaging the livelihoods of local communities. 
</p>
<p>49. Grave human rights violations meet with impunity and are even authorized by law.  In 
that respect, the Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned at the continued misuse of the legal 
system, which denies the rule of law and represents a major obstacle to securing the effective and 
meaningful exercise of fundamental freedoms.  The Special Rapporteur regrets to observe that 
the lack of independence of the judiciary has provided a &#8220;legal&#8221; basis for abuses of power, 
arbitrary decision-making and exonerating those responsible for serious human rights violations.  
The Special Rapporteur has also repeatedly expressed concern to the Government of Myanmar 
about the abuse of due process in political trials and the denial of basic rights in detention.  For 
the last six years, the Special Rapporteur has received numerous reports concerning arbitrary 
arrests without warrants, incommunicado detention, torture or ill-treatment in pretrial detention, 
deaths in custody and very poor conditions of detention without access to adequate food and 
medical treatment.  He has also received reports of defendants who have been denied the right to 
legal counsel and reports of political trials often being held in camera. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur considers the criminalization of the exercise of fundamental 
freedoms by political opponents, human rights defenders and victims of human rights abuses to 
be a matter of especially grave concern.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>51. The authorities have continued to impose severe restrictions on freedom of movement, 
freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of assembly.  The Special 
Rapporteur has received several reports alleging the Government&#8217;s involvement in crackdowns 
on several initiatives by people to organize themselves even for non-political purposes, such as 
fighting HIV/AIDS.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur has also received reports of allegations concerning the 
prosecution of individuals who have communicated information that should belong in the public 
domain to organizations and individuals inside and outside the country.   
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur is also very much concerned about the strict restrictions on 
freedom of movement that prevail in general in the country, and in particular about those 
imposed on specific groups, such as the Muslim minority. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Military operations in ethnic areas 
</b></p>
<p>54. Since 1948, millions of people have been uprooted and thousands have died every year, 
mostly from preventable diseases, in the country&#8217;s conflict areas.  The situation has become 
critical.  The Army has approximately doubled the number of battalions deployed across eastern 
Myanmar since 1995.  The attacks on villages in ethnic areas have led to extensive forced 
displacements.  This is true for Kayin State but also other ethnic states in eastern Myanmar 
(Mon, Shan and Kaya) and in northern Rakhine State.  Reliable and independent sources 
estimate that between 1996 and 2006, 3,077 separate incidents of destruction, relocation or 
abandonment of villages have been documented in eastern Myanmar.  Over a million people are 
understood to have been displaced from their homes during this time.  As of November 2006, the 
total number of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced or obliged to leave 
their homes and have not been able to return or resettle and reintegrate into society is estimated 
to be at least 500,000.  The Government does not recognize the existence of IDPs within its 
borders and severely restricts access to them by United Nations agencies and other humanitarian 
actors. 
</p>
<p>55. Widespread violence continued to spiral upwards during the last year in mountain areas 
outside of military control in the Toungoo, Nyaunglebin and Papun Districts of Kayin State and 
in eastern Bago Division.  For many independent and reliable observers, this is the worst 
humanitarian situation since the 1996-1997 military campaign. 
</p>
<p>56. Among the most appalling features of the military campaign in ethnic areas is the 
disproportionate effect on civilian populations.  In addition to the heightened risks posed by the 
widespread availability of small arms and light weapons and anti-personnel mines, the killing, 
terrorizing or displacement of civilians is often part of a deliberate strategy to separate ethnic 
armed groups from their civilian populations.  It has been considered by various observers to be 
a concerted policy aimed at denying people their livelihoods and food or forcing them to risk 
their lives when they attempt to return to their villages after having been forcibly evicted. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur has received reports from reliable and independent sources 
alleging that the militarization of refugee camps at the border has put the safety of civilians at </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>risk.  In that regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to welcome the opening of legal 
assistance centres for promoting legal awareness and providing legal services to refugees in 
camps along the Thai-Myanmar border. 
</p>
<p>58. Violence against unarmed civilians by the Myanmar military is a very serious concern.  
The Government of Myanmar has a positive obligation under international humanitarian law to 
protect civilians from the effects of armed conflict and, therefore, needs to take the appropriate 
measures to end the targeting of civilians during military operations. 
</p>
<p>59. In western Myanmar, the Muslim minority has long been discriminated against, and is 
denied citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law.  Muslim minority asylum-seekers continue 
to flee to Bangladesh.  They are subject to serious abuses, especially forced labour 
(e.g. construction of roads, bridges, model villages and military facilities, camp maintenance, 
portering) and arbitrary taxation.  They also suffer skyrocketing rice prices.  Since January 2006, 
the government-imposed policy of cultivating physic nut plantations is causing new hardships, 
including forced labour, extortion and land confiscation.  New developments have been observed 
in recent months, including increased restrictions on movement as it became very difficult to 
obtain a travel pass after the new village-level administration was put in place, and the closing of 
a number of mosques which had been repaired or enlarged without permission.  The Special 
Rapporteur praises the international humanitarian organizations and their expatriate staff in 
northern Rakhine State who have been very helpful in protecting the Muslim minority from the 
Myanmar military and border security forces. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Land confiscation 
</b></p>
<p>60. Access to and control over land and natural resources has long been central to the 
political economy of Myanmar.  In many ethnic minority-populated areas, repeated incidents of 
forced displacement - interspersed with occasional periods of relative stability - have been a fact 
of life for generations.  Some 75 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture (including 
fisheries, forestry and livestock), which accounts for 40 per cent of the gross domestic product.  
Land and natural resource issues therefore lie at the heart of livelihoods in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>61. A large-scale and effectively arbitrary land confiscation policy prevails throughout the 
country.  These confiscations appear to have several aims, including relocating civilian 
populations deemed to be sympathetic to the armed opposition; anchoring a military presence in 
disputed areas through the deployment or support of new Army battalions; opening the way for 
infrastructure development projects, including the Lawpita dam, the three proposed Salween 
dams and the Day Loh dam in Toungoo District; the extraction of natural resources, notably 
offshore gas; and providing various interest groups, including the military and foreign groups, 
with business opportunities, e.g. economic concessions, including for logging and mining.  This 
policy has led to numerous forced evictions, relocations and resettlements, especially in rural 
areas but also in urban areas, most notably in connection with the move of the capital from 
Yangon to Pyinmana. 
</p>
<p>62. The Land Nationalization Act of 26 October 1953 confers land ownership on the State.  
Legal practice in Myanmar today generally refers to this Law, which recognizes some private 
ownership of agricultural land, although it restricts land sales or transfers.  However, the Law </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>allows the State to confiscate land that is left fallow.  The current legislation on land offers little 
protection to farmers.  In addition, victims of land confiscations are not likely to lodge 
complaints because of fear of reprisals and lack of confidence in the judiciary. 
</p><p>63. The Special Rapporteur is not aware of any specific provisions of the draft Constitution 
which would provide for secure land and housing rights of citizens, protect the rights to fair and 
just compensation as a result of legal or illegal land or property expropriation, or guarantee 
traditional practices of ethnic minorities in relation to land and natural resource management, 
such as collective property rights and swidden agriculture (an important element of sustainable 
livelihood strategies). 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur views the ongoing large-scale confiscation of land as a matter of 
grave concern that will continue to impact dramatically on the political and economic stability of 
the country if it is not addressed.  The Special Rapporteur notes the increasing recognition 
among human rights, humanitarian and development groups of the need to document issues 
related to land and natural resource management in Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur believes there is a need to recognize that Myanmar&#8217;s ethnic 
nationalities enjoy a special relationship with the land.  The issue of housing, land and property 
rights in Myanmar is inextricably linked to the struggle for justice and democracy in the country.  
For ethnic minorities, this includes the right to reside on their ancestral land and to participate in 
decisions regarding its use. 
</p>
<p>66. Protection from land confiscation depends on settlement of the conflicts which have 
wracked the country for more than half a century.  Unfortunately, efforts at conflict resolution 
have thus far met with only very limited success.  Nevertheless, some inspiring projects have 
been implemented by civil society groups in Myanmar.  These examples show that it is not 
necessary to wait for fundamental democratic reform before addressing the issue of land 
confiscation and paving the way to transitional justice. 
</p>
<p><b>E.</b>  <b>Humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>67. According to numerous and consistent reports, there have been marked signs of 
deterioration in the economic and social sectors, which could aggravate the humanitarian 
situation.  Even if the International Monetary Fund estimates that the Myanmar economy has 
grown 7 per cent in 2006, owing largely to rising revenues from exports of offshore gas fields, 
the hardships that the population have to face continue to be very serious.  There is a need to 
address, adequately and urgently, the needs of the population. 
</p>
<p>68. Myanmar&#8217;s ranking in the 2005 United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) 
Human Development Index was 129 out of 159 countries.  Maternal mortality in Myanmar is 
among the highest in South-East Asia, and only 40 per cent of children complete five years of 
primary education (considerably fewer in conflict-affected border areas).  Rates of HIV/AIDS 
and tuberculosis infection remain amongst the highest in Asia.  Malaria is the leading cause of 
morbidity and mortality, and most commonly affects the poor and other groups at risk.  The 
potential threat of a pandemic of H5N1 avian influenza remains of serious concern following the 
March/April 2006 outbreak, although there have been no human cases of H5N1 thus far in 
Myanmar. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>69. Since 2005, new restrictions have been placed on actors in the humanitarian field.  These 
restrictions, in the context of the complicated environment and pressure from outside lobbyists, 
have been used as a pretext for the withdrawal of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria, which has been deeply deplored by the Special Rapporteur and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health.  The withdrawal of M&#233;decins Sans Fronti&#232;res (France) at the end 
of 2005, owing to access restrictions, has further complicated the humanitarian situation. 
</p>
<p>70. The Government of Myanmar in late November ordered the International Committee of 
the Red Cross (ICRC) to close its five field offices in the country.  While the Government is 
reconsidering its decision to close the offices, ICRC is still not in a position to operate according 
to its standard modalities. 
</p>
<p>71. The restrictive guidelines for United Nations agencies and international organizations 
announced by the Government in February 2006 added to the current difficulty for humanitarian 
workers seeking access to project areas and to operate independently, in accordance with 
internationally accepted standards.  Although the Special Rapporteur recently received 
information about some positive signs of progress, there is still an urgent need for the 
Government of Myanmar to demonstrate some flexibility.  In that regard, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages the Government to ensure that humanitarian agencies can operate in a mutually 
agreeable environment, in accordance with the guiding principles provided by the 
United Nations Country Team on 7 March 2006. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the launching of the Three-Disease Fund,<b>1</b> which will 
provide funding roughly equivalent to that of the Global Fund that should soon start flowing to 
implementing agencies.  This shows that donors still have an important commitment to 
humanitarian aid in Myanmar.  The Special Rapporteur encourages the provision of 
humanitarian assistance to Myanmar.  He also believes that there must be transparency and 
accountability in the monitoring of the provision of humanitarian assistance to ensure that it is 
not misused for personal and individual gains.  In addition, Myanmar nationals employed by 
agencies working in the country must be afforded protection from any form of threats and 
intimidation for their work on humanitarian assistance and development programmes. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the recent appointment of the Resident Coordinator as 
Humanitarian Coordinator.  He believes that the formal engagement of the humanitarian sector 
of the United Nations Secretariat will provide stronger essential support in ensuring the integrity 
and independence of ongoing efforts. 
</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Myanmar&#8217;s international human rights and humanitarian obligations 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Government of Myanmar has an obligation to cooperate for the advancement of 
human rights under the Charter of the United Nations, which provides for the promotion of 
&#8220;universal respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as 
to race, sex, language, or religion&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>75. Myanmar is party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949, the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Slavery Convention, the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the 
Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage.  It has not 
signed the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography, and the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 
</p>
<p>76. Myanmar submitted its initial report to the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1999, but its second periodic report has been 
overdue since August 2002.  The Special Rapporteur believes that the Government of Myanmar 
would benefit from a dialogue with CEDAW in view of the widespread sexual violence against 
women and girls that prevails in the country.  The initial and second periodic reports under the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child were submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child (CRC) and its next report, the combined third and fourth periodic report, is due in 
August 2008.  The Special Rapporteur believes that this represents an opportunity for the 
Government of Myanmar, working with civil society, the United Nations system and CRC, to 
engage in a discussion on sexual violence against girls and on the recruitment of child soldiers 
with a view to submitting its report in the best possible conditions. 
</p>
<p>77. CEDAW and CRC have examined Myanmar&#8217;s reports and issued recommendations and 
concluding observations providing guidance to the Government on how to fulfil its international 
human rights obligations.  The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that recommendations 
made by treaty bodies for protecting and promoting human rights in Myanmar represent an 
important tool for policymakers and development practitioners.  It is therefore important for the 
Government of Myanmar and its partners to follow up on these recommendations.  They will 
help to measure political will, obstacles encountered and progress made, to identify new trends, 
and to complement the efforts made by the Government towards the protection and promotion of 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>78. Myanmar also acceded to a number of ILO conventions, including, as noted above, the 
Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29) and the Freedom of Association and Protection of the 
Right to Organize Convention, 1948 (No. 87), which are of particular importance from a human 
rights perspective.  In June 2006, the ILO Committee of Experts on the Application of 
Conventions and Recommendations observed that the Government of Myanmar had been 
strongly criticized by various ILO bodies regarding the implementation of Convention No. 29.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>The major focus of the criticisms related to the outcome of the 1997 Commission of Inquiry 
appointed by the Governing Body of ILO, which concluded that the Convention had been 
violated in national law and in practice &#8220;in a widespread and systematic manner&#8221;.  The report of 
the Committee of Experts refers to material that purported to be from nearly every state and 
division of the country on several hundred cases of forced labour, including forced portering, 
repair and maintenance of army camps and villages for displaced people, cultivation of paddy 
and other fields, road construction, clearing of jungle areas, &#8220;human minesweeping&#8221;, patrolling 
and sentry duty.<b>2</b>  The Special Rapporteur believes that the implementation by Myanmar of the 
important conclusions of the Committee published last June would help to prevent forced labour 
to a significant extent, as they identified practical steps that are required to put an end to these 
abuses. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUDING REMARKS 
</b></p>
<p>79. The human rights concerns enumerated in the present report are largely the same as those 
highlighted by the Special Rapporteur in his reports since 2001.  The Special Rapporteur 
deplores the fact that, despite early indications from the Government that it was willing to 
address these problems when the Special Rapporteur first took up his mandate six years ago, this 
willingness has disappeared. 
</p>
<p>80. The current administration has not yet demonstrated any willingness to concede any 
space for a political opening of the kind that occurred during similar transitions in several 
countries in Asia, nor for the promised move towards democratization.  Any voice questioning 
existing policies and practices has been harshly suppressed.  Moreover, most individuals and 
groups responsible for committing serious violations, in particular members of the State 
apparatus, are not being arrested or prosecuted.  Impunity has also impaired progress in the 
social and economic development of Myanmar for the benefit of the majority of the people. 
</p><p>81. Recommendations formulated by the General Assembly, the Commission on Human 
Rights, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his former Special Envoy, as well as 
those advocated by the Special Rapporteur and relevant human rights treaty bodies, have not 
been implemented. 
</p>
<p>82. From the outset of his work on Myanmar, the Special Rapporteur has made a point of 
visiting and reporting regularly on the plight of political prisoners.  Nothing is more revealing 
about the situation of human rights in a country than the existence of political prisoners.  
Moreover, the manner in which such persons are treated is a reflection of how a Government 
regards its own people.  At least 1,201 citizens of Myanmar are behind bars without access to the 
guarantees of due process for the exercise of their political rights. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur has constantly repeated, to no avail, to the Government of 
Myanmar and its partners that Daw Aung San Su Kyi&#8217;s house arrest and her lack of access to 
NLD colleagues run counter to the spirit of national reconciliation.  The release of the other 
</p>

</p>
<p>Recommendations:  Individual Observation concerning Convention No. 29, Forced 
Labour, 1930, Myanmar, June 2006, para. 6. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>1,200 political prisoners and intellectuals, such as Win Tin, the 76-year-old poet and journalist 
who has been in prison since 4 July 1989, would also become assets for a meaningful political 
transition.  As Nelson Mandela so eloquently said, &#8220;Only free men can negotiate; prisoners 
cannot enter into contracts.  Your freedom and mine cannot be separated.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur takes note with great satisfaction of the recent release of political 
prisoners, including the five &#8220;88 generation&#8221; student leaders arrested last September.  He 
expresses the hope that other prominent political prisoners will benefit from the amnesty granted 
in early January 2007. 
</p>
<p>85. After six years serving this mandate, the Special Rapporteur believes it is important for 
Member States to support effective initiatives to deal with common concerns of society in 
Myanmar and in the region.  Joint initiatives on issues of common concern such as the 
environment, economic growth and development, educational modernization, medical research 
and engineering and technology which could prove to be paths to progress should be explored.  
All these initiatives must have as their goals to encourage an effective democratic transition and 
to promote the improvement of the standards of living and the protection of human rights of the 
people of Myanmar. 
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur would like to conclude by reaffirming what he said to the Human 
Rights Council in September:  humanitarian assistance cannot be made hostage to politics.  Any 
decision on humanitarian assistance must be guided solely by the best interests of children, 
women, people living with disabilities, those affected by diseases and minority groups.  It would 
be a terrible mistake to wait for the political normalization of Myanmar to help the population 
and to empower communities and their representatives. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations made in earlier sections of the present 
report, as well as in his previous reports, remain valid in view of the prevailing situation in 
Myanmar.  For the last time, the Special Rapporteur would like: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) To appeal to the Government of Myanmar to free all political prisoners and 
put an end to harassment and persecution of NLD members and representatives of ethnic 
groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) To encourage the Government of Myanmar to resume, without further 
delay, dialogue with all political actors, including NLD and representatives of ethnic 
groups, to complete the drafting of the Constitution;
