subject (101.<footnote name="1">7. The Government of Guatemala is pleased with the way in which this periodic review 
was conducted and with its outcome. We feel more fully understood and supported in our 
commitment and resolve to shape a democratic State under the rule of law in which respect 
for human rights and for individual freedoms is strong enough to serve as a foundation for 
the development and well-being of all Guatemalans, without discrimination of any type 
whatsoever.

<p> United Nations A/HRC/22/8/Add.<footnote name="1">6. We take note of the remaining six recommendations (101.20, Austria; 101.23, 
Slovakia; 101.<footnote name="1">5. In relation to the recommendation concerning improved participation on the part of 
stakeholders, with a focus on women and indigenous peoples, in decision-making processes 
that could have an impact on the future development of rural communities (101.<footnote name="1">4. In regard to the recommendation concerning protective measures and immediate, 
independent and systematic investigations of abuses perpetrated against human rights 
defenders (101.<footnote name="1">3. With regard to the part of that recommendation that refers to human rights defenders 
and journalists, it should be noted that inter-agency mechanisms for their protection and for 
the investigation of reports of violations have been established. 
</footnote>5, Switzerland), it should be noted that inter-agency mechanisms for the 
protection of human rights defenders are in place and that the investigations into reports of 
violations conducted by the prosecution service and the courts will improve once the 
constitutional amendments designed to increase their functional and economic 
independence have been approved. 
</footnote>9, 
Canada), it is our understanding that the consultation procedure provided for in the 
Constitution and the law that will govern consultations under ILO Convention No. 169 will 
be the appropriate mechanisms for these purposes; consideration may be given to additional 
measures in order to address the concerns of women and indigenous peoples.

<p><b>A/HRC/22/8/Add.<footnote name="1">2. Work is proceeding on the task of bringing the definition of the offence of 
extrajudicial execution into line with the definition set forth in international legal 
instruments, along with the alignment of laws on other types of offences. 
</footnote> 
</b></p>
<p><b>2</b> GE.<footnote name="1">1. In respect of the recommendation relating to the investigation of extrajudicial 
executions (101.14, Australia), we would like to note that the only recent report of such an 
execution is under investigation and that the Government is cooperating fully with the 
prosecutor&#8217;s office and the courts. 
</footnote>3-10276 
</p>
<p>1. The Government of Guatemala is pleased to observe that the great majority of the 
recommendations made during the interactive phase of the review are in line with the 
Government&#8217;s human rights policy and that 111 of the 138 recommendations can therefore 
be accepted at once and without discussion. 
</p>
<p>2. We have taken note of the remaining 27 recommendations, and most of them will 
also be accepted once we have issued an explanatory statement concerning our 
understanding of them. 
</p>
<p>3. Regarding the seven recommendations relating to ratification of conventions or 
protocols (101.1, Argentina; 101.2, Mexico; 101.3, France; 101.4, Spain; 101.5, France; 
101.<footnote name="7">. With respect to the recommendation regarding the strengthening and 
decentralization of human rights institutions (101.10, Indonesia), we have already made a 
commitment to reorganize the country&#8217;s human rights institutional structure with assistance 
from the United Nations, and this undertaking will include its decentralization. The 
Presidential Human Rights Commission currently has 17 regional offices. 
</footnote>, Norway; and 101.<footnote name="8">. Concerning the recommendation that a moratorium on the death penalty be re-
established (101.11, Australia), we would note that the death penalty has not been applied 
in Guatemala since 2001 and that we have accepted six recommendations that consideration 
be given to submitting a proposal for its abolition to Congress. 
</footnote>, Slovakia), please note that the inter-agency consultations being 
held prior to their submission to Congress for approval and subsequent ratification or 
accession are quite far along. With respect to those of them that relate to the death penalty, 
our acceptance signals the fact that consideration will be given to the possibility of 
submitting a proposal for its abolition to the Colombian Congress. 
</p>
<p>4. Five recommendations refer to consultations with indigenous peoples (101.24, 
Slovenia; 101.25, Norway; 101.<footnote name="9">. We accept the recommendation regarding the allocation of resources for the 
implementation of the law against femicide (101.12, Uruguay) but would like to note that 
additional resources have already been provided for in the 2013 budget. 
</footnote>, Republic of Korea; 101.26, Switzerland; and 101.27 
United States of America). These recommendations do not present a problem either, as the 
promulgation of a law and the issuance of regulations governing such consultations are 
forthcoming. To that end, the Cabinet recently held a working meeting with representatives 
of the International Labour Organization (ILO) and officials from the Government of Peru, 
which is the only country that already has legislation on that subject in place. 
5. The Constitution establishes that all subsoil resources are in the public domain and 
thus belong to all Guatemalans; consultations regarding such resources must therefore be 
conducted in a way that is in keeping with that constitutional provision. In addition, since 
there are no indigenous territories as such, although there are communal and community 
lands, references to land claims should be in keeping with the legal framework and actual 
circumstances existing in Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>6. Two recommendations (101.16, Canada; and 101.17, Germany) relate to events that 
occurred during the armed conflict. An amnesty is in place that was negotiated with the 
help of the United Nations. The corresponding amnesty law is currently in force, and any 
challenges to its validity or scope will have to be dealt with by the high courts of 
Guatemala.
