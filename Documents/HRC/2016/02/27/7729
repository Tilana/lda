<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conduct of the visit 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography conducted an official visit to Benin from 28 October to 8 November 2013. She 
visited the cities of Cotonou, Abomey-Calavi, Porto Novo, Parakou, Com&#232;, Lokossa and 
Applahou&#233;. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Benin for organizing 
the meetings with the various authorities and for its cooperation before, during and after the 
visit. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur spoke with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, African 
Integration, Francophonie and Beninese Abroad. She met with representatives of the 
Ministry of Justice, Legislation and Human Rights, the Ministry of the Family, Social 
Affairs, National Solidarity, Persons with Disabilities and Older Persons, the Ministry of 
Development, Economic Analysis and Planning, the Ministry of Microfinance and Youth 
and Women&#8217;s Employment, the Ministry of Nursery and Primary School Education, the 
Ministry of Secondary School, Technical and Vocational Training, Retraining and 
Integration of Young Persons, the Ministry of Culture, Literacy, Handicrafts and Tourism, 
the Ministry of Labour and the Civil Service, the Ministry of Administrative and 
Institutional Reform and Social Dialogue and the Ministry of Health; with representatives 
of the Central Office for the Protection of Minors (OCPM), the Central Office for the 
Suppression of Cybercrime, the vice squad, the national headquarters of INTERPOL and 
the intelligence service; with representatives of the departmental directorates of the family, 
the prefectures, the municipal councils, the Social Advancement Centres and centres for the 
protection of children and adolescents, as well as with members of the judicial system, the 
police and the gendarmerie at local level; and with the national unit to monitor and 
coordinate child-protection activities and the National Commission on Children&#8217;s Rights.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur spoke with United Nations representatives in Benin, 
including the Acting Resident Coordinator and Representative of the United Nations 
Population Fund, the Representative of the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) and 
her team and representatives of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the 
World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the 
Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  
</p><p>5. She met with members of civil society and visited care centres for children in 
difficulty.1 She also met with children in difficulty and child victims and with associations 
of young people active in prevention activities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Context 
</b></p>
<p>6. Independent since 1960, Benin began its democratic transition in 1990. It is divided 
into 12 departments, which are subdivided into 77 districts, and it had approximately 10

</p>
<p>million inhabitants in 2013. Benin&#8217;s population is very young (46.97 per cent under 15 
years of age), with a female majority (51.2 per cent).2 According to the Demographic and 
Health Survey 2011&#8211;2012 (EDSB-IV), the fertility rate is estimated at 4.9 children per 
woman; it is much higher in rural areas (5.4 children per woman) than in urban areas (4.3 
children).3 
</p><p>7.  The national economy has been adversely affected by the global economic 
slowdown, and Benin continues to be heavily dependent on foreign aid. Despite the 
Government&#8217;s efforts to improve social services, many development indicators have fallen 
short of expectations. According to UNDP, the poverty rate is 36.2 per cent.4 The country is 
stagnating at the bottom of the human development index, where it ranks 166 out of 187.5 A 
study on vulnerability in Benin conducted in 2009 revealed that 44 per cent of children 
under 5 years of age live in the poorest households.6 Many natural disasters (floods, 
droughts etc.) in Benin in recent years have caused frequent humanitarian crises which have 
contributed to aggravating the precarious situation of vulnerable population groups, notably 
women and children. 
</p>
<p>8. Notwithstanding some progress, the administration of the country continues to be 
ineffective and very centralized, despite a legislative and regulatory framework that is 
favourable to decentralization, but in which accountability and the obligation to produce 
results are sorely lacking. According to a survey conducted in 2008 by the anti-corruption 
observatory, corruption in Benin has a heavy impact on the functioning of the 
administration. These problems of governance, together with poor institutional capacities, 
are a major obstacle to the protection of children.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Analysis of the situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Extent and forms of sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography 
</b></p>
<p>9. It is impossible to reflect in exact figures the actual extent of the sale and sexual 
exploitation of children in Benin because of the clandestine nature of these phenomena, a 
lack of centralized and disaggregated data and, above all, the very small number of reports, 
but the problem has been recognized by all stakeholders interviewed.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Sale of children 
</b></p>
<p>10. The sale of children in Benin was not presented as a major problem during the visit, 
although it is at times difficult to distinguish it from the alarming phenomenon of 
trafficking in children, the seriousness of which is recognized. With regard to sale for 
international adoption, the Ministry of Justice has stated that international adoptions have

<p>been suspended pending the adoption of the 1993 Hague Convention on the Protection of 
Children and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption and the harmonization of 
national legislation with the relevant international standards.7 However, during visits to 
centres that take in children awaiting adoption, the Special Rapporteur was told that 
international adoptions were continuing. Although the Family Code makes provision for a 
strict adoption process, the Special Rapporteur stressed the importance of establishing an 
independent oversight mechanism in this regard.  
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur was concerned about the persistence, in particular in certain 
rural areas, of the practice of early marriage, which is sometimes regarded as a family 
survival strategy. According to the Demographic and Health Survey 2011&#8211;2012, in Benin 8 
per cent of girls under 15 and 34 per cent of girls under 18 years of age are married.8 
According to the Departmental Directorate of the Family, in Parakou there were 54 cases of 
early/forced marriages in 2012 and 172 cases between January and September 2013. 
</p>
<p>12. All stakeholders interviewed referred to the problem of &#8220;vidom&#233;gon&#8221;9 children 
(children placed in families which traditionally are responsible for their care, and their 
education in particular) exploited at the Danktopa market in Cotonou, the biggest open 
market in western Africa. According to a study by UNICEF, 4,677 children (including 
3,776 girls) are working at the Danktopa market, 2,149 children (including 1,669 girls) at 
the Ouando (Porto Novo) market and 1,056 children (including 732 girls) at the Arzeke 
market in Parakou; 54 per cent of these children are under 14 years of age.10 According to 
Plan International,11 90 per cent of vidom&#233;gon children do not go to school. They are 
employed at markets, in the street trade, in handling and in cleaning of stands, in addition to 
performing unpaid domestic tasks. Today this tradition supplies child sale and child 
trafficking networks. Employers and intermediaries go directly to the villages to collect 
these children.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur was also informed about the growing phenomenon of 
missing children. According to OCPM, 233 children were reported missing in the first half 
of 2013, and 521 in 2012. OCPM registered 370 cases of abductions of minors in 2011 and 
375 cases in 2012. The Special Rapporteur has not received any information on action 
taken on those cases.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Child prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>14. The phenomenon of sexual exploitation of children in Benin was acknowledged by 
all stakeholders interviewed, although the Special Rapporteur was not provided with any 
figures. There was universal agreement that the problem existed, but that it was carefully 
concealed, and even &#8220;disguised&#8221;. In its national plan of action for the elimination of the 
worst forms of child labour 2012&#8211;2015, the Ministry of Labour also recognized the 
phenomenon. 
</p>
<p>15. Young vidom&#233;gon girls, in addition to being exploited economically, reportedly are 
often victims of occasional and &#8220;informal&#8221; prostitution. It was reported that some sell their

<p>bodies to market guards in exchange for a place to sleep at night, and that others are forced 
to prostitute themselves to earn the money which they were unable to make during the day, 
and thus avoid being subjected to violence by their guardians.  
</p><p>16. According to information from the vice squad, of the 100 persons arrested in the 
vicinity of Cotonou in 2012, 2 were minors. The vice squad intervenes primarily in inns, 
hotels and motels in and around Cotonou. According to the vice squad, soliciting takes 
place primarily in discotheques. The Parakou chief of police referred to the case of five 
girls who were victims of sexual exploitation around the market in 2013. The perpetrators 
were not arrested.  
</p>
<p>17. According to the Department of Tourism, the number of child victims of sexual 
tourism has been growing in the department of Littoral. Police officers referred to cases of 
young girls who were sexually exploited in certain tourist areas.  
</p>
<p>18. A study conducted by the NGO Terre des Hommes on child mobility between Lom&#233; 
and Cotonou stressed the risks of sexual exploitation facing these children. According to 
the report, in Vogan cases have been observed of young girls in transit who are victims of 
prostitution. They sell their bodies so that they can pay for motorcycle taxis. According to 
the report, more than one girl in two engages in these activities in bars along their route, 
which are ideal places for recruiting girls for sexual exploitation.12  
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur stressed that official data disaggregated by sex, profile, age 
and status of the victims, as well as on arrested and convicted perpetrators, are insufficient 
for providing accurate figures on sexual exploitation of children. In her view, it is essential 
for all stakeholders to conduct a national study in order to have a better understanding of 
the phenomenon and its scale. Such a study could also serve as a basis for an initial report 
on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of 
children, child prostitution and child pornography, which Benin has not yet submitted.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Child pornography 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur obtained very little information concerning the 
dissemination of pornographic material involving children. However, some stakeholders 
expressed concern at the growing risk of sexual exploitation online, given the proliferation 
of Internet cafes, concerning which there is very little supervision because of the limited 
capacity of the Central Office for the Suppression of Cybercrime. The phenomenon of 
&#8220;video clubs&#8221;, which for a modest fee show films with content inappropriate for children, 
also gives cause for concern.  
</p>
<p>21. A number of officials, police officers and representatives of civil society have 
reported several cases of children who photographed themselves naked and sent each other 
the images by mobile telephone; the images are then circulated. No action is taken on these 
cases, because the Central Office for the Suppression of Cybercrime does not have the 
technical means to carry out investigations.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Trafficking in children 
</b></p>
<p>22. Trafficking of children within Benin and to neighbouring countries is a phenomenon 
of alarming proportions. According to the study conducted in 2007,13 40,317 children aged

<p>6 to 17 were identified as trafficking victims, including 92 per cent who were trafficked 
domestically, the majority of whom were girls (86 per cent).  
</p><p>23. In 7 cases out of 10, family members are involved in recruiting the children, who 
come from poor families and large households and who in most cases have never gone to 
school or have dropped out. These children are found in domestic employment, commerce, 
agriculture and the handicrafts. They work every day, from 5 or 6 in the morning until late 
at night. In one case in two, they sleep at the workplace. They are malnourished and are 
often ill-treated.  
</p>
<p>24. Virtually all the country&#8217;s districts, 62 out of 77, supply this trafficking. Cotonou 
and the main district towns are both destinations and places of transit. Transnational 
trafficking follows two routes: the more developed one goes east to Nigeria and on to 
Gabon, and the other goes west to Togo, Ghana and C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. A new route has 
appeared to the north to Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, eventually leading to the Maghreb 
and western Europe. 
</p>
<p>25. During the first half of 2013, OCPM registered 103 cases of trafficking involving 
minors (74 girls and 29 boys). In 2012, it registered 159 cases. According to the 
Departmental Directorate of the Family, there were 95 cases of trafficking in children in 
Parakou in 2012 and 262 cases between January and September 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Sexual abuse 
</b></p>
<p>26. All stakeholders interviewed referred to the shocking number of child victims of 
sexual abuse, in particular girls in school, but also at places of occupational training, in 
families, at markets and construction sites, in voodoo convents14 and other places of 
worship, at video clubs and in the street. OCPM registered 61 cases of rape of minors 
(including 3 resulting in pregnancy) in 2011, 89 (25 pregnancies) in 2012 and 52 (19 
pregnancies) in the first half of 2013. The Parakou Departmental Directorate of the Family 
reported 31 cases of sexual harassment and 50 cases of rape of minors in 2012, and 62 
cases of sexual harassment and 57 cases of rape of minors between January and September 
</p><p>2013. According to the Mono-Couffo Departmental Directorate of the Family, in 2012, 620 
schoolgirls had a first pregnancy.  
</p>
<p>27. A large part of the study on violence against schoolchildren in Benin15 focused on 
sexual violence. In schools, 9.3 per cent of children reported that they had been the victims 
of sexual violence. The Special Rapporteur was told that sexual harassment and abuse by 
teachers, but also by other pupils, is frequent in the school environment. Some teachers 
reportedly promised good marks in exchange for sexual relations. The phenomenon has 
become such a problem that it has been the subject of a number of interministerial 
decrees.16  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur is outraged that such abuses are occurring at schools, which 
should provide a protective environment. In addition to causing irreversible physical and 
psychological harm, these abuses lead to an alarming number of early pregnancies (with at

<p>times fatal complications), with the result that the girls drop out of school. Persons active in 
child protection in Benin often referred to the &#8220;epidemic of pregnancies&#8221; in schools. 
According to the Departmental Directorate of the Family, in 2012, 529 pregnancies were 
recorded among the 8,733 girls enrolled in secondary school in Parakou, 303 among the 
2,852 girls in Bemb&#232;r&#232;ke and 686 among the 3,240 girls in Nikki. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Causes and risk factors 
</b></p>
<p>29. The factors underlying the sale and sexual exploitation of children are numerous and 
interrelated. They are linked to supply (families in great difficulty, poverty, lack of 
economic opportunities, problems of access to basic social services, school dropout, unsafe 
access to the Internet and certain social norms) and demand (growing demand for sexual 
services involving children, increasingly structured exploitation networks, rapid and 
frequent evolution of destinations for child sex tourism).  
</p><p>30. Some categories of children are more vulnerable: children without birth certificates, 
children living on or roaming the streets, migrant children, juvenile workers, vidom&#233;gon 
children, abandoned children and orphans, children placed in institutions and children who 
are victims of sexual abuse within the family.  
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur noted that the registration of births continues to be a major 
problem in Benin, despite considerable progress made in recent years. According to the 
Demographic and Health Survey 2011&#8211;2012, the national rate rose from 60 per cent in 
2006 to 80.2 per cent in 2011. However, disparities have been observed depending on the 
department and income. In Alibori, for example, only 37 per cent of children have a birth 
certificate. 
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur noted with concern the scale of the phenomenon of 
abandoned children and children rejected at birth. So-called &#8220;witch children&#8221;17 are 
sometimes even killed for fear that they bring bad luck. OCPM registered 161 cases of 
abandoned children in the first half of 2013, 537 in 2012 and 484 in 2011. 
</p>
<p>33. The quality of teaching is very deficient and is aggravated by teacher absenteeism 
and strikes (three months in 2012). According to an evaluation of educational 
achievement,18 only 30 per cent of children have learned to read and write correctly by the 
end of primary school. Despite free primary school education, some fees persist. The 
educational system does not seem to be well adapted, from the point of view of either 
curriculum or school hours. Some children must walk miles to school. There are also 
considerable disparities between regions.  
</p>
<p>34. The national survey on child labour (ENTE)19 showed that about one child in three 
(34 per cent) works. This finding conceals disparities between departments. Donga and 
Collines have the highest percentage of child labour: 76.1 per cent and 70.2 per cent, 
respectively, as against 9.8 per cent in Littoral and 10.2 per cent in Atlantique. Child labour 
is essentially a rural phenomenon. Most of these children work in the agricultural sector

<p>(64.5 per cent) and in services (28.7 per cent). Child labour interferes with schooling and 
causes irreversible harm to children&#8217;s health and development. These children work 23.6 
hours a week on average; 90.1 per cent of them are forced to perform work that is to be 
abolished, and 69.3 per cent perform dangerous work.20  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur also expressed concern about the persistence of practices 
harmful to children, including infanticide, rites of initiation and forced confinement in 
voodoo convents, corporal punishment, excision, the treatment of &#8220;witch children&#8221;, early 
and forced marriages and the treatment of talib&#233; children (children in Koranic schools who 
are forced to beg by their religious teachers). 
</p><p>36. A survey conducted in 2011 by UNICEF identified 372 children, including 66 per 
cent girls, undergoing rites of initiation in 157 voodoo convents in the department of 
Atlantique. The duration of the initiation could attain and even exceed three years, a period 
equivalent to half the duration of primary school education. The survey revealed that 
initiation is increasingly expensive, as much as 1 million CFA francs.21 Serious suspicions 
were voiced about possible sexual violence perpetrated in these convents.  
</p>
<p>37. The 2007 national policy and strategies document on child protection revealed that 
the phenomenon of street children, both <i>talib&#233;</i> and otherwise, is widespread in cities.22 
According to the Yearbook of Social Indicators published in September 2010 by the 
Ministry of the Family, the majority of street children registered in the context of this 
survey are boys (71 per cent). This phenomenon is more prevalent in the departments of 
Litteral (25 per cent) and Ou&#233;m&#233; (33 per cent). The Special Rapporteur regretted that very 
few programmes target street children.23  
</p>
<p>38. As demonstrated in the 2009 survey,24 violence against children continues to be 
widespread in all private and public schools. More than 89 per cent of schoolchildren have 
been victims of one form of violence, 55 per cent have been victims of corporal 
punishment, and 30 per cent have been beaten, slapped or hit outside the school 
environment.  
</p>
<p><b> III.  Measures to combat and prevent the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Regional and international human rights instruments  
</b></p>
<p>39. Benin ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 and its two optional 
protocols on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict in 2005.  
</p>
<p>40. In 2001, Benin ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention

<p>Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the 
Worst Forms of Child Labour, 1999 (No. 182). In 2004, it ratified the Protocol to Prevent, 
Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, 
supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime 
(Palermo Protocol). The Special Rapporteur strongly urged Benin to ratify the 1993 Hague 
Convention. 
</p>
<p>41. Benin is a party to most international human rights instruments but has not yet 
ratified the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families or the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (signed in 2007). 
</p><p>42. Benin is a member of the African Union and has ratified several of its treaties, 
charters, conventions and protocols, including the African Charter on the Rights and 
Welfare of the Child in 1997 and the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and 
the Constitutive Act of the African Union in 1986.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. General legal framework for the protection of children 
</b></p>
<p>43. Benin has made considerable progress in strengthening its legal framework for the 
protection of children. Article 26 of the 1990 Constitution stipulates that the State must 
protect the family, and mothers and children in particular. The Code on Persons and the 
Family, adopted in 2004, has many articles relating to the best interests of the child and 
abrogates all legislation to the contrary, in particular customary law (Circular A.P. 120 of 
19 March 1931, entitled Customary Law of Dahomey) used until then for decisions 
concerning marriage, descent, parental authority, divorce and child custody, inheritance etc. 
Drawing on the principle of equality, this new legislation improves the legal situation of 
women and children in a number of areas, notably the steps to be taken to declare and 
register births, and conditions and procedures for adoption. Benin has also adopted many 
laws to strengthen the protection of children, including Act 98-004 on the Labour Code 
(articles 166 to 168 of which concern protection of children from exploitation), Act No. 
2003-17 on the educational system, which incorporates the principle of education for all 
and confirms the dual apprenticeship system, Act No. 2003-03 on the suppression of female 
genital mutilation, Act No. 2006-19 on the suppression of sexual harassment and the 
protection of victims and Act No. 2011-26 on the prevention and suppression of violence 
against women.  
</p>
<p>44. Despite this progress, legal lacunae subsist. A bill of March 2013 on a children&#8217;s 
code25 has been elaborated but is still in the process of being adopted in the National 
Assembly. Once adopted, the text would provide a complete legal framework for the 
protection of children. The Special Rapporteur was surprised, however, about the reference 
in chapter III to children&#8217;s duties, which she considers inappropriate.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur also noted that some persons responsible for the protection 
of children are poorly informed about legislation relating to the rights of children, and that 
the institutions and persons concerned (judges, social workers, police officers and labour 
inspectors) fail to apply those texts sufficiently.

<p>GE.14-11826 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Punishment of the sale and sexual exploitation of children 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Criminal Code in force in Benin is the <i>Recueil annot&#233; de textes de droit p&#233;nal 
applicables en Afrique occidentale fran&#231;aise</i> (annotated compilation of criminal law texts 
applicable in French West Africa), which stems from the Decree of 6 May 1877 (Bouvenet 
Code).26 Today, this text is on the whole obsolete. In 1996, the Government of Benin began 
elaborating a draft criminal code. According to the Ministry of Justice, the latest version, 
dating from August 2013, is to be considered by the National Assembly in early 2014. The 
Special Rapporteur noted that this text and the future children&#8217;s code should be 
harmonized. Pending the adoption of these two texts, Benin&#8217;s legislation does not provide 
children with adequate protection against various forms of sale and sexual exploitation.  
</p>
<p><i>  Sale of children 
</i>47. Legislation currently in force in Benin does not contain any provision on the sale of 
children. Articles 333 and 334 of the draft children&#8217;s code provides for severe penalties for 
this crime, ranging from 5 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of between 500,000 and 5 
million CFA francs. The Special Rapporteur noted, however, that the sale of children for 
illegal adoption has not been clearly defined and made punishable in the future code, which 
also does not provide for the establishment of an independent body responsible for 
overseeing the adoption process.  
</p>
<p><i>  Trafficking in children 
</i>48. Act No. 2006-04 on conditions governing the placement of minors and the 
suppression of trafficking in children in Benin defines trafficking in children in conformity 
with the Palermo Protocol and prohibits trafficking in children for the purpose of 
prostitution and/or the production of pornography or for pornographic performances. It 
covers both internal and transnational trafficking in children. It also makes provision for 
harsh sentences, up to 20 years&#8217; imprisonment for the perpetrators and their accomplices 
and anyone who assists them. Penalties range from 6 months&#8217; imprisonment to life 
imprisonment and a fine of between 10,000 and 5 million CFA francs.  
</p>
<p><i>  Child prostitution and child sex tourism  
</i></p>
<p>49. Article 34 of the Act on Violence against Women specifies that forced prostitution is 
punishable by 1 to 5 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine of between 1 and 10 million CFA 
francs, and by at least 10 years&#8217; imprisonment if the victim is under 16 years of age. Article 
334 of the Bouvenet Code stipulates that perpetrators of sexual exploitation of children 
under 21 years of age are liable to between 6 months and 5 years&#8217; imprisonment and a fine 
of between 4,000 and 10 million CFA francs. However, the definitions and sanctions 
relating to child prostitution are inappropriate. Pursuant to article 315 of the draft children&#8217;s 
code, anyone who offers, obtains or uses a child for sexual purposes in exchange for 
remuneration or benefits of any other kind is liable to 5 to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment and a 
fine of between 2 million and 5 million CFA francs. Article 316 provides for the principle 
of extraterritoriality.  
</p>
<p><i>  Child pornography 
</i></p>
<p>50. The only law that makes reference to child pornography is the 2006 Trafficking Act, 
which prohibits trafficking for the production of pornography and for pornographic

<p>performances. Pursuant to article 318 of the draft children&#8217;s code, the production, 
distribution, dissemination, import, export, gift, sale or possession of any material 
depicting, by any means, a child engaged in explicit sexual activities, whether real or 
simulated, or the sexual organs of a child is punishable by 2 to 5 years&#8217; imprisonment and a 
fine of 2 million to 5 million CFR francs.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Prosecution and punishment of offenders 
</b></p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur expressed great concern that none of the judicial authorities 
was able to cite a sole indictment for sexual exploitation of children, although the 
phenomenon is recognized, and that they were able to cite very few indictments for child 
rape. 
</p>
<p>52. She was alarmed about the large number of cases of sexual abuse which do not lead 
to a conviction due to the failure of the judicial authorities to enforce the law but also 
because of out-of-court settlements. Fear and threats play a significant role. Most Beninese 
live in fear of &#8220;mystical powers&#8221; and do not dare report cases of abuse or exploitation. The 
Special Rapporteur was informed of many instances of reprisals for cases reported, even at 
the level of the Social Advancement Centres (staff members are said to have been 
transferred after they reported cases of sexual violence). 
</p><p>53. Even when complaints are lodged, they are often withdrawn and the authorities do 
not fulfil their obligation to prosecute. Several judges told the Special Rapporteur that it 
was preferable for some cases of sexual abuse to be settled in the family.  
</p>
<p>54. According to information provided by the Cotonou Court, only three cases of child 
rape were heard between January and October 2013 although, as indicated above, OCPM 
had received 52 complaints in the first six months of 2013. Of the 159 cases of trafficking 
received by OCPM in 2012, only 13 were taken to court. Witch doctors often are not 
reported or punished for fear that they will cast a spell. According to information received, 
two Lokossa witch doctors were brought before the prosecutor&#8217;s office for unlawful 
confinement of children in convents, but no action was taken.  
</p>
<p>55. As to sexual violence in schools, a serious problem referred to by all stakeholders 
interviewed, the Special Rapporteur was alarmed to learn that in 2013, only two teachers 
had been sentenced to prison, one in connection with the abortion of a minor resulting in 
her death, and the other for the rape of a minor who became pregnant. Between 2011 and 
2013, six teachers were prosecuted for sexual abuse resulting in pregnancy or for sexual 
harassment of schoolchildren, but they were only sentenced to a temporary suspension and, 
in some cases, to a suspension of salary,27 although the sanctions under articles 331 to 333 
of the Bouvenet Code range from imprisonment to forced labour for life. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the Decree of May 2012, which makes provision for sanctions to be 
imposed on perpetrators of sexual violence in schools, is absolutely inappropriate, since it 
only calls for suspension of employment and salary in cases of sexual abuse committed 
against schoolchildren.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned about impunity and corruption, which 
greatly impede the application of the law. Several State officials admitted that they were 
sometimes subjected to pressure by political decision makers and community leaders.

</b></p>
<p><b> C. Institutional framework for the protection of children 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Ministry of the Family, Social Affairs, National Solidarity, Persons with 
Disabilities and Older Persons is composed of several administrative directorates, including 
the Observatory of the Family, Women and Children, which is responsible for studies and 
documentation on questions relating to the family, women and children, and the Directorate 
of the Family, Children and Adolescence, which is tasked with elaborating and 
implementing assistance and social reinsertion programmes for children in difficult 
situations. In 2006, the Directorate set up a National Coordination and Monitoring Office 
for Child Protection and acts as its permanent secretariat. The Office coordinates and 
monitors action taken to promote the rights of children at national level, and its local 
branches monitor the rights of children at their level. The Special Rapporteur noted that the 
Office suffers from a lack of commitment by other ministries, which consider that only the 
Ministry of the Family has competence. It should be pointed out, however, that child 
protection concerns many ministries, and this affects the effective implementation of 
policies and strategies. Moreover, the members who take part in the meetings do not have 
decision-making power, which is a major obstacle to putting decisions into effect. 
</p><p>58. The Office is represented locally by departmental and district coordination and 
monitoring offices for the protection of children. However, the child protection policy is 
difficult to implement at local level because the departments and municipal councils often 
do not have budget allocations for this purpose. During her visits to a number of districts, 
the Special Rapporteur noted that some mayors were not interested in the question of child 
protection.  
</p>
<p>59. The Social Advancement Centres, which report to the Ministry of the Family, should 
play a key role in the protection of children, but they do not have the necessary resources. 
Their staff often works under very difficult conditions, and the Centres are not in a position 
to take in child victims. Many also regretted the lack of continuity due to constant change in 
personnel. The Special Rapporteur noted the presence in some Centres of legal assistants 
responsible for ensuring that legal action is taken in cases of sexual abuse or exploitation, a 
practice which she strongly encourages.  
</p>
<p>60. The Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, through its Human Rights Directorate, is 
responsible for the promotion and popularization of texts and the elaboration of periodic 
reports on the implementation of international instruments ratified by Benin. The 
Directorate for Legal Protection of Children and Young People is mandated to address legal 
and institutional questions relating to the protection of children and young people in 
conflict with the law or in moral danger. The centres for the protection of children and 
adolescents operating under the Directorate are tasked with sheltering children in conflict 
with the law who have been the subject of a judicial placement decision. These centres, 
such as the one in Applahou&#233;, are not always operational. According to information 
received, there are only 10 juvenile judges in the entire country, including 2 in Cotonou. 
The juvenile judges only hear cases of children in conflict with the law, and not cases 
involving child victims, for which the president of the court has competence.28 The 
children&#8217;s code makes changes in this regard. The Special Rapporteur noted that the 
secondment of social workers to the courts is a good practice to promote.  
</p>
<p>61. The National Commission on Children&#8217;s Rights, created in 1999, is under the 
authority of the Ministry of Justice, Legislation and Human Rights. It is responsible for the 
coordination, protection and promotion of children&#8217;s rights. Chaired by the Minister of

<p>Justice and vice-chaired by the Minister of the Family, the Commission is composed of 
members of many other ministries and representatives of civil society appointed by order of 
the Minister of Justice. The departmental committees on children&#8217;s rights, which are 
chaired by the prefects of the departments, are made up of the directors of the decentralized 
services of the member bodies of the Commission, which usually holds two annual sessions 
(and sometimes just one). However, the Special Rapporteur stressed that the Commission is 
not an independent body in line with the Paris Principles29 and general comments No. 2 and 
No. 5 of the Committee on the Rights of the Child.30 She encouraged the reform process 
under way in this regard.31 
</p>
<p>62. The Ministry of the Interior, Public Security and Worship, through OCPM and the 
police and gendarmerie, ensures the protection of endangered children (child victims and 
children in conflict with the law) and maintains a hotline (116 and 117). OCPM is present 
solely in Cotonou. The Government is planning to open offices in all departments in which 
the local police and the gendarmerie are carrying out that function for the moment. The 
police and the gendarmerie must work with very limited resources. Sometimes they do not 
even have the vehicles or petrol needed to take action when a perpetrator of abuse has been 
identified.  
</p>
<p>63. The Ministry of Nursery and Primary School Education and the Ministry of 
Secondary School Education initiate, prepare and propose educational policies, strategies 
and plans of action and oversee their implementation. The Ministry of Nursery and Primary 
School Education coordinates activities aimed at encouraging girls to attend school. The 
Ministry of Secondary School Education has set up counselling and monitoring offices for 
child victims of violence, but such facilities have not been systematically introduced in all 
schools. 
</p>
<p>64. The objective of the Ministry of Health is to implement the policies defined by the 
Government in the health field. One of its specialized bodies is a maternal and child health 
directorate, which coordinates activities relating to maternal and infant health and family 
planning.  
</p>
<p>65. The National Steering Committee to Combat Child Labour, set up in July 2008 
within the Ministry of Labour and the Civil Service, is mandated to direct the elaboration of 
policies, to approve programmes to combat child labour and to coordinate, supervise, 
monitor and evaluate activities in this area. The Committee, which brings together 15 
ministries, has technical commissions, including one on juvenile workers who are victims 
of sexual exploitation. However, the Special Rapporteur was told that the decisions taken at 
the meetings of this Committee are not always acted upon.  
</p>
<p>66. Given the weakness of State institutional capacities, the network of associations 
plays an important role in the protection of children, providing for virtually all non-
custodial support, placement, accommodation, care and reintegration of children. The 
Special Rapporteur noted the large number of associations active in the protection of

<p>children, with a great deal of goodwill, although sometimes with limited resources and 
insufficient coordination, complementarity and synergy.  
</p>
<p><i>  Interministerial coordination 
</i></p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur noted that the proliferation of bodies involved in the 
protection of children seriously affects the effective implementation of policies, plans of 
actions and programmes.32 She cited the example of duplication between the National 
Coordination Office, the National Commission on Children&#8217;s Rights and the National 
Steering Committee to Combat Child Labour, and she encouraged a clarification of the 
mandates of the bodies concerned so as to rationalize and optimize resources.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Detection, childcare and monitoring policies and programmes  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Policies, plans of action and programmes 
</b></p>
<p>68. In 2007, with technical assistance from UNICEF, Benin adopted its policy and 
strategies for the protection of children and a plan of action for the quinquennium 2008&#8211;
</p><p>2012. However, the Special Rapporteur noted that many objectives under this policy were 
not attained, including the introduction of a centralized information system; the 
establishment of a mechanism to monitor and evaluate the situation of children&#8217;s rights; the 
effective capacity-building of State structures responsible for child protection, and the 
harmonization, adoption and implementation of legislation; and the availability and 
accessibility of basic social services and protection services. For a children&#8217;s policy to be 
effective, decentralization policies must be effective and must have the requisite budgeting. 
In 2013, the Ministry of the Family launched the elaboration of a comprehensive child 
protection policy.  
</p>
<p>69. Benin has introduced many other policies and programmes relating to child 
protection, including the national policy for the comprehensive development of young 
children (2011), the national plan of action to eliminate the worst forms of child labour 
(2012&#8211;2015), the national policy and strategies for social protection (2004&#8211;2013), the 
national plan of action to combat trafficking in children for the purpose of exploiting their 
labour (2007) and also the national policy for the advancement of women, a political 
strategies document on the family, including the national plan of action for the family, the 
community-based national rehabilitation programme, the programme to strengthen social 
protection and promote national solidarity, and the programme for the promotion of the 
family and gender equality and equity. Without a reliable information and 
monitoring/evaluation system, it is not possible to assess the impact of these policies and 
programmes.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Detection, care and rehabilitation of children 
</b></p>
<p>70. Providing care and effective protection for children who are victims of sale, 
trafficking, abuse or sexual exploitation is a complex process that requires an 
interdisciplinary and holistic approach to ensure assistance, medical, psychological and 
legal support, rehabilitation/reintegration and monitoring for these children.  
</p>
<p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> GE.14-11826 
</p>
<p><i> (a) Identification, and reporting and complaint mechanisms 
</i>71. The principal State bodies that receive complaints concerning child victims of 
violence, abuse, exploitation or trafficking are the Social Advancement Centres, OCPM, the 
police and gendarmerie and, in rare cases, health centres. According to many stakeholders 
interviewed, the obligation to report is not always complied with, and the lifting of medical 
confidentiality is not systematic. Like OCPM, the Social Advancement Centres have 
counselling services, but the procedures are not in accordance with international standards: 
the meeting rooms are not adapted to child victims, and a psychologist or social worker is 
not always present. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that the participation of 
children in the judicial process is not in conformity with international standards either, 
since the proceedings are not held in camera.  
</p>
<p>72. OCPM has a hotline (116 and 117), but the Special Rapporteur noted that it was not 
operational. No register is kept, and it was not possible to provide statistics on calls. 
According to information received, child victims do not know these numbers.  
</p>
<p>73. NGOs play an important role in the identification of victims. Plan International has 
set up a reporting system through SMS &#8220;Ushaidi&#8221; with a hotline number (+22996008484). 
According to children&#8217;s associations, the Ushaidi system is functioning. However, the 
Special Rapporteur regretted that, for lack of resources, the police and the gendarmerie 
contacted by Plan International did not always take action. Salesian nuns have set up an 
&#8220;SOS Vidom&#233;gons Stall&#8221; at the Danktopa market. Two organizers circulate at the market 
and encourage and receive reports of abuse and exploitation. The Salesian nuns also have a 
hotline (7344) and work with a pool of lawyers and psychologists.  
</p><p>74. The Special Rapporteur noted with regret the serious limits in the reporting 
mechanisms made available to children and the frequent failure to take action on 
complaints. Officials active in the protection of children are often unfamiliar with 
legislation and even with the reporting protocol. In addition to a reluctance to report 
complaints due to cultural resistance and fear of reprisals, the complexity of procedures 
also often discourages reporting.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Care and rehabilitation 
</i>75. The Special Rapporteur noted throughout her visit the many gaps in the system for 
providing care for child victims, starting with medical treatment, which is not always free. 
Even when the child is accompanied by a social worker in a health centre, the fees must be 
covered by the victim, including the medical certificate. According to many stakeholders 
interviewed, the health-care fund for the indigent is not working properly: health-care 
facilities refuse to cooperate, because the State does not reimburse them. Some associations 
have stepped in to provide care for child victims. 
</p>
<p>76. All stakeholders interviewed referred to the acute shortage of public childcare 
facilities, in particular shelters and transit centres for child victims. The only State childcare 
facility is the Reception and Transit Centre of OCPM. In 2012, it took in 777 children (483 
girls and 294 boys). Police stations, particularly in remote departments and areas, rarely 
have facilities to take in child victims, who sometimes must stay for several days at the cost 
of the police themselves. In the absence of State bodies, many local and international 
associations provide comprehensive care for children in difficult situations and sometimes 
also ensure training, educational and occupational rehabilitation and family reintegration. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-11826 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>Associations have set up foster family networks. In some cases, reintegration is very 
difficult when the family rejects the child.33  
</p><p>77. These associations are usually unable to shelter many children and have very limited 
material and human resources. Very few NGOs have permanent multidisciplinary teams 
(social workers, teachers, psychologists, health-care workers, paralegals) with adequate 
training. Often dependent on donors, the associations cannot ensure programme continuity. 
They also encounter many difficulties when caring for children. According to information 
received, placement orders issued by the courts are subject to a charge of between 5,000 
and 10,000 CFA francs per child.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur has noted that support for child victims is fragmented and 
that there is a considerable waste of resources because of considerable duplication and 
many gaps in the protection chain. Harmonization of practices and compliance with 
standards for the care of child victims are insufficient. Intervention protocols34 should be 
put in place detailing the roles of each stakeholder. Despite the adoption of Decree No. 
2012-416 establishing norms and standards applicable to the country&#8217;s child reception and 
protection centres, many centres do not comply, and inspections are rare. The Special 
Rapporteur regrets that neither the social services nor the courts monitor these children. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Prevention, training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p><i>  Preventive measures 
</i></p>
<p>79. Many preventive measures have been implemented in recent years by the 
Government, associations, international organizations and donor countries. These activities 
include dissemination and popularization of legislation on the protection of children, 
advocacy work (for birth registration, the fight against violence, abuse, exploitation, 
trafficking and sexually transmitted diseases, the promotion of school attendance, etc.), 
partnership agreements with community radio stations for the broadcast in local languages 
of programmes on trafficking in children, and the holding of days on questions relating to 
children. UNICEF has launched an awareness-raising initiative with heads of convents and 
has trained journalists on children&#8217;s rights.  
</p><p>80. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets the lack of courses on sex education in 
school curricula. Such courses are included in life science and earth science curricula, but 
not until ninth grade, although at that age many young girls have already had their first 
pregnancy. Despite efforts by the Ministry of Health and the United Nations Population 
Fund in this regard, family planning programmes are limited.  
</p>
<p>81. It is regrettable that some forms of violence and exploitation persist due to certain 
sociocultural practices. The prevention of all forms of exploitation of children is a long-
term effort that goes beyond mere awareness-raising campaigns. Effective prevention must 
attack the problems at the root, including vulnerability and factors linked to supply and 
demand.

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> GE.14-11826 
</p>
<p><i>  Training and capacity-building 
</i></p>
<p>82. For many years, numerous training workshops on the protection of children&#8217;s rights 
have been regularly held for police officers, gendarmes, judges, social workers and teachers 
by various ministries, often with support from technical and financial partners, and by 
associations active in the area of children&#8217;s rights. Despite all these efforts, stakeholders 
interviewed often stressed the insufficient qualifications of many persons working in the 
field of child protection. Many stakeholders referred to the adverse impact of frequent 
changes in personnel, in particular in the Social Advancement Centres, which is detrimental 
to ensuring continuity and building on progress made. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur underscored the importance of setting up a system to assess 
practices and progress made once training programmes are completed and of introducing 
measures to evaluate the impact of prevention programmes.  
</p>
<p>84. Without a specific and sustained commitment to child protection at the highest State 
level, any preventive and capacity-building measures will have only a very limited impact.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Participation of children 
</b></p>
<p>85. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the many initiatives for the participation of 
children which have been implemented in recent years in Benin, for example, consultative 
children&#8217;s councils, children&#8217;s village committees for development and child reporters. 
Children also host broadcasts on their rights on national and local radio stations.  
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Children&#8217;s Parliament, which had been 
established in 2003, has been discontinued. She was informed that the Beninese Parliament 
has put forward a proposal to set up a youth parliament (18&#8211;25 years of age), but has 
expressed reservations about that initiative, which might use young people for political 
ends. 
</p>
<p>87. Despite occasional initiatives, real participation of children in the process of taking 
decisions affecting them is limited and their opinions are very rarely taken into account. In 
her meetings with organizations of children and young people, the Special Rapporteur 
noted that some children and young people were a force for change, positively influencing 
community leaders, traditional chiefs and religious leaders. The participation of children in 
the progressive identification and promotion of social practices and conduct that respect 
their rights should be encouraged.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Data collection 
</b></p>
<p>88. A standardized and centralized information system is a key tool for preventing and 
combating all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation of children. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes the creation in 2007 of a database on children in need of special 
protection measures, managed by the Observatory of the Family, Women and Children. 
However, she regrets the inadequacy of collection tools on the ground and the failure to 
include certain situations in the database. She noted above all that data came only from 
bodies attached to the Ministry of the Family, but that there was no centralized information 
system covering all data relating to children which the various State authorities (the courts, 
the police, the Ministries of the Family, Health and Education, etc.) and relevant 
associations dispose of. She encouraged the ongoing process of reviewing the CHILDPRO 
database.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p>GE.14-11826 <b>19 
</b></p>
<p><b> H. Monitoring, evaluation and oversight bodies 
</b></p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur noted during her visit that there was no independent national 
body to monitor children&#8217;s rights. As pointed out earlier, the National Commission on 
Children&#8217;s Rights, which is directly attached to the Ministry of Justice, is not an 
independent body. The Beninese Human Rights Commission, which was set up in 1989, 
encountered many problems, including the lack of legal provisions to ensure State funding. 
In 2004, it discontinued its activities entirely. In December 2012, Benin adopted legislation 
to establish a new national human rights body; the legislation was signed by the President 
of Benin in February 2013. The process of appointing its members has not begun, because 
the President has not yet signed the requisite implementing decree. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Social responsibility of the private sector 
</b></p>
<p>90. The Special Rapporteur was not informed of any initiative launched by the private 
sector for the protection of children, apart from occasional cooperation of the Department 
of Tourism with private tour operators. During her visit, she stressed the importance of 
developing partnerships with the private sector, including with tour operators, Internet 
access providers and telecommunications companies, which might, for example, ensure 
sustainable funding for emergency hotlines for child victims of all forms of violence, abuse 
or exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Regional and international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>91. Benin has concluded many bilateral and multilateral agreements with the countries 
of the western and central African subregion, in particular on combating trafficking in 
children in western Africa.  
</p>
<p>92. For many years, technical and financial partners and the major international NGOs 
have been supporting many projects for the development, promotion and protection of 
children&#8217;s rights and prevention, awareness-raising and training initiatives in most State 
institutions. Although initiatives have on occasion been successful, the Special Rapporteur 
noted dissatisfaction with the limited overall results of these investments. In this 
connection, she encourages the creation of a system of cross-compliance and of 
performance and impact indicators. She noted a lack of coordination between the 
stakeholders involved in the country&#8217;s development. Although a joint programming process 
has been initiated in the United Nations Country Team in Benin, work continues to focus 
on a &#8220;project&#8221; logic, whereas a strategic joint programming framework would enable the 
Country Team to better respond to national priorities and would strengthen the impact of 
action taken and avoid duplication. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The Special Rapporteur noted that the protection of children is not a priority 
on Benin&#8217;s political agenda. She expressed her deep concern about the relative social 
tolerance towards violence and exploitation involving children and the impunity of the 
perpetrators of these crimes. Today many children are victims of sale, trafficking and 
economic and sexual exploitation. However, the true scale of these phenomena is 
difficult to gauge due to weak reporting and to recourse to out-of-court settlements. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/48/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> GE.14-11826 
</p>
<p><b>The number of cases of violence and of economic and sexual exploitation involving 
girls is particularly alarming. The Special Rapporteur expressed alarm about sexual 
violence involving schoolgirls and the growing number of early pregnancies. It is 
unacceptable that girls are abused with impunity in schools, which are supposed to 
provide an educational and protective environment. 
</b></p>
<p>94.  <b>Although Benin has many laws relating to the protection of children, they are 
ineffectively implemented due to difficulties of access for children to recourse 
mechanism guaranteeing their protection and safety, as well as corruption and 
impunity. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Many mechanisms and actions for child protection have been put in place at 
central and local level, but most are dysfunctional or insufficient, notably because of a 
lack of resources. Despite the commitment of certain parties, initiatives undertaken to 
protect children continue to be isolated, uncoordinated and unsustainable, since they 
are dependent on partners.  
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The Special Rapporteur stressed the need for a shift from a project focus to a 
genuine comprehensive child protection strategy with local protection mechanisms 
readily accessible to all children and equipped with the necessary human and financial 
resources.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>In a spirit of dialogue and cooperation, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
formulate the following recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>In order to ensure an effective and sustainable protection of all children against 
all forms of violence, abuse and exploitation, the Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to adopt a cross-cutting approach centred on children&#8217;s rights and which 
aims to put in place an overarching strategic framework for comprehensive child 
protection.

<p>99. <b>To this end, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government ensure 
the effective application of laws by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Accelerating the reform process to bring the national legal framework 
into line with international standards and address the shortcomings in some of the 
legislation on child protection, notably by adopting the children&#8217;s code; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Effectively combating corruption and impunity and fully applying the 
laws in force, which impose severe penalties for perpetrators of child sexual 
exploitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  Accelerating judicial procedures; 
 (d) Guaranteeing the protection and safety of children in legal proceedings, 
ensuring confidentiality and preventing the re-victimization of child victims; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Establishing mechanisms to regularly monitor the implementation of 
laws. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>She also recommends that the capacities and governance of central and local 
bodies should be strengthened by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Clarifying the mandates of bodies active in the protection of children, 
and establishing intersectoral coordination mechanisms in order to avoid overlap and 
optimize resources; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Introducing good governance mechanisms at central and local level 
through the establishment of accountability and monitoring-evaluation mechanisms; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Concluding partnership agreements between the public authorities and 
NGOs, and clarifying the roles and commitments of the parties concerned, resources, 
timetables and monitoring procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>She also recommends that the Government set up comprehensive protection 
systems for all children, without discrimination, by: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Encouraging reporting by disseminating and simplifying reporting 
forms and mechanisms and by establishing redress mechanisms easily accessible to 
children and guaranteeing their protection and safety;

<p>102. <b>She recommends the implementation of effective and sustainable preventive 
measures by initiating or strengthening: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  Integrated local development plans to improve the living conditions and 
standards of vulnerable populations and provide vulnerable children and families 
with equitable access to social and protection services;

<p><b> (c)  Supporting children&#8217;s and young person&#8217;s activities and organizations to 
ensure that children are more effectively equipped to protect themselves and their 
peers. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>For improved knowledge of the scale of these phenomena and related 
developments, the Special Rapporteur recommends: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a)  The establishment of a centralized, standardized and reliable 
information-gathering and processing system to collect data disaggregated by age, sex, 
background and status, and giving a clear description of the crime committed against
