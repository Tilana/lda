identify, promote and exchange views on best practices related to access to safe drinking 
water and sanitation, and, in that regard, to prepare a compendium of best practices. In the 
report the independent expert presents a framework for assessing good practices from a 
human rights perspective, using five normative criteria (availability, quality/safety, 
acceptability, accessibility and affordability) and five cross-cutting criteria (non-
discrimination, participation, accountability, impact and sustainability).  
</p>
<p> The independent expert encourages all relevant stakeholders to submit their good

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, submits the present report to 
the Human Rights Council in accordance with its resolution 7/22. In the resolution, the 
Council asks the independent expert to develop a dialogue with Governments, the relevant 
United Nations bodies, the private sector, local authorities, national human rights 
institutions, civil society organizations and academic institutions, to identify, promote and 
exchange views on best practices related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, 
and, in that regard, to prepare a compendium of best practices. To approach this task, the 
independent expert decided to focus her work on good practices and elaborate a set of 
criteria that can be used as a standard against which to assess whether a practice is &#8220;good&#8221; 
in human rights terms. 
</p>
<p>2. The identification of good practices addresses the question of how human rights 
related to water and sanitation can be realized and what approaches some actors have taken 
in that regard, hopefully inspiring others to put in place laws, policies and practices that will 
be consistent with human rights. Disseminating information on practices that have worked 
allows others to learn from these experiences and can promote progress in ensuring access 
to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation. In this regard, the identification and 
dissemination of good practices can contribute to the progressive realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights, as well as to preventing human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Process and approach 
</b></p>
<p>3. When she took up her mandate, the independent expert consulted with numerous 
people, seeking advice and exchanging views on how to approach the collection of best 
practices. Her first decision was to adjust the terminology contained in Council resolution 
7/22 slightly, focusing instead on &#8220;good&#8221; practices. This decision is based on the 
observation that different approaches can be equally good in various contexts. 
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with her report submitted to the Human Rights Council at its tenth 
session, which laid out the programme of activities pursuant to her mandate, the 
independent expert started to work on criteria that will enable her to classify a practice as a 
&#8220;good practice&#8221; (A/HRC/10/6, para 34). As &#8220;good&#8221; is a very subjective notion, and since 
different actors might have different (or even opposing) views on the accuracy of 
designating a certain practice as good, the independent expert considered it necessary to 
elaborate criteria that are based on human rights standards and principles, in order to 
provide her with a clearer and more objective standard of assessment.  
</p>
<p>5. She organized an expert consultation in Lisbon, held on 7 and 8 October 2009, in 
order to discuss potential criteria for good practices. Participants representing United 
Nations agencies, development agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector, 
national human rights institutions, Governments, and academia attended. They were asked 
to consider a set of criteria, shared with them in advance, for determining whether practices 
related to water and sanitation could qualify as good from a human rights perspective. 
Taking into account the fruitful discussions at the meeting, the independent expert decided 
on two sets of criteria, which are introduced in the present report: (a) the normative criteria, 
comprising availability, quality/safety, acceptability, accessibility and affordability; and (b) 
the cross-cutting criteria, comprising non-discrimination, participation, accountability, 
impact and sustainability.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Based on these criteria, the independent expert elaborated a questionnaire, which 
was widely distributed to different stakeholder groups such as States, water and sanitation 
regulators, public and private water and sanitation service providers, national human rights 
institutions, civil society, donor agencies, intergovernmental organizations and others. In 
the context of identifying and submitting examples of good practices to be included in the 
compendium, the independent expert hopes that these human rights criteria will prove 
helpful to different actors for self-evaluating their respective practices. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. To prepare the compendium, the independent expert will rely on at least two types of 
information. First, she will consult the written responses to the questionnaire. Second, the 
independent expert has started to organize several stakeholder consultations to enable her to 
examine some practices in more detail. At the time of writing, two consultations have 
already been held with intergovernmental organizations and bilateral development 
agencies. Further consultations are planned with Governments, civil society organizations, 
national human rights institutions, public and private water and sanitation providers and 
potentially other individuals. By bringing people from the same sector together to discuss 
good practices related to human rights, water and sanitation, the independent expert hopes 
to facilitate exchange of these good practices in order to allow others to draw useful lessons 
from them. She also expects to identify common challenges in the realization of the rights 
to sanitation and water, as well as possible solutions for overcoming them. 
</p>
<p>8. Based on the written submissions and the examples of good practices gathered at the 
stakeholder consultations, the independent expert will submit to the Human Rights Council 
in 2011 a compendium of practices related to water and sanitation that have been assessed 
as &#8220;good&#8221; from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Criteria based on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>9. The independent expert considers that the collected practices must achieve &#8211; or 
contribute to achieving &#8211; the realization of the human rights to water and to sanitation.  
</p>
<p>10. The independent expert has a broad understanding of the term &#8220;practice&#8221;, which she 
considers to encompass both policy and implementation. What constitutes a good practice 
can thus include initiatives as diverse as international treaties, legislation (at the national, 
subnational and local levels), regulations, policies, strategies, institutional frameworks, 
planning and coordination procedures, international cooperation policies, programmes, 
projects, campaigns, subsidies, financing mechanisms, tariff structures, operators&#8217; 
contracts, complaints procedures and judicial and quasi-judicial decisions, among many 
other possible considerations.  
</p>
<p>11. The criteria contained in the present report are aimed at delineating more clearly the 
concrete requirements that enable the classification of a certain practice as good. The 
normative content of the human rights to sanitation and water provides the relevant human 
rights standards &#8211; or the normative criteria &#8211; (availability, quality/safety, acceptability, 
accessibility and affordability). The cross-cutting criteria (non-discrimination, participation, 
accountability, impact and sustainability) are based on human rights principles and more 
general human rights considerations. Both sets of criteria will be further outlined below.  
</p>
<p>12. In other contexts, a broad range of criteria has been suggested and used for the 
identification of good practices, including, for example, effectiveness, efficiency, relevance, 
ethical soundness, sustainability;1 impact, responsiveness, innovativeness/creativeness,<b>

</p>
<p>practices&#8221;, issue 1 (Geneva, 1999), p. 5. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>transferability, replicability,<b> </b>ease of implementation and gender considerations;2 or 
participation, non-discrimination and equality,3 among others. Some of these criteria &#8211; such 
as participation and non-discrimination &#8211; are already explicitly addressed from a human 
rights perspective. Impact and sustainability were identified as additional criteria 
considered essential for assessing practices from a human rights viewpoint. Others &#8211; such 
as responsiveness &#8211; are implicitly addressed, for instance via the criteria of participation 
and acceptability. The proposed criterion of effectiveness is also addressed by the impact 
criterion, and the relevance criterion is covered by the five normative criteria. The equality 
and gender considerations are implicitly addressed by the non-discrimination and 
participation criteria. Yet others, in particular ethical soundness and 
innovativeness/creativeness, seem redundant or irrelevant from a human rights perspective. 
Criteria that ask for practices that are valuable for replication and transferability could also 
be useful in a human rights context. However, these are not requirements, since, from a 
human rights perspective, a practice might be considered good even if it is aimed only at 
finding a solution for a small community facing unique challenges &#8211; thus not necessarily 
replicable. Similarly, efficient solutions or approaches that are easy to implement are 
important. Human rights law acknowledges the obligation to make progress in the 
constraints of limited financial resources and requires moving as expeditiously and 
effectively as possible towards the full realization of these rights.4 However, cost efficiency 
and ease of implementation are not dominant and overarching considerations - to the 
contrary, human rights may even call for solutions that involve comparatively high costs. 
For instance, participatory processes, which are considered fundamental from a human 
rights perspective, may have high costs, but are considered indispensable for the realization 
of human rights and for achieving a sustainable impact. 
</p>
<p>13. The human rights criteria outlined below are deliberately broad, flexible and 
adaptable. Human rights law does not prescribe a particular choice of policy or technology, 
but instead calls for context-specific solutions. It requires that individual needs are met and 
therefore excludes one-size-fits-all solutions. In this regard, human rights law stresses the 
perspective of the individual, provided that the exercise of individual rights does not 
infringe on the rights of others. Keeping this in mind, the identification of good practices 
aims to capture as wide a spectrum of different approaches as possible, ensuring that 
everyone&#8217;s human rights are met. 
</p>
<p>14. In the following sections, the independent expert will analyse all the criteria, as well 
as the way in which each one of them applies to the rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Normative criteria  
</b></p>
<p>15. The normative criteria for determining good practices are based on the normative 
content of the human rights to sanitation and water. The Committee on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights described the content of the right to water in its general comment 15 
(2002), and the independent expert, in her report on human rights obligations related to

</p>
<p>sanitation (A/HRC/12/24), described the normative content of the right to sanitation.<b> </b> The 
independent expert decided to build on this framework by defining the normative criteria 
for good practices, namely: availability, quality/safety, acceptability, accessibility and 
affordability. The categories are interrelated and some practices may correspond to several 
of the normative criteria, or only to one. For example, a tariff structure that takes into 
account the particular challenges faced by people living in poverty can be assessed in terms 
of affordability, whilst other criteria would be less relevant. On the other hand, a sector-
wide approach would relate to all the normative criteria. Practices which assist in the 
realization of the rights to water and sanitation by addressing one or more of these criteria 
will be considered by the independent expert in putting together the compendium, provided 
that the practice does not undermine or contradict the other criteria.  
</p>
<p>16. These criteria are explained in more detail below. An analysis of their relevance 
from a human rights perspective and examples of the types of good practices which might 
relate to them are also included.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Availability 
</b></p>
<p>17. In many instances, water and sanitation facilities are simply not available in 
sufficient quantity. People do not have enough water to satisfy their basic personal and 
domestic needs or it arrives only intermittently. With regard to sanitation, over a billion 
people still defecate in the open because sanitation facilities are not available to them.5 This 
criterion aims to respond to this reality.  
</p>
<p>18. Human rights law requires that there be a sufficient number of sanitation facilities 
with associated services to ensure that waiting times are not unreasonably long. Defining a 
minimum number of toilets for a given population is tempting, but might be 
counterproductive, since this may not take into account the particularities of a given 
community and the special needs of each one of its members. For instance, women, persons 
with disabilities, children and others may have particular sanitation requirements 
(A/HRC/12/24, para. 75).  
</p>
<p>19. With regard to water, the criterion provides that it has to be available continuously 
and in a sufficient quantity to meet the requirements of drinking and personal hygiene, as 
well as of further personal and domestic uses, such as cooking and food preparation, dish 
and laundry washing and cleaning.6 Neither continuity nor exact quantity required can be 
determined in the abstract, since individual requirements for water consumption vary, for 
instance due to climatic conditions, level of physical activity and personal health 
conditions. Thus, it is not possible to set precise amounts that apply at a global level. 
Supply needs to be continuous enough to allow for the collection of sufficient amounts to 
satisfy all needs, without compromising the quality of water.7 Regarding the necessary 
quantity, estimates and international recommendations can provide broad guidance for 
assessing whether the availability criterion is being met. For example, it has been estimated

 7 This issue also links to quality, because household water storage bears risks in terms of water quality 
</p>
<p>and health. Gundry, Wright and Conroy find that improving household water storage can reduce 
cholera. See S. Gundry, J. Wright and R. Conroy, &#8220;A systematic review of health outcomes related to 
household water quality in developing countries&#8221;, <i>Journal of Water and Health</i>, vol. 2, No. 1 (March 
2004), p. 1. See also WHO, <i>Combating Waterborne Disease at the Household Level</i> (Geneva, 2007), 
available from www.who.int/household_water/advocacy/combating_disease.pdf. </p>

<p>that all domestic needs can be met with about 100 litres per capita per day.8 An absolute 
minimum amount in the context of disaster response is set at 15 litres per capita per day.9 
However, such an amount raises health concerns, as it is insufficient to meet hygiene 
requirements, and must not be understood to correspond to the full realization of the right to 
water. 
</p>
<p>20. Taking into account this understanding of availability, a wide variety of practices 
might qualify as good from a human rights perspective. These might involve laws and 
policies for according priority to water for basic personal and domestic uses, exempting 
such water uses from licensing requirements, ensuring the minimum &#8220;lifeline&#8221; amount of 
water for personal and domestic uses, providing technologies to improve water continuity, 
promoting community-led sanitation or building latrines in communities which have none. 
Such practices relate to the availability of services, but will most likely simultaneously 
intersect with other criteria mentioned below. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Quality/safety 
</b></p>
<p>21. While the most recent estimates indicate that 884 million people still do not use 
improved water sources,10 the number of people relying on water of poor quality is 
unfortunately estimated to be much higher.11 Water contamination from pollution, natural 
geological phenomena such as arsenic in groundwater, inadequate sanitation, and improper 
handling and household storage have a profound effect on people&#8217;s health and, as a result, 
their capacity to go to school, work, or otherwise participate in society. The lack of access 
to safe and hygienic sanitation raises serious public health concerns. The criterion of 
quality/safety is directed at dealing with these problems.  
</p>
<p>22. Human rights require that sanitation facilities must be hygienically safe to use. This 
means that they must effectively prevent human and animal, including insect, contact with 
human excreta. Manual emptying of pit latrines should be avoided. Furthermore, facilities 
must ensure access to safe water and soap for hand-washing. Hygiene considerations, such 
as menstrual hygiene and anal and genital cleansing, also have important safety dimensions 
(A/HRC/12/24, para. 72).  
</p>
<p>23. Water must be of such a quality that it does not pose a threat to human health.12 The 
transmission of water-borne diseases via contaminated water must be avoided. In its 
<i>Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality, </i>WHO defines safe drinking water as water that 
&#8220;does not represent any significant risk to health over a lifetime of consumption, including 
different sensitivities that may occur between life stages&#8221;.13 The maximum limits provided 
in the <i>Guidelines</i> for a wide range of potentially harmful substances can serve as a 
reference point. The State may adopt these standards or create regional or national

</p>
<p>standards for implementation; in either case, it must ensure that such standards prevent 
hazards to human health. 
</p>
<p>24. Good practices related to safety and quality may be directed at different aspects, as 
the dimensions of this criterion are quite diverse. They could include, but are not limited to, 
laws and systems in place for monitoring and testing water quality, systems of ecological 
sanitation, innovative methods for emptying latrines in complicated environments such as 
slums, low cost sanitation solutions which hygienically separate excreta from human and 
animal contact, purification, filtration or other low cost solutions for rendering water 
potable, or hygienic household storage methods. <b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Acceptability 
</b></p>
<p>25. Perspectives differ with regard to which sanitation and water supply solutions are 
acceptable in a given context. Personal sanitation is a highly sensitive issue across regions 
and cultures. If facilities and sources are not acceptable because of, for instance, their 
position, then people will not use them. Thus, acceptability is an equally important 
criterion.  
</p>
<p>26. In many cultures, toilets must be constructed so as to ensure privacy. Acceptability 
will often require separate facilities for women and men in public places, and for girls and 
boys in schools. As mentioned above with regard to quality, facilities should accommodate 
common hygiene practices in specific cultures, such as anal and genital cleansing, and 
women&#8217;s toilets need to accommodate menstruation needs (A/HRC/12/24, para. 80). 
</p>
<p>27. Acceptability is also relevant for encouraging people to use safe water sources. In 
particular, water should be of an acceptable colour, odour and taste.14 These features must 
be understood in connection with water safety, which directly links to health requirements, 
since water may have an acceptable taste, colour or odour, but still be of unsafe quality.  
</p>
<p>28. Good practices related to the acceptability of drinking water and sanitation will 
inevitably involve a high degree of consultation with users to fully understand their 
definitions of &#8220;acceptable&#8221;. This could relate, for instance, to the design or location of a 
sanitation facility, or to the placement of a water point or the actual water source. Cultural 
prescriptions may also apply to conditions for use of these facilities. A proper dialogue with 
and awareness-raising among concerned groups is necessary to foster understanding of the 
linkages with other aspects of the rights to water and to sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Accessibility 
</b></p>
<p>29. Even where water and sanitation are generally available, they are frequently 
inaccessible for a host of reasons. Around the world, water points are often a long distance 
from the home, so people, especially girls and women, spend major portions of their day 
walking to collect water for their daily needs. Often, people&#8217;s security is threatened on their 
way to or while using the service, in particular when using sanitation facilities at night. The 
practices that meet the accessibility criterion would strive to overcome these issues. 
</p>
<p>30. The independent expert has stated that &#8220;sanitation facilities must be physically 
accessible for everyone within, or in the immediate vicinity of, each household, health or 
educational institution, public institutions and places, and the workplace&#8221; (A/HRC/12/24, 
para. 75). The same is true for water facilities. The distance to the sanitation facility or 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>water source should be in reach of every household, bearing in mind the special needs of 
certain groups and individuals. The path leading to the facility, and the facility or water 
source itself, should be safe and convenient for all users, including children, older people, 
persons with disabilities, women, including pregnant women, and chronically ill people. 
Furthermore, people must be able to use sanitation facilities safely at night. This can be 
facilitated through lighted paths, provision of flashlights, or other measures. The risk of 
attack from animals or people, in particular for women and children, and especially girls, 
has to be considered when choosing how to construct and where to locate the service in 
order to avoid such threats. 
</p>
<p>31. Regular maintenance and cleaning (such as emptying the pits or cleaning the water 
point surroundings) are essential to ensure the sustainability of sanitation and water 
facilities and continued access thereto.  
</p>
<p>32. Good practices with a particular focus on accessibility may include specially 
designed facilities for people with particular needs, including such features as ramps or 
handrails for people with disabilities, as well as interventions to bring water points closer to 
the home or the mobilization of community groups to ensure safety in and around water and 
sanitation facilities, among many others.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Affordability 
</b></p>
<p>33. In too many places, the poorest pay the most for water and sanitation services. Not 
being connected to the public network for water and sanitation services, people living in 
poverty sometimes have no other choice than to buy water from informal private vendors, 
who can charge 10 to 20 times more than public utilities.15 People may find networked 
services unaffordable, even if it is possible to connect. Since water and sanitation are so 
basic to survival, people may spend the extra money to acquire access, but often this comes 
at the expense of the enjoyment of other human rights. The affordability criterion addresses 
this problem.  
</p>
<p>34. Sanitation and water facilities and services must be available for use at a price that is 
affordable to all people. The provision of services includes construction, maintenance of 
facilities, treatment of water and disposal of faecal matter. Paying for these services must 
not limit people&#8217;s capacity to acquire other basic goods and services guaranteed by human 
rights, such as food, housing, health services and education. Affordability does not 
necessarily require services to be provided free of charge. When people are unable, for 
reasons beyond their control, to gain access to sanitation or water through their own means, 
the State is obliged to find solutions for ensuring this access.  
</p>
<p>35. Special caution must be exercised and due process guaranteed in cases of 
disconnection from the water supply due to a user&#8217;s inability to pay. Measures must be in 
place to ensure that such users are not deprived of access to safe water to meet their most 
basic personal and domestic needs, including sanitation needs when relying on water-borne 
sanitation.  
</p>
<p>36. With respect to affordability, good practice examples might relate to, inter alia, the 
inclusion of sanitation and water services in social safety nets, microcredit programmes or 
revolving funds to help people afford the connection cost to the network, tariff structures 
with built-in cross-subsidies, policies regarding disconnections, or initiatives to monitor and 
regulate the price of water and sanitation.

<p><b> III. Cross-cutting criteria 
</b></p>
<p>37. Non-discrimination, participation and accountability are defining attributes of 
human rights, with a combined effect of empowering the powerless, the marginalized and 
the excluded. In this regard, these three criteria are natural for the identification of good 
practices from a human rights perspective. They are also reflected in the human rights-
based approach to development,16 which is a guiding framework for interventions to ensure 
access to water and sanitation. In considering further criteria, and through discussions in 
particular with water and sanitation practitioners, impact and sustainability were added as 
they were considered equally essential in the human rights context.  
</p>
<p>38. The independent expert considers that good practices need to meet all five cross-
cutting criteria to some degree, and at the very least, the practice must not undermine or 
contradict these. For instance, a substantial effort to extend access to water to the entire 
population in a given area, but which perpetuates prohibited forms of discrimination by 
providing separate taps for the majority population and for a marginalized or excluded 
group, while meeting the criterion of accessibility, cannot be considered a good practice 
from a human rights perspective. 
</p>
<p>39. Below, these criteria are explained in more detail, including their relevance from a 
human rights perspective and examples of the types of good practices which might relate to 
them.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>40. In many countries, some people are discriminated against because of their colour, 
sex, language, ethnicity, nationality or other grounds. In the fields of sanitation and water, 
discrimination can manifest itself, for instance, in denied or restricted access to sanitation 
facilities or to water sources for certain groups of people. The non-discrimination criterion 
is aimed at highlighting and correcting these types of situations.  
</p>
<p>41. Non-discrimination is at the heart of human rights law, with non-discrimination 
provisions in most human rights treaties and declarations. In article 2 of both the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International 
Covenant Civil and Political Rights, discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights contained 
in the respective treaties on the basis of &#8220;race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or 
other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status&#8221; is prohibited.17 
Subsequent human rights treaties focus on people who experience discrimination, and 
undertake to specify their rights. These include the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1965), the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child (1989), the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (1990) and the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006). Over time, the list of prohibited grounds of

<p><b>A/HRC/15/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>discrimination has grown to include also &#8211; under the grounds of &#8220;other status&#8221; &#8211; age, health 
status, and economic and social situation,18 among other categories.  
</p>
<p>42. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has defined discrimination 
as &#8220;any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference or other differential treatment that is 
directly or indirectly based on the prohibited grounds of discrimination and which has the 
intention or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an 
equal footing, of Covenant rights&#8221;.19 
</p>
<p>43. This applies equally to de jure and de facto discrimination.20 De jure discrimination 
is explicit in laws, policies or other instruments, for example, when a water law provides 
that only citizens (and not non-citizens) have the right to access safe drinking water. De 
jure discrimination is a violation of human rights, and such provisions must be repealed and 
replaced.  
</p>
<p>44. However, discrimination is often not explicit, but only evident in the de facto impact 
of seemingly neutral policies. For instance, a given water and sanitation policy might 
require users to present documents, such as a birth certificate, property title or a building 
permit, in order to be connected to the network. At first view, this requirement is neutral. 
However, in examining the specific situation in a country, one may realize that members of 
a particular minority group have very low rates of birth registration, or lack formal 
ownership over the land on which they live. The policy will have a de facto discriminatory 
impact on this minority group because it will be unable to connect to the water and sewage 
networks.  
</p>
<p>45. In order to addresss existing discrimination, positive measures and targeted action 
may be required. In this regard, human rights require a focus on the people who are the 
most marginalized and vulnerable to exclusion and discrimination. These include persons 
falling within the prohibited grounds of discrimination mentioned above, as well as other 
specific groups who may have particular concerns related to access to safe drinking water 
and sanitation, such as nomadic and traveller communities, people living in rural or 
deprived urban areas, prisoners and other detainees, victims of natural disasters, persons 
living in disaster-prone areas, and those living in arid or semi-arid areas or on small islands. 
Good practices relating to eliminating discrimination may be aimed specifically to address 
the situation of disadvantaged groups and the discriminatory practices which perpetuate 
their exclusion. For instance, such practices might focus on innovative ways to ensure the 
provision of services to remote rural areas or slums where people lack legal title to the land 
they live on. Other examples might include guarantees that no forced evictions will be 
carried out, or partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as intermediaries 
to extend services to discriminated groups.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>46. Furthermore, good practices may identify de jure and de facto forms of 
discrimination, including their root causes, and design interventions to end such 
discrimination. This is possible, inter alia, through legislative action and lobbying for 
changes in the law, awareness-raising on the de facto discriminatory impacts of policies and 
the correction of such policies, and mobilization to change attitudes and prejudices which 
feed discrimination.

</p>
<p><b> B. Participation  
</b></p>
<p>47. Some interventions in the fields of sanitation and water are planned and 
implemented without sufficient participation of the beneficiaries, which can compromise 
the effectiveness of a project. For instance, if new water points are to be built in a 
community, and the beneficiaries do not actively participate in this process, the intervention 
may not meet people&#8217;s needs. If only some people participate, and others are not 
represented in the process, in the end the water points might benefit only a certain part of 
the community. While participation is important as a preventive measure and as a way of 
ensuring sustainable change, it is also important as a human rights consideration. The 
criterion of participation addresses these factors.  
</p>
<p>48. Participation is a central requirement in the human rights framework and indivisible 
from the realization of all other human rights. Ensuring meaningful participation requires, 
in particular, full respect for the freedoms of expression, assembly and association, and for 
the right to information. The right to participate is most clearly reflected in article 25 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which provides for the right to 
participate in public affairs. In its general comment No. 25 (1996) on the right to participate 
in public affairs, voting rights and the right of equal access to public service, the Human 
Rights Committee interprets article 25, explaining that citizens may participate directly, or 
indirectly through freely chosen representatives, in the conduct of public affairs, which is 
considered to cover &#8220;all aspects of public administration, and the formulation and 
implementation of policy at international, national, regional and local levels&#8221; (para. 5). The 
significance of participation from a human rights perspective has been repeatedly 
reinforced through other conventions and treaties detailing the rights of particular people.21 
The Declaration on the Right to Development (1986) calls on States to &#8220;encourage popular 
participation in all spheres as an important factor in development and in the full realization 
of all human rights&#8221;<i>.</i>22 
</p>
<p>49. Participation must be active, free and meaningful23 and thus needs to go beyond 
mere consultation and provision of information. It requires a genuine opportunity to express 
demands and concerns and influence decisions. It is also crucial for all concerned 
individuals, groups and communities to be able to take part or be represented in 
participatory processes. In particular, the inclusion of women must be ensured. Failing to 
do so may undermine a project. For example, one project to bring water points closer to a 
village included consultation with the village council, and on that basis, water points were 
established close to most of the homes. However, it was later realized that the women 
continued to go the further distance to the river, instead of using the new water points. After 
investigation, it was revealed that there were no women on the village council, and that 
their input would have been crucial because they were the ones who collected the water. 
The women subsequently indicated that they would have preferred the water points to be 
located closer to their homes than the old water point, but further away than the new ones, 
in order for them to preserve the social dimension of collecting water together, while 
preserving their privacy away from men. 
</p>
<p>50. In order to ensure effective and meaningful participation, transparency and access to 
information are crucial elements. To reach people and actually provide accessible

<p>information, multiple channels of information have to be used, as must communication in 
local languages. Moreover, capacity development and training may be required, because 
only when people understand existing legislation and policies can they judge whether their 
rights are adequately protected. 
</p>
<p>51. The independent expert has witnessed numerous interventions at the country level 
which place a heavy emphasis on participation, and these are having an extraordinary 
impact on improving peoples&#8217; access to water and sanitation. Participatory programming 
already features prominently in many development interventions, not least because of the 
important effect of participation on their impact and sustainability.24 Practices which meet 
the participation criterion might be related to mobilizing the community to offer input on 
proposed interventions, providing for participatory processes in policies related to 
sanitation and water, involving community members in monitoring access to drinking water 
and sanitation, and many other intiatives.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>52. In some instances, interventions in the water and sanitation sectors are perceived as 
charity. People are offered services as passive beneficiaries who hope to gain access but do 
not have a sense of entitlement. Often, roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined and 
people do not know where they should turn when access to water and sanitation is non-
existent or inadequate. Without accountability, human rights guarantees may not be realized 
since obligations cannot be enforced. Accountability is a defining attribute of human rights 
law and thus a fundamental element for identifying good practices from a human rights 
perspective. Clear lines of accountability assist responsible parties to know their 
obligations, and help individuals to claim their rights.  
</p>
<p>53. Judicial mechanisms of accountability, such as courts and tribunals, are an 
indispensable part of accountability. Article 14, paragraph 1, of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights guarantees that &#8220;all persons shall be equal before the courts 
and tribunals,&#8221; which has been interpreted as including a right of equal access to the 
courts.25 To make this guarantee effective, States are required to establish an independent 
and impartial court system that is endowed with an adequate institutional structure and 
financing to enable it to carry out fair proceedings.26 Furthermore, mechanisms must have 
the competence to respond to the human rights violation in question and to enforce 
judgements. 
</p>
<p>54. States should put into place accountability mechanisms that are accessible, 
affordable, timely and effective.27 Access to justice must be ensured in practical terms, 
meaning that people must have physical access and economic access, including through 
legal aid schemes, and information must be available in local languages. The State should 
ensure that victims of violations are entitled to adequate reparation, including restitution, 
compensation, satisfaction and/or guarantees of non-repetition.28

</p>
<p>55. Although not all human rights concerns necessitate immediate resort to the courts, 
effective, affordable and timely access to an independent and functioning judicial system is 
crucial in case other forms of accountability fail to respond effectively to the violations in 
question.29 Rights cannot be made fully effective without some role being provided for the 
judiciary. 
</p>
<p>56. In addition to the judicial system, many other types of accountability mechanisms 
exist at State and non-State levels. While the State bears the primary obligations to ensure 
enjoyment of human rights, other actors such as donors, intergovernmental organizations, 
water service providers, private actors and civil society organizations also have 
responsibilities regarding the rights to water and sanitation, which must also be 
accompanied by accountability mechanisms. State-based and non-State-based mechanisms 
can perform a variety of functions, including monitoring; receiving and responding to 
complaints; and providing remedies and/or redress where human rights violations have 
occurred.  
</p>
<p>57. Quasi-judicial mechanisms, such as national human rights institutions and 
international human rights treaty bodies, can play an important role in ensuring 
accountability by monitoring the observance of rights and reporting violations, as well as 
by receiving individual complaints. Since water and sanitation are frequently the 
responsibility of local governments or of specific ministries within the Government, 
administrative mechanisms must be established at those levels. These can be established 
within regulatory bodies. Such mechanisms should be able to receive and respond to 
complaints from water and sanitation users and to carry out human rights impact 
assessments.  
</p>
<p>58. Water and sanitation service providers should also establish grievance mechanisms 
at the level of the operator so as to respond to the complaints and concerns of users. 
Informal justice systems, such as traditional or indigenous systems of justice, may also be 
relevant in the context of water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>59. Accountability mechanisms at the political level can be established through 
parliamentary review committees or similar structures.30 Furthermore, accountability can be 
achieved through social mobilization, media reporting, campaigning and lobbying, and 
social activism. The proper functioning of these mechanisms is dependent upon the 
enjoyment of the rights to freedom of expression, of the press, of assembly, of association, 
and of access to information, as well as the rights to participate in public affairs and vote, 
among others. Accountability will usually depend on the availability of a variety of 
different mechanisms, which can be used in parallel or subsequent to each other.  
</p>
<p>60. Good practices in the area of accountability may take different forms. They might 
ensure that easily accessible mechanisms are available to users, located for instance at the 
level of the service provider, to respond to user complaints. They could also include 
instruments that clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of the different actors involved 
and that are easily available and transparent to users. They would also ensure coordination 
between the different entities involved. Interventions aimed at institutional strengthening 
and fighting corruption would also link to criterion of accountability. 
</p>
<p>61. At the judicial level, public interest litigation or representation by civil society 
organizations on behalf of victims can also facilitate accountability. Community-based 
monitoring systems may fit this criterion. Conducting human rights impact assessments as

<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>part of administrative mechanisms for accountability may also be important positive 
practices to highlight. Active and engaged national human rights institutions which monitor 
the realization of the rights to water and sanitation, and respond to complaints, may also 
represent good practices in terms of accountability. Where bilateral donors, international 
organizations or NGOs are involved, their good practices could include the establishment of 
feedback mechanisms and the inclusion of the communities in monitoring and evaluating 
activities. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Impact 
</b></p>
<p>62. Guaranteeing human rights requires more than mere rhetoric. These rights must be 
operationalized, and as such, good practices from a human rights perspective should 
positively contribute to the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation. This 
criterion is essential for assuring meaningful interventions which can effect an 
improvement in peoples&#8217; lives.  
</p>
<p>63. In the water and sanitation sectors, as in other areas of development, well-meaning 
but ineffective interventions sometimes occur. For instance, where latrines are provided to 
communities without essential awareness-raising activities aimed at ensuring that people 
understand the importance of using safe sanitation, the intervention will inevitably fail since 
the community members will see no reason for changing their entrenched habits of open 
defecation. The participation of concerned communities is important for ensuring impact, as 
is learning lessons from past experiences. Accountability also must be factored into the 
impact criterion, since accountability mechanisms are important means for feedback on 
practices which require improvements.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>64. Sustainability is particularly relevant to issues concerning water and sanitation, as it 
relates to the longer term positive and negative impacts of a particular practice. Water 
networks or other sources of water delivery may be built, but in the absence of 
corresponding capacity-building to maintain such infrastructure, the ongoing needs of the 
community in question will not be met. The costs of maintaining water and sanitation 
facilities are a frequent cause of discontinued use - for example, communities may be 
unable to pay for repairs to the system or to empty septic tanks. Over-reliance on 
groundwater can result in the depletion of groundwater levels, which has serious 
implications for the wider environment. The criterion of sustainability ensures that these 
considerations are taken into account.  
</p>
<p>65. Sustainable development has been defined as &#8220;meeting the needs of the present 
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#8221;.31 The 
Economic Commission for Europe Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary 
Watercourses and International Lakes (1992) provides that &#8220;water resources shall be 
managed so that the needs of the present generation are met without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs&#8221; (art. 2, para. 5(c)). The Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also affirms that realization of the right to water 
requires &#8220;ensur[ing] that there is sufficient and safe water for present and future 
generations&#8221;32 and this similarly applies to sanitation. Unsustainable interventions may

</p>
<p>eventually result in unjustifiable retrogression in the progressive realization of the rights, 
amounting to violations of these rights.33 Sustainability also implies that the practice in 
question does not negatively impact on other human rights.  
</p>
<p>66. The economic, social and environmental aspects of sustainable development must be 
taken into consideration in this regard.34 Environmental sustainability35 means that water 
quality and availability have to be ensured in a way that respects and supports the larger 
environment. Water contamination and over-extraction must be avoided in order to ensure 
continued access to safe and sufficient water. In this regard, good practices would, for 
instance, aim to map existing groundwater availability and current use patterns and avoid 
over-abstraction of groundwater by industrial or agricultural users so as to ensure that 
sufficient water resources are available for personal and domestic uses. Moreover, 
considering the impacts of climate change and changing water availability and variability, 
adaptive capacity is important. Similarly, good practices in the area of sanitation should 
contribute to environmental sanitation, for example by ensuring that human excreta do not 
leak into groundwater. 
</p>
<p>67. Economic sustainability requires, inter alia, that, in addition to the initial investment, 
the costs of ongoing operation, management and investment must be taken into 
consideration from the planning phase onwards in order to ensure the continued functioning 
of the system. One source of income in this regard is user fees. However, achieving 
economic sustainability must take into account the equity aspects of ensuring that the 
poorest segments of the population may still afford these services. The availability of 
skilled labour and affordable spare parts for operation and maintenance are equally 
important. In that context, good practices could include building the capacity of the local 
community, or of the local private sector, to maintain facilities after a project initiated by 
development agencies or civil society organizations is terminated.36 They could also include 
tariff structures which ensure that those who can afford it contribute to the sustainability of 
the system, and that those who cannot afford it receive assistance from the State.  
</p>
<p>68. Last, but not least, social sustainability37 touches on issues of social equity and 
acceptance. Participatory processes will greatly contribute to sustainability in this regard.38

<p>Participation by all concerned individuals, communities and groups is crucial to 
guaranteeing that interventions enhance community ownership and thus contribute to 
achieving sustainability. Good practices could include participatory processes from the 
outset, and use the input from these in the design of interventions to ensure that they will 
endure.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Relevant actors 
</b></p>
<p>69. A great number of actors are relevant to the realization of the rights to safe drinking 
water and sanitation for all and thus for identifying good practices in that context. While 
not attempting to present an exhaustive list, this section aims to illustrate some of the ways 
that different actors may be engaged in good practices. These different actors include, but 
are not limited to, States (including local governments), regulators, public and private water 
and sanitation providers, civil society organizations, development cooperation agencies, 
intergovernmental organizations, and education, training and research institutions, as well 
as individuals and communities. Furthermore, realizing the rights to water and sanitation 
requires a wide number of different practices, and goes beyond service provision to include 
other types of interventions, such as legislation, policy formulation, institution building, 
awareness-raising, training, advocacy and litigation.  
</p>
<p><b> A. States 
</b></p>
<p>70. The State is ultimately responsible and accountable for ensuring that everyone&#8217;s 
human rights are realized. While the State may choose to provide water and sanitation 
services directly, it is not obliged to do so, but it must create an enabling environment for 
the enjoyment of these rights, including the necessary legislative and policy measures to 
govern these sectors. Many States have good practices to share in terms of realizing the 
rights to water and sanitation. These practices can range from direct service provision, 
establishing a regulatory framework and ensuring the existence of responsive accountability 
mechanisms, to engaging in awareness-raising activities and putting social policies in place 
to protect people living in poverty. States which have adopted national action plans for the 
realization of the rights to water and sanitation, with benchmarking and monitoring 
processes built in, are particularly well placed to share experiences, as these plans form the 
backbone for the progressive realization of these rights.  
</p>
<p>71. Frequently, responsibility for water and sanitation services lies at the local or 
municipal level. As part of the State, entities at this level have human rights obligations to 
ensure enjoyment of the rights to sanitation and water for all within their jurisdiction. At the 
local level, tailored solutions can often be devised to respond to the specific needs of the 
communities in question. For instance, local and municipal authorities can, inter alia, take 
specific measures to extend access to excluded communities, to ensure participation of 
marginalized groups, to raise awareness of the public health, environmental and other 
aspects related to water and sanitation, and to establish local-level accountability 
mechanisms to respond to potential problems and resolve disputes efficiently. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Regulatory bodies 
</b></p>
<p>72. A regulatory framework has been defined as &#8220;the promulgation of an authoritative 
set of rules, accompanied by some mechanism, typically a public agency, for monitoring </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/15/31/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>and promoting compliance with these rules&#8221;.39 In the water and sanitation sectors, this 
usually covers the areas of water quality, pricing, and service standards. Regulators can 
make important contributions to the human rights to sanitation and water, for instance, 
through setting and monitoring water quality standards. They also play an important role 
with regard to tariffs, aiming to achieve a delicate balance between affordability and 
economic sustainability. Furthermore, regulators can monitor performance standards to 
ensure that human rights criteria are met, for instance, in policy objectives and business 
procedures. Monitoring can extend to informal service providers who often supply water to 
the poorest sections of the population. Creating rules regarding new connections in 
formerly unserved and underserved areas and setting standards for interruptions of supply 
and disconnections, in line with human rights considerations, can also be important 
contributions. Non-networked water supplies such as wells, standpipes, kiosks, tanker 
trucks and bottled water are also appropriate topics for regulators to address. These 
institutions also may receive complaints directly from water and sanitation users. Moreover, 
they can provide advice and facilitate discussions related to decisions on the model of 
service delivery opted for by the State to assure respect for human rights in that process.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Service providers 
</b></p>
<p>73. Water and sanitation service providers are also well placed to share good practices in 
realizing the rights to water and sanitation. These service providers can play an important 
role in many respects, including in extending the water and sanitation networks to unserved 
or underserved areas, providing services, including delivery of water by tanker trucks, at 
affordable prices to communities that are not connected to the network, and by developing 
low-cost technologies for ensuring that more people fully enjoy these rights. They can also 
promote public discussion on how the enjoyment of the rights to sanitation and water can 
be improved. Since they possess specific expertise in the areas of water and sanitation, they 
can be crucial partners for Government as it devises strategies for the progressive 
realization of the rights to sanitation and water. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Private sector 
</b></p>
<p>74. Beyond their role in service provision, private actors are active in many areas related 
to the rights to water and to sanitation. The private sector includes companies and business, 
and they can contribute by including the respect and realization of the rights to water and 
sanitation in their core business operations and decision-making processes. For instance, 
they can guarantee consultation with, and accountability to, local communities so as to 
ensure that the company&#8217;s water use does not jeopardize the safe water available to the 
community. Moreover, corporate social responsibility initiatives, when undertaken in 
compliance with human rights standards, can be useful interventions to help in the 
realization of human rights, for instance, projects which aim to make essential products 
available at reduced prices to populations in need.

<p><b> E. Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>75. Civil society is a diverse category including local community organizations, faith-
based groups, NGOs focused on water and sanitation in the context of development, NGOs 
focused on human rights, including the rights to water and sanitation, NGOs focused on the 
environment, and lobby groups, among others. The areas of intervention and the 
contributions of these organizations can vary widely. They may operate as service 
providers, monitor service provision, or engage in training or capacity-building on technical 
issues (how to build water and sanitation facilities) or policy issues (such as how to lobby 
Government representatives on these issues). They may engage in campaigning and act as 
pressure groups to effect change at the local, national and international levels. They may 
also conduct research on a wide variety of topics related to the human rights to water and 
sanitation, which can inform future action in these sectors.40  
</p>
<p><b> F. National human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>76. A national human rights institution (NHRI) is a &#8220;body which is established by a 
Government under the constitution, or by law or decree, the functions of which are 
specifically defined in terms of the promotion and protection of human rights&#8221;41 In the 
fields of water and sanitation, NHRIs can play a role in reviewing government action, such 
as legislation, policies and programmes, to ensure that it is consistent with human rights. 
Furthermore, they can monitor compliance with relevant laws, policies and programmes. 
They can also investigate complaints by users and provide adequate redress.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Development agencies 
</b></p>
<p>77. Development agencies, which implement a donor country&#8217;s bilateral development 
cooperation and assistance, also have a positive contribution to make. Development 
agencies are frequently part of the Government structure. As States which have undertaken 
specific human rights commitments, donor countries are equally obliged to respect, protect 
and promote human rights in their activities, including through their official development 
assistance.42 Furthermore, agencies which explicitly adopt a human rights-based approach 
to their water and sanitation interventions may have particular experience to share.  
</p>
<p>78. Development agencies can promote the rights to sanitation and water in numerous 
ways: for example, financial assistance can help build sanitation and water infrastructures, 
while technical assistance can support the receiving country in institution-building, transfer 
of technology, and know-how for sustainable operation and maintenance of the 
infrastructure. These agencies can promote participatory processes in their projects. They 
can also offer valuable advice in establishing regulatory frameworks and accountability 
mechanisms in line with human rights norms. Furthermore, they can build the capacity of 
civil society to monitor compliance with human rights, including the rights to water and to 
sanitation.

<p><b> H. Intergovernmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>79. Intergovernmental organizations include international organizations such as the 
United Nations, its specialized agencies, funds and programmes, and the World Bank and 
International Monetary Fund, as well as regional organizations such as the regional 
development banks. Organizations of the United Nations are obliged to promote and 
encourage respect for human rights, as provided for in the Charter of the United Nations; 
more broadly, since intergovernmental organizations are composed of States, it can also be 
argued that these acquire the human rights obligations to which States have committed.43  
</p>
<p>80. Many intergovernmental organizations are active in the fields of water and 
sanitation, and have an important contribution to make in promoting the recognition and 
realization of the human rights to water and sanitation, within their organizations and in 
collaboration with their external partners. For example, they can support the capacities of 
national water and sanitation institutions through technical cooperation, they can carry out 
and disseminate research on water and sanitation technologies and they can advocate for 
improved water and sanitation policies on the national level. They can also identify 
marginalized and excluded groups and work with the Government to ensure that these are 
not left behind in extending access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Intergovernmental 
organizations are also engaged in important standard-setting and monitoring activities. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Education, training and research institutions 
</b></p>
<p>81. Education, training and research institutions such as schools, universities and 
institutes can play important roles in order to realize the human rights to water and 
sanitation. For schools, this includes teaching young people about fundamental issues such 
as their human rights, the links between sanitation and water contamination, and 
understanding that water is a precious resource. Training institutes can equip people with 
the skills needed for working in the sector, for instance with technical or managerial 
competences. Research institutions also play important roles in finding locally adapted 
solutions to the challenges in accessing water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Individuals and communities 
</b></p>
<p>82. Individuals and communities frequently know their own needs and priorities best; 
with knowledge of their rights, they can play an enhanced role in improving their access to 
water and sanitation. They can also monitor service provision, propose appropriate policies 
to government, and advocate for their implementation. Furthermore, encouraging the 
responsible use of water and sanitation facilities and spreading knowledge of good hygiene 
practices, as well as assisting vulnerable and marginalized individuals and households 
within the community can be ways for communities and individuals to promote the human 
rights to water and sanitation.44

<p><b> V. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> The present report has laid out the framework which the independent expert 
will use to assess good practices from a human rights perspective. While good 
practices should not undermine any of the 10 criteria identified, practices may focus 
on particular aspects of realizing the rights to water and to sanitation. On the basis of 
the report, the independent expert wishes to proceed with the collection of good 
practices and submit the requested compendium of good practices to the Human 
Rights Council in 2011  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> To ensure the inclusion of as many good practices as possible which conform to 
this framework, the independent expert recommends that all stakeholders, including 
those actors identified in this report, submit their good practices to the independent 
expert for consideration.
