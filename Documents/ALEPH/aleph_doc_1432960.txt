Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
September 30, 2009 
(Expressed in US dollars) 
(Unaudited) 
 
1.
2.
Nature of Operations 
 
Uranerz Energy Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. on May 26, 1999. Effective July 5, 2005, the Company
changed its name from Carleton Ventures Corp. to Uranerz Energy Corporation. The Company has mineral property interests in Canada and the United
States.
The  Company  is  an  Exploration  Stage  Company,  as  defined  by  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  Accounting  Standards Codification 
(“ASC”) 915, Development Stage Entities. The Company’s principal business is the acquisition and exploitation of uranium and mineral resources.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
  
a)
Basis of Presentation
b)
c)
d)
The interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United  States  for interim financial  information and with the instructions  for Securities  and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Form  10-Q. In the 
opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all 
adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position as of September 30, 2009, and the 
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim 
financial statements related to these periods are unaudited. The results for the nine month period ended September 30, 2009 are not necessarily 
indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter of the entire year ending December 31, 2009. The interim unaudited consolidated 
financial statements have been condensed pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations and do not include all of the 
information  and  footnotes  required  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  for  complete  financial  statements.  Therefore,  these  financial
statements  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  Company’s  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  for  the  year  ended
December 31, 2008, included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 12, 2009 with the SEC.  
  
Cash and Cash Equivalents  
  
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents. 
  
Marketable Securities  
  
The  Company  defines  marketable  securities  as  income  yielding  securities  that  can  be  readily  converted  into  cash.  Examples  of marketable 
securities include U.S. Treasury and agency obligations, commercial paper, corporate notes and bonds, time deposits, foreign notes and certificates 
of  deposit.  The  Company  accounts  for  its  investment  in  debt  and  equity  instruments  under  FASB  ASC  320,  Investments  –  Debt  and  Equity
Securities.  We  follow  the  guidance  provided  by  ASC  320  to  assess  whether  our  investments  with  unrealized  loss  positions  are  other than 
temporarily impaired. Realized gains and losses and  declines  in value judged to  be  other than temporary  are  determined based on the specific
identification method and are reported in other income (expense). Management determines the appropriate classification of such securities at the 
time of purchase and re-evaluates such classification as of each balance sheet date. At September 30, 2009, the Company’s marketable securities
consisted of term deposits for periods longer than three months and are classified as held-to-maturity. 
  
Mineral Property Costs  
  
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. Mineral property acquisition costs are 
capitalized when management has determined that probable future benefits consisting of a contribution to future cash inflows have been identified 
and adequate financial resources are available or are expected to be available as required to meet the terms of property acquisition and budgeted 
exploration and development expenditures. Mineral property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred if the criteria for capitalization are not met. 
In the event that a mineral property is acquired through the issuance of the Company’s shares, the mineral property will be recorded at the fair
value of the respective property or the fair value of common shares, whichever is more readily determinable.
When mineral properties are acquired under option agreements with future acquisition payments to be made at the sole discretion of the Company, 
those future payments, whether in cash or shares, are recorded only when the Company has made or is obliged to make the payment or issue the 
shares.  When  it  has  been  determined  that  a  mineral  property  can  be  economically  developed  as  a  result  of  establishing proven  and  probable 
reserves and bankable feasibility, the costs incurred to develop such property are capitalized.

Income Taxes 
 
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 
740, Income Taxes as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried 
forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these consolidated financial statements because the Company 
cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years. 
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
Our  financial  instruments  consist  principally  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  and  short-term  marketable  securities,  accounts  payable and  loans 
payable. Marketable securities consist of time deposits longer than three months and are classified as held to maturity securities. Pursuant to ASC 
820,  Fair  Value  Measurements  and  Disclosures  and  ASC  825,  Financial  Instruments  the  fair  value  of  our  cash  equivalents  and  marketable 
securities  is  determined  based  on  “Level  1”  inputs,  which  consist  of  quoted  prices  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets.  We  believe  that  the 
recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short 
maturity dates or durations.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as the single source of
authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in 
conformity with U.S. GAAP, aside from those issued by the SEC. ASC 105 does not change current U.S. GAAP, but is intended to simplify user 
access to all authoritative U.S. GAAP by providing all authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place. The adoption of ASC 105 
did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, but did eliminate all references to pre-codification standards
 
In May 2009, FASB issued ASC 855-10, Subsequent Events – Overall, which establishes general standards of for the evaluation, recognition and
disclosure of events and transactions that occur after the balance sheet date. Although there is new terminology, the standard is based on the same 
principles as those that currently exist in the auditing standards. The standard, which includes a new required disclosure of the date through which 
an entity has evaluated subsequent events, is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of ASC 855-10 did 
not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 5.
 
The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not 
believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or 
results of operations. 
 
Reclassifications 
 
Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior period’s financial statements to conform to the current period’s presentation including the 
reclassification of non-controlling interest upon the adoption of ASC 810, Consolidation.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
 
At  September  30,  2009  the  Company  had  $15,722,477  in  cash,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities.  Our  marketable securities  consist  of 
$13,978,466  of  bank  guaranteed  deposits  with  terms  longer  than  three  months.  Pursuant  to  ASC  820  the  fair  value  of  all  of  our cash  equivalents  and 
marketable securities is determined based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company places 
cash investments in instruments that meet credit quality standards, as specified in our investment policy guidelines.

General
Uranerz Energy Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 26, 1999. On July 5, 2005, we changed our name from Carleton 
Ventures Corp. to Uranerz Energy Corporation. Our executive offices are located at 1701 East “E” Street, PO Box 50850, Casper, Wyoming 82605-0850, USA and 
our phone number there is 307-265-8900.
Our principal business office and our operations office is located at 1701 East “E” Street, PO Box 50850, Casper, Wyoming 82605-0850 and our phone number 
there is 307-265-8900. We also maintain an administrative office located at Suite 1410 — 800 West Pender Street, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 
2V6, and our telephone number there is 604-689-1659.
We  are  an  exploration  stage  company  engaged  in  the  acquisition  and  exploration  of  uranium  properties.  “Uranium”  used  in  this  context  refers  to  U3O8. 
“U3O8”, also called yellowcake, is triuranium octoxide produced from uranium ore and is the most actively traded uranium-related commodity.
We  are  principally  focused  on  the  exploration  of  our  properties  in  the  Powder  River  Basin  area  of  Wyoming.  We  are  exploring  these  properties  with  the 
objective of assessing their viability for commercial in-situ recovery (which we refer to as “ISR”) uranium mining projects. ISR is a low cost mining process that 
uses a “leaching solution” to extract uranium from underground ore bodies. We also own interests in properties in the Great Divide Basin area of Wyoming, in 
Texas and in Saskatchewan, Canada.
We have applied for mine operating permits on two of our properties in the Powder River Basin area of Wyoming that we feel have the potential, based on data 
in our possession, of being developed into commercial in-situ recovery uranium mines. These permits, if received, should allow us to produce uranium yellowcake 
concentrate, which can be sold directly to utilities for fuel used in nuclear electrical generating facilities.
Our Powder River Basin properties include:
(cid:122) our 100% owned properties that totaled 30,945 acres as of September 30, 2009; and  
(cid:122) our 81% interest Arkose Mining Venture properties that totaled 88,128 acres as of September 30, 2009.
Our 100% owned properties are comprised of unpatented mineral lode claims, state leases and fee (private) mineral leases, summarized as follows:

Through a combination of claim staking, purchasing, and leasing we have also acquired interests in several projects that lie within the Powder River Basin but 
outside of the project areas discussed above. These properties include the Verna Ann, Niles Ranch, North Reno Creek, and South Reno Creek projects. These 
projects are located in sandstone basins of Tertiary age with known uranium mineralization. However, due to our focus on other projects, we have not yet initiated 
exploration work on these projects.
Our plan of operations is to continue exploration of our Wyoming Powder River Basin properties. Our Saskatchewan, Wyoming Great Divide Basin and Texas 
properties are under strategic review. The information regarding the location and access for our Saskatchewan and Wyoming properties, together with the history of 
operations, present condition and geology of each of our properties, is presented in Item 2 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 
2008 under the heading “Description of Properties”, previously filed with the SEC on March 12, 2009.
We have applied for mine operating permits on two of our properties in the Powder River Basin area of Wyoming that we feel have the potential, based on data 
in our possession, of being developed into commercial in-situ recovery uranium mines. We plan to use the low cost mining process of ISR. The ‘leaching’ agent, 
which contains an oxidant such as oxygen with sodium bicarbonate (commonly known as baking soda), is added to the native groundwater and injected through 
wells into the ore body in a sandstone aquifer to dissolve the uranium. This solution is then pumped via other wells to the surface for processing into finished 
yellowcake product ready for sale to utilities requiring nuclear fuel for operations — resulting in a cost-efficient and, relative to other common mining methods, a 
more environmentally-friendly mining process.
The ISR mining process differs dramatically from conventional mining techniques in that ISR mining leaves the rock matrix in place. The ISR technique avoids 
the movement and milling of rock and ore as well as mill tailing waste associated with more traditional mining methods.
Applications for a Permit to Mine and a Source Material License for the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project were submitted to the Wyoming Department of 
Environmental Quality — Land Quality Division (which we refer to as “WDEQ”) and the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (which we refer to as 
“NRC”) in December of 2007. Both the NRC and WDEQ applications were deemed complete for further technical and environmental review in April 2008 and 
August 2008, respectively. In the fall of 2008, we received Requests for Additional Information (which we refer to as “RAI”) for the technical review from the 
NRC. We submitted the response to this RAI, consisting of answers with supporting data, to the NRC during March 2009. This return of information and data will 
allow the NRC to progress with the review, which should ultimately lead to the issuance of the required Source Materials License that allows us to receive, possess, 
use, transfer, and deliver radioactive materials. We also received RAIs from the NRC for the environmental portion of the application review on March 12, 2009.
We submitted responses to the environmental RAIs in May 2009. The WDEQ is currently conducting their detailed review of the Permit to Mine application, and 
both the NRC and WDEQ applications are progressing through the regulatory review process. Approval of the permit applications should allow us to proceed with 
development of the commercial mining facilities and related infrastructure.
The mine plan for the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project includes a central processing facility at our Nichols Ranch property and a satellite ion exchange 
uranium concentrating facility at our Hank property. The ultimate production level from these two properties is planned to be in the range of 600,000 to 800,000 
pounds per year (as U3 08 ). The central processing facility is planned for a licensed capacity of two million pounds per year of uranium (as U3 08) and it is
intended that it will process uranium-bearing well-field solutions from Nichols Ranch, as well as uranium-loaded resin transported from the Hank satellite facility, 
plus uranium-loaded resin from any additional satellite deposits that may be developed on our other Powder River Basin properties. We believe this centralized 
design enhances the economics of our potential additional satellite projects by maximizing production capacity while minimizing further capital expenditures on 
processing facilities. The project is progressing through detailed engineering and design.
In anticipation of receiving all the approvals necessary to begin construction in 2010, we have commenced a marketing program for conditional sales of uranium 
from our Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project. On July 23, 2009, we announced that we
entered into a sales agreement with Exelon Generation Company, LLC for the sale of uranium over a five year period for defined pricing. On August 17, 2009 we 
announced the second contract for the sale of uranium to a U.S. utility over five years, with a pricing structure that contains references to both spot and long-term 
prices and includes a floor and ceiling price.
During  the  winter  of  2008/09,  leach  amenability  studies  were  performed  on  sample  cores  obtained  from  the Doughstick  and  South  Doughstick  properties. 
Standard  ISR  leach  “bottle  roll”  tests  were  conducted  on  the  samples  by  Energy  Laboratories  in  Casper,  Wyoming.  The  leach  amenability  studies  intend  to
demonstrate  that  the  uranium  mineralization  is  capable  of  being  leached  using  conventional  ISR  chemistry.  The leach  solution  was  prepared  using  sodium 
bicarbonate as the source of the carbonate complexing agent. Hydrogen peroxide was added as the uranium oxidizing agent. The study is an indication of the ore’s 
reaction  rate  and  the  potential  uranium  recovery.  The  test  results  showed  the  uranium  recovery  percentage  for South  Doughstick  as  87.8%,  and  the  uranium 
recovery percentage for Doughstick as 77.1% . The 88% and 77% results are greater than the 73% that Uranerz used in its Preliminary (Economic) Assessment of
the Nichols Ranch Uranium ISR Project. Doughstick and South Doughstick properties are located approximately two miles south of Nichols Ranch.
Between  July  4,  2009  and  September  30,  2009,  on  the  Arkose  Mining  Venture  property  ("Arkose"),  a  joint  venture  between  the  Company  (81%) and  United 
Nuclear, LLC (19%), a total of 289 uranium trend and delineation holes were drilled utilizing up to three drill rigs and two electric log probing units. Drilling on the 
Arkose property was conducted at North Jane, Little Butte, Beecher Draw, Lone Bull and the South Doughstick extension.
At the North Jane property, located southeast of the Uranerz Doughstick area, 20 additional holes were drilled with excellent results in the 100 Sand. The North 
Jane  area is part  of Arkose  and is  adjacent to the trend located at the  Company's 100%-owned Doughstick property.  A combined National Instrument  43-101 
technical report is currently in progress for both the Uranerz Doughstick and North Jane properties.
At Little Butte and Beecher Draw (northwest targets), 185 exploration holes were drilled but only minor mineralization was found in the 90 sand at these locations. 
Drilling was also conducted in an area identified as Lone Bull which is located 5 miles southwest of South Doughstick. Wide space drilling at this location has 
found a trend in the 100 sand with uranium mineralization present. Additional drilling at Lone Bull is planned in this area before the end of the 2009 drilling 
season.
Drilling was also conducted along the South Doughstick extension located one mile south of the primary South Doughstick trend. A total of 61 holes were drilled 
with good results along 5,000 feet of mineralized trend. A National Instrument 43-101 technical report was prepared for the South Doughstick property dated 
August 11, 2009 which was amended and restated on October 13, 2009 (please see below under “Recent Developments”).
The combined effort for drilling on the Arkose properties from July 4 through September 30 represents approximately 206,655 feet of drilling with an average 
depth of 715 feet per hole.
The objective of the 2009 Arkose drilling project is to find previously unknown or little known uranium mineralization trends and to delineate known trends, thus 
providing data for permitting and eventual production operations in favorably identified areas. During this update period, uranium mineralization found ranged 
from <0.01% eU3O8 to 1.18% eU3O8. A cut-off grade of 0.03% eU3O8 was established for Arkose projects. Approximately 29.4 % of the 289 holes drilled during
this period met or exceeded the minimum cutoff grade. Some of the delineation drilling was conducted in rows or fences of drill holes, with each end of the fence
being drilled until barren sand was found. This drilling technique typically results in two or more barren holes per fence.
Recent Developments
During August 2009, we decided to forfeit our interests in certain mining claims which we determined, based on the review, analysis and recommendations of 
our  geological  staff,  did  not  merit  further  exploration  and  accordingly  were  no  longer  of  strategic  interest  or value  to  the  Company.  The  claims,  which  were 
forfeited, effective September 1, 2009, when the annual renewal fee would have become due, were comprised of: 285 claims in which we had held a 100% interest 
in the Streeter, Collins Draw, East Nichols, North Nichols, Eagle and Cyclone Rim project areas and 132 claims in the Little Butte and South Collins project areas, 
in which we held an 81% interest through the Arkose Mining Venture.
On  October  13,  2009,  we  filed  an  amended  and  restated  technical  report  entitled  “Technical  Report,  South Doughstick  Property,  Campbell  and  Johnson 
Counties,  Wyoming,  U.S.A.”  prepared  by  Douglass  H.  Graves,  PE  of  TREC,  Inc.  and  dated  October  12,  2009.  The  technical  report  was  amended  after  we 
discovered that the Arkose Mining Venture does not control 100 percent of the fee mineral interests on the west one half of Section 29 in the South Doughstick 
project area. We recently discovered that the Arkose Mining Venture’s interest is subject to a 50 percent interest for the minerals on the west one half of Section 29. 
This has resulted in 50% decrease in the mineralized material for that section (a decrease of approximately 18% of the mineralized material for the total South 
Doughstick project) as reported in the previous technical report, dated August 11, 2009.
On October 23, 2009, we received notification that the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (which we refer to as the “WDEQ”) – Air Quality 
Division has approved and issued the air quality permit for our Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project. The
WDEQ – Air Quality Division has issued Permit No. CT-8644 in the form of a Permit to Construct the Nichols Ranch Uranium ISR Project which includes the 
Nichols Ranch Central Processing facility and the Hank Satellite plant. This is the first operational permit for the construction of the Nichols Ranch Uranium ISR 
Project to be issued to us by the State of Wyoming. Receipt of the air quality permit demonstrates progress in the environmental permitting process required for 
uranium production in Wyoming. The WDEQ Permit to Mine and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Source Material License must also be obtained prior to 
initiating construction activities on site.
Financial Position
The  Company’s  overall  financial  position  is  disclosed  in  the  Company’s  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2008  filed with  the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2009 and the unaudited Financial Statements at September 30,  2009 as  provided herein under the section
heading “Financial Statements” above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are carrying out an exploration, environmental and mine design program with a budget of approximately $5,900,000 in 2009. This plan, plus general and 
administrative  expenses  of  approximately  $3,600,000  amounts  to  cash  requirements  of  approximately  $9,500,000  for  the  year  ending  December  31, 2009  as 
reported in Item 2 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 under the heading “Description of Properties”, previously filed with 
the SEC on March 12, 2009. Mineral property acquisitions, dependent upon opportunities that may arise, and equipment acquisitions of approximately $1,500,000 
are expected to be additional expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, mineral property expenditures incurred were $3,498,878, including 
minor acquisitions.
At September 30, 2009, we had cash and short term securities of $15,722,477 and working capital of $15,983,711, as compared to the ending near cash balance of 
$21,253,277  and  working  capital  of  $21,405,022  as  at  December  31,  2008.  Our  working  capital  at  September  30,  2009  includes  $13,978,466  of short  term 
marketable securities compared to $20,432,035 as at December 31, 2008, which are equivalent to cash for operational purposes.
Net cash used in operating activities was $5,598,119 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, compared to $9,097,266 for the corresponding period in 2008. 
The decrease in net cash used in operations of $3,499,147 resulted primarily from a decrease in mineral property cash expenditures of $3,487,645 from 2008 when 
substantial properties were acquired. Net cash from investing activities was $6,380,057 for the nine months ended September 30, 2009, compared to $24,301,124 
used in the corresponding period in 2008; the variance derived primarily from the investment in short term marketable securities.
Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  amounted  to  $140,831  for  the  nine  months  ended  September  30,  2009,  compared  to  $22,810,701  provided in  the 
corresponding period in 2008 when common shares were issued for proceeds of $24,221,275.
During the twelve-month period following the date of this quarterly report, we anticipate that we will not generate any revenue. We anticipate that any additional 
funding may be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock and the exercise of share purchase warrants. Our exploration plans will be 
continually evaluated and modified as exploration and environmental results become available. General and administrative expenses, planning and environmental 
expenses  are  incurred  throughout  the  year;  most  of  our  exploration  expenditures  are  incurred  during  the  nine-month  period  of  March through  November. 
Modifications to our plans will be based on many factors including results of exploration, assessment of data, weather conditions, exploration costs, the price of 
uranium and available capital. Further, the extent of exploration programs that we undertake will be dependent upon the amount of financing available to us. We
believe we have sufficient cash to continue our exploration and planning and to meet on-going operating expenses for the next twelve months, and beyond as we 
scale our operations to the resources we have available.
To date, our primary source of funds has been equity investments, and this trend is expected to continue together with production related financing when our mine 
development permitting is complete. On July 10, 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and a 
preliminary prospectus in Canada under which, when effective, we may issue up to $50 million in common stock, debt securities, warrants, subscription receipts or 
other such securities. On October 27, 2009 we issued 8,500,000 Units, comprised of one share of common stock and one-half of one share purchase warrant, for 
gross proceeds of $17,000,000.
Our current short term investments have not been devalued by the current stock market disruptions as these investments are primarily in low risk bearer deposit 
notes issued and guaranteed by Canadian Chartered banks. Rates of return, however, are at historic lows. At the end of the investment period of these securities we 
plan  on  reinvesting  the  securities  in  similar  short  term  instruments.  Management  and  the  board  of  directors  periodically  meet  to  review  the  status  of  these 
investments and determine investment strategies, taking into account current market conditions and the short and long term capital needs of the Company.
Results of Operations
Three-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to three-month period ended September 30, 2008
Revenue and Operating Expenses
We have not earned any revenues to date and we anticipate that we will not generate any revenues during the twelve-month period following the date of this 
quarterly report.
We  incurred  total  operating  expenses  of  approximately  $2,879,027  for  the  three-month  period  ended  September  30,  2009,  as  compared  to $2,721,321  for  the 
corresponding period in 2008. The increase of operating expenses in the amount of $157,706 was primarily attributable to a $201,736 increase in mineral property 
expenses.
We had no significant financing expense for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008. We earned $17,985 of interest income for the three-
month period ended September 30, 2009 as compared to $133,054 for the corresponding period in 2008. This income resulted from short term investments which 
are realizing low returns.
Net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2009 was approximately $2,861,042, as compared to approximately $2,588,267 for the corresponding 
period in 2008, primarily due to the reduction of interest income and an increase in mineral property expenditures.
Nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 compared to nine-month period ended September 30, 2008
We  incurred  total  operating  expenses  of  approximately  $7,136,450  for  the  nine-month  period  ended September  30,  2009,  as  compared  to $33,451,066  for  the 
corresponding period in 2008. The decrease of operating expenses in the amount of $26,314,616 was primarily attributable to a $22,577,645 decrease in mineral 
property expenditures and a $1,807,372 decrease in general and administrative expenses. Our $24,617,796 acquisition of NAMMCO properties is included in the 
mineral property expenditures for nine-month period ended September 30, 2008.
We had no significant financing expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2009 and 2008. We earned $131,979 of interest income for the nine 
month period ended September 30, 2009 as compared to $340,169 for the corresponding period in 2008. This income resulted from short term investments. A gain 
on disposal of discontinued operations in Mongolia of approximately $977,077 was realized during the nine month period ended September 30, 2008.
Net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 was approximately $6,423,504, as compared to approximately $32,133,820 for the corresponding 
period in 2008, a decrease of $25,710,316. The net loss was abnormally affected by the acquisition of properties in the 2008 period and results of operations can be 
more expected to reflect historical levels for the remainder of 2009, unless other significant acquisitions are identified and concluded.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in 
financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses,  results  of  operations,  liquidity,  capital  expenditures  or  capital  resources  that  are  material  to  stockholders  except  as 
disclosed  in  the  unaudited  Financial  Statements  at  September  30,  2009.  The  Company  has  had  no  material  changes  to  its  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  as 
disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 
2009 and the unaudited Financial Statements at September 30, 2009 as provided herein under the section heading “Financial Statements” above.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. 
We  regularly  evaluate  our  estimates  and  assumptions  related  to  the  useful  life  and  recoverability  of  long-lived  assets,  stock-based  compensation  and  deferred 
income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be 
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of 
costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To 
the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.
We  believe  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  require  us  to  make  significant  judgments  and  estimates  in  the  preparation  of  our consolidated  financial 
statements.
Mineral Property Costs
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. Mineral property acquisition costs are capitalized in 
accordance  with  EITF  04-2  “Whether  Mineral  Rights  Are  Tangible  or  Intangible  Assets”  when  management  has  determined  that  probable  future  benefits 
consisting of a contribution to future cash inflows have been identified and adequate financial resources are available or are expected to be available as required to 
meet the terms of property acquisition and budgeted exploration and development expenditures. Mineral property acquisition costs are expensed as incurred if the 
criteria for capitalization are not met. In the event that a mineral property is acquired through the issuance of the Company’s shares, the mineral property will be 
recorded at the fair value of the respective property or the fair value of common shares, whichever is more readily determinable.
When mineral properties are acquired under option agreements with future acquisition payments to be made at the sole discretion of the Company, those future 
payments, whether in cash or shares, are recorded only when the Company has made or is obliged to make the payment or issue the shares. When it has been 
determined that a mineral property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves and pre-feasibility, the costs incurred to 
develop such property are capitalized.
Stock-based Compensation
The Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS 123(R), “Share-Based Payments,” which requires the measurement and recognition of 
compensation expense, based on estimated fair values, for all share-based awards, made to employees and directors, including stock options. SFAS 123(R) requires 
companies to estimate the fair value of share-based awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model as its method of determining fair value. This model is affected by the Company’s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective 
variables. These subjective variables include, but are not limited to, the Company’s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and 
projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense in the 
consolidated statement of operations over the vesting period.
No tax benefits were attributed to stock-based compensation expense because a full valuation allowance was maintained for all net deferred tax assets.
Contractual Obligations
The Company has had no material changes to its contractual obligations as disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission on March 12, 2009 and the unaudited Financial Statements at September 30, 2009 as provided herein under the section heading “Financial 
Statements” above.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our operations are not yet exposed to risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and credit. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that we 
may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of uranium. Interest rate risk results from our debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and 
liquidity for our business. Credit risk would arise from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is not yet significant. Industry-wide risks 
can, however, affect our general ability to finance exploration, and development of exploitable resources; such effects are not predictable or quantifiable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company’s management, 
including its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Glenn Catchpole, and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Benjamin Leboe, of the effectiveness of the design and 
operations of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a – 15(e) and Rule 15d – 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that 
evaluation the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were 
adequately designed and effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms 
and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required 
disclosure.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or 
submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's 
rules  and  forms.  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be 
disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2009, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
The  term  “internal  control  over  financial  reporting”  is  defined  as  a  process  designed  by,  or  under  the  supervision  of,  the  registrant's  principal  executive  and 
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the registrant's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the registrant;
 
Provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the registrant are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management 
and directors of the registrant; and 
 
Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the registrant's assets that could 
have a material effect on the financial statements.

PART II- OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings.
We currently are not a party to any material legal proceedings and, to our knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated.
Item 1A. Risk Factors
Except for the risk factor as provided below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K 
for the year ended December 31, 2008 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2009
Recent market events and conditions, including disruptions in the U.S. and international credit markets and other financial systems and the deterioration of 
the U.S. and global economic conditions, could, among other things, impede access to capital or increase the cost of capital, which would have an adverse 
effect on our ability to fund our working capital and other capital requirements.
In 2007, 2008 and into 2009, the U.S. credit markets began  to experience serious disruption due  to a deterioration in residential property values, defaults and 
delinquencies  in  the  residential  mortgage  market  (particularly,  sub-prime  and  non-prime  mortgages)  and  a  decline  in  the  credit  quality  of  mortgage  backed 
securities. These problems led to a slow-down in residential housing market transactions, declining housing prices, delinquencies in non-mortgage consumer credit 
and a general decline in consumer confidence. These conditions continued and worsened in 2008 and into 2009, causing a loss of confidence in the broader U.S. 
and global credit and financial markets and resulting in the collapse of, and government intervention in, major banks, financial institutions and insurers and creating 
a  climate  of  greater  volatility,  less  liquidity,  widening  of  credit  spreads,  a  lack  of  price  transparency,  increased  credit  losses  and  tighter  credit  conditions.
Notwithstanding various actions by the U.S. and foreign governments, concerns about the general condition of the capital markets, financial instruments, banks, 
investment banks, insurers and other financial institutions caused the broader credit markets to further deteriorate and stock markets to decline substantially. In 
addition,  general  economic  indicators  deteriorated,  including  declining  consumer  sentiment,  increased  unemployment  and  declining  economic growth  and 
uncertainty about corporate earnings.
Although there are indications that the worst disruptions are over, these disruptions in the credit and financial markets have had a significant material adverse 
impact on a number of financial institutions and have limited access to capital and credit for many companies. These disruptions could, among other things, make it 
more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, capital and financing for our operations. Our access to additional capital may not be available on
terms acceptable to us.
Acquisitions and integration issues may expose us to additional risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Our business strategy includes making targeted acquisitions. Any acquisition that we make may be of a significant size, may change the scale of our business and 
operations, and may expose us to new geographic, political, operating, financial and geological risks. The success of our acquisition activities depends on our 
ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our 
own. Any acquisitions would be accompanied by risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, there may be significant decreases 
in commodity prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and have established the purchase price or exchange ratio; a material ore body may prove 
to  be  below  expectations;  we  may  have  difficulty  integrating  and  assimilating  the  operations  and  personnel  of  any acquired  companies,  realizing  anticipated 
synergies  and  maximizing  the  financial  and  strategic  position  of  the  combined  enterprise  and  maintaining  uniform standards,  policies  and  controls  across  the 
organization; the integration of the acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and 
contractors; and the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. If we choose to use equity securities as consideration for 
such an acquisition, existing stockholders may suffer dilution. Alternatively, we may choose to finance any such acquisition with our existing resources. There can 
be no assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions.
Our mineral properties may be subject to defects in title.
We own, lease, or have under option, unpatented and patented mining claims, mineral claims or concessions and fee mineral leases which constitute our property 
holdings. The ownership and validity or title of unpatented mining claims and concessions are often uncertain and may be contested. We also may not have, or may 
not  be  able  to  obtain,  all  necessary  surface  rights  to  develop  a  property.  We  have  not  conducted  title  research  in relation  to  many  of  our  mining  claims  and 
concessions to ensure clean title. We cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is generally not available for mineral 
properties and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely
constrained.  Our  mineral  properties  may  be  subject  to  prior  unregistered  agreements,  transfers  or  claims,  and  title  may  be  affected  by, among  other  things, 
undetected defects. We may incur significant costs related to defending the title to our properties. A successful claim contesting our title to a property may cause us 
to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property or lose our rights to explore and, if warranted, develop that property. This could 
result in us not being compensated for our prior expenditures relating to the property. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would 
divert our management’s time from ongoing exploration and development programs.
