<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its eleventh 
session from 2 to 13 May 2011. The review of Hungary was held at the 15th meeting on 11 
May 2011. The delegation of Hungary was headed by Zoltan Balog, Minister of State for 
Social Inclusion, Ministry of Public Administration and Justice. At its 17th meeting, held 
on 13 May 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on Hungary. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Hungary: France, Gabon, Ukraine. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Hungary: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/11/HUN/1);  
</p>

</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/11/HUN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden. Switzerland and the United Kingdom of Great 
Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Hungary through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation expressed its conviction that Hungary&#8217;s first universal periodic 
review and the follow-up would further strengthen its human rights record.  The delegation 
reported that a wide range of civil-society representatives were consulted with during the 
national report preparation. 
</p>
<p>6. Hungary had launched a series of international conferences in 2008, called the 
Budapest Human Rights Forum, which covered a range of human rights issues. During the 
3rd Forum in 2010, the Deed of the Foundation for the International Prevention of 
Genocide and Mass Atrocities was signed by the Central European University and the 
G&#225;sp&#225;r K&#225;roli University of the Hungarian Reformed Church. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation noted that the adoption of a new Constitution by the Parliament in 
April 2011 represented a milestone for the development of the rule of law and marked the 
end of the transitional period from dictatorship to democracy. The new Constitution 
strengthened the protection of human rights inspired by the Charter of Fundamental Rights 
of the European Union and contained a more extensive list of rights than before. The new 
Constitution stipulated that marriage was an institution between a man and a woman, 
however the rights of same-sex couples in a registered partnership were protected to the 
same extent as those of heterosexual couples. The new Constitution also strengthened and 
widened the function of the Constitutional Court by introducing the constitutional right to 
launch a complaint before it by individuals. </p>


<p>8. The delegation informed about Hungary&#8217;s willingness to accede to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OP-CAT) as a part of its pledges to the Human 
Rights Council as well as about the Government&#8217;s steps to prepare this ratification. 
</p>
<p>9. Hungary supported the preservation and further development of cultural rights and 
values of the13 national and ethnic minorities recognized in the country and strived to 
broaden the cultural autonomy of the minorities by providing the necessary legal, 
institutional and budgetary framework. Minority self-governments were entitled to have 
minority-run and State-subsidized institutions. 
</p>
<p>10. Since the establishment of a democratic system, Hungary had been addressing the 
special situation of the Roma through laws and other measures to improve their socio-
economic situation, while remaining committed to the elimination of discrimination against 
them. At the same time the delegation acknowledged that the situation of the Roma and 
other socially disadvantaged groups had not significantly improved but rather had 
worsened, especially in the area of employment.  Hungary joined the Roma Decade 
Programme and was in the process of developing a Roma Programme for implementation. 
</p>
<p>11. Hungary had taken measures and implemented several programmes that covered 
1,800 education institutions, were supported by a budget of about US$ 40 million and 
aimed, inter alia, to fight segregation, ensure access to quality and inclusive education and 
decrease school dropout. 
</p>
<p>12. In 2008, Hungary launched a development programme for the 33 most 
disadvantaged micro-regions with a budget of US$ 545 million to remedy deficiencies in its  
social and economic infrastructure and improve the quality of local services.  Regarding 
employment issues, the delegation reported on the provision of training programmes and 
access to professional consulting services and information about potential employers for 
those seeking employment. To end segregation, in the period of 2005-2009 Hungary 
implemented settlement programmes with a budget of about US$ 20 million, which resulted 
in the improvement of living conditions for hundreds of families. 
</p>
<p>13. In recent years, extremist groups had re-emerged with a demand to maintain public 
order in Roma-populated areas, resulting in social and ethnic unrest. Among several steps 
taken to address the situation, Hungary amended the relevant legislation to effectively 
prosecute and punish these extremist groups. 
</p>
<p>14. Hungary guaranteed the enjoyment of human rights in the field of health care and 
provided a legal basis for the protection of the dignity, autonomy and rights of patients.  To 
guarantee the rights of women, the legislation provided a possibility for women to give 
birth outside the hospital system by legally setting necessary requirements and conditions. 
</p>
<p>15. In 2007, the Parliament accepted the &#8220;Let it be better for the children&#8221; &#8211; National 
strategy 2007-2032 with the goal of decreasing child poverty and improving opportunities 
for children.  
</p>
<p>16. In 2010, Hungary adopted the Media Law to replace the Media Act. The 
Government had worked, inter alia, with United Nations Special Rapporteurs on this issue 
and incorporated suggestions for amendments made by the European Commission. The 
delegation noted that this media regulation provided a balance between freedom of 
expression and other relevant fundamental rights. At the same time, Hungary welcomed the 
initiative to hold a general debate on the role of the European Union in the area of media 
regulation and, as part of this debate, every regulation in EU member States would be 
reviewed in order to correct the deficiencies of the normative framework on the media. 
</p>
<p>17. As to the issue of the independence and impartiality of the Media Council, the 
delegation explained that a number of legal guarantees existed to ensure its independence, 
including the fact that the Council was comprised of professionals elected by a two-thirds </p>


<p>majority of the National Assembly, and that Council members were required to have no 
political party affiliation and were not to accept instructions from anyone. 
</p>
<p>18. Regarding the questions on hate crimes, the delegation stated that cases of violent 
acts motivated by racism and xenophobia were punishable by the Criminal Code and racist 
motivation constituted an aggravating circumstance for several other crimes.  Victims of 
racially motivated crimes were entitled to State assistance. 
</p>
<p>19. The delegation stated that the domestic legislation on equal treatment and the 
promotion of equal opportunities defined and prohibited direct discrimination as well as 
prohibited indirect discrimination. The Constitution and legislation also provided 
guarantees for equal treatment and several legal remedies in case of discrimination. 
Furthermore, the Equal Treatment Authority was responsible for the investigation of 
complaints about discrimination. 
</p>
<p>20. Any act that might appear as &#8220;domestic violence&#8221; was already covered by the 
existing crimes and offences provided for in the Criminal Code. Since such violent acts did 
not differ, whether committed against a member of the family or against a third person, it 
was believed that there was no need to have domestic violence defined as a separate crime 
to avoid duplication in the Code. 
</p>
<p>21. In response to questions regarding the national human rights institutions the 
delegation reported that the application process for the accreditation of the office of the 
Parliamentary Commission by the International Coordinating Committee had started. 
</p>
<p>22. While reporting on the initiative to adopt a new Criminal Code in 2011, the 
delegation gave assurances that due attention would be given to ensure that the new Code 
include a definition of torture in line with the requirements of the Convention against 
Torture. 
</p>
<p>23. The delegation reported that detention of a person entering the country illegally was 
not ordered as a punishment for illegal border-crossing but rather it might be necessary to 
ensure the implementation of expulsion.  The detention should be immediately terminated 
when the person concerned is granted international protection and the purpose of detention 
no longer existed. The legality of the detention was ensured by continuous judicial control. 
Additionally, the person concerned could appeal this decision. 
</p>
<p>24. In response to questions on the right to health and the preventive health care system, 
the delegation reported on the age-based screening programme for citizens within the 
framework of the National Public Health Programme, which included, inter alia, 
mammography, cytology, and colonoscopy. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding the steps to combat torture, the delegation explained that the Criminal 
Code provided for the crimes of ill-treatment and forced interrogation and it penalized the 
indirect commission of such crimes. Moreover, an Independent Police Complaints Board, 
which consisted of independent experts, was established in 2008 to examine alleged 
violations of fundamental rights by the police. 
</p>
<p>26. The domestic legislation ensured the principle of non-refoulement and the relevant 
authorities were required to verify whether the principle of non-refoulement was respected 
before the implementation of a decision on return. The person concerned was also entitled 
to request a remedy against the decision on return before a court. 
</p>
<p>27. As to measures to combat human trafficking, the delegation reported that human 
trafficking was criminalized and forced labour linked to trafficking was addressed by the 
legal provisions on human trafficking. Hungary had established excellent cooperation with 
Switzerland, Italy and Romania and also established a national coordination mechanism to 
effectively combat human trafficking. </p>


<p>28. The delegation reported that the periodic report to the Committee on the Elimination  
of Racial Discrimination was already prepared and would be submitted soon to that treaty 
body. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>29. During the interactive dialogue, 48 delegations made statements. A number of 
countries recognized Hungary&#8217;s openness to international scrutiny and its willingness to 
make further progress on human rights. A number of countries thanked Hungary for 
preparing a comprehensive national report involving a wide spectrum of Government 
departments, experts and civil society stakeholders. Recommendations made during the

people with respect to education, health, employment and housing, and the 
disproportionately high levels of poverty among them.  India inquired about the 
effectiveness of the Programme for the Decade of Roma Inclusion 2005-15 and any 
progress achieved in the implementation of the European Roma Strategy.  India made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>31. France noted that Hungary is party to most core human rights instruments. France 
observed that the new constitution did not explicitly prohibit the death penalty and 
discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation and inquired whether legislation protecting 
against such discrimination was envisaged. France noted that Roma had been victims of 
racist acts and intimidation by extremists and inquired on measures envisaged to protect 
them. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Switzerland, observing that victims of racist attacks often belonged to ethnic 
minorities or vulnerable groups, underlined that recent violence against Roma committed

<p>78. The delegation reported on existing constitutional provisions to guarantee the 
conformity of the implementation of the new Constitution with international human rights 
obligations. Additionally, the Constitutional Court was mandated to examine and compare 
domestic legislation with international agreements for the identification of possible 
conflicts. 
</p>
<p>79. While the new Constitution contained a non-exhaustive list of grounds for 
discrimination, the case-law of the Constitutional Court prohibited discrimination based on 
sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>80. With regard to the right to life, the delegation referred to the Constitutional 
provision that guaranteed the right to life and human dignity to everyone and separately 
stipulated that embryonic and fetal life should be subject to protection from the moment of 
conception. Having in mind that the current legal practice of the Constitutional Court had 
been in line with these provisions, there was no need for passing tougher legislation on 
abortion.

contained positive provisions in line with Hungary&#8217;s international obligations.

against enforced disappearances, Hungary will examine the possibility of ratifying the 
International Convention on Enforced Disappearances.

<p>84. The minor and temporary limitations of the competence of the Constitutional Court 
were caused by the economic situation, which was claimed to have no serious impact on the 
ability of the Constitutional Court to review and decide upon cases brought before it. 
Furthermore, with the new constitutional right of an individual to appeal to the 
Constitutional Court, its oversight function had been strengthened. 
</p>
<p>85. Under the new Constitution, the Ombudsman will have a deputy responsible for the 
issue of future generations, including environmental protection. 
</p>
<p>86. The delegation reaffirmed the readiness of Hungary to cooperate with international 
organizations that expressed concerns about the new media legislation. Furthermore, 
Hungary will closely monitor the implementation of the legislation in practice, in particular 
those aspects which were highlighted by the experts of UN, OSCE and the Council of 
Europe. 
</p>
<p>87. Hungary launched a comprehensive programme to address violence in schools. In 
2009, the ombudsman on educational rights conducted a comprehensive survey regarding 
violence in school. 
</p>
<p>88. The legislation prohibited discrimination and segregation in the education sector in 
line with relevant UNESCO conventions.  There were also several court decisions against 
administrative decisions causing segregation, including against the Roma pupils. </p>


<p>89. Children with multiple disadvantages, including those from the Roma community, 
received financial assistance for pre-school to higher education. The delegation reported on 
the Government&#8217;s plan to sign an agreement with the National Roma Self-Government in 
May 2011 to take a commitment for the creation of new jobs, the increase in access to 
secondary schools and the provision of scholarships for higher education to the Roma 
population in the coming four years. 
</p>
<p>90. The new Constitution contained provisions guaranteeing gender equality and the 
relevant legislation prohibited the discrimination against women both in the public and the 
private sectors. The national strategy to enhance equality of women and men aimed, inter 
alia, to eliminate wage gaps between men and women. 
</p>
<p>91. A normative integration strategy provided the main conditions for granting refugee 
status and the measures to facilitate their integration into society. 
</p>
<p>92. Regarding overcrowded prisons, the delegation informed about the target set by the 
Government to reduce by 39 per cent the occupancy of prisons.
