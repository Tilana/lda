periodic review process, the Council considered the outcome of the reviews conducted during 
the fourth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, held from 2 
to 13 February 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Consideration of universal periodic review outcomes 
</b></p>
<p>170. In accordance with paragraph 4.3 of President&#8217;s statement PRST/8/1, the section below 
contains a summary of the views expressed on the outcome by States under review, Member and 
observer States of the Council, as well as general comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary. 
</p>
<p><b>Germany 
</b></p>
<p>171. The review of Germany was held on 2 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Germany in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/DEU/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/DEU/2); 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/DEU/3). 
</p>
<p>172. At its 14th meeting, on 9 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Germany (see sect. C below). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>173. The outcome of the review on Germany comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/15), the views of Germany concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/15/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>174. The Permanent Representative of Germany to the United Nations Office at Geneva 
presented the additional views of Germany to the recommendations made during the working 
group review on 2 February 2009. The full text of the German comments to the 44 clustered 
recommendations is contained in the addendum to the report of the Working Group 
(A/HRC/11/15/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>175. The Permanent Representative indicated that the answers of Germany reflect the very 
positive interest the country had taken in the creation and conduct of the universal periodic 
review as well as the open and constructive spirit in which it had approached the 
recommendations. The review had received considerable attention in Germany at all levels, 
including Parliament, and discussion on the issues raised would certainly continue. 
</p>
<p>176. A total of 35 of the 44 clusters of recommendations were accepted, most of which without 
reservations or restrictions. Germany regretted not to be yet in a position to provide a definite 
answer on the signing and ratification of the new Optional Protocol to the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in view of the fact that it was an issue still under 
consideration. In that regard, the Permanent Representative noted that the recommendations that 
could not be accepted related to issues that had been and were the subject of ongoing and intense 
debate among all stakeholders in Germany, and the relevant recommendations were considered 
to be a valuable addition to that debate. 
</p>
<p>177. Germany indicated that all recommendations had been subjected to careful scrutiny by the 
relevant authorities at the federal level, and had been considered in the light of both international 
obligations and national laws, as well as to their added value for the protection and promotion of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>human rights in Germany. As was already the case with the national report, the answers to the 
recommendations had been the subject of consultations with civil society organizations and the 
national human rights institution of Germany. The delegate thanked them for their engagement, 
constructive criticism and devotion to human rights. He underlined that throughout the review 
process, from the summary of the stakeholder&#8217;s input to the current consultations, it had again 
been demonstrated how essential the free participation of active, lively and varied civil society 
organizations was to the functioning of a human rights culture. Germany owed them its respect 
and full support, both at home and in the Council. 
</p>
<p>178. Turning to the substance of its answers to the recommendations, Germany noted that many 
recommendations referred to the specific areas of human rights of migrants, questions of racism, 
xenophobia and related intolerance, as well as minority issues. Almost all related 
recommendations had been accepted. Germany remained fully committed to effectively 
combating all instances of racism, racial discrimination and related phenomena. In this context, 
Germany looked forward to the visit in the country of the Special Rapporteur, Githu Muigai. 
</p>
<p>179. Although Germany was currently not in a position to accept the call for the creation of a 
centralized statistic database on racist and xenophobic incidents as contained in 
recommendation 16, it looked forward to pursuing an open dialogue on the need and feasibility 
of such a mechanism. The Permanent Representative added that, despite its decision not to 
participate in the recent Durban Review Conference, Germany would continue to engage itself 
fully in the international fight against racism and all forms of discrimination. Germany also 
remained committed to protecting the human rights of all migrants, minorities and religious 
groups. Germany saw no contradiction between this commitment and its well-known stand on 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, and existing limitations to the open display of religious beliefs by 
teachers and civil servants while on duty. The first instance was due to the full protection of the 
relevant rights in other conventions, while the second was rooted in nothing else but the need to 
weigh the positive and negative freedom of belief against each other and to retain the State&#8217;s 
neutrality in matters of belief. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>180. The Permanent Representative also drew the attention of the Council to the answer to 
recommendation 30, where Germany not only fully embraced the recommendation, but also 
provided basic data and information relating to the factual situation in the country. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council 
on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>181. Qatar saluted Germany&#8217;s efforts to respond positively to the recommendations, particularly 
with regard to better integration of Muslims in society and the full enjoyment by Muslims of 
their human rights, such as freedom of religion and non-discrimination. It noted that Germany 
had taken positive measures in countering discrimination on the basis of religion. It encouraged 
Germany to implement the recommendations concerning combating discrimination, in particular 
vis-&#224;-vis ethnic and religious minorities. Qatar welcomed developments, in line with its 
recommendation, with regard to the punishment of perpetrators of acts of violence on the 
grounds of racial discrimination, particularly against Muslims. It also noted the measures taken 
by Germany to ensure compliance with international standards, such as protection of freedom of 
religion, for example of Islam, adding that this showed the political will to allow foreigners and 
above all Muslims to enjoy their rights fully. It hoped for further improvements in this regard. 
</p>
<p>182. Algeria highlighted the increase in racist incidents, particularly against Muslims, Sinti, 
Roma and asylum-seekers of African origin. It said it would follow with great interest the 
implementation of its recommendation to follow up on the recommendations of the Committee 
on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. It expressed interest in measures to prevent racially 
motivated offences, guarantee equality in the right to suitable housing, lift obstacles for 
asylum-seekers to educate their children and make ethnically, racially or religiously motivated 
hatred an aggravating circumstance in criminal cases. Noting Germany&#8217;s commitment to 
combating racism, Algeria had recommended that it contribute actively to the Durban Review 
Conference preparations. Given Germany&#8217;s contribution to the preparatory process, Algeria 
regretted its boycott of the Conference and called on it to join the consensus on the outcome 
document. It regretted that Germany had not accepted the recommendations with regard to 
migrant workers and accession to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>183. The Russian Federation thanked Germany for its detailed and substantive replies to the 
recommendations made. It noted Germany&#8217;s constructive approach to the universal periodic 
review, which was displayed in particular by the fact that Germany had agreed fully to 
70 per cent of the recommendations, including two from the Russian Federation. It looked 
forward to the report on their implementation during the next cycle of the review. It highlighted 
Germany&#8217;s agreement with the recommendation to intensify efforts to combat racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. It trusted that appropriate steps in this regard 
would include the adoption of a final decision on Germany&#8217;s accession to the outcome document 
of the Durban Review Conference. 
</p>
<p>184. Saudi Arabia commended Germany&#8217;s acceptance of recommendation 15 and the 
commitment to continue implementing the national plan of action to eliminate xenophobia and 
Islamophobia. It cited the integration into German society of 3.4 million Muslims and the 
protection of their rights as proof of Germany&#8217;s interest in implementing its national plan of 
</p>
<p>action to eliminate racism and racial discrimination. Saudi Arabia said that Germany had 
reaffirmed its commitment to cooperate with the international community, commended it for its 
tireless efforts to protect human rights, especially minority rights, and called on it to continue 
doing so. 
</p>
<p>185. The Islamic Republic of Iran reiterated its serious concerns at the growing racism and 
persistent discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, gender, religion and belief; 
ill-treatment by law-enforcement officials; the dramatic increase in racist violence against 
minorities; and the Government&#8217;s poor strategy to counter this phenomenon. It said that the 
Government had failed to deal sufficiently with race-related incidents and discrimination against 
Muslim, Sinti/Roma and other communities. It noted that no concrete response had been given 
on the absence of a definition of racial discrimination in domestic legislation and recommended 
that a clear and comprehensive definition be adopted thereon. No clear response had been 
provided in relation to ensuring that relevant criminal law provisions were effectively 
implemented in case of racially motivated offences. The Islamic Republic of Iran expressed 
concern that some Muslim women had been denied positions as training teachers and civil 
servants and been threatened with disciplinary action for wearing the headscarf, contravening  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>freedom of religion and expression. It also noted that adherence to certain religious organizations 
or beliefs constituted one of the main grounds for disqualifying individuals from employment in 
the public service.  
</p>
<p>186. Sweden noted that a recommendation relating to the human rights aspects in the fight 
against terrorism had been accepted. It expressed hope that it would also include how legislation 
was applied with regard to searches of private computers. It welcomed the fact that 
recommendations with a view to promote integration further and ensure that all persons enjoy 
the right to education, regardless of their background, enjoyed the support of Germany. 
</p>
<p>187. The United States of America commended Germany for its recent actions to extend 
permanent residence to those granted asylum. It also commended it for its efforts to better 
integrate members of immigrant communities into mainstream society. It noted, however, that 
discrimination and hostility towards some racial and religious minority groups remained a 
problem. It thus applauded the creation of the national plan of action against racism and 
commended Germany for its ongoing efforts to combat racism, xenophobia and intolerance. 
</p>
<p>188. Chad noted with satisfaction that Germany had accepted most of the recommendations 
made, which clearly showed the importance Germany attaches to the universal periodic review. 
It noted that Germany assisted poor countries in combating poverty by financing development 
projects, of which Chad was one of the beneficiaries. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>189. The German Institute for Human Rights welcomed Germany&#8217;s acceptance of most of the 
recommendations, of which it would closely monitor the implementation. It sought stronger 
commitment concerning the ratification of all core human rights treaties and the withdrawal of 
reservations, particularly concerning the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and lifting reservations to the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. It said the universal periodic review procedure needed to 
be further developed, particularly relating to the interactive dialogue and adoption of 
recommendations. Given the importance of human rights, Governments could not simply 
disregard recommendations and should operate under the presumption that any rejection should </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>be treated as an exception, deserving an explanation. It added that the review should be seen in 
conjunction with other human rights mechanisms. Those recommendations based on treaty body 
or special procedures findings deserved additional attention. It added that a consultation process 
was initiated by the Government of Germany regarding adoption of recommendations and this 
should be a regular part of the review process. Governments should share whether, how and 
when such consultations had taken place. 
</p>
<p>190. The Charitable Institute for the Protection of Social Victims drew the attention of the 
Council to cases of human rights violations in Germany on the pretext of the war on terror. It 
noted that the adoption of secrecy policies by the Government and the grave violation of the 
rights of detainees suspected of terrorism were just a few examples of these extraordinary 
measures. It expressed concern at Germany&#8217;s adoption of double-standard policies in the war on 
terror, and considered that a confession from a suspect of terrorism obtained as a result of torture 
was a blatant violation of human rights, in particular in view of the fact that the German law 
would not in normal circumstances accept those confessions as credible evidence. 
</p>
<p>191. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence noted that German teachers wearing 
the hijab were discriminated against on the basis of their gender and religion, while exceptions 
were made for Christians and western cultural traditions. Another alarming issue was the 
increase of attacks by neo-Nazi criminal groups against migrants and minorities. It expressed 
concern about the conditions of the migrant population and called for more sensitivity towards 
them. It called on the Council to request Germany to increase its commitment to human rights 
and to pay attention to the neglect of freedom of expression and belief, which amounted to 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>192. The Iranian Elite Research Center expressed concern at the neglect of the freedom of belief 
and religion. It noted that this issue in some German States had resulted in legal restrictions for 
Muslims, particularly women who faced religious and gender discrimination. The banning of 
religious clothes in some State-run schools violated the fundamental rights of Muslim women. 
The Center called upon Germany to review and re-evaluate laws banning the wearing of 
religious signs and insignia in some States, so that the freedom of religion and belief of people 
would not be violated. It also called on the Government to take to Muslims the same 
non-discriminatory approach it takes to other religions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>193. The Arab Commission for Human Rights expressed concern at Germany&#8217;s refusal to 
accept the recommendation to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, noting that its argument remained 
unchanged since, at the time when the Convention was negotiated in 1990, regarding the Durban 
Review Conference, it noted Germany&#8217;s commitments to continue its fight against racism, and 
underlined the statements that democratic countries had enormous responsibility for the universal 
acceptance of the outcome document, particularly paragraph 66, which stated that the Holocaust 
should never be forgotten. 
</p>
<p>194. Amnesty International welcomed Germany&#8217;s acceptance of the majority of 
recommendations, including the upcoming ratification of the International Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It saw Germany&#8217;s contribution to the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a 
strong commitment to consider its ratification in due course as announced in the national human 
rights plan. It welcomed the acceptance of the recommendation to fully respect provisions of 
international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the Convention against Torture. Despite Germany&#8217;s assertion that it had 
always acted in accordance with these, Amnesty International expressed concern about the 
continued reliance on inherently unenforceable diplomatic assurances and the failure to introduce 
measures to prevent future renditions through its territory, including air space. It regretted that 
Germany had declined recommendations to strengthen efforts to prevent ill-treatment by law 
enforcement officials and to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>195. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network commended Germany for accepting 
recommendations to take further initiatives to combat hate crimes based on sexual orientation, 
strengthen measures to counter discriminatory attitudes, and include sexual orientation and 
gender identity in public education and equality programmes. It commended Germany for 
accepting recommendation 22 on the proposal to change the law governing gender registration of 
transgender people, granting them the right to maintain their existing marriages. However, 
concerns remained that the proposed law still contained intrusive and unnecessary restrictions, 
for example, requiring transgender people to undergo sterilization and hormone treatment to be 
able to change their official documentation. It recommended that the new law should conform to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Yogyakarta principles on sexual orientation and gender identity. It also recommended that 
the Government should consult with transgender people to ensure that the new law conformed to 
their needs. 
</p>
<p>196. The World Council of Churches commended Germany for having accepted 75 per cent of 
the recommendations, but noted that a higher rate could have been met. It expressed concern on 
issues relating to migration and discrimination against migrants. It regretted that migrants did not 
have all their rights guaranteed, in particular irregular migrants, whose rights to education, health 
and access to justice were hindered. The right of migrants to live with their families did not exist 
in the legal framework and the Government of Germany was part of the hard-line faction in the 
European Union seeking to further restrict this right. Even those living in Germany for years 
with legal status were threatened with expulsion because of a bureaucratic deadline. The 
ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families would help improve their rights. It regretted the lack of 
political will to withdraw Germany&#8217;s reservation to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 
saying that the argument that the federal system would not allow withdrawal of the reservation 
without the consent of the federal states was a pretext. It encouraged the Government to 
unconditionally ratify the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights soon and to declare officially its support for the outcome document of the 
Durban Review Conference, possibly during the debate on item 9 at the current Council session. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>197. In his concluding remarks, the Permanent Representative wholeheartedly thanked the 
OHCHR for its hard work and the resources it was putting at the disposal of the universal 
periodic review, the Conference Services for their excellent and often overtime work, and the 
President for his kind and very able stewardship. 
</p>
<p><b>Djibouti 
</b>198. The review of Djibouti was held on 2 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Djibouti, in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/DJI/1); </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/DJI/2); 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/DJI/3). 
</p>
<p>199. At its 14th meeting, on 9 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review of Djibouti (see sect. C below). 
</p>
<p>200. The outcome of the review on Djibouti comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/16), the views of Djibouti concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>201. Djibouti extended the apologies of the Minister for Justice in charge of human rights, who 
was unable to attend the consideration of the outcome of his country at the plenary session of the 
Council. 
</p>
<p>202. In relation to the freedom of expression, Djibouti referred to article 1 of its Constitution, 
which stated that each and every person had the right to express and disseminate freely his or her 
opinions by word, pen or image. These rights were limited by the stipulations of the law and in 
respect of the honour of others. Organic law number two concerning freedom of the press and 
communication authorized every person in Djibouti to create and use freely the media of his or 
her choice to express their thought and to communicate to any others and have access to the 
expression of the thoughts of others. In addition to the public press bodies, there was private 
press as well as international press and no restriction or censorship thereof. 
</p>
<p>203. The Government had also taken appropriate measures to improve the status of journalists. 
Djibouti hosted the Association of Journalists of Eastern and Central Africa and the Pen Club, an 
association for the defence and promotion of freedom of expression. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>204. In the areas of social dialogue, freedom of association and trade union rights, Djibouti was 
convinced of the need to create conditions to promote the emergence of a positive environment 
for collective negotiations and the establishment of a framework of true tripartism. With this aim 
in mind, the Djibouti labour code provided for the establishment of several tripartite or joint 
bodies: the National Council for Labour, Employment and Professional Training; the National 
Joint Commission for Collective Agreements and Pay Agreements; and the National 
Commission for Security and Labour Health. 
</p>
<p>205. Article 15 of the Djibouti Constitution guaranteed freedom of association. The modalities 
were detailed in a law of 1901. 
</p>
<p>206. Concerning trade union freedoms, the legislation provided the necessary guarantees to 
trade unions to organize themselves freely. In the new labour code, two provisions had been the 
subject of comments by International Labour Organization (ILO) monitoring bodies. Djibouti 
had committed itself to comply with ILO Convention No. 87. 
</p>
<p>207. Djibouti noted that, during the review, many delegations had taken the floor and that the 
recommendations covered a wide range of areas dealing with integration of women; combating 
female genital mutilation; the right to education; access to health; the protection of children; the 
ratification of international instruments; the fight against unemployment and the establishment of 
programmes to combat poverty; the strengthening of the judicial system and access to justice; the 
establishment of a schedule to address the backlog encountered in the submission of reports to 
treaty bodies; the establishment of a programme of cooperation and capacity-building with 
OHCHR; and the strengthening of efforts to establish regional assemblies to help regional 
communities. 
</p>
<p>208. Djibouti had accepted the overwhelming majority of recommendations, although it rejected 
a small number because they were either incompatible with provisions of domestic legislation or 
did not correspond to the reality in the country. 
</p>
<p>209. The delegation of Djibouti, as soon as it returned from the universal periodic review 
Working Group, organized a workshop involving all concerned stakeholders, including civil 
society. Four main pillars have been defined: strengthening the capacities of national bodies 
dealing with periodic reports and the implementation of international conventions; strengthening </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the capacities of the national human rights commission and civil society to raise awareness for 
the promotion and protection of fundamental human rights; the development of training modules 
aimed at staff and justice auxiliaries, namely, judges, lawyers, penitentiary wardens, law 
enforcement agencies and policemen; and the continuing of a policy of ratifying human rights 
treaties and the submission of reports to treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>210. With the support of the United Nations system, Djibouti organized, in March 2009, a 
four-day workshop on drafting and techniques for the submission of reports to treaty bodies. 
Shortly after, an initial report on the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women was drawn up, endorsed and sent to the competent 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>211. A wide-ranging programme of functional literacy had been established and benefited 
thousands of young women. The Ministry for the Promotion of Women, Family Well-being and 
Social Affairs planned to strengthen and continue these programmes. It had also established 
post-literacy programmes, whereby 400 girls were currently being trained in professional and 
vocational courses. 
</p>
<p>212. In response to the universal periodic review recommendations, the Ministry had adopted a 
master plan and a strategic framework for the period 2009-2013, which will make it possible to 
speed up the institutionalization of gender issues and strengthen the empowerment of women by 
the emergence of entrepreneurs among women. 
</p>
<p>213. On 18 April 2009, a workshop on the national study on poverty and disparities involving 
children had been held. The objective of the study was to propose a fact-based systematic 
analysis on the impact of poverty and disparities on children. 
</p>
<p>214. In order to respond to recommendations 9 and 11 on juvenile justice, the Government was 
working on reforming provisions on juvenile delinquency. The draft text, which incorporated 
articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, provided for the introduction of true justice 
for minors through a juvenile judge, a court for children and a chamber of appeals for children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>215. With regard to access to health, including in rural areas, the Government had adopted, 
on 2 June 2009, a national charter for the promotion of health, aimed at reducing the current gaps 
and at offering citizens equal opportunities to optimize their potential in the health sphere. 
</p>
<p>216. The fight against poverty had been discussed and considered in a national seminar on 
Government action, held from 9 to 18 May 2009. The seminar, which was chaired by the 
President of the Republic, had also involved actors from civil society. 
</p>
<p>217. With regard to unemployment, an assessment had revealed that the main obstacle was the 
mismatch between the qualifications of young people and the demands of the market. The 
Government had defined priority actions for the promotion of employment and development of 
vocational training. 
</p>
<p>218. The Council of Ministers had also adopted a bill allowing it to become a party to the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which will soon be considered by the 
National Assembly. Measures had been taken to deposit with the Secretary-General the 
instruments of ratification of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>219. Qatar welcomed the spirit of cooperation and openness demonstrated by Djibouti in 
relation to the recommendations and observations made by delegations during the review in 
February. It welcomed in particular the acceptance by Djibouti of 37 recommendations. Qatar 
stressed the progress made in Djibouti in the area of human rights, in particular regarding the 
right to education and the rights of the child.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>220. Algeria welcomed the establishment of a national human rights institution in line with the 
Paris Principles. It acknowledged the efforts made in the areas of education, health care, the 
protection of women and children and poverty eradication. Algeria reiterated its recommendation 
that OHCHR provide the necessary technical assistance requested by Djibouti to meet its human 
rights commitments, particularly to overcome the current delay in submitting its reports to treaty 
bodies. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>221. Cuba congratulated Djibouti on its efforts, saying it was particularly meritorious given the 
fact that Djibouti was fighting for the well-being of its people under the difficult conditions 
imposed by the existing economic world order, aggravated by the impact of the current global 
financial crisis. It noted with satisfaction that Djibouti continued taking positive steps to 
implement the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>222. The United Arab Emirates noted with satisfaction that Djibouti had accepted most of the 
recommendations made during the session of the Working Group, and had decided to involve 
civil society in their implementation. The United Arab Emirates considered that Djibouti was 
going in the right direction in the area of human rights and appreciated the efforts that it was 
making. 
</p>
<p>223. Egypt commended Djibouti for the efforts made, noting that these were fraught with 
challenges and constraints, but that they had no doubt Djibouti would overcome these. Noting 
that Djibouti had voluntarily accepted the majority of the recommendations, it encouraged the 
Government to further its efforts, while welcoming the attention paid to the areas of education, 
health, poverty reduction and strengthening of the judicial system and the national human rights 
architecture. 
</p>
<p>224. Bahrain noted with appreciation the steps taken by Djibouti to implement a number of 
recommendations contained in the report of the Working Group. The measures taken showed 
Djibouti&#8217;s willingness to give new impetus to human rights and to cooperate with human rights 
mechanisms. Bahrain noted in particular the measures to promote the right to education, 
especially for children. 
</p>
<p>225. Saudi Arabia welcomed the acceptance of most of the recommendations, in particular 
recommendation 17 on continuing efforts to increase the number of primary and secondary 
schools and to strengthen higher education. Despite the obstacles encountered, Djibouti had 
achieved progress in the promotion and protection of human rights, having set up a ministry for 
the promotion and protection of the rights of women, and enacted laws to strengthen the right to 
education so that children between 6 and 16 years of age could benefit from free education. 
</p>
<p>226. Indonesia commended Djibouti for its ongoing work and constructive strategies to reduce 
illiteracy and to promote the education of girls between the ages of 6 and 16, saying that this </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>would empower girls and women in society. It also commended it for the incorporation of 
ratified international norms and human rights instruments into national legislation. It welcomed 
the initiatives aiming at increasing the participation of women in the political and social sphere, 
especially with regard to the national commitments to the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>227. Morocco noted that Djibouti had accepted 37 recommendations and reiterated its call to the 
international community to support Djibouti in its efforts to promote human rights, in particular 
in the area of the harmonization of domestic legislation and related institutional reform. Djibouti 
should be encouraged to make specific technical assistance requests to relevant agencies and 
international institutions, including OHCHR, in order to develop and promote the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>228. Yemen said that the presentation and report made by Djibouti during the universal periodic 
review clearly illustrated its achievements and challenges. The acceptance of a large number of 
recommendations was a further indication of the importance given by the country to many of the 
issues raised and of the moral commitment to promote and protect human rights. It encouraged 
Djibouti to persevere in its efforts. 
</p>
<p>229. Senegal welcomed the efforts made and policies put in place by Djibouti to promote the 
social condition of its citizens, in particular through programmes to reduce unemployment and 
the promotion of the rights to housing, education and health. It noted that the measures taken by 
the authorities in various areas showed the determination of Djibouti to overcome the constraints 
faced and to attain its objectives in the area of human rights. Senegal called on the international 
community to express more solidarity for Djibouti. 
</p>
<p>230. Nigeria was impressed by Djibouti&#8217;s initiative to take measures to strengthen its capacity 
in the administration of justice; establish a juvenile justice system; train judicial and law 
enforcement officers dealing with juvenile cases; and develop and strengthen legislative 
measures to ensure prompt investigation and prosecution of sexual offences against children. 
</p>
<p>231. Burkina Faso encouraged Djibouti to pursue its efforts to implement the recommendations 
made during the review. It noted with satisfaction the action already taken to this end. 
Burkina Faso expressed its solidarity with Djibouti in its efforts to implement strategies for the 
realization of human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>232. The Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et de promotion de la coop&#233;ration 
economique internationale, in a joint statement with the Indian Council of South America, the 
International Human Rights Association of American minorities and the Organization for 
defending victims of violence, welcomed Djibouti&#8217;s particular attention to the rights of the child 
and women. It encouraged Djibouti to continue its efforts to reduce illiteracy, which remained 
very high among women. It recommended that Djibouti should continue its efforts to elaborate a 
plan of action for the implementation of the recommendations made by the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child, and reminded Djibouti of the importance of ratifying other human rights 
instruments. 
</p>
<p>233. The Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme stressed that, after many 
years of political instability, Djibouti had committed itself to building a State based on the rule of 
law thanks to its adherence to international human rights instruments. It recommended that 
Djibouti should establish a national programme to promote women&#8217;s rights and rehabilitate 
victims of poverty and sexual mutilation, and to establish a framework to promote freedom of 
the press. 
</p>
<p>234. The Arab Commission for Human Rights<b> </b>congratulated Djibouti for having accepted 
several recommendations, but regretted that, in certain paragraphs, the report did not identify 
more clearly which recommendations had been accepted and which had been rejected. In that 
regard, it noted a contradiction between the rejection of recommendation 59 (e), and the apparent 
endorsement of recommendation 7 of paragraph 68, thus creating a conflict of interpretation. 
</p>
<p>235. The Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine expressed its 
willingness to work in collaboration with Djibouti to ensure that its commitments were realized, 
in particular in the area of harmonization of domestic legislation with international standards. 
</p>
<p>236. The Al-Hakim Foundation urged Djibouti to reform effectively the judiciary, which was 
reportedly under the influence of the executive, with courts failing to respect fair trial standards, 
particularly in political cases not tried in public. It further noted reports of political and tribal 
intervention in the selection of judges and judicial officers, and the application of tribal laws to 
cases, including murder and rape, where fines were determined as blood money to be offered to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the family or tribe of the victim. It said that, although the Constitution and the law provided for 
the creation of trade unions, workers associations and political parties, in some instances the 
Government had imposed some restrictions, noting for example that the labour code stipulated 
that the Government must give prior authorization to the creation of trade federations and unions. 
</p>
<p>237. The Cairo Institute encouraged Djibouti to enhance its collaboration with all international 
human rights instruments and mechanisms, notably by extending a standing invitation to the 
special procedures mandate holders by ensuring treaty body reporting, and by publicly speaking 
out in favour of the International Criminal Court, to which it is a State party. It called on the 
Government to bring an immediate end to the continued harassment of human rights activists 
such as the President of the Ligue djiboutienne des droits de l&#8217;homme, to create an enabling 
environment for the independent media by repealing the current press law and passing new 
legislation, that eliminates criminal sanctions for press offences among other provisions, and to 
guarantee freedom of the media as stipulated in the numerous regional and international treaties 
ratified by Djibouti. It called on the Government to refrain from harassment, arbitrary arrest and 
detention of trade unionists and to expand the space available to free and independent activism. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>238. In its concluding remarks, Djibouti reiterated that there was no persecution of trade 
unionists in Djibouti. The press was free; journalists worked in an environment that allowed 
them to move about and participate in the formulation of policy and to give their views on issues. 
</p>
<p>239. Djibouti reaffirmed its deep gratitude to the States and representatives of civil society, who 
in their statements had expressed their interest in the human rights situation in Djibouti. 
</p>
<p>240. Before the adoption of the outcome of the review, and in compliance with paragraph 32 
of Council resolution 5/1, Switzerland invited Djibouti to clarify the status of the 
eight recommendations listed in paragraph 68 and for which responses were to be provided by 
Djibouti during the plenary session. The representative of Djibouti confirmed that the concerned 
noted recommendations were being carefully considered and reviewed by the authorities and that 
substantive responses would be provided in the future. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Canada 
</b></p>
<p>241. The review of Canada was held on 3 February 2009, in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Canada in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/CAN/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/CAN/2); 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/CAN/3). 
</p>
<p>242. At its 14th meeting, on 9 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Canada (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>243. The outcome of the review on Canada comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/17), the views of Canada concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and its replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/17/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>244. The Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations Office at Geneva indicated 
that Canada had submitted a written response that addressed the 68 recommendations contained 
in the Working Group report as well as other recommendations submitted in writing by States 
that were unable to speak at the review owing to time constraints. 
</p>
<p>245. As outlined in its response, Canada accepted 32 recommendations, accepted in 
part 22 recommendations, and did not accept 14 recommendations. Canada also made a number 
of voluntary commitments in the response. To inform its response to these recommendations, 
Canada held meetings with non-governmental organizations and Aboriginal representatives, and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>also conducted online consultations through a web portal. Canada worked with all the actors 
involved in the implementation of the recommendations or on which the recommendations 
would have an impact to prepare its national response for the plenary session. Interest in the 
follow-up to the review had been strong, from Governments to civil society organizations and 
Parliamentarians. Two parliamentary committees were examining the results of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review of Canada. In support to these ongoing discussions, the Government of Canada 
committed to submit the outcome of the review of Canada to its Parliament. 
</p>
<p>246. Canada elaborated on some issues addressed in its written responses. Regarding Aboriginal 
peoples, new funding had been allocated to support training to improve labour market outcomes 
for Aboriginal people and to address First Nations on-reserve housing, as well as infrastructure 
needs. Canada continued to support practical partnership approaches with Aboriginal 
organizations and provincial and territorial governments on the delivery of First Nations and 
Inuit health programme and child and family services. On 11 June 2008, the Prime Minister of 
Canada had offered a historic statement of apology to former students of Indian residential 
schools. A truth and reconciliation commission had been established in 2008 and Canada 
committed to considering its future recommendations. 
</p>
<p>247. Governments in Canada were working to advance equality for women and to ensure the 
protection of their rights, including by exploring ways to facilitate women&#8217;s labour force 
participation and economic security, improve the lives of Inuit, M&#233;tis and First Nations women, 
both on and off reserve, and address violence against women. Domestic violence courts had been 
established in many jurisdictions. Canada committed to identifying the causes of violence against 
Aboriginal women and developing appropriate responses, in consultation with Aboriginal and 
civil society organizations. Governments were working together to strengthen preventative 
</p>
<p>measures and improve the response of the criminal justice system to violence against all women, 
including Aboriginal women. 
</p>
<p>248. Governments in Canada were taking measures to respond to the social and economic needs 
of Canadians. Provincial and territorial governments had policies and programmes aimed at 
reducing poverty; four had implemented poverty reduction strategies. As a result of these 
measures, in the past decade, low-income rates for seniors, women, and children had fallen </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>considerably. The Government of Canada committed to continuing to find ways to build on 
efforts to address poverty and housing issues, in collaboration with provinces and territories. 
</p>
<p>249. Canada was committed to taking decisive steps to eliminate racism and to address any and 
all issues of discrimination facing Canada&#8217;s diverse racial, ethnic, cultural and religious 
communities. &#8220;A Canada for All&#8221;, Canada&#8217;s plan of action against racism, addressed racial 
discrimination in a coordinated manner across 20 federal departments and agencies.  
</p>
<p>250. Canada monitored the implementation of its legislation, programmes and services related 
to the protection of victims of trafficking. Canada pursued a multipronged approach to protect 
children from all form of sexual exploitation, including a comprehensive legal framework to 
deter exploitation and to hold offenders accountable; the development of tools and strategies for 
law enforcement agencies; and support for community-based projects that foster prevention and 
support victims. 
</p>
<p>251. Federal, provincial and territorial governments worked both individually and 
collaboratively to enhance implementation of international human rights treaties to which 
Canada was a party. Canada recognized that there may be opportunities to improve existing 
processes and therefore committed to considering options for enhancing mechanisms and 
procedures related to the implementation of international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>252. Making reference to the recommendations accepted, rejected and or partially accepted by 
Canada, Algeria indicated that it had expected more openness and consistency from Canada in 
the universal periodic review exercise. Algeria referred to the persistent refusal of Canada to join 
the consensus on the institution-building package of the Council and its refusal to systematically 
denounce violations committed by an occupying Power in a particular region of the world. 
Algeria noted Canada&#8217;s rejection of recommendation 61, which took up a recommendation from 
the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination regarding 
awareness-raising intended to protect certain groups associated with terrorism and to amend 
anti-terrorist law. Algeria indicated it would have liked Canada to take the opportunity to 
announce its support for the final document of the Durban Review Conference. Algeria noted the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>refusal of Canada to adhere to various international human rights instruments while it had made 
similar recommendations in the context of the universal periodic review to other countries. 
</p>
<p>253. Cuba noted that, in the course of the review of Canada, around 68 recommendations had 
been formulated. It highlighted those asking Canada to ratify international conventions to which 
it was not yet a party and to intensify efforts to combat racism, racial discrimination and 
xenophobia, particularly against First Nations, as an essential component to democracy. It noted 
that Canada had accepted a number of recommendations, but regretted that it continued to refuse 
to comply fully with and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, one of Cuba&#8217;s recommendations. Cuba also regretted that Canada dissociated itself 
from international efforts to combat racism, racial discrimination and xenophobia and urged it to 
join the activities to implement the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, as well as the 
outcome document of the Review Conference. Cuba indicated it missed the time when Canada 
took a pro-third-world approach, committed to the noblest causes, always on the side of the 
weakest, and awaited its return. 
</p>
<p>254. The Russian Federation regretted that the recommendations that it made to Canada had not 
been implemented. It recommended that Canada not isolate itself from international cooperation 
with respect to work on combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance and that it consider the possibility of accepting the final document of the 
Durban Review Conference. The Russian Federation also stressed the importance of a 
nationwide strategy to combat poverty, particularly in the context of the current global financial 
and economic crisis and of the desirability to pay special attention to the situation of 
representatives of indigenous peoples, who were experiencing the greatest difficulties. 
</p>
<p>255. The Islamic Republic of Iran made reference to concerns raised by the treaty bodies and in 
stakeholders&#8217; submissions, including on continued cases of violation of human rights in Canada, 
as well as the growing discriminatory treatment of indigenous people, aboriginal women, 
migrants, Muslims, Arabs and Afro-Canadians. Iran noted that, since September 2001, Canada&#8217;s 
Muslim and Arab communities had continuously felt victimized. It made reference to concerns 
about serious acts of violence against Aboriginal women and urged Canada to examine its failure 
to investigate cases of missing and murdered Aboriginal women. Iran also noted that Canada 
placed barriers to refugee and migrant family reunification, and recommended that Canada </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>address the root causes of various forms of discriminations in the country, ensure effective 
access to justice, establish means of redress and protection of the rights of ethnic minorities and 
indigenous people and Aboriginals, and revisit its decision with regard to the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 
</p>
<p>256. Sweden welcomed this opportunity to participate formally in the universal periodic review 
dialogue on Canada, and made two comments. Firstly, Sweden noted that the recommendations 
on the issue of violence against women, including indigenous women, including its own 
recommendation posted on the extranet, enjoyed the support of the Government of Canada. 
Secondly, concerning the issue of violence against children, Sweden noted that the 
recommendations made on this issue enjoyed the Government&#8217;s support and encouraged Canada 
to include a prohibition of corporal punishment. 
</p>
<p>257. The United States of America appreciated Canada&#8217;s efforts to settle Aboriginal land 
claims, with a view to accelerating the process. It also welcomed the attention paid to 
recommendations to review the effectiveness of its anti-trafficking laws and to coordinate law 
enforcement efforts among national, provincial and State authorities, and requested more 
information in this regard. It commended Canada&#8217;s acknowledgement of civil society concerns 
and appreciated its efforts to build on these constructive relationships, consulting them on 
universal periodic review follow-up activities. It noted that Canada had been a model member of 
the Council, demonstrating deep commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>258. Chad noted with satisfaction the acceptance of most of the recommendations made by 
Canada. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>259. The Canadian Human Rights Commission wished to see the universal periodic review 
process move the dialogue forwards with regard to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples and the acceleration of Canada&#8217;s ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities. The Commission commended Canada for its acceptance of a number of 
recommendations. For those not accepted, it encouraged Canada to develop practical strategies 
to reach the objectives they were designed to achieve. It also called on Canada to establish a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>national mechanism to implement and report on its international commitments, which should 
include human rights commissions and countrywide civil society. The Commission promised to 
follow Canada&#8217;s implementation of the outcome document with great interest. 
</p>
<p>260. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims commented on the prevention of 
violence against women. It emphasized the importance of assessing the complex issue of the 
effects of violence and abuse on women and on society. It called for closer attention to be paid to 
negligence in promoting and protecting women&#8217;s rights and to the causes of neglect in 
investigating the condition of women threatened with violence and abuse by their husbands. 
</p>
<p>261. The Organization for Defending Victims of Violence expressed concern over the violence 
or excessive force that the Canadian police use against people. While expressing grave concern 
at the application of these forms of violence by the Canadian police, the Organization deemed 
the use of Taser stun guns as a policy contrary to all international human rights instruments and 
guidelines and called upon the Council to consider this issue in its review on Canada. 
</p>
<p>262. The Iranian Elite Research Center referred to the human rights issues of the Muslim, 
indigenous and African-Canadian citizens of Canada and the increase in Islamophobia in the 
country. It noted that, following the September 11 attacks, the Muslim community had been 
under constant pressure and was subjected to various forms of prejudice. It expressed concern 
about the conditions of migrants and the excessive violence of police and security forces. The 
Center invited the Council to call upon Canada to observe all its human rights commitments. 
</p>
<p>263. The Indian Council of South America, in a joint statement with the Organisation pour la 
communication en Afrique et de promotion de la coop&#233;ration economique internationale and the 
International Organization of Indigenous Resource Development, referred to complaints received 
about the use of the term &#8220;aboriginal&#8221; in the universal periodic review of Canada. It raised the 
need to address unresolved issues, issue an apology in general, create a truth and reconciliation 
commission for all indigenous peoples and adopt the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. Reference was made to recommendation 61 and to the need for States to be careful that 
they do not stereotype individuals or groups to conveniently identify them as terrorists so that 
accusations of terrorism did not become a convenient excuse for the use of force and arms 
against non-violent and peaceful resistance. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>264. Rencontre africaine pour la defense des droits de l&#8217;homme made reference to Canada&#8217;s 
enormous difficulties regarding people of African descent living in Canada. It exhorted Canada 
to set up a programme for the implementation of the Durban Programme of Action and to 
promote real integration of indigenous women and black women and other minorities in 
Canada&#8217;s economic tissue. It congratulated Canada on its contribution to combating poverty in 
developing countries and on its adoption, in 2004, of a law to enable Canadian enterprises to 
communicate medical patents to combat AIDS in developing countries. 
</p>
<p>265. The International Organization of Indigenous Resource Development noted that Canada 
could not or did not accept the recommendations on ILO Convention 169, the lifting of 
reservations, with regard to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, on indigenous children 
and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It supported Canada&#8217;s 
commitment to submit the universal periodic review outcome to the Parliament and highlighted 
the need for a permanent domestic mechanism related to the implementation of international 
human rights obligations generally and specifically for indigenous peoples. It underscored 
Canada&#8217;s commitment to considering recommendations of the truth and reconciliation 
commission, though this would not in itself ensure justice and respect. 
</p>
<p>266. The World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace (on behalf of three other 
organizations), the Arab Commission for Human Rights, the International Federation of Human 
Rights Leagues and Amnesty International were scheduled to speak within the 20-minute 
segment for non-governmental organizations, but were not allowed to do so because the meeting 
was running late. At its 15th meeting, on 10 June, the President of the Council decided, on an 
exceptional basis, that, although not delivered during the proceedings, summaries of the 
statements of the above-mentioned organizations would be reflected in the present report. 
</p>
<p>267. A joint written statement by the World Association for the School as an Instrument of 
Peace with Action Canada for Population and Development, the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal 
Network and the International Organization of Indigenous Resource Development welcomed the 
Government&#8217;s acknowledgement of the importance of the issue of missing and murdered 
Aboriginals. With reference to recommendations 33 to 38 and recommendations 45, 47 to 49, 50 
and 54, the World Association for the School as an Instrument of Peace considered Canada&#8217;s  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>responses insufficient. It reiterated comments that Canada&#8217;s failure to accept recommendation 17 
contradicted the 2006 election promise to close the gap in quality of life standards between 
indigenous peoples and the rest of Canada. It expressed its disappointment with Canada&#8217;s refusal 
of recommendation 52, to endorse the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples. Regarding recommendation 57, it considered that consultations on the Migrant Workers 
Convention had been inadequate. 
</p>
<p>268. In its written statement, the Arab Commission for Human Rights saluted the acceptance of 
recommendation 2. It regretted the rejection of recommendation 5 on the ratification of the 
International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers, and recommendation 21, especially 
its second part, urging Canada to contribute to global efforts in the fight against racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. It was especially concerned over the 
argument that the Review Conference had elicited manifestations of intolerance and 
anti-Semitism. It invited Canada to reconsider its position on the Durban Review Conference and 
to join the Outcome Document, ensuring its universal acceptance. It recommended that Canada 
ratify the 1960 Convention against Discrimination in Education of the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 
</p>
<p>269. In its written statement, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues regretted 
Canada&#8217;s decision not to accept fully or partially 28 recommendations. It referred to the refusal 
of Canada to endorse the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and regretted that 
consultations with civil society had not been serious, and indicated that the choice of 
recommendations accepted had not been done in a transparent manner. It regretted Canada&#8217;s 
refusal to recognize the justiciability of economic, social and cultural rights and to adhere to the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on the Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It 
expressed concern at the refusal to accept recommendations relating to Canadian citizens facing 
the death penalty abroad. 
</p>
<p>270. In its written statement, Amnesty International welcomed Canada&#8217;s acceptance of many 
recommendations, although it had expected a more ambitious response from Canada. It was 
disappointed that Canada had rejected recommendations relating to the ratification of 
international human rights instruments and to declaring support for the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It welcomed the commitment of Canada to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>submitting the outcome of its review to the Parliament and urged that provincial and territorial 
legislatures do the same, and that the Government move quickly to develop a new approach to 
the implementation of Canada&#8217;s international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>271. Canada expressed appreciation to the Troika members, and the delegations and 
organizations that contributed to the process. Canada viewed the universal periodic review as a 
four-year cycle centred on the country under review. Having completed the preparations for its 
review and the review itself, Canada was looking ahead to the implementation phase. 
Implementing the recommendations accepted and its voluntary commitments would require 
sustained engagement by all orders of government. 
</p>
<p>272. Canada had been an early and committed proponent of the universal periodic review as one 
of the most important innovations of the Council. Canada remained committed to working to 
strengthen this dynamic new mechanism as it developed and to improving the protection of 
human rights for all people across Canada. 
</p>
<p><b>Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p>273. The review of Bangladesh was held on 3 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Bangladesh in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/BGD/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/BGD/2); and 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/BGD/3). 
</p>
<p>274. At its 15th meeting, on 10 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Bangladesh (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>275. The outcome of the review on Bangladesh comprised the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/18), the views of Bangladesh concerning the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/18/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or  
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>276. The Charg&#233; d&#8217;affaires of the Permanent Mission of Bangladesh to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva indicated that the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on her first visit 
since the new Government took office, had headed the Bangladesh delegation during its review 
held on 3 February 2009 reflected the importance that the Government attached to this new 
human rights mechanism. The conduct of the review had been a productive and rewarding 
experience for Bangladesh, obliging it to have a deeper look into its human rights situation and 
to identify possible areas requiring more attention. It had offered an opportunity to engage all 
relevant Government agencies and civil society in the human rights discourse within the country. 
</p>
<p>277. The interactive dialogue in the Working Group had been very productive. Bangladesh had 
learned how its situation and efforts had been perceived by the international community. It noted 
with great satisfaction that there had been positive recognition of the efforts made, with some 
accomplishments regarded as examples of best practice. Despite its many achievements, 
Bangladesh was aware that there were a number of shortcomings and room for improvement. 
Several delegates referred to Bangladesh&#8217;s deficits. Most of the questions and recommendations 
presented were challenging, yet constructive. Bangladesh considered them carefully and 
consulted with Government departments before finalizing its response to the recommendations, 
which was available as a public document. 
</p>
<p>278. Bangladesh had accepted almost all recommendations, with action already initiated to 
implement some of them. One or two could not be accepted as they were in conflict with 
Bangladesh&#8217;s Constitution, legal provisions or deeply-held social values. In a few cases, 
explanations had also been provided to better understand the context of human rights protection 
and Bangladesh hoped the Council would understand and appreciate this approach. Bangladesh 
stated that its commitment to the promotion of human rights was not limited to these 
recommendations. It was convinced that it needed to continuously pursue higher norms and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>standards, be it in the area of human rights or in socio-economic development. It also referred to 
its institutional framework in addressing all human rights challenges, including its democratic 
polity, vibrant civil society and newly established national human rights commission. 
</p>
<p>279. Bangladesh explained that most of its human rights challenges were rooted in poverty and 
underdevelopment. As a result, the Government had given priority attention to the alleviation of 
poverty through a range of home-grown ideas and policies, such as microcredit, non-formal 
education and social safety net programmes. Bangladesh would continue to strive for further 
progress and was confident that there would be significant progress to report in its pursuit of 
human rights by the next review. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>280. Pakistan noted that the presentation of the national report by the Minister for Foreign 
Affairs of Bangladesh was a manifestation of the priority that the newly elected Government 
attached to human rights. The acceptance of almost all recommendations was further proof of 
this commitment. Pakistan stated that the recommendations not taken on board by Bangladesh 
were clearly those that neither fell under the rubric of international human rights standards nor 
conformed to its national laws, commitments and values. It commended this stance. Pakistan 
appreciated the actions initiated for implementing the recommendations made. 
</p>
<p>281. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) was pleased with Bangladesh&#8217;s open and cooperative 
presentation, which had allowed positive interaction on its achievements and challenges. It 
thanked Bangladesh for its replies, particularly on the implementation of the strategy to reduce 
poverty in remote regions and positively valued the development programmes favouring 
vulnerable groups, especially women in situations of poverty. Venezuela recognized the efforts 
and political will of Bangladesh for human rights. 
</p>
<p>282. Qatar noted that Bangladesh seriously endeavoured to promote and protect human rights 
through its Millennium Development Goal plans, especially on education. Bangladesh&#8217;s 
achievements and considerable efforts to address challenges faced in the fields of good 
governance, economic and social development, human rights, poverty alleviation and women&#8217;s </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights were also noted. Qatar also called on OHCHR and other bodies to provide assistance to 
Bangladesh, including technical advice, to address the challenges it faces, including environment 
and climate change that had an impact on human rights. 
</p>
<p>283. Cuba<b> </b>recognized that Bangladesh had accepted the majority of recommendations and 
highlighted the fact that its efforts to implement them were praiseworthy. It noted that these 
efforts had been made in a situation exacerbated by the current international financial and 
economic crisis. It noted that Bangladesh continued to promote education and women&#8217;s rights. 
Cuba recognized the actions implemented to combat poverty and hunger and to meet basic 
needs, such as food, housing, education and health, and encouraged Bangladesh to continue these 
efforts. 
</p>
<p>284. Belarus regretted that it had not been able to speak during the review of Bangladesh. It 
supported a number of the recommendations accepted by Bangladesh, including those on the 
rights of women and children, education and health care and of continuing effective measures to 
eradicate poverty. Belarus expressed satisfaction that Bangladesh had agreed to all the 
recommendations relating to the vulnerable categories of citizens and expressed its conviction 
that Bangladesh would take just as serious an approach to the implementation of the 
recommendations as it did for the preparation of its review. 
</p>
<p>285. Bahrain noted that Bangladesh had taken numerous measures to promote and protect 
human rights, showing that Bangladesh was fully willing to give new impetus to its human rights 
movement and to fully cooperate with United Nations bodies. Bahrain welcomed the fact that 
Bangladesh was combating violence against women, having set up a commission to provide 
medical, legal and police assistance, and homes for women in need. It greatly appreciated 
Bangladesh&#8217;s efforts to end hunger and violence against children in close cooperation with 
non-governmental organizations and civil society. 
</p>
<p>286. China thanked Bangladesh for presenting the efforts made and the achievements reached 
and for its frank account of the difficulties and challenges that it faced. China welcomed the 
active measures taken by Bangladesh to implement the accepted recommendations. China hoped </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that the international community would provide the necessary economic and technical assistance 
to help Bangladesh. China expressed its sincere sympathy to Bangladesh because it had recently 
suffered from violent tropical storms. 
</p>
<p>287. Algeria greatly appreciated the acceptance by Bangladesh of 40 of the 42 
recommendations submitted to it and understood the explanations for the recommendations 
rejected. Algeria commended Bangladesh for its commitments and efforts to address the impact 
of climate change on human rights and for its achievements and commitment to poverty 
reduction, particularly among women, and called on the international community to assist 
Bangladesh in combating poverty. 
</p>
<p>288. Egypt noted that Bangladesh had succeeded in its review process to share its experiences 
and good practices in the elimination of poverty, ensuring food security, attaining the right to 
education and political participation. Egypt encouraged the international community to extend 
assistance to Bangladesh based on its needs assessment for further advancing all human rights. 
Egypt also commended Bangladesh for upholding its sovereign right to implement its laws based 
on the universally agreed human rights norms and standards, especially in relation to the death 
penalty. 
</p>
<p>289. Saudi Arabia noted that Bangladesh intended to continue the efforts under way to promote 
human rights. Saudi Arabia welcomed those made to combat poverty and noted its ambitious 
national programmes for the poorer segments of the population, especially women and children. 
It highlighted the fact that Bangladesh provided clear and transparent information on the 
challenges faced and required support from the international community. 
</p>
<p>290. The United Arab Emirates welcomed the voluntary commitments of Bangladesh made 
during the universal periodic review process. It commended the Government for the efforts made 
in the promotion and protection of human rights, especially those of children. It expressed its 
appreciation to other initiatives taken, including for disabled persons. The United Arab Emirates 
was confident in Bangladesh&#8217;s capacity to face its challenges and hoped that the Council would 
support Bangladesh in its reforms. 
</p>
<p>291. Kazakhstan<b> </b>appreciated Bangladesh&#8217;s consultation with civil society in the preparation of 
the review and encouraged continued consultation in its follow-up and implementation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan would appreciate Bangladesh&#8217;s consideration of acceding to the core treaties to 
which it was not a party. It noted progress in the field of education, particularly for girls, and 
steps for improving the role of women in society. It stressed the need to further strengthen the 
national human rights commission. Kazakhstan expected the finalization of the national 
document on eradication of child labour and encouraged Bangladesh to address problems faced 
by children. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>292. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, in a joint statement, welcomed the 
recent decision of the Government to establish tribunals for the trial of those responsible under 
the International Crimes Act of 1973. It expressed dismay that, despite the announced policy of 
&#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; of extrajudicial killings, such killings had allegedly continued without any 
substantive efforts to investigate or take appropriate action. It reported on cases of violence 
against women since January 2009. It urged the Government to make concrete, measurable and 
time-bound commitments to address these human rights violations, including investigations into 
ongoing and past human rights abuses, including war crimes, extrajudicial killings, torture and 
arbitrary detention, and cases of violence against women, minorities and indigenous people, and 
to provide adequate reparation to victims and families. A call was made for a road map for the 
repeal of discriminatory laws, with particular emphasis on those affecting religious minorities, 
workers and persons with disabilities, as well as juvenile justice and gender-based personal laws. 
It strongly urged the Government to take concrete steps for the full implementation of the peace 
accord in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. 
</p>
<p>293. The Asian Legal Resource Centre<b> </b>welcomed the attention given to the human rights 
situation in Bangladesh thanks to the universal periodic review process. It noted grave violations 
during the review period. Concerning recommendations 10, 20 and 26, the Centre said that 
Bangladesh had promised to address the culture of impunity. It challenged Bangladesh to 
produce evidence of cases in which State agents had been held responsible for torture or 
extrajudicial killings. Bangladesh should repeal the Joint Drive Indemnity Act of 2003 and 
article 46 of the Constitution, which provided blanket impunity to State agents involved in 
violations. Concerning recommendations 11 and 25 and despite claims that the judiciary had </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>been separated from the executive, it noted that the Government had amended its code of 
criminal procedure of 1898 to allow &#8220;executive magistrates&#8221; to take control of any trial they 
deemed fit, which, in practice, was an obstruction to judicial independence. The Centre was 
deeply disappointed that Bangladesh had not accepted recommendation 12 and indicated that 
Bangladesh must ensure visits of three special rapporteurs, as a priority, and extend invitations to 
all other mandates. 
</p>
<p>294. Action Canada for Population and Development requested that Bangladesh incorporate 
into its law enforcement training programme issues of the transgender community. 
Acknowledging Bangladesh&#8217;s acceptance of recommendations 6 and 7 of the universal periodic 
review, it requested that the Government create a special gender and sexual minority cell within 
the national human rights commission. With regard to recommendation 18 on vulnerable groups, 
it called upon Bangladesh to regard men and women attracted to the same sex living in poverty, 
intersex, <i>Hijra</i> and <i>Kothi</i> as special groups and bring them into safety net packages. On 
recommendation 23 on the setting up of a national plan of action against sexual abuse, it 
requested that Bangladesh take into consideration the particular vulnerabilities of intersex and 
&#8220;effeminate&#8221; children, the violence they faced in schools and the traumatic effects this violence 
had on their lives. 
</p>
<p>295. The International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs raised concerns about the situation of 
indigenous peoples in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. It noted that the Government of Bangladesh 
had expressed its sincere intention to implement fully the Chittagong Hill Tracts peace accord. It 
referred to recommendation 34 and the particular importance of resolving the land disputes with 
effectiveness and justice by amending the Land Dispute Commission Act of 2001 and by having 
the land disputes resolution commission resume its work and by initiating a viable process of 
voluntary relocation of government-sponsored Bengali settlers from the Chittagong Hill Tracts. 
It was also important to expedite the withdrawal of hundreds of temporary military camps, and to 
facilitate normal civil administration by transferring all the agreed subjects and functions to the 
Hill District Councils with immediate effect, taking all the necessary steps to ensure the full 
functioning of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Regional Council. 
</p>
<p>296. The International Human Rights Association of American Minorities noted that the 2008 
elections were promising and the establishment of the human rights commission offered some </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>hope. It considered that the continuation and expansion of poverty alleviation programmes would 
allow more people to be lifted out of poverty. Despite progress made in the field of human rights, 
the Association noted that corruption was still commonplace, that torture, extrajudicial killings 
and custodial deaths were still being reported, and that equality between men and women had not 
yet been fully realized. It encouraged Bangladesh to ratify the treaties, as recommended in the 
review report. It spoke of the need to bring to a halt custodial deaths and torture of people in 
custody and to take further steps towards ending all forms of violence against women and 
eradicating child labour. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>297. Bangladesh thanked all participants and conveyed particular thanks to those who had 
expressed their support and solidarity following the recent cyclone that had devastated a part of 
its country. 
</p>
<p>298. Bangladesh believed that, although the universal periodic review was primarily an 
intergovernmental process, civil society had an important role to play. As Bangladesh consulted 
national non-governmental organizations during its preparatory process, it would have been 
happy to hear more voices of national organizations on the outcome of the review, and expressed 
the hope that the Council would try to facilitate participation of mainstream national 
non-governmental organizations in deliberations on country human rights situations. Bangladesh 
stated that it was committed to continue involving its civil society and working with them. 
</p>
<p>299. Bangladesh was a small country, with a vast population, resource-starved and 
disaster-prone, for which reasons fully guaranteeing human rights protection was a daunting 
challenge, so expectations had to be realistic. Although there might be some instances of human 
rights violations, there was an adequate and effective institutional framework to deal with them. 
However, Bangladesh would continue to strive for further improvements. 
</p>
<p>300. Careful note had been taken of all observations, suggestions and comments made, and they 
would be referred faithfully back to the Government, which would give them due consideration 
and take practical measures within the parameters of the Constitution and in line with the 
expectations of its people. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>301. Bangladesh viewed the universal periodic review as a continuous process to improve the 
human rights situation. The second part of the process was starting with the implementation of 
accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>Russian Federation 
</b></p>
<p>302. The review of the Russian Federation was held on 4 February 2009 in conformity with all 
the relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by the Russian Federation in accordance with the 
annex to Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/RUS/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/RUS/2); and 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/RUS/3). 
</p>
<p>303. At its 15th meeting, on 10 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on the Russian Federation (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>304. The outcome of the review comprised the report of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/19), the views of the Russian Federation concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/19/Add.1/Rev.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or  
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>305. The Russian Federation stated that it had evaluated how the many recommendations made 
complied with its existing policies and efforts related to strengthening democratic State 
institutions, developing civil society organizations, ensuring supremacy of the law and the 
respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, family traditions and political equality. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>306. With great satisfaction, it announced that the Government was prepared to fully approve 
approximately 40 clusters of recommendations, amounting to 70 per cent, while expressing 
partial agreement with some of the remaining ones. 
</p>
<p>307. The Russian Federation was particularly prepared to implement recommendations 
regarding the continuation of the policy to protect the liberty and dignity of human beings, 
freedoms of thought, conscience and religion, the realization of economic, social and cultural 
rights, the strengthening of national institutions in the area of human rights, the development of 
international cooperation in this field and ensuring active participation in the Council&#8217;s work. 
Even in the context of the international financial crisis, it did not intend to lower the level of 
social protection for its citizens. 
</p>
<p>308. The Russian Federation would continue its work to accede gradually to international 
human rights instruments, taking into account the financial implications and requirements for 
changes in law and practice. It intended to speed up work to ratify the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities. The State Council for the Disabled had adopted a set of decisions to 
prepare for the ratification of the Convention and to create an accessible environment. This 
included modernizing the education system for disabled children to help them integrate into 
society. 
</p>
<p>309. The delegation noted that Russia regularly hosted Council special procedures. After three 
visits in recent years, it planned to organize another two in 2009. 
</p>
<p>310. On combating manifestations of extremism and racism, it stated that the majority of 
recommendations were useful and would be taken into account in practical work. There was no 
need, however, to establish new organizational structures to achieve this goal, as existing State 
bodies, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, would be used. 
</p>
<p>311. Judicial reform would continue, aiming to strengthen confidence in the administration of 
justice, enhance the quality and effectiveness of judicial review of court cases and the level of 
enforcement of decisions, and ensure the independence of judges. A new draft of the federal law 
on the administration of justice was being prepared, together with the development and 
implementation of procedures for prejudicial consideration of disputes. The State Duma of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Federal Assembly had approved the introduction of amendments in the federal constitutional law 
on the country&#8217;s judicial system, which provided, particularly, for the establishment of juvenile 
courts. 
</p>
<p>312. Further steps were planned to develop qualitatively the penitentiary system and improve 
conditions of detention. The President had issued an order to amend laws providing for 
alternative criminal sanctions that did not involve the deprivation of liberty. 
</p>
<p>313. The Russian Federation accepted all recommendations relating to interaction with 
non-governmental organizations and the protection of human rights defenders and journalists. It 
said the Presidential Council for its promotion of the development of civil society institutes and 
for human rights would continue to dialogue constructively with non-governmental 
organizations to progressively develop legislation governing their activities, taking into account 
international standards. Possible legal amendments were being considered to regulate matters of, 
inter alia, taxation of non-governmental organizations and their interaction with State bodies. 
</p>
<p>314. Further measures were also envisioned to ensure the independence of mass media outlets 
and to develop a legal basis for their operation, particularly given the development of new 
technologies. A draft federal law had already been adopted in the first reading on guarantees of 
equality for parliamentary parties in reporting by State mass media. 
</p>
<p>315. The delegation stated that the Russian Federation, as one of the most multi-ethnic of States, 
would continue to protect the rights and freedoms of minorities and ethnic groups actively. 
Recommendations would be duly taken into account in the realization of concept papers for State 
national policy, national educational policy and the plan to implement priority areas in the 
general education system. It would continue to monitor the issue of mother-tongue education. 
</p>
<p>316. The Russian Federation would also continue to expand and strengthen international 
cooperation in human rights promotion and protection, developing non-confrontational dialogue 
on an equal footing in the interests of all States Members of the Council and in constructive 
interaction with OHCHR. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>317. Pakistan welcomed the Russian Federation&#8217;s detailed comments, prepared through wide 
consultation with stakeholders, reflecting the importance it attached to the universal periodic 
review from the very beginning. Pakistan was encouraged by Russia&#8217;s acceptance of the majority 
of the recommendations, including those made by Pakistan; this reflected Russia&#8217;s constructive 
attitude to human rights promotion and protection. It noted steps enumerated to reform different 
sectors, particularly the justice system. It wished Russia well in implementing the 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>318. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) commended the Russian Federation for its inclusive 
approach to the universal periodic review, including the wide consultations carried out in 
preparing the national report, which reflected the contributions of all sectors of society. It 
welcomed the acceptance of recommendations and replies, particularly to a question asked by 
Venezuela regarding the implementation, scope and expected results of the national priority plan 
in the area of health. It commended the country for its reduction in child mortality and the 
expansion of immunization campaigns. Venezuela recognized the efforts of the 
Russian Federation and its resolve to promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>319. Qatar appreciated the Russian Federation&#8217;s openness towards the review process and its 
acceptance of recommendations made by Qatar, including that of redoubling efforts to improve 
the condition of detainees in prisons and to ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. It 
highlighted Russia&#8217;s determination to combat racial discrimination and intolerance. Qatar 
encouraged Russia to implement the recommendations made and wished it full success in 
promoting human rights. 
</p>
<p>320. Algeria noted the Russian Federation&#8217;s favourable response to 70 per cent of the 
recommendations, and its efforts to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related 
intolerance at the national and international levels through the role it played in the success of the 
Durban Review Conference. It noted Russia&#8217;s determination to continue improving the situation </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of detainees and children without parental care. Algeria had encouraged Russia to continue 
efforts to deepen international cooperation in the area of human rights by promoting constructive 
dialogue in the interest of all regional groups within the Council. 
</p>
<p>321. Uzbekistan welcomed the Russian Federation&#8217;s constructive approach to the universal 
periodic review and its broad spectrum of work to promote and protect human rights and 
fundamental freedoms. It also welcomed Russia&#8217;s cooperation with the Council, the treaty bodies 
and other international organizations, as well as its consistent measures relating to human rights 
promotion and protection, allowing its effective and transparent participation in every stage of 
the review process. It noted with satisfaction Russia&#8217;s achievements in the protection of 
women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, social welfare, health care, right to education, freedom of religion 
and conscience and others. 
</p>
<p>322. Cuba commended the Russian Federation for its efforts, successes and clearly defined 
objectives and priorities in promoting and protecting human rights. It welcomed its acceptance of 
the recommendations made by Cuba, noting that the right to health had been strengthened 
through the implementation of a national plan and that the country guaranteed accessibility and 
the free provision of pre-school education, general basic education and vocational training in 
State and municipal education centres. Cuba commended Russia for its efforts to combat poverty 
in the framework of the socio-economic development programme and the results achieved. Cuba 
encouraged full implementation of the accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p>323. Belarus welcomed the constructive and responsible attitude of the Russian Federation to 
the universal periodic review. Belarus had recommended that, despite the economic crisis, 
Russia should continue implementing programmes to protect economic and social rights. It noted 
with satisfaction that expenditure for the development of human rights institutions was not to be 
reduced, and that Russia was actively implementing its recommendations at the national and 
regional levels, particularly in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Noting Russia&#8217;s active 
participation in the work of the international academic centre in Minsk regarding migration and 
human trafficking, it counted on further effective work in these areas. 
</p>
<p>324. Sri Lanka<b> </b>paid tribute to the Russian Federation&#8217;s role in the institutional-building process 
of the Council, the universal periodic review and the Durban Review Conference. It recognized </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Russia&#8217;s historic contribution to the area of human rights and the difficulties it had faced. 
Sri Lanka commended the Russian Federation for safeguarding human rights, strengthening the 
individual, strengthening society while not weakening the State or the nation. 
</p>
<p>325. China noted the Russian Federation&#8217;s acceptance of the majority of recommendations and 
commended it for its constructive, open, practical and responsible attitude. The measures on the 
protection of the rights of disabled persons and on judicial reform were inspiring. China believed 
that Russia&#8217;s next review report would be even more impressive and, through concrete actions, 
would demonstrate its solemn commitment to human rights. 
</p>
<p>326. Egypt commended the Russian Federation for its achievements on the path of 
consolidating its democratic system, while overcoming the economic and social challenges to the 
establishment of stability and prosperity. It expressed appreciation for Russia&#8217;s efforts to achieve 
greater social security and the overall effective realization of all economic, social and cultural 
rights through the integration of a human rights approach in its national strategies and 
programmes. Egypt commended Russia for its constructive approach and openness throughout 
the review process, demonstrating its commitment to cooperating with the Council and the other 
human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>327. Saudi Arabia commended the Russian Federation for its acceptance of the majority of 
recommendations and paid tribute to its efforts to implement them. It highlighted Russia&#8217;s 
political will to deal positively with human rights mechanisms and to promote and protect human 
rights effectively by upgrading laws and establishing mechanisms. It commended Russia&#8217;s 
determination to implement further judicial reforms and strengthen anti-corruption mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>328. The United Arab Emirates valued the responsible approach of the Russian Federation in 
the preparation of its national report and during the interactive dialogue, which was held in 
accordance with relevant General Assembly and Council resolutions. It expressed satisfaction for 
Russia&#8217;s human rights achievements. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>329. The Indian Council of South America<b> </b>commended the Russian Federation for its continued 
reforms in its transition to a democratic State, and its contribution during the Durban Review 
Conference. It urged Russia to continue combating racism, addressing extremism and improving </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the integrity of its justice system. It noted Russia&#8217;s dialogue with indigenous peoples to address 
their rights and concerns. It called for the implementation of the recommendations of the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, improving the situation of indigenous 
peoples and ensuring full respect for their rights. Noting Russia&#8217;s abstention on the Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it asked that it work towards accepting its provisions, 
allowing indigenous peoples in Russia to enjoy all the rights therein. 
</p>
<p>330. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme noted the rise of ethnic tensions, 
racial hatred and violence, the proliferation of young neo-Nazi groups and racist and xenophobic 
declarations in the media and on the Internet, including by public officials. It urged the 
implementation of the recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination. It called for a lasting political solution to the conflict in Chechnya and 
Southern Ossetia. Democracy, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and the rule of law 
had to be fully respected in accordance with Russia&#8217;s international commitments. It commended 
Russia for its contribution to the Council and to Durban and encouraged it to accept the visits of 
special procedures mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>331. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network welcomed the acceptance of recommendations 
on sexual orientation and gender identity. It noted, however, numerous restrictions against 
lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people with regard to freedom of expression and 
peaceful assembly. Peaceful events to promote respect for such people had been banned and 
people subjected to arrests and violence. It urged the Government to ensure the holding of such 
events with adequate police protection. Noting a rise in hate crimes, it said that discrimination on 
the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity should be prohibited, that such bias should 
be an aggravating factor, and that perpetrators should be vigorously prosecuted and punished. 
Noting Russia&#8217;s indication that training was provided to prison guards and law enforcement 
officials on the needs of minorities, including on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender 
identity, it sought elaboration and clarification. 
</p>
<p>332. Human Rights Watch noted the many concerns about the hostile and deteriorating 
environment for civil society and the restrictive 2006 law on non-governmental organizations, 
providing for excessive Government interference and unreasonable bureaucratic requirements. It 
had hoped that Russia would commit to specific steps to ensure civil society operation without </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>undue Government interference, particularly since President Medvedev had initiated a process to 
review the law. It urged the Government to revise the law substantially and to condemn attacks 
on human rights defenders and journalists, ensuring that such crimes were investigated and 
prosecuted. Ongoing abuses in Chechnya and the broader North Caucasus and persisting 
impunity were other areas of concern. Russia was urged by its peers to establish meaningful 
accountability mechanisms and to implement fully the more than 100 rulings of the European 
Court finding it responsible for serious violations in Chechnya, and to ratify Protocol No. 14 to 
the European Convention. It regretted that the concerns had been ignored. Russia&#8217;s failure to 
grant access to special procedures, particularly on torture, was also raised. Noting that 10 special 
procedures had pending requests to visit Russia, it regretted Russia&#8217;s decision not to issue 
invitations and agree on dates. 
</p>
<p>333. The International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs highlighted the situation of 40 ethnic 
groups in the North, Siberia and the Far East of Russia, which traditionally use and inhabit about 
two thirds of Russia&#8217;s land mass, where most natural resources such as oil, gas, timber, gold and 
diamonds, are extracted. It noted the concern of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination about their situation and its recommendations that Russia seek their consent and 
give primary consideration to their special needs prior to granting licences to private companies, 
and to ensure their priority rights to territories of traditional nature use and to natural resources. 
The Committee had urged Russia to withdraw support for the Evenkiiskaya dam, which would 
displace thousands of indigenous Evenks, and from other similar large-scale projects. 
Welcoming the announcement of a national plan to implement the recommendations and that a 
first interim report would be presented by end of year, the Work Group hoped that the plan 
would address the above-mentioned concerns, noting, however, that the indigenous umbrella 
organization, RAIPON, had no information on the existence of such a plan. The Work Group 
sought clarification on the status and timeline of the document, its title and availability. It urged 
actively consultation with and participation of indigenous organizations in the implementation 
process. 
</p>
<p>334. The International Commission of Jurists regretted Russia&#8217;s last-minute responses to the 
recommendations, but called for their prompt and effective implementation. It urged effective 
investigation, accountability and redress for human rights violations, including acts of torture, 
ill-treatment, secret and other arbitrary detention and enforced disappearances in the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>North Caucasus. The lack of effective investigation of the law enforcement response to the 
Dubrovka theatre siege and the attack on Beslan School No. 1 should be urgently addressed. It 
expressed serious concern at the harassment of lawyers, journalists and other human rights 
defenders, and particularly at the murder, in January 2009, of Stanislav Markelov and 
Anastasia Baburova. These should be promptly and effectively investigated. It also cited threats 
and attacks against applicants to the European Court of Human Rights, particularly those from 
the North Caucasus. The Government should prevent such obstruction of applications to the 
Court against victims, their families and legal representatives. It regretted that the threat to the 
independence of lawyers posed by the proposed amendments to the 2002 federal law on legal 
practice and the bar, which would grant the State registration agency power to initiate court 
action to remove lawyers&#8217; licences, had not been addressed. It called for the withdrawal of the 
amendments. Also unaddressed was the practice of informal transfers of suspects from Russia to 
other members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, contrary to the non-refoulement 
obligation. The Commission asked Russia to invite the special rapporteurs on torture, executions, 
independence of judges and lawyers and the Working Group on enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>335. The Russian Federation noted that accession to the second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights concerning the abolition of the death penalty 
would depend on the prevailing view in Russian society on abolition. It noted, however, that the 
death penalty had been de facto abolished since August 1996 and, since 1999, all prior death 
sentences had been commuted to life or 25 years of imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>336. It said that the ratification of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights 
of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families required an in-depth study to determine 
the concordance of specific provisions with Russian legislation. With regard to the ratification of 
ILO Convention No. 169, it stated that current legislation in Russia on indigenous peoples was 
more progressive and better reflected the particular characteristics of the local situation. 
</p>
<p>337. The question of ratifying the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court was being 
considered, guided by the notion that the decision to accede was the prerogative of the State and 
made in the State&#8217;s own interests. Many factors would be considered, including the initial results 
of the activities of the Court and outcome of the work to define the crime of aggression.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>338. A draft law on the ratification of Protocol No. 14 was under consideration by the State 
Duma of the Federal Assembly. The preparation for ratification of the European Charter for 
Regional or Minority Languages was being carried out in the framework of a State inter-agency 
working group that, together with the Charter secretariat, aimed to find modalities for the 
implementation of the Charter that would take into account Russian realities and the unique 
cultural and linguistic diversity of its people.  
</p>
<p>339. The delegation thanked the non-governmental organizations for their comments and 
referred to two meetings with civil society representatives held in the Ministry of Justice and 
covered by the mass media. After the universal periodic review, Russia planned to convene a 
working group on the preparation and presentation of the national report and on further steps for 
implementing the recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>340. Prior to the adoption of the outcome, Germany, on behalf of the European Union, stated 
that it was in favour of the adoption of the outcome of the review of the Russian Federation on 
the understanding that the formulation in paragraph 86 of the Working Group report would mean 
that the recommendations referred to in paragraph 54 did not enjoy Russia&#8217;s support. It 
considered the assessment contained in paragraph 86 factually incorrect, but respected the 
freedom of the Russian Federation to reject any recommendation made during the interactive 
dialogue of the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>341. The Russian Federation was of the view that it was not appropriate to discuss substantive 
issues at this stage and that its position had been clearly set forth in paragraph 86 of the Working 
Group report, which had been adopted by consensus. 
</p>
<p><b>Nigeria 
</b></p>
<p>342. The review of Nigeria was held on 9 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Nigeria in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/NGA/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/NGA/2); </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/NGA/3). 
</p>
<p>343. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Nigeria (see sect. C below). 
</p>
<p>344. The outcome of the review on Nigeria comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/26), the views of Nigeria concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or  
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>345. The head of delegation recalled that Nigeria had engaged in the universal periodic review 
process with the utmost openness and transparency and had benefited immensely from all views 
expressed on that occasion. Nigeria stated that the 32 clusters of recommendations made by the 
Working Group had been carefully considered with the active collaboration of relevant 
stakeholders. In February 2009, Nigeria had already accepted 30 of the 32 clusters of 
recommendations and had taken note of recommendations 12 and 13. The implementation of 
some recommendations was already ongoing before they were made and new legislation was 
ongoing. Although Nigeria was determined to work assiduously towards the implementation of 
the recommendations, the delegation stated that constitutional and legal implications had 
prevented Nigeria from giving immediate effect to some of them. 
</p>
<p>346. A substantial number of recommendations were, however, being implemented, such as the 
one on accession to human rights instruments, as demonstrated by the signature in January 2009 
of a series of international instruments by the President of Nigeria and the recent ratification 
through a bill passed by the National Assembly on the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>347. Nigeria recalled that its Constitution protected minority rights, in addition to the 
comprehensive application of the constitutional federal character principle following the 
establishment of the federal character commission regarding the distribution of national </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>resources and political appointments among the six geopolitical zones. The delegation stated that 
Nigeria was proud of its great ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. All Nigerian languages 
were spoken in Government-owned broadcast stations, and private and public initiatives 
promoted cultural and linguistic rights without any constraints. 
</p>
<p>348. Nigeria also continuously addressed the specific challenges of certain areas of the country 
with greater determination, such as in the Delta Region, with several actions such as the 
establishment of the Ministry for Niger Delta in 2009. Recently, Nigeria had offered amnesty to 
all involved in agitational activities in the Niger Delta in the logic of peace and in furtherance of 
dialogue. 
</p>
<p>349. The delegation stated that economic, social and cultural rights had been included in the 
Constitution and that successive Governments had taken initiatives aimed at their realization, 
such as the establishment and strengthening of pro-poor initiatives at the national, State and local 
levels. Nigeria had also strengthened its national poverty eradication programme aimed at 
creating jobs, with a particular focus on the rural areas. 
</p>
<p>350. In addition to a self-imposed moratorium on executions, Nigeria had established a national 
committee on the review of the death penalty, whose outcome would determine the 
Government&#8217;s decision on this issue, subject to due process of the amendment to the 1999 
Constitution of Nigeria. 
</p>
<p>351. The delegation stated that the universal periodic review would, in the years to come, be a 
very effective mechanism for the enhancement of human rights. Nigeria considered its recent 
re-election in the Council as an indication of the premium that the international community had 
placed on Nigeria&#8217;s commitment. Nigeria was determined to honour all its commitments and 
asked for the support of the Council and OHCHR. Lastly, Nigeria paid tribute to the Council for 
electing a Nigerian President and for the support given to him, and ensured it would continue to 
cooperate and support the Council. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the  
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>352. Pakistan indicated that Nigeria&#8217;s commitment to promote and protect human rights was 
explicit both by the steps taken at home and the active role played by the delegation in Geneva. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Pakistan commended Nigeria for its determination to institutionalize and enhance the enjoyment 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms. It took particular note of the recent ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and of other 
planned activities under consideration of the Parliament, including the review of the status and 
role of the national human rights commission in accordance with the Paris Principles, the 
restructuring of the administration of justice and police and prison reforms. 
</p>
<p>353. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) noted that Nigeria had given a clear demonstration of 
its commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights by openly cooperating during 
the universal periodic review. It welcomed its constructive approach to the review by providing 
answers to questions raised, including those asked by Venezuela on the extent of the latest 
education programmes and its short-term expectations. Venezuela highlighted Nigeria&#8217;s 
important and valuable efforts for the effective promotion and protection of human rights, and 
the Government&#8217;s commitment and political will to achieve the objectives set out in this field. 
</p>
<p>354. Qatar highly appreciated Nigeria&#8217;s responses to most of the review recommendations and 
the measures taken to translate them into tangible accomplishments on the ground. Nigeria had 
enhanced its efforts to disseminate a human rights culture and to combat human trafficking and 
corruption in order to achieve social and economic development. Qatar called on the competent 
United Nations institutions to provide Nigeria with the support it may need in its efforts to 
promote and protect human rights. 
</p>
<p>355. Belarus noted that, during the review, it had made a number of recommendations aimed at 
further promoting important categories of human rights. In this regard, Belarus had 
recommended that Nigeria continue its efforts to combat trafficking in persons, in particular 
women and children; take measures for the further development of primary and secondary 
education; and foster the strengthening of the national health system. Belarus noted with 
satisfaction that Nigeria had accepted these recommendations and indicated its willingness to 
implement them. Nigeria had expressed its resolve to implement a whole range of 
recommendations aimed at strengthening the national system for the promotion and protection of 
human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>356. China indicated that, during the review process, Nigeria had adopted a positive and open 
posture in presenting its efforts and achievements in promoting and protecting human rights, and 
had spoken frankly about the difficulties and challenges it faced in this regard. It appreciated the 
fact that Nigeria had actively implemented the recommendations it had accepted and hoped that 
it would make even greater progress in ensuring judicial independence, improving education 
quality and realizing the Millennium Development Goals. It was convinced that Nigeria would 
continue to overcome its difficulties and make progress in the field of human rights, and 
appealed to the international community to show full understanding for the practical difficulties 
and challenges facing Nigeria, and to support the Government in its efforts to protect human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>357. Algeria stressed Nigeria&#8217;s commitment to promote and protect women&#8217;s rights and human 
rights in general, which was reflected not only domestically through the steps it had taken or 
intended to take to implement accepted recommendations, but also through its constructive role 
in the Council. Algeria was encouraged by Nigeria&#8217;s acceptance of its recommendation to 
continue incorporating the provisions of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women into its domestic law. Algeria noted Nigeria&#8217;s will to improve its 
performance in the fields of education, health and poverty reduction, which reflected its 
determination to fulfil human rights. It referred to Nigeria&#8217;s respect of human rights in access to 
justice and law enforcement. Algeria added that possibilities in terms of technical assistance in 
these areas were significant. 
</p>
<p>358. Egypt highlighted the important progress made by Nigeria towards the attainment of the 
Millennium Development Goals and the priority given to the promotion and protection of human 
rights. It referred to the national plan of action and the seven-point agenda defining the 
Government&#8217;s priorities in several areas, including the development of human capital, food 
security, functional education and the rule of law. Egypt welcomed Nigeria&#8217;s cooperation with 
OHCHR and the international human rights mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>359. Saudi Arabia noted that Nigeria had voluntarily committed to the recommendations made. 
It said that the review was an opportunity for Nigeria to conduct broad national consultations 
regarding human rights issues, which reaffirmed the positive interaction of the country with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>international human rights mechanisms. It commended Nigeria for the important legal and 
institutional strides taken by Nigeria to promote and protect human rights even further. 
</p>
<p>360. Kazakhstan believed that the review was a good opportunity for Nigeria to 
comprehensively assess the human rights situation in the country. During the interactive 
</p>
<p>dialogue, Kazakhstan had learned of the challenges facing Nigeria with regard to preserving 
social coherence and in areas such as the rights of children, women and vulnerable groups, as 
well as education and health. It had also learned about the Government&#8217;s commitments and plans 
to address these challenges. Kazakhstan greatly appreciated the Government&#8217;s acceptance of 
most of the recommendations and believed that the ones that had not been accepted would be 
taken into account. 
</p>
<p>361. Bahrain commended the positive steps taken by Nigeria to implement a number of review 
recommendations. The universal periodic review had demonstrated the importance that Nigeria 
attached to the promotion and protection of human rights at the internal and international levels. 
Bahrain welcomed Nigeria&#8217;s initiatives, taken in cooperation with different stakeholders, to 
design, implement and assess programmes aiming at saving, rehabilitating and integrating 
victims of human trafficking. Bahrain commended Nigeria for its efforts to fight all forms of 
human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>362. The United States of America welcomed the adoption of Nigeria&#8217;s national plan of action 
on the promotion and protection of human rights. It noted that torture and abuse of detainees by 
security forces, lengthy pre-trial detention and poor prison conditions were severe problems in 
Nigeria. It supported the recommendations that Nigeria make efforts to end impunity for the 
perpetrators of human rights violations. It also supported the recommendations to ensure the 
independence of the national human rights commission. The United States of America hoped 
that the recently created Ministry for the Niger Delta had sufficient capacity and Government 
support to address the problems of violence and crime in the region. It supported the 
recommendation that consultations with minority groups in the Delta be undertaken. 
</p>
<p>363. Senegal welcomed Nigeria&#8217;s continued efforts to promote and protect human rights. 
Despite important progress, the authorities had reaffirmed their commitment to pursue reforms to 
improve the human rights situation in the country. Senegal welcomed the adoption of the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>national plan of action for the promotion and protection of human rights, the implementation of 
which would be a clear opportunity to make further significant progress. It noted that the 
attainment of the objectives set out in the plan and the implementation of the review 
recommendations would be easier if Nigeria could benefit from the support of the international 
community. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>364. Amnesty International welcomed Nigeria&#8217;s engagement with the universal periodic review 
and its commitment to cooperate in every aspect of the work of the Council. It also welcomed 
Nigeria&#8217;s statement according to which it continued to exercise a self-imposed moratorium on 
the death penalty, but expressed concern at recent legislative amendments in several States in 
Nigeria to extend the scope of the death penalty to include crimes related to kidnapping. 
Amnesty International welcomed the announcement by Nigeria to support most of the review 
recommendations and urged early implementation in particular of recommendations related to 
women&#8217;s rights; access to justice; the fight against impunity; discrimination on the basis of 
gender and sexual orientation; the independence of the human rights commission; and on a 
formal moratorium on the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>365. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network stated that the delegation of Nigeria had recalled 
that the rights enshrined in the Constitution applied to all people, including those who considered 
themselves gay. It referred to the proposed same sex prohibition bill of 2006 and the same 
gender prohibition bill of 2008, noting that, if approved, the bill would seriously restrict essential 
freedoms and HIV-prevention services, as well as the activities of human rights defenders. 
Reference was also made to harassment and publications in the media inciting and promoting 
hatred against sexual minorities. The Network asked Nigeria to repeal criminal provisions 
against consensual same-sex conduct, and to ensure that the human rights of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender individuals and human rights defenders were not violated; to reject any 
attempt to create discriminatory new laws; and eliminate all existing legislation that 
discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</p>
<p>366. While referring to claims by Nigeria reflected in paragraph 6 of the Working Group report, 
Conectas Direitos Humanos believed that Nigeria had failed to implement reforms that did not 
require substantial financial resources or additional capacity, citing as an example the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recommendations in paragraphs 103-1 and 103-8. Conectas regretted that there were no 
recommendations related to the right of housing, noting that Nigeria had failed to agree to a visit 
by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing. Conectas stressed that, under international law, a 
country&#8217;s domestic regime was no excuse for failure to implement its international obligations. 
</p>
<p>367. While taking note of the commitments made by Nigeria concerning the implementation of 
the universal periodic review recommendations, Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs 
de la personne humaine noted the numerous difficulties involved in exercising human rights in 
Nigeria. It expressed concern about interreligious violence and the security problems in the 
Niger Delta. 
</p>
<p>368. Interfaith International, in a joint statement with the Al-Hakim Foundation, indicated that 
the acceptance of 30 recommendations had to be given effect through the adoption of political 
and legislative measures. It expressed its hope that Nigeria would take the necessary measures to 
rehabilitate the victims from the Ogoni minority. It encouraged Nigeria to establish a national 
dialogue framework for the development of a code of conduct and ethics for transnational 
corporations, and also urged it to foster intercultural and interreligious dialogue to combat 
religious intolerance against women in the northern provinces, as well as inter-community 
</p>
<p>violence. 
</p>
<p>369. The International Human Rights Association of American Minorities congratulated Nigeria 
on the establishment of its national human rights commission, and expressed the hope that the 
authorities would do their utmost to ensure that the commission was independent, free and 
impartial. It also called on Nigeria to end as soon as possible the use of the death penalty. The 
Association also noted the worrying trend towards incarcerating suspected criminals without 
charge or trial, and indicated that it was essential that access to justice be granted to all in 
Nigeria. It indicated that there was significant evidence that extrajudicial executions and torture 
were still being carried out by the security forces, and called on Nigeria to implement 
procedures, and when necessary legislation, to put an end to those practices. 
</p>
<p>370. The Arab Commission for Human Rights invited Nigeria to accept and implement 
recommendation 1 relating to the ratification of international instruments, in particular those 
related to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the International </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It also invited Nigeria to implement 
recommendation 14 with regard to the adoption of legislation to address extrajudicial executions 
and acts of torture committed by the police. The Commission encouraged it to accept and 
implement recommendation 24 on the fight against corruption. Nigeria should pay special 
attention to the follow-up mechanism and submit reports on progress made in the 
implementation of recommendations and voluntary commitments, with the participation of civil 
society, to the Council at its fourteenth regular session. 
</p>
<p>371. The Islamic Human Rights Commission made reference to recommendations 30 and 31, 
and indicated that the policies of Nigeria, as well as many trials, were not compatible with the 
standards of fairness and due process, including those defined by Sharia law and the Nigerian 
Constitution itself. The Commission expressed concern at the current general practice adopted by 
Nigeria in Sokoto, noting that it was not proportionate to their stated aim and position that 
Nigeria should launch a transparent, comprehensive and impartial inquiry and uphold the 
principle of fair trial, which should not contravene Nigeria&#8217;s international obligations to 
guarantee individuals the right to equality before the law. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>372. The delegation highlighted the fact that the National Assembly was supportive and 
committed to the reform initiatives undertaken by the Government to improve the protection and 
promotion of human rights, and would adopt the legislation backing them. 
</p>
<p>373. The delegation stated that its commitments to the promotion and protection of human 
rights were irreversible. In Nigeria, individuals, institutions and public and private entities, as 
well as the State itself, were subject to publicly promulgated laws. These laws were equally 
enforced, independently adjudicated and consistent with international human rights standards. 
Nigeria commended all delegations for their constructive engagement in the universal periodic 
review process and was looking forward for its next review. 
</p>
<p><b>Cameroon 
</b></p>
<p>374. The review of Cameroon was held on 5 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Cameroon in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/CMR/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/CMR/2); 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/CMR/3). 
</p>
<p>375. At its 16th meeting, on 10 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Cameroon (see sect. C below). 
</p>
<p>376. The outcome of the review on Cameroon comprised the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/21), the views of Cameroon concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/21/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or  
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>377. The Minister Delegate at the Ministry of External Relations in charge of Commonwealth 
</p>
<p>Affairs expressed the profound gratitude of the people and Government of Cameroon to all 
countries that supported the renewal of their mandate in the Council. The Minister Delegate 
reaffirmed the commitment of Cameroon during the election and reiterated its determination to 
work further in the interest and advancement of human rights in Cameroon through, inter alia, 
the implementation of the road map that had been given to the country. 
</p>
<p>378. The Minister Delegate renewed the appreciation of Cameroon for the effective start and the 
conduct of the universal periodic review mechanism, which was in line with Cameroon&#8217;s view of 
the Council, which must constantly be guided by the quest for objectivity, cooperation and 
constructive dialogue.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>379. The Minister Delegate expressed gratitude to all countries that assisted Cameroon 
on 5 February 2009 during the universal periodic review. He indicated that their observations, 
comments and recommendations would continue to guide the Government to pursue its action to 
promote and protect all human rights in Cameroon.  
</p>
<p>380. In the course of Working Group discussions, 54 recommendations were made, 40 of which 
Cameroon accepted, 7 it rejected, while 7 were subject to further consideration, leading 
Cameroon to accept 1, reject 2 and continue consideration of 4. A total of 41 recommendations 
received the consent of the Cameroonian authorities. The Government would work within the 
limit of available possibilities and with the cooperation of the international community to 
implement them. The four recommendations under consideration related to the ratification of the 
Treaty of Rome establishing the International Criminal Court, the adoption of a law on specific 
cases of HIV/AIDS, the adoption of suspensive effects to decisions on deportation and measures 
related to non-refoulement, and accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture. 
</p>
<p>381. The Minister Delegate indicated that nine recommendations had not been supported by 
Cameroon. With regard to the decriminalization of homosexuality, he stated that the penalization 
of homosexuality was not, according to the legal order of Cameroon, contrary to the provisions 
of article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 26 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Homosexual persons were not denied their rights or any 
benefit because of their presumed sexual orientation. The practice was, however, contrary to 
both prevailing legislation and what the democratic society of Cameroon still regarded as 
immoral. 
</p>
<p>382. The Minister Delegate also underlined the fact that the legislation of Cameroon was in line 
with the relevant provisions of articles 26 (2) of the Universal Declaration and article 29 (7) of 
the African Charter on Human and People&#8217;s Rights, which constitute guarantees that can be 
invoked by every democratic society according to its moral characteristics. On the one hand, 
these provisions allowed the State to restrict a right or freedom in order to satisfy the just 
requirements of morality, public order and general well-being in a democratic society, and on the 
other required individuals to ensure in their own relations with society the preservation and 
strengthening of positive African cultural values. For the culture of Cameroon, homosexuality </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>was not permitted by society; the legislator had merely ensured the affirmation of this 
sociological value. The Government, however, ensured that all rights of citizens were respected 
without any discrimination. 
</p>
<p>383. Cameroon welcomed the creation of an independent monitoring body to organize elections 
(ELECAM), which represented an important step forward in its democratic process and was an 
additional guarantee of transparency and fairness in electoral processes. The composition of the 
body was consistent with the decree that established it, according to which its members were to 
be persons of varied ethnic, cultural and professional origin and known for their independence, 
moral rectitude, intellectual honesty, patriotism, neutrality and impartiality. The President of the 
Republic had taken steps to guarantee the full and complete independence of the body.  
</p>
<p>384. At the current stage of the universal periodic review process, Cameroon would like to be 
able to count on international cooperation, convinced that, with the support of the United Nations 
and other partners, it would succeed in implementing in a satisfactory manner the 
recommendations that had been accepted with a view to improving the general situation of 
human rights in Cameroon. Cameroon was aware that the promotion and protection of human 
rights were important not only for development but were also a factor essential to stability and 
peace in society. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>385. Algeria thanked Cameroon for the additional information given on the follow-up to 
recommendations made at the fourth session of the universal periodic review. It welcomed 
Cameroon&#8217;s decision to accede to the Optional Protocols to the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child and to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families, expressing the hope that this example would be followed by 
other countries, in particular, developed countries. Algeria also noted Cameroon&#8217;s intention to 
continue its efforts to ensure the conformity of conditions of detention to international standards 
and to increase the effectiveness of the plan of action to improve the judicial system to combat 
corruption in a more effective manner. Lastly, Algeria reiterated its invitation to the international 
community, in particular OHCHR, to provide the technical assistance requested by Cameroon to 
those ends. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>386. Belarus noted the constructive and responsible approach shown by Cameroon during the 
universal periodic review. During the review, Belarus had recommended measures to further 
protect and promote social and economic rights of citizens, improve the quality of education and 
strengthen the independence and authority of the judicial system, and noted with satisfaction that 
Cameroon had agreed to these and other recommendations. It commended Cameroon&#8217;s intention 
to accede to other human rights instruments. Belarus supported the recommendation to improve 
national legislation in the area of women&#8217;s rights and ensuring gender equality. 
</p>
<p>387. China indicated that it had been honoured to be one of the Troika members for the review 
of Cameroon. It expressed its great appreciation for Cameroon&#8217;s comprehensive and constructive 
dialogue with Council Members. It noted that Cameroon had given a detailed reply to the various 
issues raised during the deliberations, including questions asked by China. China was confident 
that, with the support of the international community, Cameroon would overcome its difficulties 
and make new progress in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>388. Morocco thanked Cameroon for its constructive engagement in the universal periodic 
review, its efforts in the field of human rights and the measures taken in that regard. Morocco 
also congratulated Cameroon on having accepted the majority of recommendations made, 
especially the one related to difficulties encountered in the reform of the penal code. Morocco 
reiterated its appeal to make sure that all necessary assistance is given to Cameroon in reforming 
its penal code, including financial and human resources to support the country in its tasks. Any 
assistance should be given in close cooperation with the country in order to guarantee the best 
result possible. Lastly, Morocco encouraged Cameroon to continue its efforts in the 
implementation of the recommendations that it had accepted and to keep the Council informed 
with regard to their implementation. 
</p>
<p>389. Senegal noted that Cameroon had accepted the majority of the recommendations made and 
appreciated its commitment to continue its efforts on the promotion and protection of human 
rights, in particular the establishment of a national commission on human rights and freedom, as 
well as the launching of a ratification process for several international instruments in human 
</p>
<p>rights. Senegal encouraged Cameroon to implement the different recommendations that it had 
accepted and called upon the international community to provide any assistance needed. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>390. Nigeria commended Cameroon for its open and constructive spirit with which it 
approached the review process and hoped that it would implement the recommendations made. It 
appreciated Cameroon&#8217;s acceptance of its recommendations, which were aimed at strengthening 
measures and mechanisms in the administration of justice, investments in prison infrastructure 
and the overall enjoyment of civil and political rights. 
</p>
<p>391. The United States of America appreciated the dedication to human rights that the 
Government of Cameroon had demonstrated during the universal periodic review process and 
hoped that this dedication would be translated into action. The United States shared the concerns 
regarding the independence of ELECAM, including the lack of representatives of the opposition 
appointed to it, and reports of vote rigging in the last election. It supported the recommendation 
that Cameroon should take measures to ensure the independence of ELECAM. It also joined the 
concerns expressed by a number of delegations regarding the independence of the press, 
including the closure of media outlets and the imprisonments of journalists. It encouraged the 
Government to accept and speedily implement the recommendation of a special law that would 
take into consideration the land rights of the &#8220;pygmy&#8221; communities. 
</p>
<p>392. Djibouti congratulated Cameroon on having accepted 75 per cent of the recommendations 
made, which very clearly showed the attachment of the country to the universal principles of 
human rights. Djibouti called upon the international community to provide Cameroon with all 
the necessary aid and technical assistance for it to implement the different recommendations. 
Djibouti encouraged Cameroon to continue to give full attention to the situation of human rights 
and to continue its efforts to reach the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>393. Burkina Faso congratulated Cameroon on its cooperation and commitment to the 
promotion and protection of human rights in spite of the challenges of development needs. It 
noted that Cameroon had made tangible progress in the promotion and protection of human 
rights. Burkina Faso welcomed Cameroon&#8217;s spirit of dialogue in the framework of the universal 
periodic review and the firm will of the country&#8217;s authorities to meet their human rights 
obligations. It noted that the majority of recommendations had been accepted by Cameroon and 
this would strengthen the institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human 
rights in the country. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>394. Chad welcomed the delegation of Cameroon and noted that the country had accepted the 
majority of recommendations, in spite of the lack of resources necessary to implement them. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>395. The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network noted that an issue of concern raised during the 
review of Cameroon related to the criminalization of consensual same-sex conduct under 
article 347 of the penal code, and indicated that such provisions were a violation of established 
international human rights law. The delegate stated that the law continued to be the source of 
numerous incidents of harassment, abuse, arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention and continued 
to pose a threat to public health.<b> </b>The Network asked Cameroon to ensure that the human rights 
of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals and human rights defenders were not 
violated and to repeal article 347 of its penal code. 
</p>
<p>396. Franciscans International welcomed the fact that recommendations on the rights of the 
child had been accepted, but noted that there were still many obstacles to the full realization of 
children&#8217;s rights. As stated in recommendations 19, 55 and 76, the situation of children in the 
street was of concern, as were the child victims of exploitation and rape, children of divorced 
couples and children with handicaps. These recommendations offered an opportunity to assess 
programmes implemented and to adapt them to new challenges. It appreciated Cameroon&#8217;s 
commitment to free primary education and to closing the gap between girls and boys in primary 
education. It noted the challenges to its implementation, however, particularly in rural areas. It 
highlighted the fact that Cameroon should ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and the Protocol thereto, following recommendation 76.  
</p>
<p>397. The International Federation of Acat welcomed the replies of Cameroon and congratulated 
the country on its commitment to accelerate the reform of the judicial system to ensure fair 
proceedings. It recalled that 85 per cent of persons detained in the prisons of Douala and 
Yaound&#233; were preventively detained and joined the concern on the absolute necessity to ensure 
the respect of the rights of those deprived of their liberty. It welcomed the remarks regarding the 
necessity of improving detention conditions and supported the recommendations that there be a 
judicial reform to eradicate corruption. It also welcomed the measures taken, in particular the  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>creation of a national anti-corruption commission, and joined the concerns regarding torture in 
prisons. Lastly, it supported that recommendations that Cameroon should prosecute and sanction 
those responsible for violence and inhuman and degrading treatment. 
</p>
<p>398. In a joint statement, Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne 
humaine and Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et de promotion de la coop&#233;ration 
economique internationale welcomed the decree, signed in 2008, providing for compensation for 
the homeless, and requested further information on the time frame for the decree to come into 
effect. They also noted the dysfunction of the national commission for human rights and 
freedoms and asked the Government to give its assurances on the measures taken in order to 
provide the commission with the necessary resources to carry out its missions. 
</p>
<p>399. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme noted Cameroon&#8217;s acceptance 
of the recommendations referred to in paragraphs 22 and 23 on judicial reform and the 
independence of judges, highlighting the fact that the Cameroonian justice system had a lot of 
failings. It reported on the killing of more than 110 people by security forces in February 2008 
during demonstrations against the increased cost of living. Clarifications in that regard were 
requested from the authorities. It encouraged Cameroon to respect the independence and freedom 
of the media and the rights of political parties. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>400. The Minister Delegate thanked all speakers for their support and encouragement and 
reiterated the commitment of Cameroon to fulfil its obligations, not just as a member of the 
international community but also as a member of the Council itself. Concerning a number of 
issues that had been raised, Cameroon was in an ongoing process of reform, particularly in the 
area of the judiciary, where much had been done but much remained to do. Cameroon believed 
that the promotion and protection of human rights were an integral part of its development 
process. It was certain that, at the next round, a number of the issues raised would have been 
resolved. Cameroon was open at all times to comments from all in terms of what could be done 
to improve the human rights situation in the country. The Minister Delegate expressed the 
readiness of Cameroon to cooperate with all instances promoting human rights - the  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>United Nations, African or regional bodies - with the assurance that this confluence of 
cooperation would definitely make the work easier for the country, given that the political will 
was there. 
</p>
<p><b>Cuba 
</b></p>
<p>401. The review of Cuba was held on 5 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Cuba in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/CUB/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/CUB/2); 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/CUB/3). 
</p>
<p>402. At its 16th meeting, on 10 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Cuba (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>403. The outcome of the review on Cuba comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/22), the views of Cuba concerning the recommendations 
and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of 
the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the 
interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also written additional information submitted by 
Cuba). 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or  
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>404. Cuba regretted that the process of adoption of several of the reports at the session had been 
affected by the artificial obstacles in their translation presented by the Conference Services 
Division, stating that it welcomed and supported the draft decision being put forward to attempt 
to resolve this issue. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>405. Cuba thanked the countries that supported its re-election to the Council, which it saw as a 
token of the international community&#8217;s recognition of its efforts and achievements in the 
promotion and protection of human rights.  
</p>
<p>406. Cuba stressed that, in its national capacity and as the President of the Non-Aligned 
Movement, it had contributed to the establishment of the universal periodic review mechanism, 
and had undertaken the exercise with full responsibility, participating openly and transparently in 
the dialogue with all States. This exercise had allowed Cuba to put forward its experience and 
good practices, as well as the challenges it faced. It allowed Cuba to listen to the opinions of 
many delegations. 
</p>
<p>407. After 20 years of unjust anti-Cuban manipulation of human rights, Cuba saw the results of 
the universal periodic review as an important victory for its people, showing that, in the context 
of an objective exercise of universal participation where it was not possible to exert pressure, the 
truth about Cuba could not be silenced. The international community clearly confirmed its 
condemnation of the blockade imposed by the United States of America on Cuba. Several 
delegations had been explicit in their solidarity with the Cuban people in their historical demand 
that an end be put to that genocidal policy.  
</p>
<p>408. Several delegations had recognized the example of people&#8217;s participation, inclusion and 
social justice that was part of the political, economic and social system chosen by the Cuban 
people. The success of Cuba in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, including its 
excellent health and education systems, were praised.  
</p>
<p>409. Cuba&#8217;s international cooperation in health and education were referred to as paradigms of 
international solidarity. The &#8220;Yes I can&#8221; literacy programme and the &#8220;Milagro Operation&#8221; were 
mentioned on several occasions as good practices. 
</p>
<p>410. Cuba stated that the report adopted by the Working Group objectively reflected the results 
of the process; 60 delegations spoke and 89 recommendations had been made. Cuba fully 
accepted 60 recommendations and provided additional information and comments on the 
17 others in writing. Cuba objected to a few recommendations because of their incompatibility 
with the exercise of the right to self-determination; some of them showed a lack of information 
and knowledge about Cuba&#8217;s very rich and diverse reality. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>411. Cuba had carefully reviewed the report of the Working Group and the recommendations 
made. It said it was working to put the recommendations into practice, according to its 
possibilities, and that the inter-institutional working group established to coordinate 
consultations in preparation of the national report was still active, with the objective of following 
up and implementing the recommendations as necessary, by carrying out consultations and 
guaranteeing the broad participation of civil society. 
</p>
<p>412. Cuba stated that, in the midst of the difficult conditions in the country, where the impact of 
the blockade had been compounded by the effects of the world financial crisis, the Government 
had continued to deepen its revolutionary transformation. Cuba had continued to develop and 
perfect its programmes in health, education, social security, protection for the elderly, persons 
with disabilities and the most vulnerable. Cuba had continued to promote equality, including 
programmes to empower women. Despite the difficulties, Cuba had continued its housing 
construction plan and was taking measures to increase agricultural production and ensure greater 
food security. 
</p>
<p>413. Cuba also stressed that it continued to offer its assistance for the realization of human 
rights elsewhere. It noted that, as at 5 May 2009, 50,747 professionals had provided cooperation 
services in 96 different countries and 4 overseas territories; of these, 75.8 per cent worked in the 
health sector. Cuba had recently inaugurated three new ophthalmologic centres in Latin America 
and the Caribbean, and the &#8220;Yes I can&#8221; literacy programme was under way in 25 countries. 
</p>
<p>414. Cuba noted it was party to 42 of the most important human rights treaties and had 
overcome the delays in presenting its periodic reports. It had submitted its reports to the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination, and had established a working group to prepare the report for the Committee 
against Torture. It reiterated its firm commitment to continue extending an invitation to visit the 
country to the Council special procedures that have been established on a non-discriminatory 
basis. It had already extended an invitation to the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture to 
visit the country in 2009, and had established a national working group to organize and 
coordinate the visit. The Cuban people preserved their sovereign capacity to invite, as it found  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>appropriate, other mandate holders. Cuba recalled that it was subjected to a policy of hostility 
and blockade by a foreign power and that this required changing priorities. Cuba also cooperated 
with different humanitarian organizations throughout the world. 
</p>
<p>415. Cuba explained that it had a broad and effective inter-institutional system, which included 
the participation of non-governmental organizations, to receive and respond to any individual or 
collective complaint or petition. This system also assessed the effectiveness of current policies 
and programmes and provided follow-up on recommendations it considered necessary to 
continue to perfect the enjoyment of human rights in Cuba. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>416. Pakistan thanked Cuba for its replies on recommendations made during the review, and 
welcomed the acceptance of its own recommendations. It welcomed Cuba&#8217;s involvement in 
international cooperation and hoped that Cuba would be a model for countries with limited 
resources. Pakistan stressed that Cuba continued to uphold the principles of objectivity, 
impartiality and independence in its pursuit of the universal realization of human rights, and 
referred to Cuba&#8217;s leading role in promoting the right to development and achieving the right 
balance between civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>417. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) stated that the universal periodic review was an 
opportunity to see the progress made by the Cuban revolution, despite adverse conditions, and to 
tear away the veil on the demonization campaign that had existed for 50 years. It paid tribute to 
the Cuban revolution and its people for their spirit of cooperation in the area of human rights, 
with programmes in the areas of health, education, culture and sports, especially in the neediest 
countries. It stressed the efforts and successes made by Cuba for human rights on its territory, as 
demonstrated by the review. 
</p>
<p>418. Qatar stressed that Cuba had accepted 60 recommendations, including those made by 
Qatar, which demonstrated the commitment of Cuba to the universal periodic review process. It 
valued the efforts made in the field of economic, social and cultural rights, in particular the rights 
to work, education and health, and its policies and strategies on social and human development. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Qatar paid tribute to the effective role played by Cuba in the institution-building of the Council 
and in the Non-Aligned Movement. It wished Cuba success in overcoming challenges. 
</p>
<p>419. The Russian Federation stressed that the review of Cuba reflected the progress achieved 
and demonstrated the constructive and responsible approach of Cuba to international 
cooperation. Cuba remained a good example of respect for human rights, including economic, 
social and cultural rights. The Russian Federation paid tribute to the active role played by Cuba 
in the elaboration of the universal periodic review. It wished Cuba every success in the 
realization of its commitments and further progress in human rights, as would certainly be shown 
at the next cycle of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>420. Bolivia (Plurinational State of) stressed that the international community recognized 
Cuba&#8217;s achievements, despite it being a developing country subjected to an unjust economic 
blockade and suffering from climate change. Cuba demonstrated solidarity with many peoples; 
instead of criticizing those that had chosen their destiny, it made human rights a reality in 
practice. During the review, it had recommended that Cuba share its experience in the fields of 
health and education. It congratulated Cuba on its participative and transparent approach to the 
universal periodic review. It called for the end of the blockade by the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>421. Uzbekistan thanked Cuba for the detailed reply provided on the recommendations, for its 
active participation in the universal periodic review, and commended it for the measures taken in 
the field of human rights. The review clearly demonstrated the achievements made, particularly 
with regard to gender equality, the protection of women and children, social protection, health 
care, the right to education, religious freedom and economic, social and cultural rights. 
Uzbekistan was convinced that Cuba would continue its efforts to implement the 
recommendations and its international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>422. Belarus stressed the responsive and constructive approach of Cuba during the review, 
which was held while unlawful sanctions were imposed on it. Belarus had recommended that 
Cuba continue its efforts to counter such unilateral measures. Belarus paid tribute to Cuba for its 
role in the Non-Aligned Movement, in promoting human rights and in strengthening the Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>It hoped that Cuba would continue to play its leading role in ending politicization of human 
rights issues. Belarus noted that Cuba had accepted its recommendation, as well as many others, 
which demonstrated Cuba&#8217;s genuine interest in human rights. 
</p>
<p>423. Sri Lanka stated that Cuba&#8217;s participation in the universal periodic review was a model. It 
paid tribute to Cuba&#8217;s active role in the Council and the way in which it fought against attempts 
to use human rights selectively and hypocritically. Cuba discharged its responsibilities under 
conditions of extreme external hostility. Cuba was a model for the realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights. Its action was not limited to collective rights, as demonstrated by 
Operation Milagro and the &#8220;Yes I Can&#8221; literacy programme. Sri Lanka saluted Cuba&#8217;s 
performance. 
</p>
<p>424. China stressed that Cuba was faced with enormous difficulties created by the embargo and 
had achieved outstanding achievements in the economic, political, social and cultural fields. 
Cuba had cooperated in a constructive manner with developing States and made important 
contributions to the human rights cause. A majority of States in the Working Group praised Cuba 
highly for its achievements. China noted that Cuba had replied to all questions raised during the 
review, including by China. China was convinced that Cuba would make every effort to attain 
the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>425. Algeria stressed Cuba&#8217;s constructive approach, as demonstrated by its acceptance 
of 60 recommendations. Algeria underlined Cuba&#8217;s action for human rights, in particular the 
rights to development, food and peace, the promotion of cultural diversity, international 
cooperation and solidarity, and the right of peoples to self-determination. During the review, 
Algeria had welcomed Cuba&#8217;s commitment to human rights, despite the economic blockade, and 
encouraged Cuba to share its experience in the areas of health, education and the right to food. 
Algeria paid tribute to Cuba for its progress in the area of human rights, social justice and 
democracy. 
</p>
<p>426. Egypt commended Cuba for its efforts and the significant advances in the area of 
economic, social and cultural rights. Cuba&#8217;s achievements in the field of health care had been 
beneficial to many countries, especially in Africa, and the heath assistance provided without 
condition indicated Cuba&#8217;s belief in international solidarity. Cuba demonstrated through the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>universal periodic review a high degree of professionalism and openness, and the huge number 
of recommendations accepted was testimony to its engagement with the Council and other 
bodies. Egypt thanked Cuba for its detailed replies to the recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>427. The Women International Democratic Federation noted that the recommendations made to 
Cuba about sharing its experiences in the fields of education, social work, health, cooperation 
and international solidarity were deserved. Cuba protected all human rights, cooperated with 
United Nations mechanisms and had achieved important results in gender equality and 
empowerment. Despite obstacles, most of them caused by the prolonged and genocidal blockade 
imposed by the United States of America, Cuba kept moving forward and represented an 
example of dignity, courage and strength for the world. 
</p>
<p>428. The Centre of Studies about Youth recalled that young people in Cuba were born under the 
brutal blockade imposed by the United States. It stressed that children and young people had 
been guaranteed free education and the continuation of their studies, were free to express their 
opinions and gather in various associations, had access to the public health system and had an 
automatic right to participate in the election process. It indicated that there were 20 members of 
Parliament who were less than 30 years of age. 
</p>
<p>429. The National Association of Cuban Economists pointed out that, despite the blockade, 
Cuba had the lowest infant mortality rate in the continent and a life expectancy rate exceeding 
that of developed countries, and that education up to the university level was guaranteed, as was 
full employment, shelter and food. Trade was systematically affected by the blockade and the 
tourist sector was threatened. Cuba shared its achievements with other peoples, aware that 
solidarity was the highest expression of the capacity of a people to exercise its will with dignity 
and respect. 
</p>
<p>430. The World Federation of Trade Unions stated that it had been in close contact with the 
true trade union movement in Cuba and congratulated Cuba for results in the enjoyment of 
human rights and for its political will to build a society for the welfare of all, which had  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>been achieved under a cruel blockade. Cuba contributed to the improvement of human rights 
through international solidarity and was committed to human rights, as was reflected in 
the 60 recommendations accepted. 
</p>
<p>431. Organizaci&#243;n de solidaridad de los pueblos de &#193;frica, Asia y America, in a joint statement 
with the Indian Movement Tupaj Amaru and the World Peace Council, noted that Cuba enjoyed 
extensive respect at the international level, having defended its self-determination and 
independence. It referred to Cuba&#8217;s cooperation and solidarity with other peoples, unlike 
those who looted and destroyed the planet, referring to Operation Milagro. In the area of 
education, 3.5 million people had been taught to read in 24 countries. 
</p>
<p>432. The China NGO Network for International Exchanges noted Cuba&#8217;s programme for social 
justice and equality. It welcomed Cuba&#8217;s tireless efforts to improve the living standards of its 
people and its active participation in international cooperation on human rights. It welcomed the 
positive attitude of Cuba towards the universal periodic review and its cooperation with the 
Council. It recommended that Cuba take more concrete measures for the full implementation of 
its obligations and commitments, and continue to participate actively in international cooperation 
on human rights. 
</p>
<p>433. The China Society for Human Rights Studies welcomed the priority given by Cuba to 
human rights and its significant achievements, especially in the field of education, health and 
food, despite the unjust blockade. It encouraged Cuba to share its experience in the right to 
health, in particular the primary, maternal and childcare programmes and HIV/AIDS control 
programmes. It recommended that Cuba continue to participate in international cooperation on 
human rights and provide other developing countries with medical and educational assistance. 
</p>
<p>434. Centrist Democratic International and Freedom House noted that the ratification of two 
international covenants on human rights was still pending. They stated that there were hundreds 
of political prisoners and prisoners of conscience in Cuba, many of whom were sick and not 
receiving medical attention. They stated that 21 deaths in prison, more than 500 arbitrary arrests 
and 26 cases of imprisonment of human rights defenders had been reported, and that 
2 individuals had been subjected to intimidation for having submitted reports for the universal 
periodic review. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>435. The Indian Council of South America, also on behalf of the International Human Rights 
Association of American Minorities, praised Cuba&#8217;s contribution to the issues of indigenous 
peoples and the right to food. While welcoming the ratification of the Convention for the 
Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the invitation to the Special 
Rapporteur on torture, they called on Cuba to ratify the two international covenants on human 
rights and to invite other special procedures to visit the country. 
</p>
<p>436. Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights regretted that 
Cuba had not explained the systematic violation of civil and political rights. They supported the 
recommendations that Cuba should adopt measures to guarantee the independence of the 
judiciary, condemned the repression of dissident activity and requested the immediate abrogation 
of laws used to restrict fundamental rights. They called for the liberation of political prisoners 
and an end to arbitrary detentions, and supported recommendations to establish guarantees for 
the protection of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>437. The Federation of Cuban Women noted advances in the situation of women, observing that 
gender equality was part of a democratic policy for social justice, which allowed women to 
participate in all social, political and economic arenas. It mentioned the guarantees for women in 
the areas of the right to work, land rights, sexual and reproductive rights, education and culture. 
It noted that this had been achieved despite the economic blockade. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>438. Cuba reaffirmed its commitment to continue to follow up on the results of the universal 
periodic review and the implementation of the recommendations it had accepted, with objectivity 
and rigour. 
</p>
<p>439. Cuba thanked all delegations that had recognized its efforts and achievements, and for their 
recommendations and constructive comments to continue to perfect its system, and thus improve 
the enjoyment of human rights for all. 
</p>
<p>440. Cuba thanked the majority of non-governmental organizations that participated in the 
debate. It regretted the dissonant voices of those that were mercenaries paid by the empire and 
voices of the defeated counter-revolution. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>441. Cuba reiterated its commitment to cooperate with United Nations human rights machinery, 
especially the Council and its universal periodic review, and to continue working towards the 
promotion and protection of human rights through international cooperation and respectful 
dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b>Saudi Arabia 
</b></p>
<p>442. The review of Saudi Arabia was held on 10 February 2009 in conformity with all the 
relevant provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following 
documents:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Saudi Arabia in accordance with the annex to 
Council resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/SAU/1);  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/SAU/2); and 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/SAU/3). 
</p>
<p>443. At its 16th meeting, on 10 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review of Saudi Arabia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>444. The outcome of the review on Saudi Arabia comprised the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/23 and A/HRC/11/23/Corr.1), the views of 
Saudi Arabia concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary 
commitments and its replies presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to 
questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the 
Working Group (see also A/HRC/11/23/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or  
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>445. The delegation of Saudi Arabia was convinced that the universal periodic review 
mechanism had established common denominators for all States. It has helped to ensure </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the universality of human rights through constructive dialogue and the exchange of best 
practices and experience, thereby promoting cooperation and mutual understanding. 
</p>
<p>446. This mechanism, however, had to take into consideration the particularities and the stages 
of development and evolution of societies. This effort required a profound understanding of each 
culture and its guiding values and principles, which, by their very nature, converge with the 
humanitarian principles that have made human rights universally acceptable to and recognized 
by all cultures and civilizations. The principle of transparency, which is a prerequisite for the 
effective functioning of this mechanism, had to be fully accepted and respected by all. 
</p>
<p>447. In keeping with Saudi Arabia&#8217;s commitment to these principles, the custodian of the two 
holy mosques, King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, launched an initiative calling for 
dialogue among the followers of religions and cultures, with a view to promoting mutual 
understanding among the world&#8217;s predominant cultures, on the basis of the understanding that 
human civilization is homogeneous and that dialogue is a means to settle conflicts and disputes. 
</p>
<p>448. This initiative, if followed up at the international level, would establish a favourable 
environment in which human rights could develop and flourish and in which they could be 
applied on a purely humanitarian basis. Saudi Arabia observed that all people, without exception, 
were entitled to enjoy the principle of the universality of human rights. This applied even to 
proponents of extremist ideologies, whom Saudi Arabia was endeavouring to save from the 
consequences of their aberrant modes of thought through ad hoc counselling and rehabilitation 
programmes. This Saudi security project was a pilot experiment, the international circulation of 
which has been advocated in some recommendations. 
</p>
<p>449. The recommendations resulting from the universal periodic review dialogue were an 
expression of a sincere desire to offer advice and objective criticism. However, some of the 
recommendations might fail to achieve their goals because of a misunderstanding of the values 
and principles guiding each culture or an inaccurate appraisal of the real situation. 
</p>
<p>450. In consultation with the public and private bodies concerned, Saudi Arabia carefully 
studied the recommendations made during its review. Having considered whether their </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>acceptance would contribute to the development of the Saudi human rights environment, it had 
decided to accept most of the recommendations. The reasons for non-acceptance of a few 
recommendations are explained in document A/HRC/11/23/Add.1. 
</p>
<p>451. Being aware that the acceptance of recommendations entailed considerable endeavours for 
their implementation, Saudi Arabia would continue its efforts in keeping with its belief that the 
realization of human rights was an integral part of the obligations that Islamic sharia commanded 
Saudi Arabia to fulfil. 
</p>
<p>452. The ongoing development process and political will had taken the form of sustainable 
development programmes to promote and protect human rights. Reference was made to some 
examples illustrating what had been achieved during the period following the discussion of the 
report on Saudi Arabia on 6 February 2009. 
</p>
<p>453. In the judicial field, royal decrees had been promulgated calling for the establishment of a 
supreme council of the judiciary, a supreme court, a council of the administrative judiciary and a 
supreme administrative court. These developments fell within the new statutes of the judiciary, 
which strengthened the independence of the judicial authority, established specialized labour, 
criminal and commercial courts and recognized the principle of two levels of jurisdiction. 
</p>
<p>454. New statutes for municipal councils currently being formulated would take into 
consideration the experience gained from the current municipal council elections, expand the 
scope of participation by citizens in the management of local affairs and develop the electoral 
process. 
</p>
<p>455. The consultative council had also approved the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act, 
which met international standards for the prevention and punishment of human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>456. Regarding the expansion of participation by women, a woman had been appointed assistant 
mayor of the city of Jeddah, the second largest city in Saudi Arabia. Women had also been 
appointed as vice-ministers, university president, deputy ministers and deans of faculties, and the 
number of female counsellors in the consultative council has been increased from 6 to 12. 
Provision had been made for women to engage in all commercial and industrial and service 
activities without exception, in the same way as men. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>457. Within the framework of the endeavours made to prevent violence against women and 
children, a national register had been established to record cases of domestic violence, and 
numerous courses had been held to train judges, public prosecutors and police officers to deal 
with such cases. 
</p>
<p>458. A directorate-general for the promotion and protection of the rights of expatriate workers 
had been established in the Ministry of Labour to provide such workers with urgent assistance, 
either directly or through telephone hotlines, and also to publish, in various languages, 
awareness-raising information concerning their rights and obligations. The State had guaranteed 
the 7 million expatriate workers in Saudi Arabia full freedom to make remittances to their 
families, thereby helping to greatly improve their families&#8217; living conditions and, at the same 
time, support their countries&#8217; economies. In 2008, workers&#8217; remittances totalled $22 billion. 
</p>
<p>459. At the cultural and educational levels, universities and academic research institutions and 
chairs had been established in a number of fields, including human rights, the situation of 
women, extremist ideological rehabilitation and other fields related to human rights. 
</p>
<p>460. The promotion of human rights had to take into account social and cultural circumstances, 
which necessitated a gradual approach for the creation of an environment conducive to the 
further consolidation of human rights values and culture, in a manner consistent with the natural 
process of change and development, particularly in regard to change relating to social norms and 
customs. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States  
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>461. Pakistan indicated that Saudi Arabia had enumerated a number of legislative, institutional 
and organizational reforms, in particular the intention to promulgate a bill of law to criminalize 
all forms of human trafficking, the codification of sharia law, steps taken to empower women, 
the establishment of the new directorate for the welfare of expatriate workers and for new 
supreme and constitutional courts. Pakistan mentioned that Saudi Arabia&#8217;s investments in the 
developing world and generous contributions to various United Nations projects were examples 
of its commitment to promote human rights. Pakistan appreciated Saudi Arabia&#8217;s efforts in 
promoting dialogue among followers of different religions. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>462. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) believed that the information provided in the Saudi 
replies was very useful to the universal periodic review, in particular regarding the family and 
community medical system, which provided the highest possible health service to its population. 
It recognized Saudi Arabia&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights, especially the 
measures taken to change the normative and institutional framework of the country. 
</p>
<p>463. Qatar valued Saudi Arabia&#8217;s open approach in dealing with the recommendations made by 
the delegations. Qatar commended Saudi Arabia in particular for the progress relating to the 
strengthening of human rights infrastructure in the legislative and institutional fields, and for the 
measures taken to reform the judicial system and the achievements in economic, social and 
cultural rights, such as the rights to education, health, work and housing. Qatar welcomed 
Saudi Arabia&#8217;s cooperation with international human rights institutions, in particular the Council. 
</p>
<p>464. Algeria welcomed Saudi Arabia&#8217;s efforts to promote all human rights and its attachment to 
a culture of human rights. It congratulated Saudi Arabia on its re-election to the Council. Algeria 
commended it for its efforts to promote the rights of children and women, in particular the 
creation of mechanisms to prevent domestic violence, and the adoption of legislation on children. 
Algeria also commended Saudi Arabia for accepting the recommendations to further its efforts to 
fight terrorism and protect human rights at the same time, pursue its policies aiming at the 
promotion of dialogue among religions and civilizations, and continue its efforts to create a 
positive environment for all foreign workers. 
</p>
<p>465. Cuba welcomed the fact that Saudi Arabia had accepted the majority of the 
recommendations. Measures taken to implement them showed the will of Saudi Arabia to 
promote and protect the human rights of its people. Cuba recognized the measures taken in the 
fields of education, health, housing, work, security and social assistance, which benefited the 
neediest people. Cuba recognized the generous contributions made by Saudi Arabia to alleviate 
the situation of poor countries affected by the world food crisis and urged it to continue in its 
vocation of solidarity towards developing countries. 
</p>
<p>466. Belarus noted that Saudi Arabia had been working to develop further its national judicial 
system and eradicate discrimination against migrant workers. The Government had accepted the 
recommendations of Belarus with regard to continuing efforts to protect migrant workers&#8217; rights </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and child rights. It noted that Saudi Arabia planned to consider the question of acceding to 
international human rights instruments; a positive decision on that matter would strengthen its 
national system for the promotion and protection of human rights. Belarus also pointed out that 
Saudi Arabia had undertaken initiatives, at the national and international levels, to advance 
dialogue between religions and civilizations and to promote tolerance and world peace. 
</p>
<p>467. Bahrain welcomed the positive steps taken by Saudi Arabia by its acceptance and 
implementation of a number of universal periodic review recommendations, including those 
made by Bahrain, such as the one on the rehabilitation of those suspected or detained in the fight 
against terrorism. Bahrain welcomed Saudi Arabia&#8217;s efforts to continue the dialogue among 
religions and civilizations, and promote the rights of women and children in conformity with 
sharia law and international obligations. Saudi Arabia&#8217;s action reflected its political will and the 
importance it attached to the implementation of its international commitments. 
</p>
<p>468. China noted that Saudi Arabia had submitted a thorough national report to the Working 
Group, introducing its efforts and achievements in national dialogue, judicial and institutional 
reform, public health and protection of migrant workers&#8217; rights. China welcomed the replies of 
Saudi Arabia to the Working Group report, which showed the importance it attached to human 
rights. China was convinced that the Government of Saudi Arabia, while respecting the specific 
characteristics of its national culture, would take all the necessary measures to protect the 
universality of human rights and make new progress in this field. 
</p>
<p>469. Egypt stated that the review reflected the progress made by Saudi Arabia and its 
constructive cooperation with international human rights mechanisms. Egypt commended 
Saudi Arabia for its achievements in human rights institution-building at the national level and 
for its efforts in the areas of legal and judicial reforms, combating discrimination and violence 
against women and promoting their participation in the labour market. Egypt supported 
Saudi Arabia&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights within the overall framework of its 
sovereign right to implement its national legislation in a manner compatible with internationally 
agreed norms and principles. 
</p>
<p>470. The United Arab Emirates welcomed Saudi Arabia&#8217;s efforts at the national level to 
promote and protect human rights. The measures taken by Saudi Arabia reflected its </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>determination to continue its efforts in the area of human rights, including legislative and 
institutional reforms aimed at meeting its economic, cultural, social and political needs and 
specificities. The universal periodic review recommendations and Saudi Arabia&#8217;s voluntary 
commitments would undoubtedly give new impetus to these worthy efforts. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>471. The National Association of Cuban Economists noted that Saudi Arabia had achieved 
important objectives in terms of legislation and in putting into practice economic and social 
rights. Saudi Arabia helped generously to ease the situation in countries affected by the food 
crisis, unlike what most developed countries had done. It urged Saudi Arabia to continue its 
efforts to promote economic, social and cultural rights and to redouble its efforts to guarantee 
dialogue between religions and civilizations.  
</p>
<p>472. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies welcomed the fact that Saudi Arabia had 
accepted most of the recommendations. It urged the State to ratify international human rights 
instruments, modify its legislation so as to conform to human rights standards and allow access 
to all special rapporteurs with pending requests for a visit. The State should abolish all 
legislation, measures and practices that view women as second-class citizens, enact legislation 
that criminalizes violence against women and withdraw its two reservations to the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The Institute highlighted its 
concern about religious freedom in the country and discrimination against the Shiite minority. It 
asked the State to cease all types of corporal and inhumane punishment.  
</p>
<p>473. Amnesty International welcomed the fact that Saudi Arabia had accepted most of the 
recommendations. It highlighted, however, the Government&#8217;s decision to reject a number of 
recommendations, particularly those related to the death penalty, which is used against juvenile 
offenders for offences with no lethal consequences and against foreign nationals. It stated that 
the death penalty is applied after secret and summary trials of defendants with no legal 
assistance. Amnesty International called on Saudi Arabia to reconsider recommendations to 
establish a moratorium on all executions. It also noted that thousands of people arrested on 
counter-terrorism grounds were currently being held in secret detention, most without charge or 
trial and without access to a lawyer or to the courts. Many had allegedly been tortured or 
otherwise ill-treated in order to extract confessions.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>474. The Arab Commission for Human Rights welcomed the acceptance of 
recommendations 1, 2 and 3 concerning the issue of ratification of a number of international 
instruments, in particular the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, and 
recommended the establishment of a national mechanism for prison visits and the prevention of 
torture. It also welcomed the acceptance of recommendation 23 on the minimum age and legal 
safeguards regarding corporal punishment. The Commission expressed concern at claims 
regarding the death penalty, and requested that all international commitments and conventions in 
this regard be respected. It invited the State to avoid special trials, and called upon it to send a 
standing invitation to special rapporteurs and to invite the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
to visit the country.  
</p>
<p>475. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion des Grands Lacs 
welcomed the efforts of Saudi Arabia to promote education and the protection of young people, 
establish mechanisms to combat violence in the family, and apply the law to people with 
disabilities. It noted the progress in promoting freedom of expression and opinion, the adoption 
of the law on governance, the law on the Choura advisory council, the law on criminal 
procedures, and the rights of children, women and migrant workers. It added that the selectivity 
and partiality of the International Criminal Court might explain the non-ratification of the Rome 
Statute by Saudi Arabia. It commended the State for the freedom of religion guaranteed to 
non-Muslims and the elaboration of a peace plan, backed by the Arab League, with a view to 
negotiating a solution to the Middle-East problem. It welcomed the commitments of 
Saudi Arabia to the Millennium Development Goals to assist developing countries by 
donating $500 million.  
</p>
<p>476. The Indian Council of South America, in a joint statement with the International Human 
Rights Association of American Minorities, Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la 
personne humaine, the Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims, the Organization for 
Defending Victims of Violence and Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et de 
promotion de la coop&#233;ration &#233;conomique internationale, noted the generous contributions of 
Saudi Arabia to developing countries and to people in need. It called on the Government to 
continue working towards more high-level appointments of women, and to step-up the process to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>allow women to realize the extent of their rights in order to overcome confusion between true 
Islamic sharia, customs and traditions and human rights law. They welcomed the intention of 
Saudi Arabia to ratify a number of international human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>477. The International Commission of Jurists noted that the religious police were allegedly 
responsible for human rights violations, including torture and ill-treatment, enforced 
disappearances and arbitrary detentions. Saudi authorities had failed to hold fair and transparent 
elections. It pointed out that the Government should reform the Basic Law of Government in 
order to reinforce the rule of law and human rights. The Government should also incorporate into 
the Law the principle of equality between men and women and the prohibition of discrimination 
on the basis of sex. It urged the Government to accede to international human rights treaties, 
cooperate with the Council&#8217;s special procedures and submit overdue reports to the 
United Nations treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p>478. Three non-governmental organizations were scheduled to speak during the 20-minute 
segment allocated to them, but were unable to do so because the meeting was running late.<b>3</b> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>479. Owing to time constraints, Saudi Arabia was not provided with the prescribed time 
allocated to States under review and could thus not address the issues raised in detail. It 
reiterated, however, that the national report clearly illustrated the measures taken for the 
protection of women and migrant workers&#8217; rights and provided details on related laws. It should 
be noted that 13 judges of various courts examined cases involving the death penalty, and that 
this sentence was applied to the most odious cases only. Questions and comments should be 
based on reality without dismissing the figures and the contents provided in the national report.

<p><b>Senegal 
</b></p>
<p>480. Before the consideration of the review outcome of Senegal, Armenia raised a point of 
order, the content of which is reflected in the statement posted on the universal periodic review 
extranet. 
</p>
<p>481. The review of Senegal was held on 6 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Senegal in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/SEN/1);  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/SEN/2);  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/SEN/3). 
</p>
<p>482. At its 17th meeting, on 11 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Senegal (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>483. The outcome of the review on Senegal comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/24), the views of Senegal concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/24/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations 
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>484. The Minister of State for Justice thanked all countries that contributed to the re-election of 
Senegal to the Council, and assured that Senegal would be fully dedicated to contribute to the 
implementation of the Council&#8217;s mandate. Senegal recalled that it had accepted 
30 recommendations in February 2009 and had produced a document to reply to 10 other 
recommendations, the status of which was pending. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>485. Senegal recalled that homosexuality was not a crime in Senegal, although article 319 of the 
penal code criminalized impure acts or unnatural acts with another person of the same sex. The 
Minister stated that most of the Senegalese people were hostile to homosexuality in the manner 
in which it was manifested in some societies. Ignoring this reality could lead to extremist 
attitudes. Therefore, Senegal intended to tackle this issue with serenity and moderation. Nobody 
was currently in detention on the basis of article 319 of the penal code since the Court of Appeal 
of Dakar had ruled that those who had been arrested on this basis a few months earlier should be 
released immediately.  
</p>
<p>486. The above-mentioned case was further proof of the independence of the judiciary. The 
delegation stated that the recommendation made on the separation of powers was already 
effective in Senegal, which was a law-abiding State. In order to reinforce the independence of 
the judiciary, a review of the Organic Law 92-27 was ongoing. It aimed at amending several 
provisions regarding the statute of magistrates, particularly with regard to the fact that they could 
not be removed, disciplinary measures and revocation. 
</p>
<p>487. Senegal recalled that fundamental freedoms, such as the freedom of expression and the 
freedom of peaceful assembly, were guaranteed in the Constitution and that the recommendation 
on this issue would be a new incentive to better protect these freedoms. Senegal recalled that the 
recommendation on non-discrimination against women and their access to education and health 
were in accordance with the State&#8217;s voluntary policies on health and education, as were 
legislative and other measures to fight against gender discrimination, including the ongoing 
national strategy on gender equality and equity for the period 2005-2015. 
</p>
<p>488. With regard to a standing invitation to special procedures, Senegal recalled its readiness to 
accept formal invitations and its full collaboration with mandate holders. 
</p>
<p>489. In conclusion, Senegal expressed its deep belief in the need for the involvement of 
non-governmental organizations in human rights and their dialogue with States, as well as the 
refusal of impunity, which was essential to the promotion and protection of human rights and 
was not negotiable. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the 
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>490. The United Arab Emirates welcomed the comprehensive policies implemented by Senegal 
in vital human rights areas, such as the alleviation of poverty, the empowerment of women and 
the rights of children. It commended the Government for its efforts to give priority to education. 
It noted that Senegal played a pivotal role in interreligious and intercultural dialogue and was a 
symbol of coexistence and tolerance. It pointed out the commitment of Senegal to continue the 
implementation of universal periodic review recommendations and acknowledged its 
achievements. 
</p>
<p>491. Qatar applauded Senegal&#8217;s cooperation in the framework of the universal periodic review 
and the spirit of understanding and openness shown regarding the recommendations made. It 
noted that the Constitution of Senegal made all citizens equal before the law. Qatar valued 
Senegal&#8217;s efforts in the protection and promotion of human rights - economic, social and cultural 
rights - with special attention to the rights to education, health and housing. Qatar applauded the 
peaceful coexistence of Muslims and Christians and the building up of a culture of tolerance and 
dialogue, as well as its efforts to alleviate poverty, protect street children, and combat child 
trafficking and HIV/AIDS. 
</p>
<p>492. Algeria pointed to the seriousness of Senegal in considering the universal periodic review, 
as was perfectly illustrated by the acceptance of nearly all recommendations. Algeria appreciated 
the acceptance of its recommendations by Senegal concerning the promotion of universalization 
of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families, the continuation of efforts to guarantee the right to food for its 
population and the possibility of requesting technical assistance from OHCHR, and the efforts to 
promote dialogue for peace and tolerance among religions, civilizations and cultures. Algeria 
called on the international community to assist Senegal in the implementation of the 
recommendations made. 
</p>
<p>493. Pakistan regarded Senegal&#8217;s acceptance of the majority of the recommendations as an 
encouraging sign that illustrated its constructive attitude in dealing with human rights. It was 
encouraged that Senegal had indicated that, despite resource constraints, it would continue to 
build on its progressive achievements in human rights. Pakistan noted the steps taken in judicial </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reforms, the rights of migrants and in addressing the issue of violence against women and gender 
equality through a comprehensive strategy. Pakistan stated that the successful implementation of 
the recommendations would lead to the effective promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>494. Bahrain noted the importance attached by Senegal to the promotion and protection of 
human rights at the national and international levels. Bahrain welcomed the positive measures 
that Senegal had taken to implement certain recommendations. It noted the considerable efforts 
of the Government to reinforce primary education in rural areas and to provide study grants to 
students at public and private schools. 
</p>
<p>495. Egypt noted that Senegal had achieved significant progress in the promotion and protection 
of human rights, despite all difficulties, including through efforts to establish a strong human 
rights infrastructure. It noted Senegal&#8217;s special attention to the prevention of smuggling of 
migrants, in addition to advances in economic, social and cultural rights, with a special focus on 
poverty eradication. Egypt called on the international community to assist Senegal in 
implementing national strategies to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Egypt reiterated 
its belief in Senegal&#8217;s ability to overcome challenges, while upholding its sovereign right to 
implement national laws based on universal human rights norms. 
</p>
<p>496. Saudi Arabia noted the willingness of Senegal to cooperate with human rights 
mechanisms, exemplified by the acceptance of the majority of the recommendations. It 
encouraged the efforts made by Senegal to reform laws and human rights institutions. It 
commended Senegal for its determination to continue with its programme of action for the 
promotion of human rights. It noted that Senegal had stepped up efforts to strengthen dialogue 
among civilizations, cultures and religions. 
</p>
<p>497. Morocco congratulated Senegal on its commitment to the universal periodic review, which 
had raised awareness about the achievements and challenges of protecting human rights in 
Senegal. It noted that Senegal had accepted most of the recommendations, including those 
proposed by Morocco, and had promised to consider other recommendations in the same spirit. 
The institutional human rights structure established by Senegal attested to its consistent 
commitment to guaranteeing full respect for human rights. Morocco indicated that these efforts </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>made Senegal a model and required the support of relevant international bodies to help Senegal 
to implement its programmes of action and promote the achievement of the Millennium 
Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>498. The United States of America appreciated Senegal&#8217;s commitment to further strengthen its 
efforts to eliminate the economic exploitation of children, including by enhancing access to 
education and enforcing laws against child labour and trafficking. It noted the concern expressed 
by several delegations regarding the criminalization of homosexuality, as well as harassment and 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. It also echoed concerns regarding intimidation and 
harassment of journalists and media organizations. It urged Senegal to fulfil the African Union 
mandate regarding the trial of Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233; in Senegal. It encouraged Senegal to undertake an 
awareness-raising campaign on female genital mutilation. 
</p>
<p>499. Ireland thanked the delegation of Senegal for the constructive way in which it had 
participated in the universal periodic review process. It noted with appreciation that Senegal had 
accepted its recommendation concerning the need for an awareness-raising campaign on the 
application of the law on female genital mutilation. Ireland stressed the importance of the 
mandate given to Senegal by the African Union concerning the need to bring to justice 
Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;, the former President of Chad.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>500. Comit&#233; s&#233;n&#233;galais des droits de l&#8217;homme noted with great satisfaction the replies provided 
by the Government to its complaints. It highlighted the open and sincere dialogue the 
Government had established with the national institution and all civil society organizations. It 
called on the authorities to continue their partnership with civil society and to be even more 
vigilant in their struggle for human rights. It was prepared to assist the Government in the 
implementation of the recommendations it had accepted.  
</p>
<p>501. The European Region of the International Lesbian and Gay Association noted the recent 
release from jail of nine gay men but stated that public statements condemning homosexuality 
had led to an increase in homophobia. It indicated that the penal code threatened sexual 
minorities and violated the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It urged Senegal to abolish article 319 of the penal code </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and to review other legislation that resulted in the discrimination, prosecution and punishment of 
people solely for their sexual orientation or gender identity. The Association asked Senegal to 
take measures to promote tolerance and to provide law enforcement and judicial officials with 
training on human rights and sexual minorities. 
</p>
<p>502. Organisation pour la communication en Afrique et de promotion de la coop&#233;ration 
&#233;conomique internationale, in a joint statement with the Indian Council of South America and 
the International Human Rights Association of American Minorities, noted the efforts made by 
Senegal to promote the rights of women, above all to make sure that their social status was 
commensurate with their eminent social role. It encouraged the Government to pursue its effort 
to implement its commitments. It also commended the attention paid by Senegal to the 
promotion and protection of the rights of the child. It pointed out that Senegal had made progress 
in improving access for women to positions of political responsibilities. It recommended the 
ratification of other international human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>503. Rencontre africaine pour la d&#233;fense des droits de l&#8217;homme welcomed the re-election of 
Senegal to the Council, which reflected the vitality and the mission of Senegal regarding human 
rights. It welcomed the acceptance by Senegal of most recommendations. It recalled that the 
independence of the judiciary was guaranteed by the Constitution, but that the composition of the 
High Judicial Council made it dependent on the executive branch and gave a political content to 
some judicial cases. Senegal should therefore pay attention to the recommendation made in that 
regard. 
</p>
<p>504. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine expressed its full 
support for the follow-up to the recommendations. It highlighted the fact that the President of 
Senegal was devoted to human rights and development in Africa. It also referred to the fact that 
the first President of Cameroon was buried in Senegal and the question of repatriation of his 
remains had led to much ill feeling in Cameroon and at the international level. It asked for more 
information on this issue. 
</p>
<p>505. Comit&#233; international pour le respect et l&#8217;application de la Charte africaine des droits de 
l&#8217;homme et des peuples noted the strong institutional support for young people and to better 
protect women, children, the disabled and migrant workers. It welcomed Senegal&#8217;s efforts to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>promote freedom of association and expression, the decriminalization of press offences and the 
coexistence and dialogue between religions. It indicated that recent initiatives to strengthen the 
independence of the judiciary, the reworking of academic programmes to include education in 
human rights and on the fight against HIV/AIDS all showed that Senegal was taking action in 
human rights. 
</p>
<p>506. Action internationale pour la paix et le d&#233;veloppement dans la r&#233;gion des grands lacs noted 
that Senegal had accepted many recommendations, including those relating to the human rights 
of migrants, arbitrary detention, trafficking (especially in women and children), the situation of 
human rights defenders, the independence of judges and the abrogation of article 80 of the penal 
code. It also pointed out that Senegal had been very responsible in achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals, namely through the improvement of the school attendance rate in primary 
education, the national programme for the youngest, universal access to health services for the 
entire population and the plan for the elderly ensuring access to certain medications free of 
charge. 
</p>
<p>507. Espace Afrique International stressed Senegal&#8217;s outstanding efforts in the education of 
girls. It noted that Senegal invested 40 per cent of its annual budget in education and this allowed 
the participation of citizens in all development activities. It noted the innovative and promising 
programmes in terms of good education accessible to all, especially to the most vulnerable. It 
further noted the establishment of many primary and secondary institutions and that higher 
education was improved, with many regional centres linked to world centres of excellence, 
which allowed for remote learning. It indicated that <i>t&#233;l&#233;m&#233;decine</i> allowed Senegal to combat 
maternal and infant mortality. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>508. Senegal thanked the delegations for their observations and recalled that Senegal had met 
with members of civil society before coming to the plenary session. 
</p>
<p>509. Senegal recalled its commitments to fight impunity and that it was the first country to 
ratify the International Criminal Court statutes. The financial arrangements were being processed 
in order to complete the budget and to begin the trial of the former President of Chad, 
Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233;. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>510. With regard to freedom of expression, Senegal recalled its strong commitment to guarantee 
this freedom and that no journalists or any other persons were currently deprived of liberty for 
having expressed his or her convictions. The only limitations to this freedom were posed by the 
freedom of others and of public security. 
</p>
<p>511. Concerning female genital mutilation, some individuals had recently been sentenced in that 
regard despite public opposition, in addition to sensitization activities. This should be seen in 
relation to other activities related to the protection of women and to child education. 
</p>
<p>512. Senegal recalled its commitment to the principles of indivisibility, universality, 
interdependence and non-selectivity of human rights. Senegal was very supportive of the fight 
against impunity and the work of the International Criminal Court. Senegal wanted the Court to 
be competent for all genocides, war crimes and crimes against humanity anywhere in the world, 
without exception. Consequently, in spite of rumours, Senegal would not be withdrawing from 
the Court. 
</p>
<p>513. With regard to the supposed persecution of homosexuals, Senegal was committed to 
protecting homosexuals in spite of a public opinion which was against that lifestyle. Concerning 
the independence of the judiciary, the delegation recalled that it was already ensured; however, it 
would be reinforced and the composition of the High Judicial Council would be reviewed, 
although only two members were not currently magistrates. 
</p>
<p>514. With regard to education for all, 40 per cent of the national budget was allocated to 
education. In addition, Senegal put emphasis on children and women from rural and remote areas 
in order to empower them and allow them to play an important role in the country. 
</p>
<p>515. Senegal made every effort to better protect women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights. A committee 
had been established to address violence against women and children with the participation of 
civil society. 
</p>
<p>516. On the Hiss&#232;ne Habr&#233; case, the delegation stated that the dignity of Africa was at stake. 
Therefore, every effort would be made to organize a just and fair trial. The African Union should 
complete the budget, which would be managed by international institutions.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>China 
</b></p>
<p>517. The review of China was held on 9 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by China in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/CHN/1);  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b)

</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/CHN/3). 
</p>
<p>518. At its 17th meeting, on 11 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on China (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>519. The outcome of the review on China comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/25), the views of Cuba concerning the recommendations 
and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented before the adoption of 
the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not sufficiently addressed during the 
interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations 
and/or conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments 
and the outcome  
</b></p>
<p>520. China thanked all countries for their active participation in the universal periodic review 
dialogue, and noted that quite a number of them had spoken highly of China&#8217;s human rights 
endeavours and achievements while putting forward many valuable recommendations. China 
regarded the review process as an opportunity to listen to other countries and to further promote 
and protect the human rights of its people. China had carefully examined all recommendations 
and accepted those that were compatible with its realities. Following the review, China had 
established an inter-agency task force, comprising more than 20 departments, and had 
formulated concrete implementation plans, with input from non-governmental organizations and 
academic institutions.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>521. With regard to specific recommendations, China issued its first national human rights plan 
of action for the period 2009-2010 on 13 April 2009. It comprehensively covered all rights and 
reflected the useful recommendations made during the review process. A joint meeting 
mechanism had been established to supervise and evaluate the implementation. 
</p>
<p>522. In its plan of action China pledged to continue legislative, judicial and administrative 
reforms to bring domestic laws into line with the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights to create the conditions for its earliest possible ratification. The Chinese legislature 
planned the drafting of an administrative compulsory enforcement law and amendment of laws 
on civil and political rights, including the laws on State compensation and the law on guarding 
State secrets. 
</p>
<p>523. Regarding judicial reform, the Supreme People&#8217;s Court and relevant departments had taken 
a series of measures, including a judicial reform outline, in March 2009, covering 30 measures, 
such as posting judicial indictment on the Internet, regulating discretionary power and holding 
accountable those illegally interfering with independent court proceedings. 
</p>
<p>524. With regard to the financial crisis and safeguarding people&#8217;s livelihoods, especially in rural 
areas, the central Government had used 44 per cent of the investment from the stimulus package 
of RMB 4 trillion at the end of 2008. Projects making rapid progress included the provision of 
access to safe drinking water for 14.6 million rural residents, nearly double the number 
two months earlier. 
</p>
<p>525. China had expanded the coverage of its poverty alleviation programme to 40.07 million 
people, and was considering shifting the focus of its programme from addressing food and 
clothing shortages to offering all-round support and assistance. China had entered into poverty 
alleviation cooperation agreements with a large number of developing countries, providing 
training and sharing experiences with the aim of the early realization of the Millennium 
Development Goals worldwide. 
</p>
<p>526. In April 2009, the Government had released a plan to deepen the reform of the 
pharmaceutical and health-care system, to include everyone in the medical insurance system 
by 2020. To put the plan into practice, China had formulated an implementation plan for the 
period 2009-2011. Governments at all levels would invest and additional RMB 850 billion over </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>three years; by 2011, basic medical insurance system would cover all urban and rural residents, 
and the maximum payment for medical insurance would be increased to six times the per capita 
income.  
</p>
<p>527. Information was provided on the implementation of the recommendation that the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Macao Special Administrative Region 
continue to function according to their realities and preserve different rights of their citizens in 
accordance with their laws. For example, the former was implementing the Race Discrimination 
Ordinance and the Independent Police Complaints Council Ordinance. The latter had undertaken 
legal reforms to increase the accountability of high-ranking civil servants and to strengthen a 
culture of integrity and to improve law in action.  
</p>
<p>528. China has responded, as it had promised, to four recommendations made by Portugal, 
Argentina, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Austria on inscribing a legal definition of 
discrimination in domestic law, reducing the number of crimes carrying the death penalty, 
adopting specific legislation on domestic violence and follow-up to the universal periodic 
review.  
</p>
<p>529. As a populous developing country, China faced many difficulties and challenges in human 
rights that might be unimaginable to other countries. However, China had full confidence in 
making progress. It pledged to honour the commitments made to the world, taking into 
consideration its actual situation and the people&#8217;s will and to continue to participate in the review 
process in a responsible way. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>530. The United Arab Emirates appreciated the country&#8217;s efforts in the universal periodic 
review process for institutional reform to back up its development renaissance and improvements 
in the rule of law, with efforts to reform the system to guarantee the independence of the 
judiciary. This was a difficult endeavour in a multifaceted and multicultural country such as 
China. China&#8217;s cooperation with human rights bodies and OHCHR was welcomed and the hope 
was expressed that the Council would take all of China&#8217;s achievements into account. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>531. Cuba welcomed China&#8217;s efforts and actions to implement the recommendations formulated 
during the review. It acknowledged that China had accepted the great majority of 
recommendations made relating to all human rights, which would help human rights defenders in 
China who were truly engaged in the promotion and protection of human rights. Cuba regretted 
the politically motivated recommendations made during the universal periodic review and 
underlined the fact that the delegation had its reasons to reject them. It noted China&#8217;s 
extraordinary achievement of consolidating national unity and taking its people towards 
development, and expressed its support for China. 
</p>
<p>532. Algeria welcomed China&#8217;s acceptance of all the recommendations that it had formulated, 
especially those regarding the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights and the publication and implementation of the national human rights plan for 2009-2010. 
Algeria welcomed China&#8217;s willingness to share its best practices in implementing the concept of 
&#8220;scientific outlook on development&#8221; with developing countries. It stressed that the development 
and enjoyment of human rights could be harmonized with the characteristics of Chinese society. 
</p>
<p>533. Qatar appreciated the measures to implement the recommendations accepted by the 
Government, including those against child labour and those aimed at promoting the right to 
education and the rights of ethnic minorities. Qatar called upon specialized United Nations 
agencies to provide more assistance to China, particularly regarding the enjoyment by children 
of their rights. It reiterated its invitation to China to share its experiences, particularly regarding 
the right to development and poverty reduction strategies and programmes. 
</p>
<p>534. Saudi Arabia saluted China&#8217;s influential role in the Council and the very tangible efforts 
that China had made to improve and promote human rights mechanisms by implementing a 
national plan of action on all human rights while trying to strike a balance between rural and 
urban areas, particularly with respect to economic and social rights. Saudi Arabia invited China 
to pursue its efforts along these lines.  
</p>
<p>535. Uzbekistan welcomed the constructive approach displayed by China towards the universal 
periodic review process, and commended it for the work done and the results achieved in the 
promotion and protection of human rights, including political, civil, social and cultural rights and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the right to development. Uzbekistan was convinced that China&#8217;s devotion to its international 
obligations would foster a continuation of the fruitful and integrated work covering the broad 
spectrum of human rights. 
</p>
<p>536. Pakistan highlighted the fact that China, in spite of being the most populous country in the 
world, was realizing many of the Millennium Development Goals ahead of time, and that these 
best practices should be replicated by other States. It noted that China, as a responsible global 
power, had always looked after the rights and interests of the developing world, the 
acknowledgement of which had been reflected in the statements made during the review. China&#8217;s 
acceptance of a range of recommendations made in the fields of civil, political, economic, social 
and cultural rights and the establishment of an inter-agency working group to systematically 
analyse and implement these recommendations reflected the seriousness that it attached to 
human rights. Pakistan noted the promulgation of China&#8217;s first national human rights plan of 
action and the new plan on the pharmaceutical and health-care system. 
</p>
<p>537. Sri Lanka welcomed the State&#8217;s continuous role in striving for harmony, balance and fair 
play in the Council, and pointed to the three contributions of the Chinese Communist Party to 
human rights: (a) the elimination of serfdom and slavery in China, including in the province of 
Tibet; (b) the emancipation of women; and (c) the exemplary conduct of the Chinese revolution 
with regard to prisoners of war. It was particularly pleased that China had accepted a great 
majority of recommendations, including those made by Sri Lanka, and that China had rejected 
those proposals contributing to ethnic division and extremism. Sri Lanka admired China&#8217;s policy 
concerning matters of ethnic identity and thought it could learn from China&#8217;s formula. 
</p>
<p>538. The Russian Federation noted that China had expressed its willingness to implement the 
overwhelming majority of recommendations received, particularly those relating to the exercise 
of economic, social and cultural rights and that China intended to make further large-scale efforts 
to achieve the goals that it had set for itself in the promotion and protection of human rights. The 
Russian Federation pointed out that the dynamically developing Chinese economy played a vital 
role in consolidating efforts by the international community to find a way out from the world 
financial crisis. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>539. Bahrain congratulated China on having accepted so many recommendations, including 
those by Bahrain. Bahrain welcomed the launching of the first national plan for human rights in 
China, developed in accordance with the outcome of the Vienna Conference as a result of a 
democratic process and covering all human rights. Bahrain welcomed measures included in the 
plan, especially for the protection of women, children, the elderly and those with disabilities, and 
that it took account of the recommendations from countries, which showed that China paid a 
great deal of attention to human rights and wished to respect its obligations. Bahrain indicated 
that the plan would give new impetus to human rights and a new environment for the adoption of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>540. The Women&#8217;s International Democratic Federation recognized China&#8217;s important advances 
in eliminating poverty, the enjoyment of human rights by all and the construction of a modern 
socialist system. It recognized China&#8217;s particular efforts in promoting women&#8217;s, children&#8217;s and 
disabled people&#8217;s rights. The fact that China had staged major international events was an engine 
for sustained development and growth, and had enormous responsibilities towards the human 
rights of its 1.3 billion people. 
</p>
<p>541. The United Nations Association China pointed to the consultative and participatory 
process followed in the preparation of China&#8217;s national report and when drawing up the human 
rights plan of action for 2009-2010. It welcomed the plan and noted that more efforts should be 
made for its implementation, including its coordination, the periodic planning to monitor and 
check its progress and for Chinese civil society to have a role in monitoring and evaluating its 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>542. The Federation of Cuban Women noted China&#8217;s great efforts to guarantee food, education, 
health and a good life. It also noted that women in China had been given equality of rights, 
including through legal guarantees, and of measures taken to eliminate all forms of 
discrimination against women, promote gender equality for development, establish a programme 
for women&#8217;s progress, with a special body to supervise and evaluate its implementation and 
indicate women&#8217;s progress. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>543. Amnesty International believed that the Chinese authorities had undermined the value of 
the country&#8217;s review by rejecting a large number of recommendations covering a broad range of 
human rights, and had seriously undermined the credibility of the review outcome by 
manipulating the contributions of civil society to the process. It urged the Government to 
reconsider the recommendations that had not enjoyed China&#8217;s support, including regularly 
publishing figures on the death penalty; ending the death penalty and administrative detention, 
persecution for exercising rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, repression 
of national ethnic minorities, including Tibetans and Uighurs, and persecution of other religious 
practitioners; and implementing the 2008 recommendations of the Committee against Torture 
and ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Amnesty International was concerned about Macao&#8217;s 
national security law, which could be used to imprison individuals for exercising their rights to 
freedom of expression and association. 
</p>
<p>544. The China NGO Network for International Exchanges considered that China&#8217;s attitude to 
its first review had been serious and open, its report generally objective and balanced, having 
factored in opinions and suggestions from different sides and accepted supervision from the 
Chinese people and international society, as was the national human rights plan of action. It 
noted existing shortfalls in China, such as the imperfect social security system, insufficient 
protection of the rights of special groups and loose law enforcement. It urged the Government to 
use the review to take more effective steps, accept public supervision and continue international 
cooperation to upgrade the human rights protection of its people and to promote the global 
human rights cause.  
</p>
<p>545. The China Association for Preservation and Development of Tibetan Culture appreciated 
the fact that the Working Group had raised the issue of national minorities and that the human 
rights plan of action put emphasis on equality of all national minorities, and hoped that the 
Government would implement it well. With regard to priorities for improving people&#8217;s 
livelihood, including within the present financial crisis, it called for further emphasis on the lives 
of rural people in Tibet, a focus on vocational training of national minorities and for better 
legislative work to protect the rights and interests of Tibetan people. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>546. The China Care and Compassion Society submitted its constructive and critical views 
during the preparation of China&#8217;s national report and independent reports submitted to OHCHR. 
It noted that China was implementing the national plan for children&#8217;s development and called for 
more attention to be paid to the protection of migrant children and of children left behind by 
migrant parents, and to meeting their basic needs for education and medical care. It also called 
on local governments and specialized agencies to study policies for their protection. 
</p>
<p>547. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights was concerned about China&#8217;s rejection of 
many recommendations, including almost all of those seeking an improvement in the human 
rights situation of the Tibetan people. It believed that accepting those recommendations, 
including those in paragraph 82, would compel the Chinese authorities to revisit and review 
some issues affecting the Tibetan people, including Order No. 5, issued by the State Council of 
China, that interferes in an ancient religious procedure and tradition of the confirmation of 
reincarnates of Tibetan Buddhism, and ending the &#8220;strike hard&#8221; campaign and education 
programmes that forced Tibetans to denounce their spiritual leader.  
</p>
<p>548. In a joint statement, the Society for Threatened Peoples and Reporters without Borders 
noted that one of the many recommendations rejected by China concerned granting access to 
Tibetan areas, including for OHCHR and other United Nations bodies. It believed that this 
position contradicted China&#8217;s pledges and commitments to the Council. It urged the Chinese 
authorities to open Tibetan areas for visits, welcomed the authorities&#8217; intention to invite the 
High Commissioner in response to the March 2008 request, and urged China to respond 
positively to a follow-up visit of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion and belief. 
</p>
<p>549. Mouvement contre le racisme et pour l&#8217;amiti&#233; entre les peuples, in a joint statement with 
Interfaith International and the Asian Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Network, deeply regretted 
the fact that the majority of recommendations had not been accepted by China, including for the 
resumption of dialogue between the Government of China and representatives of the 
Dalai Lama. They believed that the present impasse had arisen after the rejection by the Chinese 
authorities of the requested memorandum on genuine autonomy for Tibetan people of 2007. 
They recommended that the authorities seriously engage with the Dalai Lama&#8217;s representatives, 
as urged by the Secretary-General, and introduce laws and regulations in accordance with the 
regional ethnic autonomy law.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>550. Human Rights Watch listed the human rights issues on which China had rejected every 
recommendation. It drew attention to paragraphs 70, 71 and 104 of the report containing 
assertions that were manifestly removed from reality, noting the continued suppression of any 
reference to the Beijing massacre of peaceful protestors of 3 and 4 June 1989; to the fact that an 
individual faced State charges for having compiled a list of names of children killed during the 
2008 Sichuan earthquake; that the country&#8217;s once most prominent lawyer had disappeared for 
over six months after having been taken into custody; and that just a week earlier, more than 
15 prominent human rights defenders had been victims of arbitrary disbarment on account of the 
sensitive nature of the cases they had represented. Human Rights Watch believed that China 
seemed to equate any expression of concern over the situation in Tibetan areas with attempts to 
politicize the issue. 
</p>
<p>551. The China Society for Human Rights Studies noted that the All-China Women&#8217;s 
Federation was working on a draft law concerning domestic violence, and hoped that it would be 
adopted soon. In a recent report, the China Society had expressed concern about the livelihood of 
migrant workers. Its recommendations had aroused the Government&#8217;s attention. The Society had 
carried out a project with OHCHR on civil society participation in the work of treaty bodies and 
hoped that China would continue to cooperate with OHCHR and consider future concrete 
technical cooperation projects.   
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>552. China thanked all for their support and encouragement. The Government of China 
would study carefully the comments and recommendations made by some countries and 
non-governmental organizations. China welcomed well-intentioned criticisms and constructive 
recommendations, but was resolutely against any assault or allegation out of political motive or 
prejudice, or fabrication of lies.  
</p>
<p>553. China wished to set the record straight. In Tibet, China had abolished, 50 years earlier, 
dark theocratic feudal serfdom, sparking historic socio-economic progress there. People of all 
ethnicities in Tibet enjoyed wide-ranging human rights and freedoms inconceivable for Tibetan 
serfs under the rule of the Dalai Lama. The Central Government of China was sincere in its </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>contacts and talks with the Dalai Lama&#8217;s personal representatives. The present obstacle lay in the 
Dalai clique&#8217;s refusal to give up its stance, which was virtually for Tibetan independence and 
non-stop activities to split China.  
</p>
<p>554. Concerning the political disturbance of 1989, the Government and people of China had 
already come to a clear conclusion. In 30 years of reform and opening up, China had attained 
tremendous achievements in economic and social development, proving that the socialism with 
Chinese characteristics followed by China was commensurate with its national particularities and 
the fundamental interests of the utmost majority of its people.  
</p>
<p>555. In the review process, the Chinese delegation had accepted recommendations from both 
developed and developing countries, concerning its economic, social and cultural rights as well 
as its civil and political rights. The fact that China had not accepted a few recommendations was 
due to complicated factors. Concerning all those recommendations, China affirmed its readiness 
to study them further. 
</p>
<p>556. Through its political, economic and social strategies and programmes, China would fully 
implement the accepted recommendations and the reasonable elements of other 
recommendations. China was confident that, when it returned for its second review, its national 
human rights report would be a scoreboard with inspiring human rights progress.   
</p>
<p><b>Azerbaijan 
</b>557. The review of Azerbaijan was held on 4 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
(a) the national report submitted by Azerbaijan in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/AZE/1); (b) the compilation prepared by 
OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/AZE/2); (c) the summary 
prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/AZE/3). 
</p>
<p>558. At its 17th and 18th meetings, on 11 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the 
outcome of the review on Azerbaijan (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>559. The outcome of the review on Azerbaijan comprised the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/20), the views of Azerbaijan concerning the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/20/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>560. Azerbaijan thanked all the countries that had participated in its review, adding that 
constructive recommendations made would undoubtedly contribute to furthering human rights 
protection and promotion in Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p>561. The delegation of Azerbaijan announced that it had accepted the majority of 
recommendations in whole or in part. Various ministries and institutions had been involved in 
preparing its response to the recommendations, which were also discussed in the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
Office with governmental and non-governmental representatives. The Government was also 
considering establishing a working group of governmental and non-governmental organization 
representatives for implementation.  
</p>
<p>562. Among the accepted recommendations were those concerning further institutional 
strengthening in the area of human rights. It highlighted that, in March 2009, significant 
constitutional reforms had been passed, as detailed in its written response to recommendations. 
Provisions to prohibit unlawful interference in private and family life, on the right to equality, 
the rights of children, freedom of religion and the right to obtain information had been enhanced. 
A new form of direct democracy had also been included in the Constitution, granting the right of 
legislative initiative to 40,000 voters. A national strategy to increase transparency and combat 
corruption had been decreed and a national plan for the period 2007-2011 adopted to implement 
the strategy. 
</p>
<p>563. Having accepted recommendations on further measures to prevent violence against 
women, Azerbaijan was taking social, economic and legislative measures. The definition of 
&#8220;discrimination on the grounds of sex&#8221; had been enhanced in the law on gender equality adopted 
in 2006, which included &#8220;any demonstration of differentiation and superiority for reason of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>gender that limit or impede equal implementation of rights&#8221;. A draft law on the elimination of 
domestic violence contained, inter alia, provisions on the establishment of rehabilitation centres 
for women and child victims of violence in various parts of Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p>564. Azerbaijan had accepted recommendations relating to the prohibition of corporal 
punishment and cruel treatment of children, the enhancement of educational programmes, and 
measures for the social integration of children without parental supervision that were victims of 
sexual exploitation and physical violence. Recommendations to continue with institutional 
measures to increase the effectiveness of human rights protection had also been accepted. The 
above-mentioned constitutional amendments also included provisions prohibiting the recruitment 
of children under 15 years of age and the involvement of children in work that threatened their 
lives, health and morals. Children deprived of parental care and guardianship were in the charge 
of the State. A special norm had been stipulated in the Constitution on State monitoring of 
children&#8217;s rights. Azerbaijan also cited a number of laws on children&#8217;s rights, including with 
regard to child trafficking and homelessness. 
</p>
<p>565. With regard to recommendations on the effective realization of the national plan of action 
against human trafficking and the provision of assistance to victims, Azerbaijan had accepted 
these and noted that wide awareness-raising campaigns had been held involving 
non-governmental organizations; special websites and television programmes had been created; 
and social research was conducted to understand the causes and prevent perpetration of such 
crimes.  
</p>
<p>566. Azerbaijan had accepted some recommendations regarding the effective realization of the 
rights of foreigners and stateless persons in accordance with treaty body recommendations. It 
had noted improvements in its collection of statistics on labour migration and the elaboration of 
guidelines on granting work permits or immigration status. On 4 March 2009, the President of 
the Republic had signed a decree with a view to simplifying procedures granting permission to 
foreigners and stateless persons for residence and employment. The simplified procedures 
allowed such individuals to leave and return to Azerbaijan with passports and relevant 
certificates issued by the State migration service. A draft migration code was also being 
prepared. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>567. Regarding recommendations on the further promotion of religious tolerance, Azerbaijan 
was ready to share its experience and the existing practice, given its notably high level of 
tolerance and respect for various ethnic groups and religions over the centuries. The promotion 
of cross-cultural and interreligious dialogue remained one of the priorities of the foreign policy 
of Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p>568. Azerbaijan had accepted recommendations to improve living conditions further in prisons 
and to resolve the issues of overcrowding and insufficient health care therein, detailing the 
measures taken and envisaged in this regard. In May 2009, the new building of the Baku 
detention Centre of the penitentiary service, compliant with international standards, has been 
opened for use. At the same time, following the amnesty act of 17 March 2009, 9,000 convicts 
had been released. 
</p>
<p>569. With regard to the recommendation to reform provisions on defamation in criminal law, 
Azerbaijan noted that a special working group, as detailed in its written response, had been 
established. 
</p>
<p>570. Azerbaijan disagreed with allegations about alleged pressure or physical violence against 
journalists and human rights defenders, allegations that had resulted from misinformation. 
Equality of each person before the law was a fundamental principle, and applied to all, regardless 
of their professional occupation and work status. However, on the basis of the recent amnesty 
act, four mass media representatives had been released from detention facilities. The President 
also issued a decree in April 2009 establishing a State support fund for the development of mass 
media with $1.625 million. 
</p>
<p>571. Regarding claims of alleged impediment to the activities of human rights groups, it noted 
that, as a result of measures taken in recent years, the situation of non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations and human rights defenders had improved. More than 140 human rights 
non-governmental organizations had been registered in Azerbaijan. 
</p>
<p>572. The delegation had also clarified in its written response to recommendations in this regard 
that foreign radio broadcasting was not banned in Azerbaijan.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>573. The delegation committed to adopting a whole series of recommendations to improve the 
living conditions of internally displaced persons further. The Government was carrying out a 
consistent policy in this area. The last tent villages in Azerbaijan had been dismantled and more 
than 70,000 internally displaced persons provided with favourable housing and employment. The 
poverty rate among internally displaced persons and refugees had fallen from 74 to 30 per cent. 
During the same period, $1.25 million had been allocated to the social protection of refugees and 
internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>574. With regard to the elimination of the root causes of poverty and the solving of social 
problems, Azerbaijan had accepted the recommendation and was ready to share its practice. To 
ensure the realization of social and economic rights, the Government had adopted States 
programmes on, inter alia, poverty reduction, sustainable development, employment strategies 
and the socio-economic progress of regions. As a result of policies and measures taken, the 
poverty rate had fallen considerably.  
</p>
<p>575. Azerbaijan expressed its readiness to periodically submit information on the 
implementation of the recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the 
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>576. The United Arab Emirates noted the importance that Azerbaijan attached to human rights 
and the steps taken to harmonize legislation with international law to protect human rights. It 
expressed satisfaction on the establishment of programmes to combat poverty and provide work 
opportunities to its citizens. It noted the efforts to ensure sustainable development and the rights 
of women and children. It also noted the efforts being made in the areas of health and education. 
</p>
<p>577. Qatar commended Azerbaijan for its constructive cooperation and openness throughout the 
review process. It appreciated the efforts to protect and strengthen human rights, especially 
through the constitutional and legal changes adopted in recent years. Those changes had been 
intended to strengthen and protect human rights in accordance with international human rights 
and humanitarian law. It noted that, for a number of years, Azerbaijan had witnessed 
considerable economic growth, which had facilitated the attainment of economic and social 
policies. Such policies, it added, were designed to raise living standards and the social protection </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of Azerbaijani people, with the view to attaining the Millennium Development Goals. Qatar 
trusted that the Government would meet the challenges ahead, particularly relating to children&#8217;s 
rights and the rights of refugees and internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>578. Algeria commended Azerbaijan for the spirit of cooperation displayed in the framework of 
its review, noting that 80 per cent of the recommendations had been accepted. It noted with 
appreciation Azerbaijan&#8217;s transparency and its constructive role played in the Council. Algeria 
also commended it for its efforts to promote and protect human rights, especially economic and 
social rights, by implementing policies aimed at alleviating poverty and increasing employment, 
in line with Algeria&#8217;s recommendations. Algeria expressed its satisfaction at Azerbaijan&#8217;s efforts 
to tackle the problem of violence against women, including domestic violence, as recommended 
by Algeria. It encouraged further steps in this regard. Algeria underlined Azerbaijan&#8217;s progress 
in ensuring the rights of the child and access to education for all children. 
</p>
<p>579. Uzbekistan commended Azerbaijan for the consistent steps taken to uphold human rights 
and fundamental freedoms in the framework of its international obligations and in national 
legislation. The results of this commitment and Azerbaijan&#8217;s serious approach to the universal 
periodic review had created the prerequisites for its active and transparent participation in all 
stages of the process. Uzbekistan was convinced that Azerbaijan&#8217;s commitments to its 
international obligations meant a continuation of efforts to enhance and strengthen the promotion 
and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>580. Pakistan noted that Azerbaijan, a founding member of the Council, had constructively 
participated in its institution-building. It acknowledged Azerbaijan&#8217;s principled positions, open 
and constructive approach to the universal periodic review and frank responses to the issues 
raised. It noted that Azerbaijan had accepted a majority of the recommendations made. It 
highlighted Azerbaijan&#8217;s follow-up to many of these recommendations through the establishment 
of a working group. It noted particularly the constitutional reforms providing additional human 
rights guarantees, the steps taken to empower women and eliminate all forms of violence against 
them, and the measures to enhance children&#8217;s rights, religious intolerance and penitentiary 
services. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>581. The Russian Federation thanked the delegation of Azerbaijan for the detailed information it 
provided to the Council plenary. It believed that Azerbaijan&#8217;s review fully met the requirements 
of General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Council resolution 5/1. This was the result of the 
serious and constructive attitude shown by Azerbaijan at all stages of the universal periodic 
review process. The Russian Federation stated that participation in the review was further 
evidence of Azerbaijan&#8217;s active engagement towards international cooperation in human rights. 
It expressed the hope that the Government of Azerbaijan would be highly successful in 
implementing all obligations undertaken during its review process. 
</p>
<p>582. Saudi Arabia stated that Azerbaijan&#8217;s presentation concerning the recommendations made 
during its review had reflected a positive and effective approach towards the machinery of the 
Council. It noted that Azerbaijan had accepted the majority of recommendations. Saudi Arabia 
stated that Azerbaijan&#8217;s cooperation with United Nations procedures and mechanisms and its 
determination to continue this positive dialogue had made clear the importance it attached to 
human rights. It also noted Azerbaijan&#8217;s determination to promote the civil, cultural, political 
and social rights of its citizens. The review had provided a useful opportunity to learn about 
Azerbaijani efforts to develop legislation and institutions to promote and protect human rights. 
Saudi Arabia commended Azerbaijan for its efforts and encouraged it to continue in this 
direction. 
</p>
<p>583. Egypt commended Azerbaijan for its progress in economic and social development, 
particularly on the eradication of poverty. It highlighted Azerbaijan&#8217;s special attention to 
achieving gender equality through its national human rights infrastructure. Egypt welcomed 
Azerbaijan&#8217;s commitment to cooperation with human rights bodies and mechanisms, including 
the Working Group. It expressed its confidence that Azerbaijan would make all efforts to 
implement its national plans and strategies in all areas of human rights in cooperation with 
human rights bodies and mechanisms. Egypt also believed in Azerbaijan&#8217;s commitment to 
implement the recommendations that it had accepted in line with its national priorities. 
</p>
<p>584. China noted the importance that Azerbaijan attached to the universal periodic review and 
the action taken to follow up on recommendations. It cited Azerbaijan&#8217;s constitutional reform as 
a major step in improving its rule of law. It also noted the new laws on the rights of the child and 
protection of migrants, with a simplified definition of the term &#8220;migrant&#8221;, which would </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>contribute to the protection of their rights. It cited measures to combat violence against women 
and children and the implementation of a national programme of action on human rights. It 
expressed its confidence that, with these efforts, Azerbaijan would overcome the impact of the 
financial crisis and continue to promote and protect human rights by seriously implementing the 
programme of action and the review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>585. Bahrain expressed its appreciation for the positive steps taken by Azerbaijan towards the 
implementation of a number of recommendations. It commended Azerbaijan for its efforts to 
promote equal rights between men and women and to develop policies and plans to ensure that 
education met the needs of society. It noted the programmes, projects and workshops to train 
judges and strengthen judicial reform, as well as the efforts made with regard to the rights of 
refugees and internally displaced persons and to ensuring their political participation and 
enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>586. The Commission for Human Rights of Azerbaijan (Ombudsman) stated that the 
Ombudsman had conducted wide-scale work related to the universal periodic review, including 
organizing a training session with the participation of international experts, representatives of 
</p>
<p>State bodies and civil society. On recommendation 1, it noted that a presidential decree had 
designated the Ombudsman in January 2009 as the national preventive mechanism envisaged by 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture. Regarding recommendations 6, 8, 9 and 
10, it stated that several legislative acts and State programmes had been adopted on women&#8217;s 
rights, gender equality and the fight against violence. It said that these issues had always been 
the focus of attention of the Ombudsman&#8217;s activities. The Ombudsman considered it necessary to 
establish crisis centres for women and children exposed to violence, for children deprived of 
parental care and, ultimately, to adopt a law on domestic violence. On recommendation 19, the 
Ombudsman made proposals for interreligious and intercultural dialogue and noted that 
Azerbaijan, as a multi-religious State, supported freedom of religion through the principles of 
unity and diversity. The Ombudsman committed to collaborating, as a national human rights 
institution, with the State in implementing the review recommendations. 
</p>
<p>587. Human Rights Watch was pleased to note that Azerbaijan had extended a standing 
invitation to all special procedures. It said the review process had brought a spotlight on a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>number of core areas of concern that it had raised with the Government, including harassment 
and intimidation of human rights defenders, violation of freedom of assembly, politically 
motivated arrests and prosecutions, and torture and ill-treatment in police custody. Improvements 
were even more acutely needed in the field of media freedom, which have steadily deteriorated 
over the past few years because of, inter alia, the use of criminal libel and other criminal charges 
to stifle critical reporting and imprison journalists. It urged the Government to accept and 
implement all recommendations from the review process, particularly in the area of media 
freedom. Specifically, it should release journalists imprisoned on politically motivated charges 
immediately and decriminalize libel. 
</p>
<p>588. Cercle de recherche sur les droits et les devoirs de la personne humaine expressed its 
appreciation for the ongoing reform process in the field of human rights and encouraged 
Azerbaijan to continue in that direction, in spite of the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh, 
which it condemned, as well as the Armenian occupying forces. Through its plans to establish an 
office in the country in the future, it would continue to support Azerbaijan in the implementation 
of its international commitments and obligations. 
</p>
<p>589. The Federation for Women and Family Planning commended Azerbaijan for its 
commitment to gender equality. With regard to recommendations in paragraphs 69 and 90 of the 
Working Group report, it stressed the importance of addressing sexual harassment. In this regard, 
it called on Azerbaijan to conduct research and public awareness campaigns, put in place 
structures for reporting rape, train law-enforcement personnel and implement strong measures 
against corruption. It also called for education campaigns about gender roles and the value of 
women and girls, to reduce sex-selective abortions and protect women&#8217;s rights. It called on 
Azerbaijan to consider recommendations 26 and 48, to train law enforcement and judicial 
officials on the protection of children, women and persons of minority sexual orientation or 
gender identity. It called for proper investigations into claims of police blackmailing, harassment 
and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and for the punishment of 
those responsible, as well as administrative and legal frameworks to eradicate such practices. It 
requested that Azerbaijan ensure that non-governmental organizations, including those 
supporting vulnerable groups, were free to register and operate without State interference or fear 
of reprisals. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>590. The Al-Hakim Foundation thanked Azerbaijan for its cooperation with human rights 
mechanisms and its commitment to respecting universal periodic review recommendations. It 
urged Azerbaijan to continue efforts to strengthen its institutional framework and to spread a 
culture of human rights. It indicated that Azerbaijan should establish a mechanism involving 
Government and civil society representatives to implement the recommendations. It stressed the 
importance of establishing programmes to combat violence against women and children, 
facilitate access to justice and equity for all victims of domestic violence, and reparation for 
victims. It also stressed the importance of implementing a national plan to combat trafficking in 
persons and the need to provide necessary assistance to victims. It commended the fact that, 
since 2006, there had been a forum for dialogue among civilizations and religions. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>591. Azerbaijan thanked all speakers, in particular non-governmental organizations, and 
reiterated its support for the universal periodic review and cooperation with Governments and 
non-governmental organizations. The recommendations mentioned in the statements by 
non-governmental organizations would also be taken into account to further improve human 
rights protection. 
</p>
<p>592. Azerbaijan pledged to pay even greater attention to improving gender equality and the 
protection of the rights of children, and to improving the social situation of refugees and 
internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>593. Azerbaijan believed that the elaboration of human rights was one of the greatest 
achievements of the international community, and would always support cooperation with the 
Council and the human rights machinery. 
</p>
<p><b>Mexico 
</b></p>
<p>594. The review of Mexico was held on 10 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Mexico in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/MEX/1);  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/MEX/2);  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/MEX/3). 
</p>
<p>595. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Mexico (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>596. The outcome of the review on Mexico comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/27), the oral views of Mexico concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also additional 
written information submitted by Mexico). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>597. Mexico noted that it was currently undergoing a far-reaching transformation towards a 
more democratic society, while facing enormous challenges.  
</p>
<p>598. Since the preparation of the national report, Mexico had held an intense debate on matters 
relating to human rights. In February 2009, Mexico had accepted 83 of the 91 recommendations 
made during the review. Mexico had made comments in writing to the recommendations, which 
included its position regarding the eight outstanding recommendations and information on 
relevant recent progress. 
</p>
<p>599. Mexico referred in this regard to the adoption of an initiative seeking to incorporate in the 
constitution human rights contained in international instruments the &#8220;pro persona&#8221; principle in 
the implementation of human rights norms, as well as the strengthening of the independence of 
public human rights bodies; an initiative to consider offences against journalists as federal 
offences; and the constitutional rank given to the protection of personal data. Three new laws 
had been enacted to strengthen the certification, professionalization and control of police forces 
and of the public ministry. A national academy for prison administration had been established.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>600. Mexico indicated that it had continued to promote equality, prevent and combat violence 
against women and that health centres, institutions and organizations had been mandated to 
provide medical attention to victims of sexual and domestic violence. Regarding the rights of 
indigenous people, it pointed out the establishment of specialized courts providing interpreters, 
translators and specialized public defenders. It also stressed the steps taken to guarantee the 
rights of migrants and prevent trafficking in persons, and to guarantee economic, social and 
cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>601. Mexico had taken a loan from the World Bank to strengthen the human development 
programme Oportunidades, intended to break the intergenerational poverty circle and to provide 
comprehensive care, food and education. Faced with the global financial crisis, Mexico had 
signed a national agreement for family economy and employment and a national agreement on 
labour productivity. In the area of health, it referred to its national strategy to reduce maternal 
mortality. Mexico had faced the recent epidemic of H1N1 in a responsible manner and with full 
respect for human rights and non-discrimination. 
</p>
<p>602. Regarding the eight outstanding recommendations, Mexico noted that those contained in 
paragraphs 94.1, 94.3 and 94.4 of the report of the Working Group, and in the first part of 
paragraphs 94.6 and 94.8, were either no longer applicable or had been resolved. Mexico could 
not support the recommendations made in paragraphs 94.2, 94.5 and 94.7. 
</p>
<p>603. Regarding paragraph 94.2, Mexico noted that the 2008 constitutional reform restricted the 
scope of <i>arraigo</i>, which applied only in cases of organized crime and was subject to strict legal 
control, and could only be dictated by a judge when necessary for the success of investigation, 
protection of persons or property, or when there was a founded risk of the suspect escaping 
justice. A control judge had been established to guarantee the rights of the accused and the 
victims in the procedure and to verify the legality of the process. Mexico indicated that <i>arraigo</i> 
complied with international standards, and that the accused were informed of their rights, given 
full access to a lawyer and provided with adequate defence. The <i>juicio de amparo</i> (trial for 
appeal for legal protection) could be used to appeal the decision of a control judge and guarantee 
the rights of detainees. Mexico also had a monitoring mechanism.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>604. Regarding paragraphs 94.5 and 94.7, Mexico explained that the civil legal system 
prevailed over the military system, since resolutions or decisions by military courts and military 
Supreme Court could be appealed before civil courts through <i>recurso de amparo</i> (appeal for 
legal protection). The Ministry of National Defence had accepted all the recommendations made 
by the national human rights commission. Legal steps had been taken against military personnel 
responsible for crimes, and in particular in cases of human rights violations; reparation for 
victims had been provided.  
</p>
<p>605. Mexico stressed that military jurisdiction over the conduct of the armed forces was 
provided in the Constitution and was intended to maintain military discipline, and that military 
justice had made trials before military courts more transparent and had extended the scope of 
participation of victims in them.  
</p>
<p>606. The national human rights plan for 2008-2012 had established a commitment to promote 
reforms in military justice in accordance with international commitments. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the 
Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>607. Algeria appreciated the distribution of Mexico&#8217;s written views on the recommendations. It 
welcomed the fact that Mexico had decided to follow up on the recommendations that Algeria 
had made during the review, regarding particularly domestic violence and the ill-treatment of 
children, poverty reduction and access to education. Algeria had taken note of the measures 
taken by Mexico to give effect to those recommendations, particularly the reform of the law on 
education and the adoption of the national programme for the development of indigenous 
peoples for 2009-2012. Algeria commended Mexico for its initiative within the Council 
regarding the rights of migrants, and invited it to continue to promote the universal ratification of 
the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>608. Egypt thanked Mexico for the open spirit in which it engaged in the process. It appreciated 
the attention given by Mexico to the rights of migrant workers and persons with disabilities. It 
was confident that Mexico would make all efforts to follow up on the recommendations it had 
accepted, in line with its national priorities and objectives.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>609.  The United States of America appreciated Mexico&#8217;s frank appraisal of the challenges it 
faced and acknowledged the efforts made in the area of human rights. It supported the 
recommendations made in the Working Group to bolster the Office of the Federal Special 
Prosecutor and efforts to prevent and punish violence against women and human trafficking, and 
to foster a safe environment for freedom of expression. It urged Mexico to express Government 
support for journalists as valuable witnesses in the struggle against impunity, corruption and 
lawlessness perpetuated by drug cartels and other criminal elements. A full investigation of 
human rights abuses by military and security forces and the adoption of the recommendations of 
the national human rights commission would also contribute to ending impunity.  
</p>
<p>610. Belgium stressed the importance of combating impunity and referred to the explanations 
by Mexico regarding its fight against organized crime. It regretted the decision to abolish the 
Special Prosecutor&#8217;s office for past political and social movements. While thanking the 
delegation for the information regarding the transfer of enquiries to the Attorney-General&#8217;s 
office for the specialized investigation of federal crimes, Belgium remained surprised that 
enforced disappearances or homicides during the &#8220;dirty war&#8221; had been addressed on an equal 
footing with ordinary crimes, and encouraged Mexico to establish a separate mechanism for 
enquiries relating to these crimes. Belgium welcomed the acceptance by Mexico of the 
recommendations regarding violence against women. 
</p>
<p>611. Chad noted with satisfaction that Mexico had accepted most recommendations made 
during the review, which demonstrated its attachment to human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>612. The national human rights commission of Mexico expressed confidence that 
recommendations made in the Working Group would be followed up with the participation of 
human rights institutions and civil society. It noted that the human rights of persons with 
disabilities and the right to a healthy environment had not been addressed by the Working 
Group. It requested that an integral analysis of all human rights issues be guaranteed in the 
framework of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p>613. Amnesty International noted that many recommendations made during the review 
were consistent with those of Mexican civil society. It recognized Mexico&#8217;s acceptance </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of 83 recommendations, but noted that successive Mexican Governments had made similar 
commitments to address long-standing human rights issues without delivering effective results. 
While welcoming legislative advances to combat violence against women, it noted that most 
authorities in the country had not taken measures to implement them, and that many continued to 
view the issue as a low priority. It stressed that the federal Government had failed to demonstrate 
its commitment to prevent and punish violence against women, and referred to the situation in 
Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua City and San Salvador Atenco. 
</p>
<p>614. Human Rights Watch was concerned that Mexico had not accepted recommendations 
relating to impunity for the grave human rights violations committed by the military. It stressed 
that the General Prosecutor for Military Justice had not provided one example over the last 
10 years in which military courts had convicted a military member accused of committing a 
human rights violation. It stressed that Mexico&#8217;s commitment to encourage military justice 
reform in line with its international human rights obligations would never be fulfilled if the 
military continued to claim jurisdiction over investigations of grave human rights violations 
through a system of military justice that lacked basic guarantees, and that cases in which military 
members were accused of human rights violations against civilians should be immediately 
referred to Public Ministry officials.   
</p>
<p>615. Action Canada for Population and Development noted that the conditions put to the 
criminalization of seduction by deceit (<i>estrupo</i>) of minors were not in conformity with the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Mexico should 
be encouraged to implement without delay the recommendations that it unify domestic 
legislation - particularly regarding <i>estrupo</i> - and harmonization with international law, and that it 
reform or abolish laws, regulations and practices that were discriminatory against women, with a 
view to protect their freedom, autonomy and sexual rights. 
</p>
<p>616. The International Commission of Jurists and the Centro de Derechos Humanos Miguel 
Agustin Pro Juarez referred to the need to resolve the problems of torture and arbitrary detention 
and to combat impunity. They referred to a pattern of criminalization of social protest and 
political dissidence in Oaxaca, which took the form of arbitrary detention, excessive use of force, 
the murder of political opponents and the intimidation of civil society, the media and 
independent journalists. They indicated that denial of justice for persons detained in relation to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the 2006 conflict in Oaxaca was systematic, and that there was no sanction against those 
responsible for the repression, nor for other crimes committed before and after those events, 
including enforced disappearances. 
</p>
<p>617. The Federation for Women and Family Planning appreciated the steps envisaged and taken 
by Mexico for the rights of the child, as reflected in the Working Group report. Highlighting the 
importance of comprehensive sexual education for children and youth, it was pleased that 
Mexico had hosted a gathering of ministers for health and education from Latin America and the 
Caribbean in 2008 and signed a ministerial declaration on prevention through education. It urged 
Mexico to take action to promote comprehensive sexual education in schools in order to meet the 
commitments made in the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>618. <i>Grupo de Informaci&#243;n en Reproducci&#243;n Elegida </i>stressed the recommendations made that 
Mexico harmonize national legislation with international human rights instruments. It recalled 
that recommendations regarding the abolition of <i>arraigo</i> and the revision of the definition of 
organized crime in accordance with the Palermo Protocol were pending. It noted documented 
cases where social movement leaders had been falsely accused of belonging to organized crime, 
and stressed that <i>arraigo</i> was a form of arbitrary detention used daily by security forces and 
military members. It called upon Mexico to implement these recommendations and to open a 
public debate on <i>arraigo</i>. 
</p>
<p>619. Conectas Direitos Humanos expressed its concern about the recommendations pending 
acceptance by Mexico, particularly regarding the re-establishment of the Special Prosecutor&#8217;s 
office or a similar mechanism for the investigation of past crimes. It indicated that the hearing of 
a case regarding the lack of access to justice for past crimes would take place before the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights in July 2009, which could offer a new opportunity for 
Mexico to resolve this problem. It called on the Members of the Council to accompany Mexico 
in this process. 
</p>
<p>620. The Miguel Agust&#237;n Pro Juarez Human Rights Centre noted that most recommendations 
pending related to the duty to investigate and prosecute cases of alleged human rights violations 
in civilian rather than in military courts. It emphasized the urgent need for Mexico to comply 
with these recommendations. It stressed that documented military abuses included torture, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial executions; that the number of reported violations received 
by the national human rights commission against Mexico&#8217;s Defense Department had increased 
sixfold between 2006 and 2008; and that only the investigation and prosecution of these crimes 
by independent civilian authorities could reverse the current situation. It urged the Government 
to end impunity. 
</p>
<p>621. The Social Service Agency of the Protestant Church in Germany stressed that Mexico had 
accepted recommendations on the issue of human rights defenders, but was concerned that recent 
acts had undermined those commitments, referring to two indigenous human rights defenders 
from Guerrero who had disappeared, had been tortured and executed. It stated that organizations 
had had to close their offices in Guerrero owing to threats against them and that the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights had granted provisional protection measures to 
107 human rights defenders, that had not been effectively implemented. It requested that the 
Council urge Mexico to comply with the recommendations to prevent, investigate and prosecute 
those responsible for human rights violations and that a legal framework and governmental 
programme be established to protect human rights defenders in Guerrero. 
</p>
<p>622. The Centre for Reproductive Rights recalled the 1,200 women victims of femicide and the 
situation of thousands of women and girls suffering from regressive reforms that criminalize 
abortion under any circumstance in 13 Mexican States. It stressed that access to justice remained 
a mere hope for women. It supported the recommendations to bring State and federal legislation 
in line with the general law for women&#8217;s access to a life free of violence, and for all federal, 
State and municipal authorities to implement the law. It also supported the recommendation that 
effective measures be taken to ensure that femicides were duly investigated. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>623. Mexico stressed that it had undertaken institutional mobilization and dialogue with 
stakeholders for the current review, and underscored as positive elements of the process the fact 
that all stakeholders had had a more comprehensive vision of human rights in Mexico; the 
enhanced dialogue among national stakeholders; the provision of greater foundations to the 
international vision of Mexico&#8217;s human rights situation; better focus for international aid; and the 
fact that the current exercise had enhanced and complemented international commitments. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>624. Mexico agreed that combating impunity and effectiveness of the justice system were the 
primary structural paragon for a positive transformation of the national system. The 
</p>
<p>constitutional reform of the public security and criminal justice system adopted by Congress in 
2008 had set a timetable of eight years for implementation. Mexico had extended an invitation to 
the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers. 
</p>
<p>625. Mexico reiterated the fact that organized crime was being fought with full respect for 
human rights, greater professionalization of the police and with the legal and human rights 
system monitoring and sanctioning violations in full operation. At the express request of the civil 
authority, the participation of the armed forces was temporary, in a specific geographical area, 
and purely provisional and supplementary. 
</p>
<p>626. Combating organized crime had worsened working conditions for journalists. Mexico 
condemned their harassment and would establish appropriate mechanisms to investigate and 
punish such aggressions. It particularly appreciated recommendations made by 
non-governmental organizations in this respect.  
</p>
<p>627. Mexico referred Amnesty International to paragraph 36 of the supplementary report on 
enhancing investigations relating to the murder of women in Ciudad Juarez. Responding to 
comments by Human Rights Watch and others on the functioning of the military justice, Mexico 
stressed that the Federal Government had accepted all the recommendations of the national 
human rights commission. Mexico agreed with the comments on the harmonization of 
legislation. Regarding Action Canada&#8217;s comment, it pointed out that the needed legislative 
harmonization regarding violence against women had been identified and that the Federal 
Government was working on this issue. 
</p>
<p><b>Mauritius 
</b></p>
<p>628. The review of Mauritius was held on 10 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Mauritius in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/MUS/1);  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/MUS/2); 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/MUS/3). 
</p>
<p>629. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Mauritius (see sect. C below). 
</p>
<p>630. The outcome of the review on Mauritius comprised of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/28), the views of Mauritius concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/28/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>631. The Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Mauritius to the United Nations in 
Geneva noted that the universal periodic review had offered Mauritius a unique opportunity to 
make a critical self-assessment of the human rights situation and to reflect constructively on the 
views expressed by the international community. In addition to the human rights provisions 
enshrined in the Constitution, a series of measures have been taken to ensure that all citizens of 
Mauritius, irrespective of their race, place of origin, political opinions, colour, creed or sex, were 
able to exercise effectively their civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>632. A number of legislative measures had been taken recently to promote human rights further, 
such as the Equal Opportunities Act, the HIV and AIDS Act, the Truth and Justice Commission 
Act, the Employment Relations Act and the Employment Rights Act. Mauritius reported on the 
implementation of a number of accepted recommendations:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
involvement of children in armed conflict, ratified on 12 February 2009; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Consultations were ongoing with a view to domesticating the provisions of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography and ratifying the Optional Protocol. In April 2009, Mauritius 
had announced that it had no objection to the proposed visit of the Special Rapporteur on the sale 
of children, child prostitution and child pornography to analyse the current situation and to make 
recommendations on measures to allow Mauritius to ratify the Optional Protocol. Mauritius had 
recommended that the said visit be made by the end of 2009; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Concerning the recommendation to increase efforts to ensure full compliance of 
domestic legislation with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Ministry of Women&#8217;s 
Rights, Child Development and Family Welfare was in the process of preparing a consolidated 
children&#8217;s bill; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The Government budget for 2009, recently approved by the National Assembly, 
provided for necessary funds to be allocated to the Office of the Ombudsperson for Children to 
achieve a number of important objectives and to monitor children&#8217;s rights in Mauritius; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) The Combating of Trafficking in Persons Act was passed on 21 April 2009 and was 
aimed at not only preventing human trafficking and prosecuting traffickers, but also at providing 
protection and assistance to victims of trafficking; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) A series of measures had been announced in the recent budget exercise to eradicate 
poverty, including the strengthening of the eradication of poverty programme; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) With a view to alleviating the problem of overcrowding and to providing improved 
conditions to prisoners, Mauritius planned to build a new, modern prison to accommodate 
750 detainees. The land for this purpose had been earmarked and the conceptual design was in 
progress. 
</p>
<p>633. Mauritius had also pledged to examine 13 recommendations and had drawn attention to the 
addendum to the report of the Working Group it had submitted and highlighted a few issues in 
this regard. 
</p>
<p>634. The Abolition of the Death Penalty Act had been passed in Mauritius in 1995, and all death 
sentences had been commuted by operation of the law. Since then, Mauritius has consistently </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>taken an abolitionist stand in international forums. Mauritius had co-sponsored and voted in 
favour of the resolutions 62/149 and 63/168 on a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, 
adopted by the General Assembly in 2007 and 2008.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>635. Mauritius had acceded to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees 
of 28 July 1951, but was not a party to the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees of 1967. 
Given its limited resources as a small island developing State, it would be very challenging for 
Mauritius to adopt an open policy of granting refugee status to foreigners. However, every 
application for refugee status was treated on a humanitarian basis; Mauritius indeed cooperated 
with international organizations and other States with a view to facilitating settlement of refugees 
in States willing to receive them. In practice, the principle of non-refoulement was observed with 
regard to persons claiming to be persecuted in their country of origin. 
</p>
<p>636. Given that the issue of &#8220;enforced disappearances&#8221; was of no direct relevance to the 
domestic situation in Mauritius, the ratification of the Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons from Enforced Disappearance would be given consideration in due course in the light of 
all relevant factors.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>637. With regard to the recommendation to amend constitutional provisions that affected the 
status of women, Mauritius stated that the Constitution provided for the application, in some 
cases, of personal laws with respect to adoption, marriage, divorce, burial, devolution of property 
on death or other like matters. Such laws were not to be deemed discriminatory even if they 
resulted in different treatment being afforded to different persons on the ground of creed or sex. 
The inclusion of this provision in the Constitution had been considered necessary in view of the 
fact that Mauritius was a multireligious, multiethnic and multicultural society and that 
Mauritians of different religions had to be given the freedom to practise their respective religion. 
The amendment of that provision of the Constitution was not envisaged in the short term. 
</p>
<p>638. The amendment of section 16 of the Constitution to include new forms of discrimination 
would be considered in the context of a general review of the Constitution. The Equal 
Opportunities Act, which was voted on in 2008, prohibited discrimination on grounds not 
covered in the Constitution, such as sexual orientation and HIV status. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>639. With regard to the recommendation to include marital rape as an offence under the 
proposed Sexual Offences Bill, Mauritius pointed out that there was currently no specific 
reference to the offence of marital rape. However, section 249 of the criminal code criminalized 
the offence of rape. It was also arguable that it was possible to prosecute for the offence of 
marital rape under the criminal code as it stood. However, to avoid any ambiguity, it was 
proposed to make clear reference to this offence in the Sexual Offences Bill, which was currently 
being considered by a select-committee of the National Assembly.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States of the Council 
on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>640. Algeria appreciated Mauritius&#8217; efforts to ensure the enjoyment of human rights by all its 
citizens, despite its constraints as a small island developing State. Algeria underlined the 
measures taken to speed up the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, which was 
in line with its recommendation. It noted that Mauritius had adopted a national plan on human 
rights aimed at developing and raising awareness of a human rights culture. Algeria appreciated 
the positive steps taken by Mauritius to reform its judicial system and reiterated its call to 
OHCHR to provide technical assistance to Mauritius to step up its efforts in this field. 
</p>
<p>641. Morocco noted that the universal periodic review of Mauritius, which had accepted the 
majority of recommendations, showed Mauritius&#8217; commitment to human rights and the universal 
periodic review. It stated that the dissemination of a human rights culture was essential to the 
promotion of human rights and would allow Mauritius to consolidate its achievements in 
democracy and the rule of law. Morocco thanked Mauritius for the steps taken to implement 
recommendations made during the review process, particularly Mauritius&#8217; decision regarding the 
protection of the rights of children, including through the ratification of the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child 
pornography and the elaboration of a charter on the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>642. The United States of America recognized the efforts made to create a culture of human 
rights, through, inter alia, the establishment of a human rights centre, the national human rights 
plan of action and the actions taken in the area of poverty eradication. The United States made 
reference to the efforts made to promote human rights education, especially for law enforcement </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and judicial officials, and to carry out investigations into all violations and deaths of persons in 
custody attributable to police officers. The United States supported recommendations regarding 
discrimination against women, and expressed its hope that Mauritius would finalize and adopt 
soon the sexual offences bill currently under consideration, and ensure that marital rape was 
deemed a punishable offence in the legal code. 
</p>
<p>643. Canada welcomed the commitments and impressive achievements of Mauritius in the field 
of human rights since its independence and noted that Mauritius remained a model of stability 
and democracy in the region. It indicated that, as members of the Francophonie and the 
Commonwealth, Canada and Mauritius shared common values, including respect for human 
rights, the rule of law and democracy. Canada appreciated the fact that all recommendations that 
it had formulated during the review had been accepted by Mauritius. It encouraged Mauritius to 
continue its efforts to promote and protect human rights both at home and around the world. 
</p>
<p>644. India noted that Mauritius&#8217; efforts and achievements exemplified the complementarities 
between civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights on the 
other. India hoped that an early adoption of the national plan of action on human rights would 
lead to the strengthening of a culture of human rights, and commended Mauritius for having 
been able to establish human rights institutions such as the national human rights commission, 
the Ombudsman and the Ombudsperson for Children.  
</p>
<p>645. Maldives noted that, as a small island State, Mauritius was vulnerable to external economic 
and environmental shocks and faced important resources constraints. It indicated that, despite 
these challenges, Mauritius had achieved much, including in the field of human rights. It noted 
that Mauritius had been active in integrating principles contained in major international human 
rights instruments into national laws and practices. It commended Mauritius for having 
established strong independent institutions, including a human rights commission and an 
anti-corruption commission. Maldives noted that challenges nevertheless remained but, with the 
country&#8217;s extremely proactive and progressive policies, the legal framework for tackling such 
challenges was in place. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>646. Chad congratulated Mauritius on having complemented the information already provided 
in its national report. Chad noted with satisfaction that Mauritius had accepted most 
recommendations, despite its insufficient financial resources, and called on the international 
community to assist Mauritius in this regard. 
</p>
<p>647. Botswana congratulated Mauritius on having gone through this important new process of 
the United Nations human rights system and on its clear pledge of genuine dialogue with other 
States and non-State actors. It noted that Mauritius had demonstrated its commitment to human 
rights and had noted with satisfaction that Mauritius had accepted most of the recommendations 
formulated during the review. Botswana encouraged Mauritius in the follow-up and 
implementation stages. 
</p>
<p>648. Nigeria commended the openness, transparency and commitment with which Mauritius 
had engaged in the review process. Nigeria had taken note of the acceptance by Mauritius of 
almost all recommendations, including Nigeria&#8217;s call for efforts to attain the full enjoyment of 
civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights for its population. 
</p>
<p>649. Senegal thanked Mauritius for the clear replies on the recommendations made during the 
discussions of the Working Group. Senegal noted that the acceptance of the majority of 
recommendations reflected the determination of Mauritius to work towards a true culture of 
human rights, in particular through the implementation of its national plan of action on human 
</p>
<p>rights, which aimed at consolidating fundamental human rights, specifically those of vulnerable 
groups. 
</p>
<p>650. New Zealand noted Mauritius&#8217; constructive and proactive approach to its review. It noted 
that Mauritius had made enormous progress, with limited resources, to improve the 
implementation of its human rights obligations and to promote good governance and democratic 
values. It noted Mauritius&#8217; response to the recommendation that steps be taken to amend 
constitutional provisions that could negatively affect the status of women, and encouraged 
Mauritius to intensify awareness-raising campaigns on women&#8217;s rights. It recognized that 
Mauritius had proposed to include marital rape as an offence under the Sexual Offences Bill, and 
urged Mauritius to ensure its inclusion in the final legislation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>651. The European International Lesbian and Gay Association commended Mauritius for its 
leadership in supporting the joint statement on human rights, sexual orientation and gender 
identity delivered before the General Assembly in December 2008. It welcomed Mauritius&#8217; 
acceptance of the recommendation to finalize and adopt the Sexual Offences Bill, which would 
decriminalize sexual activity between consenting adults, and enquired about the current status of 
the bill. The Association commended Mauritius for having adopted the Equal Opportunities Act, 
which prohibited discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and HIV status, and 
thanked Mauritius for its leadership on these important human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>652. The Arab Commission for Human<b> </b>Rights welcomed the acceptance by Mauritius of a large 
number of recommendations. It asked about the status of the bill referred to in recommendation 3 
regarding the handling of police complaints. It also asked for more information on issues relating 
to the situation in prisons, as contained in recommendations 22, 23b, 31 and 32, which were all 
accepted. The Commission requested more information on recommendation 9 contained in 
paragraph 81 regarding the open invitation to mandate-holders of Council special procedures. It 
recommended that Mauritius submit a mid-term review report on the implementation of its 
recommendations and voluntary commitments to the Council at its fourteenth session. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>653. Mauritius indicated that it had taken note of all the interventions, including those of civil 
society, and that it would consider them with an open mind, but within the confines of its 
Constitution, which, since independence, had served Mauritius, a multiracial and multicultural 
country, very well. Mauritius remained firmly committed to upholding the fundamental 
principles of international human rights law and practice and to providing its population with the 
highest level of civil and political rights as well as economic, social and cultural rights. Mauritius 
was also engaged in expanding the breadth and depth of a rights-based approach to economic 
development, social justice and human rights, with the aim of making the country a human rights 
island. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Jordan 
</b></p>
<p>654. The review of Jordan was held on 13 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Jordan in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/JOR/1); 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/JOR/2); 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/JOR/3). 
</p>
<p>655. At its 18th meeting, on 11 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Jordan (see sect. C below). 
</p>
<p>656. The outcome of the review on Jordan comprised the report of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/29), the views of Jordan concerning the 
recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies presented 
before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group. 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>657. The delegation of Jordan stated that, with regard to the recommendations appearing under 
paragraph 93 of the report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, Jordan 
accepted recommendations 1 to 4, 6 to 11, 13 and 15. Information on recommendation 5 would 
be provided at a later stage. Regarding recommendation 12, Jordan accepted it in part and had 
been implementing it in accordance with its national and international obligations. With regard 
to recommendation 14, Jordan had established a national committee that would be preparing a 
draft law in line with international standards. The delegation underlined the fact that Jordan had 
not only accepted the above recommendations, but had also started and/or enhanced their 
implementation. Jordan remained committed to updating the Council thereon. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>658. With regard to recommendation 1, the Government was preparing a study in cooperation 
with relevant authorities aiming at the accession to the Convention for the Protection of All 
</p>
<p>Persons from Enforced Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>659. Regarding recommendations 2 to 8, article 340 of the penal code had been amended in 
order to cancel the pretext for honour crimes. The Government, in cooperation with relevant 
authorities, had prepared a new draft law compatible with international conventions, amending 
article 97 of the penal code to strengthen the minimum sanction, and for that purpose, to remove 
the alleviating circumstances clause for honour crimes. 
</p>
<p>660. To further the status of women, the Government had enacted many laws and legislation, 
particularly the Family Protection Code. Among other initiatives, Jordan mentioned 
(a) a project by the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office on alimony fund to assist divorced women and 
widows; (b) a Family Affairs Division, set up on 29 April 2009, to draw up policies giving 
further protection to vulnerable groups; and (c) a special unit for human rights in the Ministry of 
Social Development, which would provide women with training on the promotion of a gender 
perspective and to further the role of women as equal partners in the development process. 
Correctional and rehabilitation centres were actively cooperating with non-governmental 
organizations and civil society to solve the situation of women detained without charge.  
</p>
<p>661. With regard to recommendations 9 and 10, the Government had amended the penal code in 
order to make the definition of torture compatible with the Committee against Torture. The 
amendment stipulated that any employee or official who tried to extract a confession would be 
sanctioned. 
</p>
<p>662. The national centre for human rights issued periodic reports, including recommendations to 
improve the situation of detainees. The Council of Ministers had adopted the Karama project to 
combat torture and to provide training in cooperation with a number of governmental and 
non-governmental organizations and civil society. Many lawyers had been trained on how to 
implement the international convention, and a guidebook on how to register and monitor acts of 
torture had been issued. Furthermore, a code of conduct was being developed to monitor such 
violations. Other initiatives included: (a) a committee on reform and rehabilitation, headed by the 
Director of Public Security and with the membership of many ministries, entrusted with </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation programmes; (b) a committee on public freedoms, established by Parliament, 
which could visit all prisons of the country to make sure that all detainees enjoyed proper 
treatment; and (c) an office to receive the complaints of families of detainees, dealing with, 
inter alia, relocation to other centres and special visit needs. Additional permits to visit the 
rehabilitation centres were now available to the International Committee of the Red Cross and 
other non-governmental organizations. A total of 813 visits had been made in 2008.  
</p>
<p>663. With regard to recommendation 11 on administrative detention, the Crime Prevention Act 
was a law to prevent crimes, particularly murder, honour crimes and theft, through the action of 
the Administrative Governor, whose resolutions and decisions were reviewed by the judiciary 
and the High Court of Justice, to make sure that the enforcement of authority was not arbitrary 
and that abuses were sanctioned. The Act was applied to three categories of people, according to 
their level of danger in society. The Director of Public Security periodically examined the 
situation of detainees, releasing those who were not considered a real threat to society. A total 
of 700 people had been released in the first third of 2009. 
</p>
<p>664. With regard to recommendation 12, Jordan noted that there was no penal sanction for a 
person who changed religion. Any discrimination practised stemmed from single individuals. 
The Government tried to protect persons converting to another religion from any act against 
them. 
</p>
<p>665. With regard to recommendation 13, civil society organizations called for the amendment of 
the law on societies. The Government had responded by convening many meetings with the 
unions, and a draft amended law was prepared with the collaboration of many civil society 
organizations. The draft would be reviewed at the special session of Parliament in June 2009.  
</p>
<p>666. With regard to recommendation 14, the Government was currently reviewing the proposal 
for the establishment of an independent electoral commission, and a committee had been set up 
to prepare a draft law on elections.  
</p>
<p>667. Regarding recommendation 15, Jordan noted that the law on crimes of terrorism was a 
preventive tool designed to respect public rights. Crimes punishable under this law included the 
financing of terrorist acts and recruitment into terrorist groups. Allegations would be duly 
studied by the court to ascertain intention and premeditation. Furthermore, the law did not grant </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>any special authority to the security apparatus, and security measures must be in conformity to 
the penal law applicable to these crimes, within laws and regulations on human rights. 
Competent authorities continued to work on the law. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>668. The United Arab Emirates noted that the acceptance by Jordan of most of the review 
recommendations was a clear expression of its determination to cooperate with human rights 
mechanisms. It was proud of the serious work done by Jordan in integrating human rights 
principles into its national legislation, in accordance with the international instruments that it had 
ratified. It noted the efforts made to promote the rights of the child through the national plan of 
action for children, and mentioned the provision of training and awareness-raising courses on 
human rights in the judicial system. Particularly, the United Arab Emirates commended Jordan 
for its efforts to promote the right to health and medical services. 
</p>
<p>669. Algeria commended Jordan for its efforts to advance the rights of women, combat violence 
against women, allow them to participate in decision-making and fight against some social 
prejudices. Jordan had played a pioneering role in the protection of the rights of persons with 
disabilities by creating a supreme council for persons with disabilities and adopting a national 
strategy to promote their rights. It called on Jordan to share its experience in this regard with 
other countries. It welcomed Jordan&#8217;s efforts to promote the rights of migrant workers in keeping 
with Algeria&#8217;s recommendation. Algeria indicated that it had asked Jordan to request technical 
assistance from OHCHR in order to submit overdue treaty bodies periodic reports. 
</p>
<p>670. Qatar commended Jordan for having accepted 41 recommendations, which was a reflection 
of its cooperation in dealing with the universal periodic review and other human rights 
mechanisms. It particularly valued the constitutional and legal guarantees incorporated in the 
Jordanian legal arsenal, and commended Jordan&#8217;s economic, social and cultural development in 
accordance with the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>671. Bahrain commended Jordan for the initiatives taken to implement a number of 
recommendations stemming from the universal periodic review. It welcomed Jordan&#8217;s efforts to 
continue implementing national policies, including the national plan of action for children. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Bahrain indicated that Jordan had continued to disseminate a culture of human rights and to 
provide human rights education and training to justice and law enforcement officers. It valued 
Jordan&#8217;s efforts to empower women and to promote their role in the society. 
</p>
<p>672. Saudi Arabia welcomed Jordan&#8217;s positive attitude to the recommendations, in particular its 
determination to continue its cooperation with OHCHR. It also welcomed the acceptance of 
Saudi Arabia&#8217;s recommendation regarding the right to education and the dissemination of a 
culture of human rights through school curricula. It commended Jordan for having adopted 
national laws and practical measures on human rights, despite many economic and social 
obstacles. 
</p>
<p>673. China noted with appreciation Jordan&#8217;s responsible attitude in participating in the universal 
periodic review and in accepting the great majority of recommendations. Under its Constitution, 
Jordan had established a relatively developed framework for human rights protection, upgraded 
protection practices and established a number of relevant institutions. The poverty rate had 
decreased, the health-care system was better developed and the human rights education system 
was improving. China appreciated the information on women&#8217;s rights and the penal system. It 
believed that the Government would continue to conduct exchanges and cooperation with the 
international community in order to improve the country&#8217;s human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>674. Palestine thanked Jordan for its positive attitude regarding the recommendations and 
applauded all the initiatives taken to implement them on the ground. It noted that Jordan had 
acceded to most international human rights instruments and strove to remove many of its 
reservations to some of the human rights instruments. The Constitution of Jordan guaranteed the 
protection of all civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, in accordance with 
international standards. Palestine added that Jordan was at the forefront of adopting a legislation 
to protect women and the family. 
</p>
<p>675. Morocco commended Jordan for its constructive participation in the universal periodic 
review and its openness and political will in furthering efforts to promote and protect human 
rights and strengthen the rule of law, in accordance with its religious and cultural specificities 
and international obligations. Jordan had accepted most of the recommendations and committed 
to examine and deal positively with the remaining ones. It expressed its recognition to Jordan for </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>having accepted Morocco&#8217;s recommendations. Morocco believed that the international 
community and the relevant institutions should support Jordan, in terms of technical and 
financial assistance, to help the government to implement the accepted recommendations 
stemming from the universal periodic review.  
</p>
<p>676. Indonesia was encouraged by the new measures taken to promote the status of women and 
to eliminate all forms of violence and discrimination against women. It applauded Jordan for its 
national strategic plan to protect the rights of people with disabilities and children. Indonesia 
commended Jordan for its efforts to engage in viable policy and institutional reforms, which 
were in accordance with international standards, and supported its efforts to achieve 
socio-economic development.  
</p>
<p>677. The United States of America commended Jordan for the steps taken to promote human 
rights and human welfare. It noted the concern regarding honour crimes and supported the 
recommendations aimed at strengthening legislation to protect women from violence and 
ensuring that perpetrators of honour crimes were prosecuted and received sentences 
commensurate to the gravity of their crimes. The United States shared the concerns regarding the 
law on associations and supported the recommendations that Jordan enact amendments or 
revisions that would provide civil society groups with the broadest possible freedom of 
assembly. It welcomed the formation of a committee to work with civil society on promoting 
modifications to this law. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>678. The National Centre for Human Rights indicated that steps should be taken to reform the 
legislation to reduce the application of the death penalty; fill gaps in the legislation to combat 
impunity of the perpetrators of torture, through the recognition of the competence of the 
</p>
<p>Committee against Torture, as contained in articles 21 and 22 of the Convention, and accede to 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture; amend the legislation that violates the 
rights of individuals to security and personal freedoms; enhance the independence of the 
judiciary and limit referrals to special courts; amend legislation that restricts political freedoms; 
include the principles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the 
International Covenant on </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights into the domestic legal system, and lift the reservations 
to articles 9 (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
and 20 and 21 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
</p>
<p>679. Human Rights Watch was disappointed at Jordan&#8217;s rejection of important 
recommendations to eradicate torture, and requested that it implement recommendations to set 
up an independent complaints mechanism on torture, allow unannounced prison visits by 
non-governmental organizations and abolish exceptional courts, such as the police court. It noted 
that Jordan had curtailed its practice of administratively detaining women threatened with 
violence by family members, and tribal members threatened with violence by members of other 
tribes. However, the Government had made no concerted effort to apprehend or prosecute those 
who make such violent threats. Human Rights Watch was heartened by Jordan&#8217;s readiness to 
uphold freedom of assembly and requested that Jordan abolish prior approval for public 
meetings, lift provisions governing executive approval to register a society, and remove 
excessive powers of Government interference.  
</p>
<p>680. The Arab Commission for Human Rights commended Jordan for accepting a number of 
review recommendations and regretted the fact that the replies had not been submitted in writing 
before the plenary session of the Council. It welcomed the acceptance of the recommendation to 
support more effective implementation of the provisions of the Committee against Torture. It 
called on Jordan to reconsider its position on the Optional Protocol to the Convention against 
Torture and to recognize the competence of the Committee against Torture, as contained in 
article 22 of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>681. The International Commission of Jurists stated that Jordan should investigate in a prompt, 
effective and independent manner all alleged acts of torture and other ill-treatment that had been 
systematically used in Jordan&#8217;s prisons and centres of detention, as suggested in 
recommendations 18, 19 and 20. It urged Jordan to accept recommendation 9 of paragraph 93, 
break the cycle of impunity and bring the definition of torture in the penal code into line with 
article 1 of the Committee against Torture. It requested that Jordan accept and expeditiously 
implement recommendation 15 of paragraph 93. It called on Jordan to abolish the State security 
courts and other special courts and make sure that human rights violations were tried by ordinary 
civilian courts. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>682. The International Federation of Human Rights Leagues regretted the fact that the 
Government of Jordan had refused the most substantive recommendations, in particular the 
official investigation on all allegations of torture and the withdrawal of reservations to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. It welcomed the decision of Jordan to withdraw its reservation to article 15 (4) 
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, but 
regretted that Jordan refused to lift its reservation to articles 9 (2) and 16 of the Convention. It 
expressed its hope that Jordan would finally provide positive responses to several 
recommendations concerning honour crimes and the necessary review of the legislation 
applicable to terrorism. It also regretted the fact that Jordan had rejected the recommendations 
calling for a revision of the Association Law. 
</p>
<p>683. The Charitable Institute for Protecting Social Victims underlined the negative approach 
taken towards children&#8217;s rights; the continued negligence of the basic rights of orphaned 
children; the rise in child labour; the rise in the number of women without heads of household 
and the spread of prostitution among these women; and the daily rise in the number of torture 
cases in detention centres and prisons. It also noted the rise in the number of complaints against 
human rights violations, the lack of proper investigation and processing of complaints and the 
violation of prisoner and detainee rights. 
</p>
<p>684. The Al-Hakim Foundation welcomed Jordan&#8217;s acceptance of the recommendations 
stemming from its review and its efforts to ensure the necessary conditions for the work of 
human rights institutions. It expressed its appreciation to Jordan for having hosted thousands of 
Iraqi refugees and for its continued support and assistance to them, while calling for greater 
efforts in the fields of health and education. It commended Jordan for its role in peacekeeping 
operations and in the fight against terrorism. It mentioned the need to improve the situation of 
migrant workers and to protect their human rights, and called for the adoption of laws in this 
regard. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>685. The Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies commended Jordan for its decision to lift its 
reservation to article 15 (4) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. It was concerned about the situation of women, domestic violence and the 
prevalence of honour crimes, and urged Jordan to consider amending its penal code to ensure 
that perpetrators of honour crimes would be brought to justice, and to consider withdrawing its 
remaining reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, and ratifying the Optional Protocol thereto. It asked Jordan to review its 
nationality law to allow Jordanian mothers married to non-Jordanians to pass on their nationality 
to their children and to lift all its reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It 
also asked Jordan to revise its recent law on societies and to accede to the Optional Protocol to 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It welcomed Jordan&#8217;s commitment to 
respond to the request for a visit by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, and 
requested that Jordan consider ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
and set up an independent national mechanism for oversight in places of detention. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>686. Jordan believed that the review had offered a comprehensive and objective assessment of 
the human rights situation in the country. Despite the wide range of challenges at the national 
and regional levels, the Government was determined to follow up the recommendations 
effectively and to report on their implementation. 
</p>
<p><b>Malaysia 
</b></p>
<p>687. The review of Malaysia was held on 11 February 2009 in conformity with all the relevant 
provisions contained in Council resolution 5/1, and was based on the following documents:  
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The national report submitted by Malaysia in accordance with the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1, paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/4/MYS/1);  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The compilation prepared by the OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/MYS/2);  
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/4/MYS/3). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>688. At its 19th meeting, on 12 June 2009, the Council considered and adopted the outcome of 
the review on Malaysia (see section C below). 
</p>
<p>689. The outcome of the review on Malaysia comprised of the report of the Working Group on 
the Universal Periodic Review (A/HRC/11/30 and A/HRC/11/30/Corr.1), the views of Malaysia 
concerning the recommendations and/or conclusions, and its voluntary commitments and replies 
presented before the adoption of the outcome by the plenary to questions or issues that were not 
sufficiently addressed during the interactive dialogue in the Working Group (see also 
A/HRC/11/30/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b>1. Views expressed by the State under review on the recommendations and/or 
conclusions as well as on its voluntary commitments and the outcome 
</b></p>
<p>690. Malaysia stated that, by accepting the majority of the recommendations, it had showed its 
flexibility with a view to improving the human rights situation in the country. Malaysia had 
already begun implementing recommendations and was committed to programmes, such as 
human rights awareness and training and the harmonization of national legislation with 
international human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>691. The accepted recommendations included one relating to continuous training for law 
enforcement officials, which would be implemented through a workshop to be organized jointly 
with the Commonwealth secretariat in June 2009. Malaysia was also discussing with the 
OHCHR Regional Office in Bangkok the possibility of organizing other capacity-building 
workshops or seminars.  
</p>
<p>692. Since April 2009, Malaysia had a new Prime Minister, who espoused the concept of &#8220;one 
Malaysia&#8221;, a concept that gave a clearer picture of the term &#8220;unity in diversity&#8221;, and who took a 
pluralistic and integrationist approach.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>693. Since independence, policies had been implemented for the benefit of the people. In the 
light of the current global economic and financial crisis, the Government continued to believe 
that policies that underscored the importance of achieving socio-economic and development 
goals as a way of ensuring unity remained vitally important. 
</p>
<p>694. Detailed comments and explanations provided by Malaysia on recommendations are 
available in document A/HRC/11/30/Add.1. On the issue of preventive detention legislation, the 
Government had decided, in early April 2009, to undertake a comprehensive study with a view 
to reviewing the Internal Security Act. For this purpose, a working committee had been 
established at the Ministry of Home Affairs. Since Malaysia&#8217;s review in February 2009, the 
Government had released a significant number of persons previously detained under the Act. 
</p>
<p>695. Malaysia was considering inviting the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to make a 
country visit. The Government was in the process of finalizing a national child policy, a national 
child protection policy and the relevant plans of action. Serious efforts had been made to review 
some reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women with a view to lifting them. With regard to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a 
technical committee had been established to study the possibility of withdrawing reservations, 
which was expected to be considered before the end of 2009. The Government was in the 
process of amending the Child Act 2001 in order to implement the recommendations of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child. The proposed amendments included the extension of 
powers of child protection teams, broadening the scope of coverage to include victims of 
trafficking, and the repeal of corporal punishment sentences for children, replacing them with 
community service orders. An additional M$81.1 million had been allocated to enhance a 
community-based rehabilitation programme for children with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>696. Malaysia had developed gender-awareness programmes, which included books explaining 
to children that girls should enjoy the same rights as boys, as outlined in the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>697. With a view to enhancing the transparency and independence of Malaysia&#8217;s national 
human rights commission (SUHAKAM), in April 2009, the Government amended 
the 1999 SUHAKAM Act. The amendments refined the criteria for the appointment and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>reappointment of Commission members and provided for performance assessment mechanisms. 
Further proposed amendments to the SUHAKAM Act expected to be submitted to the next 
session of Parliament included the requirement to consult with civil society representatives in the 
appointment of Commission members.  
</p>
<p>698. On the issue of the death penalty, Malaysia reiterated that this was only applied to the most 
heinous crimes, such as drug trafficking, murder, treason and kidnapping, and the Government 
was considering proposals to commute the penalty to life imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>699. Malaysia was concerned at all instances of abuse, including those against foreign workers, 
who were protected by domestic employment laws and had access to legal remedies. 
Employment disputes may be referred to both the Labour Department and the Industrial Court. 
Foreign workers who filed cases against their Malaysian employers were granted an adequate 
period of stay and would be issued with a special pass while awaiting trial. Additionally, a 
24-hour hotline had been established to deal with complaints of abuse from foreign workers. 
Guidelines for employers for the recruitment of foreign workers had been introduced. 
</p>
<p>700. Malaysia reiterated that its efforts to secure the protection and promotion of human rights 
had been very much focused on achieving inter-racial harmony in society and equitable 
socio-economic development.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Views expressed by Member and observer States 
of the Council on the review outcome 
</b></p>
<p>701. The United Arab Emirates appreciated Malaysia&#8217;s efforts to implement the result of the 
universal periodic review and its commitment to cooperate with human rights mechanisms. It 
highly valued the efforts to entrench fundamental freedoms and human rights through additional 
mechanisms and activities, particularly to strengthen the rights of the child. It noted that a 
technical committee had been established to implement the review recommendations, and paid 
tribute to the social and economic efforts made to guarantee integrity and harmony in society.  
</p>
<p>702. Cuba stated that Malaysia had achieved a high level of economic and social development. 
Malaysia had accepted a majority of the recommendations, which covered a wide range of civil, 
cultural, economic, political and social rights. Cuba acknowledged the undeniable progress made 
in the country, and referred with interest to an electronic system of clinical management that </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>helped guarantee the right to health, and the positive outcomes achieved in the areas of 
education, women&#8217;s rights, employment, culture, adequate housing and fighting poverty.  
</p>
<p>703. Brunei Darussalam was encouraged by Malaysia&#8217;s cooperation during the review in 
responding to the recommendations. It commended the voluntary commitments to the promotion 
and protection of human rights in the country. Brunei Darussalam appreciated the Government&#8217;s 
close cooperation and regular engagements with stakeholders, the United Nations, relevant 
agencies and the international community to make more efforts to raise the economic and social 
status of its people. 
</p>
<p>704. Qatar was pleased with Malaysia&#8217;s fruitful and constructive cooperation with the 
Working Group. As a member of the troika, Qatar noted the understanding shown by Malaysia 
by accepting 60 recommendations. It paid tribute to the efforts made to strengthen and promote 
economic, social and cultural rights, particularly the rights to education, health and housing; to 
combat poverty, promote the rights of the elderly; and to fight against human trafficking. It 
welcomed Malaysia&#8217;s effort to promote good governance, the rule of law and poverty alleviation. 
</p>
<p>705. Algeria noted with appreciation Malaysia&#8217;s endorsement of more than 72 per cent of the 
recommendations. It expressed understanding for the explanations given regarding 
recommendations that did not enjoy Malaysia&#8217;s support, and commended its transparency and 
openness. Algeria welcomed the intention to take appropriate steps to consider the possibility of 
ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as well as the Convention against Torture and the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It 
</p>
<p>commended Malaysia for its efforts to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and 
for spearheading progress towards gender equality and the advancement of women. It paid 
tribute to the effective policies adopted to guarantee adequate housing at a reasonable cost for all 
citizens. Malaysia&#8217;s sustained efforts to strengthen poverty eradication programmes were also 
highlighted. 
</p>
<p>706. Uzbekistan appreciated Malaysia&#8217;s comprehensive information and comments on the 
recommendations made by the Working Group. Malaysia had participated constructively in the 
process, and had held open-ended consultations in the preparation of its report. It had made </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>efforts to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms as part of its international 
obligations. The implementation of practical measures and the Government&#8217;s commitment would 
promote efforts to strengthen further the system for the protection and promotion of human 
rights. Uzbekistan considered that it was very positive that Malaysia had accepted all 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>707. Pakistan<b> </b>was encouraged that Malaysia had accepted most of the recommendations and 
had started implementation through human rights awareness and training, and harmonization of 
national legislation with international instruments. It had noted the steps taken to improve 
relevant legislation to improve the protection and promotion of the rights of children, foreign 
workers and detainees. Amendments made in the national human rights commission act would 
also add to its independence and operational effectiveness. Pakistan appreciated the 
Government&#8217;s resolve to continue to follow policies that underscored the importance of 
achieving socio-economic and development goals as a way of ensuring harmony and unity in an 
ethnically diverse nation.  
</p>
<p>708. Thailand<b> </b>appreciated the fact that Malaysia had accepted most of the recommendations and 
was actively implementing them. It highlighted the importance of human rights awareness and 
training, as well as international cooperation for capacity-building, as key elements. It welcomed 
the efforts to review and amend certain domestic legislation and policies relating to children. 
Thailand placed great importance on the human rights of women and children, and expressed its 
interest in learning more from Malaysia&#8217;s experience and best practices, and looked forward to 
furthering cooperation in this regard. 
</p>
<p>709. Egypt stated that Malaysia&#8217;s flexibility in accepting most of the recommendations 
demonstrated not only its cooperative approach but also its determination to further the human 
rights of its people. It commended Malaysia for the special attention paid to combating human 
trafficking and to the protection of the rights of women and children, as well as the measures 
taken to consolidate national human rights infrastructure and the emphasis placed on the 
advancement of economic, social and cultural rights, with priority given to utilizing the full 
potential of the diversity of its society. It expressed its firm belief in Malaysia&#8217;s continued 
commitment to pursue its goals in implementing the recommendations with diligence. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>710. Bahrain welcomed the fact that Malaysia had accepted most recommendations, including 
those made by Bahrain. It noted the participation of women in decision-making in the public 
sphere and Malaysia&#8217;s role in combating trafficking and the thorough protection afforded to 
victims. Malaysia was continuing to provide adequate housing to persons with low incomes. The 
efforts to guarantee access to free health services were also commendable. 
</p>
<p>711. China appreciated the serious and responsible attitude shown by Malaysia during the 
universal periodic review process, having accepted most of the recommendations. Malaysia&#8217;s 
constant investment in human rights legislation, health services and infrastructure for education 
had resulted in a large reduction in the poverty rate. Malaysia had taken active measures to 
protect the rights of foreign workers. It believed Malaysia would continue to make an effort to 
implement national human rights policies through a serious analysis and implementation of the 
recommendations made during the review and dialogue with the international community.  
</p>
<p>712. Viet Nam<b> </b>congratulated Malaysia on the new achievements recorded and the plan on the 
implementation of the recommendations made, which Malaysia had accepted. Viet Nam stated 
that, as a multicultural and multi-ethnic country, it had always studied and learned from 
Malaysia&#8217;s good practices and experience in maintaining harmony in society as well as the 
protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  General comments made by other relevant stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>713. The Human Rights Commission of Malaysia commended the country for the steps taken to 
amend the Human Rights Commission Act to comply with the Paris Principles. It welcomed the 
release of 13 detainees under the Internal Security Act, and the fact that the Act would be 
reviewed. It urged the review also of the Emergency Ordinance Act and the Dangerous Drugs 
Act, as well as of the police practice of arresting and detaining suspects before investigation. It 
expressed concern at the arrest of lawyers who defend detained persons. It encouraged Malaysia 
to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Convention against Torture, strengthen the 
independence of the judiciary, review the death penalty and intensify its fight against all forms of 
trafficking in women and girls. The Commission also noted the absence of a national human 
rights plan of action and the fact that the Government had not acted on most of the 
Commission&#8217;s recommendations. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>714. Amnesty International was disappointed that Malaysia did not support key 
recommendations to protect refugees, asylum-seekers and migrant workers; to end the practice of 
whipping for immigration offences; to abolish the death penalty and corporal punishment; and to 
reform restrictive laws used to suppress peaceful political dissent. It urged Malaysia to 
reconsider these. Concern was expressed about Malaysia&#8217;s rejection of recommendations to 
further the right to peaceful assembly in the light of recent arrests of up to 160 people for illegal 
assembly. The Government&#8217;s assurances that conditions in immigration detention centres were 
adequate should be re-examined. It regretted the rejection of recommendations to ratify the 
Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the International Convention on the Protection 
of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, urging that Malaysia 
reconsider this stance. 
</p>
<p>715. The Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development stated that Malaysia should 
immediately establish an independent police complaints and misconduct commission to conduct 
inquests within a month of each death in custody. Malaysia should immediately implement all 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on the right to education in relation to 
indigenous communities. It encouraged Malaysia to respond positively to the nine pending 
requests for visits and make standing invitations to all special procedures mandate holders and 
make genuine efforts to ratify core international human rights instruments, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>716. Action Canada for Population and Development referred to Malaysia&#8217;s acknowledgments 
regarding the penal code and the Minor Offences Act. It considered that the enforcement of these 
laws was targeted at people of non-normative sexual orientation, gender identity and expression. 
It encouraged Malaysia to promote non-discrimination and tolerance, and to amend the penal 
code and all laws that discriminated against people of diverse sexual orientation, gender identity 
and expression, including decriminalizing consensual sexual acts and allowing for the change of 
a person&#8217;s name and sex on identification papers, and to train law enforcement officers and the 
judiciary.  
</p>
<p>717. The Commission of the Churches on International Affairs of the World Council of 
Churches<b> </b>stated that Malaysia continued to refuse to ratify the Convention relating to the Status </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of Refugees. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Malaysia had 
registered approximately 47,000 persons of concern, primarily from Myanmar, and estimated 
that a similar number remained unregistered. Refugees, asylum-seekers and undocumented 
migrants faced the risk of arrest and were being detained in immigration detention centres. 
Another concern was freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, which had been denied to 
citizens of Malaysia.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>718. The Islamic Human Rights Commission referred to its research showing routine use of the 
Internal Security Act and the Emergency Public Order Preventive Ordinance against individuals 
suspected of being an actual or potential threat to national security or public order. It referred to 
one detainee arrested under the Internal Security Act in April 2002, and stated that even though 
his renewed detention had ended in June 2008, he was reportedly informed that the chances of 
his release were unlikely. It considered that the right to be free from arbitrary detention, the 
rights to due process and to a fair trial, as well as to the right to freedom of expression, had been 
violated. The Commission called for the abolition of the Act and the release of all persons held 
under it. 
</p>
<p>719. Persatuan Aliran Kesedaran Negara - National Consciousness Movement stated that the 
Internal Security Act was extremely broadly worded and allowed for indefinite detention without 
trial. Under the Act, the Malaysian judiciary had been systematically excluded from playing any 
meaningful role in ensuring that those detained were treated in accordance with international 
human rights norms. There was no effective judicial review. Judges could not review grounds of 
detention and were not shown the purported evidence against detainees.  
</p>
<p>720. The Arab Commission for Human Rights welcomed the transparent replies provided by 
Malaysia. It however regretted that the document containing the written replies had not been 
translated, thus impeding genuine dialogue. It recommended clarification of an apparent 
contradiction in paragraph 105, which rejected the recommendation made in paragraph 71. It 
welcomed the possibility that Malaysia would ratify the Convention against Torture and 
establish a national commission to prevent torture and allow prison visits. Given that 
recommendation 55 had been accepted, the Commission encouraged Malaysia to also adhere to 
the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education, and invited Malaysia to present a 
follow-up report to the Council at its fourteenth session. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Concluding remarks of the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>721. Malaysia stated that all comments had been duly noted and would be deliberated upon. It 
appreciated the recognition of progress made in the protection and promotion of human rights 
but acknowledged that challenges remained and that necessary actions would be taken. Certain 
issues raised by civil society representatives had been addressed in detail in the national report, 
the addendum to the Working Group report and in its earlier statements to the Council. 
Regarding preventive detention, Malaysia reiterated its view that these laws remained necessary 
for the protection of national security and public order, and that existing legislation contained 
sufficient safeguards in accordance with international law. The Government would, however, 
review the Internal Security Act. It pointed out that article 10 of the Federal Constitution 
guaranteed the right to peaceful assembly and without arms. This right was, however, not 
absolute and could be restricted for legitimate reasons, such as security, public order or morality. 
Malaysia stated that the universal periodic review process had been an opportunity to assess and 
reflect on achievements and shortcomings. Malaysia was pleased to co-sponsor a draft text to 
ensure that all review outcome reports were translated into the six official languages of the 
United Nations and that the universal periodic review process was allocated the necessary 
resources.

<p>1. In paragraphs 1 to 4 of draft decision A/HRC/11/L.2 (adopted as decision 11/117), the 
Council decided to adopt the following decision and to submit it<b> </b>to<b> </b>the General Assembly, as a 
matter of priority: 
</p>
<p> (a) To request the Secretary-General to issue all the reports adopted by the Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review at its fourth and fifth sessions and the additional 
information submitted by the States under review before the adoption of the outcome by the 
Council, as official documents in all official languages of the United Nations prior to the holding 
of the twelfth session of the Council; 
</p>
<p> (b) To recall that the Working Group should endeavour to apply in its reports the word 
limits established in the annex to President&#8217;s statement 9/2, bearing in mind that the Working 
Group is entrusted with the authority to decide on the adoption of reports that exceptionally 
exceed those word limits; 
</p>
<p> (c) To decide that all reports adopted by the Working Group should be issued as official 
documents in all official languages of the United Nations, in a timely manner before their 
consideration by the Council, and to request the Secretary-General to ensure the necessary 
support to that effect. 
</p>
<p>2. The requirements for the translation of reports called for under the terms of the decision 
are estimated at $1,439,800 each for the biennium 2008-2009 and at $4,378,900 for the 
biennium 2010-2011,<b> </b>under section 2 (General Assembly and Economic and Social Council 
Affairs and Conference Management). The requirements for translation of the reports of the 
Working Group were not included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. They 
have however been included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>3. It is estimated that the total additional requirements for the biennium 2008-2009 of 
$1,439,800 could be met from within the overall resources appropriated under section 2 of the 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, through the mechanism of integrated global 
management of resources. With regard to the requirements for the biennium 2010-2011, 
provisions have been made in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011.  
</p>
<p><b>1/11. Open-ended Working Group on an optional protocol to the Convention  
on the Rights of the Child to provide a communications procedure 
</b></p>
<p>4. In paragraphs 1 to 4 of draft resolution A/HRC/11/L.3 (adopted as resolution 1/11), the 
Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to establish an Open-ended Working Group of the Council to explore the 
possibility of elaboration of an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to 
provide a communications procedure complementary to the reporting procedure under the 
Convention; 
</p>
<p> (b) Decided also that the working group would hold its first session for five working 
days in Geneva before the end of 2009, within existing resources; 
</p>
<p> (c) Further decided to invite a representative of the Committee on the Rights of the 
Child to attend the session of the working group as a resource person, and, where appropriate, 
relevant United Nations special procedures and other relevant independent experts, and also 
invited them to submit inputs to the working group for its consideration; 
</p>
<p> (d) Requested the Working Group to submit a report on progress made thereon to the 
Council for consideration at its thirteenth session. 
</p>
<p>5. To implement the activities called for under the terms of the resolution, an estimated 
$282,700 would be required for the biennium 2008-2009,<b> </b>as follows: (a)<b> </b>under section 2 
(General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management) to 
provide conference servicing ($199,200); (b) under section 23 (Human Rights) to provide for a 
staff member at the P-3 level for four months to provide support to the work of the Working 
Group ($56,000) and for travel of a member of the Committee on the Rights of the Child to 
attend the Working Group session ($23,800); and (c) under section 28 E (Administration, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Geneva), for conference servicing ($3,700). The requirements in support of the activities of the 
Working Group have not been included in the programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. 
Although it is anticipated that a total additional amount of $282,700 would be required for the 
biennium 2008-2009, no additional resources are requested at this time as the Secretariat will 
seek to identify areas from which resources can be redeployed to meet the requirements within 
the appropriations approved for sections 2, 23 and 28 E for the biennium 2008-2009. 
</p>
<p>6. With regard to paragraph 2, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the 
most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role 
of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.  
</p>
<p><b>11/9.  The human rights of migrants in detention centres 
</b></p>
<p>7. In paragraphs 1 and 3 of draft resolution A/HRC/11/L.4, the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to hold a panel of discussion on the human rights of migrants in detention 
centres at its twelfth session, with equitable geographic and gender participation of Governments, 
relevant experts and representatives of civil society, including national institutions; 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to provide the necessary assistance and support for holding the panel. 
</p>
<p>8. To implement the activities called for by the Council in paragraph 1, an estimated $29,000 
would be required for the biennium 2008-2009 under section 23 (Human Rights) to provide for 
travel and the daily subsistence allowance of five experts. Although it is anticipated that an 
additional amount of $29,000 would be required in support of the activities for the 
biennium 2008-2009 under section 23, additional resources are not requested at this time, as the 
Secretariat will to the extent possible absorb the additional requirements within the 
appropriations for section 23 (Human Rights) for the biennium 2008-2009.  
</p>
<p>9. With regard to paragraph 3, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990 and subsequent resolutions, the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>most recent of which is resolution 62/236 of 22 December 2007, in which the Assembly 
reaffirmed that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly 
entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters and reaffirmed the role 
of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions.  
</p>
<p><b>11/2.  Accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>10. In subparagraph 12 (d) of draft resolution A/HRC/11/L.5 (orally revised and adopted as 
resolution 11/2), the Council requested OHCHR to convene, in 2010<i>, </i>in cooperation with other 
relevant entities of the United Nations system, an expert workshop to discuss specific measures 
for overcoming obstacles and challenges that States may face in preventing, investigating, 
prosecuting and punishing the perpetrators of violence against women and girls, as well as 
measures for providing protection, support, assistance and redress for victims, and requested it to 
prepare, within existing resources, a summary report thereon to be submitted to the Council. 
</p>
<p>11. To implement the activities called for by the Council in subparagraph 12 (d), an estimated 
$172,800 would be required for the biennium 2010-2011, as follows: (a) under section 2 
(General Assembly and Economic and Social Council Affairs and Conference Management), to 
provide conference servicing ($110,800); (b) under section 23 (Human Rights), to provide for 
the travel of 10 experts to attend the workshop ($60,400); and (c) under section 28 E 
(Administration, Geneva), for conference servicing ($1,600). The requirements in support of the 
activities have not been included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 
2010-2011. During the sixty-fourth session of the General Assembly, a determination will be 
made in the revised estimates report on decisions taken by the Council on whether they can be 
met from within the provisions proposed under the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2010-2011. 
</p>
<p><b>11/3.  Trafficking in persons, especially women and children 
</b></p>
<p>12. In paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of draft resolution A/HRC/11/L.6 (adopted as resolution 11/3), 
the Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Requested OHCHR to organize, within existing resources, and in close coordination 
with the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, a two-day 
seminar aimed at identifying opportunities and challenges in the development of rights-based </p>

 <p> 
</p>

further promoting the practical application of the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking, with the participation of Governments, the Special 
Rapporteur and other relevant special procedures, treaty bodies, United Nations specialized 
agencies and programmes, regional, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, 
national human rights institutions, academics, medical experts and representatives of victims, 
and to submit a report on the proceedings of the seminar to the Council; 
</p>
<p> (b) Also requested OHCHR to disseminate the Recommended Principles and Guidelines 
on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, and to collect the views of stakeholders, including 
Governments, observers of the United Nations, relevant United Nations bodies, specialized 
agencies and programmes, regional bodies, non-governmental organizations, and national human 
rights institutions on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human 
Trafficking, as well as on experiences and emerging good practices while applying them, and to 
make available to the Council a compilation of those views as an addendum to the 
above-mentioned report; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the Secretary-General to provide OHCHR with sufficient resources to 
fulfil its mandate in relation to combating trafficking in persons, especially women and children. 
</p>
<p>13. To implement the activities called for by the Council, an estimated $268,700 would be

servicing ($1,600).  
</p>
<p>14. Although provisions have not been included under sections 2, 23 and 28 E of the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 to implement activities called for by the Council 
in paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the draft resolution, the estimated requirements of $268,700 are not 
required at this time, as the Secretariat will review the potential absorptive capacity from within 
sections 23 and 28 E of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011, which will </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>be considered by the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. The determination will be 
made in the report of the Secretary-General on the revised estimates of requirements arising from 
the decisions and resolutions adopted by the Council for 2009, which will be reported 
subsequently to the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. 
</p>
<p>15. With regard to paragraphs 9 and 11, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of

arising from the decisions and resolutions adopted by the Council for 2009, which will be 
reported subsequently to the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. 
</p>
<p>20. In the event that the workshop is held prior to 2010, the Secretariat will, to the extent 
possible, absorb the additional requirements within the appropriations for sections 2, 23 and 28 E 
for the biennium 2008-2009.  
</p>
<p><b>11/12. Intergovernmental Working Group on the effective implementation  
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 
</b></p>
<p>21. In paragraph 1 of draft resolution A/HRC/11/L.15 (orally revised and adopted as 
resolution 11/12), the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Intergovernmental Working 
Group on the effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action for

</p>
<p><b>11/8.  Preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>23. In paragraph 6 of draft resolution A/HRC/11/L.16 (adopted as resolution 11/8), the Council 
requested OHCHR to prepare a thematic study on preventable maternal mortality and morbidity 
and human rights, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the United Nations 
Population Fund, as well as all relevant stakeholders, including the United Nations Children&#8217;s </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Fund and the World Bank, and requested that the study include identification of the human rights

activities within the United Nations system to address all causes of preventable maternal 
mortality and morbidity; identification of how the Council could add value to existing initiatives 
through a human rights analysis; identification of options for the Council to support and increase 
existing efforts in the United Nations system, including efforts to achieve Millennium

the human rights dimension of preventable maternal mortality and morbidity throughout the 
United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>24. To implement the activities called for in paragraph 6 of the resolution, an estimated 
$73,300 would be required under section 23 (Human Rights) to provide for consultancy services. 
Although provisions have not been included under section 23 of the proposed programme budget 
for the biennium 2010-2011 to implement activities called for in paragraph 6 of the draft 
resolution, the Secretariat will review the potential absorptive capacity to meet the estimated 
requirements of $73,300 from within section 23 of the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2010-2011, which will be considered by the General Assembly at its 
sixty-fourth session. The determination of the absorptive capacity will be made in the report of 
the Secretary-General on the revised estimates of requirements arising from the decisions and 
resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council for 2009, which will be reported subsequently 
to the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/11/L.19. Amendments to draft resolution A/HRC/11/L.17 on the  
situation of human rights in the Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>25. With regard to the amendments proposed under draft text A/HRC/11/L.19, the adoption of 
the amendments would replace the current mandate of Special Rapporteur with that of an 
independent expert on the situation of human rights in the Sudan. The related financial 
implications would amount to a total of $64,600 per year. However, the requirements for that 
mandate have been included in the programme budget for 2008-2009 and requested under the 
proposed programme budget for 2010-2011; therefore, there would be no additional 
appropriations as a result of the adoption of the amendments proposed. </p>
