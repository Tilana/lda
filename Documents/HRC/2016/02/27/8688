<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its eighth session from 3 to 14 May 2010.  
The review of Kuwait was held at the 15th meeting, on 12 May 2010. The delegation of 
Kuwait was headed by the Minister of Social Affairs and Labour, Lieutenant General Dr. 
Mohamad M. Al-Affasi. At its 17th meeting, held on 14 May 2010, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Kuwait. 
</p>
<p>2. On 7 September 2009, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Kuwait: Hungary, Indonesia and Madagascar. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Kuwait: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KWT/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KWT/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/8/KWT/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Argentina, Belgium, the Czech Republic, 
Denmark, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Switzerland, Sweden and 
the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Kuwait 
through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic 
review. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation noted with satisfaction the progress achieved by the universal 
periodic review mechanism. It stressed that the national report had been prepared by a 
committee composed of relevant State ministries and institutions as well as civil society 
organizations.  
</p>
<p>6. The national Constitution adopted by Kuwait in 1962 guaranteed the separation of 
powers while ensuring cooperation among them, and thus enhanced democracy and ensured 
human rights and fundamental freedoms. Despite a number of difficulties, including the 
Iraqi invasion of its territory in 1990 and the widespread destruction suffered by the State&#8217;s 
institutions and interests following that invasion, Kuwait had been able to re-establish 
economic, security and social stability. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation indicated that the Constitutional Court represented a constitutional 
and legal umbrella guaranteeing and strengthening the various aspects of constitutional 
protection, safeguarding the proper interpretation of the Constitution&#8217;s provisions and 
ensuring that these were compatible with national legislation. It stated that many laws had 
been adopted to consolidate and strengthen human rights, such as the 2005 law granting to 
women all their political rights, which had paved the way for four women to enter 
parliament following the 2009 parliamentary elections and to hold some of the highest 
leadership positions in the State.  </p>


<p>8. The delegation stated that Law 6/2010,<b> </b>related to work in the private sector, 
provided, inter alia, legal protection for all employees, established a minimum wage and 
prohibited all forms of discrimination. With a view to its implementation, two regulations 
had been promulgated to set minimum wages and allow employees to change their 
employers without the prior consent of the latter. The delegation explained that, although 
domestic labour fell outside Law 6/2010, that law stated that the relevant Minister shall 
issue a decision regulating the relationship between the domestic workers and the employer, 
through a binding contract which determines the domestic workers&#8217; rights, salary, working 
hours and break time. In addition, the State had built shelters to provide accommodation for 
workers in conflict with their employers until their situation had been resolved and their 
benefits paid.  
</p>
<p>9. According to the delegation, a number of draft laws related to human rights were 
among the State&#8217;s priorities and were expected to be approved by the Majlis Al Ummah 
(legislative body). These included the draft law to combat human trafficking, which 
referred to transnational and organized crime and which would impose life imprisonment 
for perpetrators and long-term sentences for accomplices, while providing full protection to 
victims. In addition, Law 9/2010 included the State&#8217;s Development Plan through 2014 and 
provided for the enactment of a set of laws related to human rights and freedoms, including 
the law protecting children&#8217;s rights against violence and exploitation. The Development 
Plan also covered fields such as social protection, social security, work, health, education, 
economy, justice and the environment. It also strengthened transparency mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>10. Kuwait had endeavoured to assist developing and least developed countries and had 
contributed $15 billion to more than 100 States through the Kuwait Fund for Economic 
Development as well as $300 million to fight disease and poverty in Africa. Furthermore,  
Kuwait&#8217;s proposal at the first Arab Economic Summit of 2009 that a $2 billion fund be 
established to support and finance small- and medium-sized enterprises had been adopted, 
with the State of Kuwait making a voluntary contribution of $500 million. Kuwait&#8217;s 
humanitarian assistance exceeded 1.3 per cent of its gross national product. 
</p>
<p>11. Despite Kuwait&#8217;s achievements in the field of human rights, some challenges 
remained, in particular the issue of illegal residents who hid their identities and did not 
cooperate with the authorities out of fear that they would not be able to acquire Kuwaiti 
nationality. Nevertheless, Kuwait had provided them with all human services, in particular 
in the areas of health and education. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation reaffirmed Kuwait&#8217;s commitment to establish an independent human 
rights institution and formulate draft laws related to the trafficking in persons and children&#8217;s 
rights, as well as to prepare and submit on time periodic reports related to human rights 
instruments.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>13. During the interactive dialogue, 52 delegations made statements. Additional 
statements that could not be delivered during the interactive dialogue owing to time 
constraints will be posted on the extranet of the universal periodic review when available1.

development and assistance.  Jordan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Responding to questions, the delegation stressed that Kuwait was party to the main 
international and ILO instruments related to human rights. Those ratified conventions were 
an integral part of Kuwait&#8217;s law under article 70 of the Constitution and were implemented 
by the judiciary unless they required the adoption of supplementary procedures. Kuwait 
implemented the conventions through specialized committees. It resorted to reservations 
only in a most restrained manner and only regarding texts that ran counter to the 
Constitution or to public order. Reservations were withdrawn once the reasons for having 
made them no longer existed.  
</p>
<p>35. As stipulated in the Constitution, Kuwait had committed to providing health-care 
services as a human right to all residents, without discrimination and with the highest 
possible quality. These services were provided to citizens free of charge, while residents 
paid token fees. All children of citizens, as well as the children of illegal residents and non-
Kuwaiti children, were covered by governmental health-care services. Medical treatment in 
the event of emergencies and in cases of HIV/AIDS and cancer was provided to all children 
free of charge. Life expectancy at birth was 78.6 years, one of the highest in the region. 
</p>
<p>36. The law required physicians to report all cases of physical, sexual and psychological 
mistreatment of children under 18. In addition, committees had been established in all parts 
of the country to monitor such cases and ensure the medical supervision of the victims, 
together with the prosecution of the cases. Awareness-raising programmes had been 
strengthened to ensure appropriate prevention. 
</p>
<p>37. The Constitution stipulated that education was a fundamental right provided for by 
the State. Education in primary and intermediate schools was compulsory and was free of 
charge at all stages. In 1958, Kuwait had begun its pioneering plan to combat illiteracy, 
which stood at 3.5 per cent of the population in 2009. That figure applied mainly to persons 
older than 60. In order to ensure education for all, Kuwait had taken steps to integrate 
persons with disabilities into public education and build special schools for them, and to 
promote the education of women, including study abroad. At present, the percentage of 
women in education was 52 per cent. Kuwait had diversified secondary education and had 
established 13 universities offering all specializations, in addition to 6 private universities. 
Kuwait has also allowed for foreign residents to receive education in accordance with the 
systems of their countries of origin.  
</p>
<p>38. As for human rights education, Kuwait had played a leading role in the drafting of 
the Arab action plan for human rights education. Moreover, human rights were taught in 
secondary school and the university, and the curriculums were based on the precepts of the </p>


<p>Islamic religion, the Constitution, the legislative framework and the universality of human 
rights principles. 
</p>
<p>39. Kuwait, as an Islamic State, applied the death penalty, among other punishments. It 
was applied in the most restrained and restricted manner and only for the most heinous and 
dangerous crimes. It was considered a deterrent to such crimes and was aimed at ensuring 
the safety of society. It was applied only after respect for all the guarantees and safeguards 
of due process of law and fair trial had been ensured at all levels. The death sentence was 
not applied to persons younger than 18 or women who had just given birth. Capital 
punishment was carried out only after the ratification of the Emir of Kuwait, who had the 
right to commute the sentence. The last death sentence carried out in Kuwait had been in 
</p><p>2007. 
</p>
<p>40. Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) acknowledged important efforts to promote and 
protect human rights, in particular in the areas of health care and sanitation, through a well- 
developed network of public hospitals and specialized medical centres. It noted the 
important allocation of resources from its general budget for health care. Venezuela made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>41. Morocco paid tribute to the Government for its efforts to advance human rights and 
achieve social prosperity for the people of Kuwait, It noted efforts to promote and protect 
economic and social rights as well as democracy and highlighted the importance of the 
efforts made in providing assistance to other countries, which exceeded the internationally 
agreed percentage of its Gross Domestic Product. It commended Kuwait&#8217;s cooperation with 
Morocco and welcomed the establishment of the Fund for supporting small and medium-
sized enterprises. Morocco made recommendations.

human rights. Pakistan greatly appreciated the Kuwaiti contribution to the sustainable 
development agenda at the international level. Pakistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Hungary commended Kuwait for being a party to many core human rights treaties, 
but noted that there had been delays in the country&#8217;s collaboration with treaty bodies.

transparent regulations regarding the treatment of foreign workers. Hungary commended 
Kuwait for its plans to overhaul the current &#8220;sponsorship&#8221; system with the assistance of, 
inter alia, ILO experts. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. China noted with appreciation that, in recent years, Kuwait had acceded to most 
international human rights instruments and actively participated in the drafting of the 2000-
2014 Arab education plan. It also noted that, according to the 2009 report of UNDP, 
Kuwait was a pioneer in education among the Arab States. China made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Azerbaijan believed that the establishment of the Women&#8217;s Affairs Committee, the 
Supreme Human Rights Committee and the National Standing Committee on International 
Humanitarian Law would further contribute to the promotion and protection of human 
rights. Azerbaijan asked about achievements and challenges in the implementation of the 
National Plan for Human Rights Education. It encouraged Kuwait to address concerns 
raised by some treaty bodies, such as the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women and the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations. 
</p>

good legal basis for continuing to improve Kuwait&#8217;s human rights standards and indicated 
that a constructive dialogue with the United Nations treaty bodies was also essential to that 
end. Norway remained concerned about the fact that Kuwaiti laws continued to 
discriminate against women in several areas, as well as about the vulnerable situation of 
female domestic workers. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Armenia acknowledged that the advancement of the human rights agenda in recent 
decades had been well-grounded in the newly created institutions, policies and practices. 
Thus, Kuwait&#8217;s achievements in promoting political rights seemed to be laying a solid 
foundation for further progress. Armenia encouraged Kuwait to continue its efforts to 
ensure full freedom of belief and association, and to strengthen the capacities of the World 
Centre of Mediation. Armenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Israel noted that women were finally afforded civil and political rights in the 
electoral process in 2005 and that four women were elected in parliament four years later. 
Israel welcomed recent victories in the area of women&#8217;s rights. However, it expressed 
concern at the instances of grave human rights violations against women, children, foreign 
workers, Beduns and other minorities that had continued within Kuwait&#8217;s borders. Israel 
made recommendations.

<p>61. The delegation of Kuwait noted that the State continued its efforts and policies to 
protect women and children from violence through the amendment of national legislation to 
bring it into line with international human rights standards, including CRC, which had been 
ratified by Kuwait in 1991. It had also enacted a number of laws to protect children against 
violence, including the law on custody, the law on the protection of minors and the bill on 
the organization of kindergarten. In addition, the decision to establish a high council for

</p>
<p>62. To protect women from domestic violence, a number of administrations had been

ensure that it was in line with the most advanced legislation as well as international 
standards. Law 8/2010 translated into reality the terms of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and was aimed at strengthening the rights of persons with 
disabilities and protecting their dignity and well-being through their integration into and 
full participation in society. The law provided for welfare for persons with disabilities in 
terms of education, health, training and rehabilitation, as well as a number of financial and 
other benefits. The law also required employers to provide adequate work opportunities for 
persons with disabilities. Moreover, persons with disabilities contributed effectively to the 
work of the higher council for disability affairs. The promulgation of the law had coincided 
with the Government&#8217;s decision to accede to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities, and the necessary measures were being taken to that end. 
</p>
<p>64. Lao People&#8217;s Democratic Republic commended Kuwait for having acceded to most 
international human rights treaties. Laos recognized that Kuwait had maintained its practice 
of supporting infrastructure projects in more than 100 developing and least developed 
countries through its Fund for Economic Development, which had provided more than 
$14.5 billion in assistance since 1961. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>65. Chile valued the voluntary pledges reflected in the national report, in particular with 
regard to the possibility of acceding to international treaties and instruments to which 
Kuwait was not yet a party, as well as efforts to harmonize domestic legislation on 
children&#8217;s rights with the provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Chile 
commended Kuwait for progress made thus far in achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. The Netherlands asked the Government of Kuwait to elaborate on measures taken to 
address the situation of stateless Beduns and requested its views regarding the need to 
ensure that women were represented in Kuwait&#8217;s judiciary. The Netherlands also expressed 
concern about the persistence of discrimination against women in various laws and about 
the situation of foreign domestic workers. The Netherlands made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Slovakia expressed concerns over the conditions of domestic servants and welcomed 
the amendments to the labour law. It referred to the Nationality Law, adopted in 1959, and 
noted that a substantial part of the country&#8217;s population had been left stateless and had been 
often subjected to various forms of discrimination, unlike regular citizens. Slovakia 
commended Kuwait for its recent steps regarding stateless persons. Slovakia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Belgium noted with satisfaction the voluntary commitments undertaken by Kuwait, 
in particular to changing the law on labour in the private sector. Belgium asked what 
measures were envisaged to improve the status of migrant workers and, in particular, 
domestic workers, and was interested to know about the process and the characteristics of 
the law being prepared in the National Assembly. Belgium was also concerned about the 
situation of Beduns. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Nepal referred to the achievements accomplished in the areas of, inter alia, 
education and children&#8217;s and maternal health. Nepal noted with appreciation Kuwait&#8217;s 
cooperation with developing and least developed countries through the Kuwait Fund for 
Economic Development.  It encouraged Kuwait to continue its efforts to ensure that 
migrant workers, including domestic workers, enjoyed their fundamental right to protection 
from any form of discrimination or exploitation. </p>


<p>70. Djibouti noted with satisfaction the measures taken by Kuwait to facilitate the 
implementation of principles relating to human rights, particularly in the field of justice. It 
welcomed the priority accorded to women and children and noted the efforts made to 
protect the rights of persons with disabilities, including the renewed commitment to accede 
to CPD. Djibouti noted that Millennium Development Goals had been achieved before the 
deadline of 2015 and praised Kuwait&#8217;s commitment to providing general and effective aid 
to developing countries. 
</p>
<p>71. Slovenia referred to reports regarding the legality of corporal punishment and 
recommendations made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other relevant 
actors in that regard. It also noted that no data existed on the prevalence of violence against 
women, which had made it difficult to ascertain the magnitude of the problem or the 
effectiveness of the Government response. It also noted that Kuwait still retained the death 
penalty in the statute books and in practice. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Turkey asked whether Kuwait planned to establish a national institution to address 
all human rights matters. It also congratulated Kuwait on strengthening the role of civil 
society. Turkey inquired about the legal procedures that had been instituted for enacting a 
new law on the private sector regarding the minimum wage. It also asked about the draft 
law on the well-being of persons with disabilities, aimed at guaranteeing their rights in 
various areas. Turkey asked about the efforts to prepare legislation to combat human 
trafficking. Turkey made no recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Senegal was pleased by the positive achievements accomplished in the efforts to 
promote social and economic rights, in particular in combating poverty and in the field of 
health and education. Senegal also noted with appreciation efforts made to ensure the 
effective enjoyment of civil and political rights, in particular the good cooperation with 
civil society and the constant improvement of the situation of foreigners. Senegal made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. France noted with satisfaction Kuwait&#8217;s plans to establish a national human rights 
institution. While referring to reforms in favour of migrant workers, France expressed 
concern about the situation of domestic workers in particular. France made reference to 
difficulties and discrimination faced by stateless persons, in particular Beduns, indicating 
that while Kuwait had taken measures to address their situation, the essential issue of their 
status had not been clarified. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. The delegation noted that the definition of stateless persons in Kuwait had no legal 
basis, as they were called &#8220;illegal residents&#8221; and that the law had set criteria for acquiring 
Kuwaiti nationality. During the invasion of Kuwait, many of the 240,000 people claiming 
to be stateless had left the country. After the establishment in 2006 of a special committee 
to follow up on their situation, 23,000 had regularized their situation. There were currently 
93,334 illegal residents in Kuwait. The State offered a number of services to illegal 
residents, including health care, education, housing and social security services. 
Furthermore, all the necessary official documents requested by those residents had been 
provided to them, and some of them worked in the public and private sectors. In addition, 
illegal residents enjoyed the right to gain access to courts, to state their opinions and to be 
provided with passports for religious, medical or education purposes. They were also 
covered by the law on disabilities. 
</p>
<p>76. Kuwait attached great importance to foreign workers, as reflected by the enactment 
of legislation to promote and protect their rights and regulate their conditions of work. 
Ministerial Decree 1182/2010 had made it compulsory that employment agencies and 
employers draw up a contract with the domestic worker to provide a wide range of legal 
protections for his or her rights. The Office for Domestic Workers had been established to 
issue authorizations to employment agencies and monitor their work to ensure that they did </p>


<p>not exploit such workers. The Office had registered more than 1,624 complaints from 
domestic workers in 2009. A centre had been set up to shelter domestic workers who were 
in conflict with their employers, and offered them a wide range of services.  
</p>
<p>77. Law 6/2010 had been promulgated following consultations with trade unions and 
employer representatives. It required employers to provide employees with accommodation 
and transportation in remote areas and guaranteed the right of all workers to join trade 
unions. The law prohibited forced labour as well as all forms of mistreatment of employees, 
who could leave their work by their own will and without informing the employer, while 
retaining their financial benefits. 
</p>
<p>78. The delegation stressed that the penal code included sanctions against any kind of 
physical violence as well as sexual violence against women. The code also contained 
provisions related to mistreatment committed by public officials against individuals and 
specified the sanctions for crimes that could amount to torture. Any confession obtained 
under coercion or torture was not accepted before the courts. <b>
