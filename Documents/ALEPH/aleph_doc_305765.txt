Item 1. Business and Properties
GENERAL
Denbury Resources Inc.
PART I
Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a growing, dividend-paying, domestic oil and natural gas company with 
468.3 MMBOE of estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December(cid:160)31, 2013, of which 83% is oil.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our primary focus 
is on enhanced oil recovery utilizing CO2, and our operations are focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky 
Mountain regions.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and 
proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to tertiary recovery operations.
As part of our corporate strategy, we believe in the following fundamental principles:
•
•
•
•
•
focus in specific regions where we either have, or believe we can create, a competitive advantage as a result of our 
ownership or use of CO2 reserves, oil fields and CO2 infrastructure;
acquire properties where we believe additional value can be created through tertiary recovery operations and a combination 
of other exploitation, development, exploration and marketing techniques;
acquire properties that give us a majority working interest and operational control or where we believe we can ultimately 
obtain it;
•  maximize the value and cash flow generated from our operations by increasing production and reserves while controlling
costs;
optimize the timing and allocation of capital among our investment opportunities to maximize the rates of return on our 
investments;
return a portion of the cash flow generated from our operations to shareholders through regular quarterly dividend 
payments, and repurchases of our common stock made from time to time; and
•  maintain a highly competitive team of experienced and incentivized personnel.
Denbury has been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997.  Our corporate headquarters is located at 
5320 Legacy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000.  At December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had 1,501 employees, 
807 of whom were employed in field operations or at our field offices.(cid:160)(cid:160)We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports 
on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15
(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available free of charge on or through our Internet website, www.denbury.com, as 
soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.(cid:160)(cid:160)The SEC also maintains 
a  website,  www.sec.gov,  which  contains  reports,  proxy  and  information  statements  and  other  information  filed  by 
Denbury.(cid:160)(cid:160)Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Form 10-K") we use the terms "Denbury," "Company," "we," "our," 
and "us" to refer to Denbury Resources Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries.
2012 AND 2013 MAJOR PROPERTY EXCHANGES AND ACQUISITIONS
We set the stage for our 2013 business developments with two major transactions.  In December 2012, we closed a sale and 
exchange  transaction  with  Exxon  Mobil  Corporation  and  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  XTO  Energy  Inc,  (collectively, 
"ExxonMobil") under which we sold to ExxonMobil our Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for (1) 
$1.3 billion in cash, (2) operating interests in Hartzog Draw and Webster fields in Wyoming and Texas, respectively, and (3) an 
overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge 
Field in Wyoming (the "Bakken Exchange Transaction").  We utilized cash received in this exchange to fund our March 2013 
acquisition of producing assets in the Cedar Creek Anticline ("CCA") in Montana and North Dakota from ConocoPhillips Company 
("ConocoPhillips") for $1.05 billion in cash, before closing adjustments.
Taken together, these two asset transactions nearly replaced the production of the sold assets with production from the acquired 
assets, exchanged proved reserves with a high proved undeveloped component in the Bakken for reserves that were nearly all 
proved developed in CCA, increased our Rocky Mountain CO2 reserves by 1.3 Tcf and our CO2 deliverability by up to 115 MMcf/
d, and positioned us to provide dividends to our stockholders as discussed below.

2013 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
Denbury Resources Inc.
In the fourth quarter of 2013, following a comprehensive review of our long-term plans, we announced our intention to expand 
our shareholder value proposition to include both growth and income.  The expansion includes the initiation of regular quarterly 
cash dividend payments to our shareholders starting with $0.0625 per share (a rate of $0.25 per share on an annualized basis).  
The first quarterly cash dividend of $0.0625 was declared on January 28, 2014, payable March 25, 2014, to shareholders of record 
as of the close of business on February 25, 2014.  Based on our current financial projections and commodity price outlook, we 
expect to grow our annual dividend rate to between $0.50 per share and $0.60 per share in 2015 and at a sustainable rate thereafter.  
All dividends are discretionary and subject to declaration by Denbury’s Board of Directors.
To expand our free cash flow, we adjusted certain of our development plans and timelines for various capital projects, principally 
in the Rocky Mountain region, in order to reduce our spending on certain major infrastructure projects over the next few years.  
These adjustments allowed us to accelerate our plan of providing a return to our shareholders through a growing cash dividend, 
while still growing our reserves and production.  Our focused strategy, significant inventory of development projects and proven 
track record of value creation give us confidence that we can deliver a long-term cash flow profile that is unique among independent 
oil companies and successfully execute on our value-driven growth and income strategy in 2014 and beyond.
2013 business developments also include the following:
•
Increased our average tertiary oil production to 38,477 Bbls/d in 2013, a 9% increase from average tertiary production in 
2012, primarily due to continued field development and expansion of facilities in our existing CO2 floods at Delhi, Hastings, 
Heidelberg and Oyster Bayou fields.
•  Added total proved reserves of 84.6 MMBOE including estimated proved tertiary reserves of 34.0 MMBbls at Bell Creek 
Field, proved non-tertiary reserves of 42.2 MMBOE (added through our 2013 acquisition of interests at CCA) and 8.4 MMBOE 
of other additions or revisions.
•  Added estimated proved CO2 reserves of 350 Bcf as a result of successful drilling in the Jackson Dome area, our primary
source of CO2 for the Gulf Coast region.
•  Continued our share repurchase program, under which we repurchased a total of 16.5 million shares of Denbury common 
stock  for  $277.8  million  during  2013.    We  have  purchased  a  total  of  59.4  million  shares  of  Denbury  common  stock 
(approximately 14.8% of our outstanding shares of common stock at September 30, 2011) for $931.2 million, or an average 
of $15.68 per share, since commencement of the share repurchase program in October 2011 and continuing through February 
20, 2014.  As of February 20, 2014, we had $230.7 million remaining for future purchases under our authorized share repurchase 
program.
•  Commenced injection of CO2 into our first two tertiary floods in the Rocky Mountain region, Bell Creek Field in Montana 
and Grieve Field in Wyoming during the first half of 2013, and commenced our first tertiary oil production in that region from 
Bell Creek Field during the third quarter of 2013.
•
Placed our Riley Ridge gas processing facility into service in the fourth quarter of 2013.
•  Commenced a horizontal oil drilling program at Hartzog Draw Field in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming targeting the 
Shannon formation.  We expect the horizontal wells to increase the field's non-tertiary oil production and reserves and to 
eventually be utilized in our planned future CO2 flood of the field.
•
Issued $1.2 billion of 4 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 in February 2013.  The net proceeds of approximately 
$1.18  billion  were  used  to  repurchase  or  redeem  our  9½%  Senior  Subordinated  Notes  due  2016  and  our  9¾%  Senior 
Subordinated Notes due 2016, and to pay down a portion of outstanding borrowings on our bank credit facility.
•  Closed our acquisition of producing assets in the CCA in Montana and North Dakota in March 2013 from a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of ConocoPhillips for $1.05 billion in cash, before closing adjustments.  The assets purchased include both additional 
interests in certain of our existing operated fields in CCA, as well as operating interests in other CCA fields.

OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
Summary. Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United 
States.(cid:160)(cid:160)Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, 
Louisiana and Alabama, and in the Rocky Mountain region in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our primary focus is using 
CO2 in EOR, and we expect the development plan for our current portfolio of CO2 EOR projects will allow us to grow our oil 
production for the remainder of the decade.
We have been conducting and expanding EOR operations on our assets in the Gulf Coast region since 1999, and as a result, 
we currently have many more CO2 EOR projects in this region than in the Rocky Mountain region.  In the Gulf Coast region, we 
own what is, to our knowledge, its only significant naturally occurring source of CO2.  These large volumes of naturally occurring 
CO2 have allowed us to significantly grow our production in that region.  In addition to the sources of CO2 we currently own, in 
2013 we began to purchase and use anthropogenic (man-made) CO2 in our tertiary operations.  We believe these man-made sources 
of CO2 will help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields while also providing an economical way to reduce atmospheric 
CO2 emissions through the concurrent underground storage of CO2 from our oil-producing EOR operations, and expect the amount 
of anthropogenic CO2 we use in such operations to grow in the future.
Through December(cid:160)31, 2013, we have invested a total of $3.5 billion in our tertiary fields in the Gulf Coast region (including 
allocated acquisition costs and amounts assigned to goodwill), have recovered all of these costs, and have generated $1.5 billion 
of excess net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures related to 
pipelines and CO2 source fields).(cid:160)(cid:160)Of this total invested amount, approximately $206.7(cid:160)million (6%) has been spent on fields that 
did not yet have any appreciable proved reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)The proved oil reserves in our Gulf Coast tertiary oil(cid:160)fields 
have a year-end 2013 PV-10 Value of $6.1 billion.(cid:160)(cid:160)Including the Green Pipeline, which currently serves our Hastings and Oyster 
Bayou fields, we have invested a total of $2.1 billion in CO2-producing assets and pipelines in the Gulf Coast region.
We  began  operations  in  the  Rocky  Mountain  region  in  2010  as  part  of  our  merger  with  Encore Acquisition  Company 
("Encore").(cid:160)(cid:160)In late 2012, we completed construction of the first section of the 20-inch Greencore Pipeline, our first CO2 pipeline 
in the Rocky Mountain region, and received our first CO2 deliveries from the Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming during the 
first quarter of 2013.  We also began injecting CO2 into Grieve Field in Wyoming early in 2013 and currently expect initial tertiary 
oil production from Grieve Field in 2015.(cid:160) We started injections at our Bell Creek Field in Montana during the second quarter of 
2013, with tertiary oil production from this field commencing in the third quarter of 2013.  In addition to our current tertiary floods 
in the Rocky Mountain region, we currently have long-term plans to flood Hartzog Draw Field and CCA after we perform additional 
non-tertiary development of these fields.  CCA is a geological structure over 126 miles in length consisting of 14 different operating 
areas.  Our Riley Ridge Field acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 and acquisition of an interest in CO2 reserves from ExxonMobil in 
2012 are expected to provide us the CO2 necessary for our current inventory of CO2 EOR projects in the Rocky Mountain region.
Field Summary Table.  The following table provides a summary by field and region of selected proved oil and natural gas 
reserve information, including total proved reserve quantities and the associated PV-10 Value of those reserves as of December(cid:160)31, 
2013, and average daily production and net revenue interest ("NRI") for 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)The reserve estimates for all years presented were 
prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas.(cid:160)(cid:160)We serve as operator of 
virtually all of our significant properties, in which we also own most of the interests, although typically less than a 100% working 
interest, and a lesser NRI due to royalties and other burdens.(cid:160)(cid:160)For additional oil and natural gas reserves information, see Estimated 
Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Present Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues below.

(1)  The reserves were prepared in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification ("FASC") Topic 932, 
Extractive Industries – Oil and Gas, using the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity price 
for each month during 2013.  These prices were $96.94 per Bbl for crude oil and $3.67 per MMBtu for natural gas, both of 
which were adjusted for market differentials by field.
(2)  PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows 
("Standardized Measure") in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 
Standardized Measure was $7.1 billion at December(cid:160)31, 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)A comparison of PV-10 Value to the Standardized Measure 
is included in the reserves table in Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Present Value of 
Estimated Future Net Revenues below.  The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from data determined 
in accordance with FASC Topic 932.(cid:160)(cid:160)See the definition of PV-10 Value in the Glossary and Selected Abbreviations.

Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview.  CO2 used in EOR is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing 
crude oil.(cid:160)(cid:160)When injected at pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO2 acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels 
through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold.(cid:160)(cid:160)CO2 tertiary 
floods are unique in that they require large volumes of CO2.  The terms "tertiary flood," "CO2 flood" and "CO2 EOR" are used 
interchangeably throughout this document.
While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO2 have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in 
a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we apply what we have learned and developed over the 
years to fields to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO2 EOR projects we operate, which include (1) well evaluation 
and monitoring methods, (2) monitoring the flood and striving to direct the CO2 to all economically recoverable portions of the 
oil-bearing reservoirs, (3) new completion techniques, (4) varied operating equipment and operating methods, and (5) application 
of intense reservoir management and production techniques.(cid:160)(cid:160)We began our CO2 operations in August 1999, when we acquired 
Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO2 reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001.(cid:160)(cid:160)Based upon our 
success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO2 reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts 
to focus a greater percentage on CO2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily, and now almost exclusively, 
on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO2 EOR projects, although prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to 
maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which 
tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production.(cid:160)(cid:160)With the sale of our Bakken area assets in 
2012, our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO2 
or plan to flood with CO2 in the future, or assets that produce CO2.(cid:160)(cid:160)We believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge 
give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate.
Our tertiary operations have grown so that (1) 49% of our proved reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013 are proved tertiary oil 
reserves; (2) 55% of our 2013 production was related to tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis); and (3) 77% of our 2013 capital 
expenditures (excluding acquisitions) were related to our tertiary oil operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)At year-end 2013, the proved oil reserves in our 
tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately $6.9 billion, or 64% of our total PV-10 Value.(cid:160)(cid:160)In 
addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or 
planned.(cid:160)(cid:160)Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct these pipelines and production 
facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, 
including (1) a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and 
geological data, (2) a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices (we currently estimate our economic break-even point 
before corporate-related overhead, based on currently estimated expenses, occurs at oil prices in the low-to-mid $40-per-barrel 
range, depending on the specific field and area), (3) limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions, (4) 
our EOR operations are generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because 
we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields, and (5) through our oil-producing EOR operations, we concurrently 
store anthropogenic CO2 in the same underground formations that had previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas.

Gulf Coast Region
CO2(cid:160)Sources and Pipelines
Jackson Dome.(cid:160) Our primary Gulf Coast CO2 source, Jackson Dome, located near Jackson, Mississippi, was discovered 
during the 1970s by oil and gas companies that were exploring for hydrocarbons.(cid:160)(cid:160)This large and relatively pure source of naturally 
occurring CO2 (98% CO2) is, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO2 in the United States east of the 
Mississippi River, and we believe that it, together with the related CO2 pipeline infrastructure, provides us a significant strategic 
advantage in the acquisition of other properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO2 EOR.

We acquired Jackson Dome in February 2001 in a purchase that also gave us ownership and control of the NEJD CO2 pipeline 
and provided us with a reliable supply of CO2 at a reasonable and predictable cost for our Gulf Coast CO2 tertiary recovery 
operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Since February 2001, we have acquired and drilled numerous CO2-producing wells, significantly increasing our 
estimated proved Gulf Coast CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of acquisition to approximately 6.1 Tcf as of 
December(cid:160)31, 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)The CO2 reserve estimates are based on a gross working interest of the CO2 reserves, of which our net revenue 
interest is approximately 4.8 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proved CO2 reserves prepared by our outside reserves engineer, 
DeGolyer and MacNaughton.(cid:160)(cid:160)In discussing our available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and 
probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who 
are customers of Denbury and others, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream.
In addition to the proved reserves, we estimate that we have 2.5 Tcf of probable CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome.(cid:160)(cid:160)The majority 
of our probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in structures that have been drilled and tested in the area but are not currently 
capable of producing or are not considered proved reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault 
blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; (3) they are in undrilled structures where we have 
sufficient subsurface data, and seismic and geophysical attributes that provide a high degree of certainty that CO2 is present; or 
(4) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing reservoirs with proved reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our 
historically high drilling success rate, coupled with our seismic data across the undrilled structures, provide us with a reasonably 
high degree of certainty that additional proved CO2 reserves will be discovered and developed.
Although our current proved CO2 reserves are quite large, in order to continue our tertiary development of oil fields in the 
Gulf Coast region, incremental deliverability of CO2 is required.(cid:160)(cid:160)In order to obtain additional CO2 deliverability, we have conducted 
several 3D seismic surveys in the Jackson Dome area over the past several years, and anticipate drilling one development well in 
2014 that is intended to increase the area's productive capacity.
In addition to our drilling at Jackson Dome, we continue to expand our processing and dehydration capacities, and we continue 
to install pipelines and/or pumping stations necessary to transport the CO2 through our controlled pipeline network.  We expect 
our current proved reserves of CO2, coupled with a risked drilling program at Jackson Dome and expected anthropogenic sources, 
to  provide  sufficient  quantities  of  CO2  for  us  to  develop  our  proved  and  probable  EOR  reserves  in  the  Gulf  Coast  region.  
Additionally, in the future, we believe that once a CO2 flood in a field reaches its productive economic limit, we could recycle a 
portion of any CO2 that remains in that reservoir and utilize it for oil production in another tertiary flood.
In the Gulf Coast region, we also currently sell CO2 to third-party industrial users under contracts of various terms and currently 
have three CO2 volumetric production payment contracts.(cid:160)(cid:160)Approximately 91% of our average daily CO2 produced or acquired 
from anthropogenic sources in 2013, 2012 and 2011 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, with the balance delivered to 
third-party industrial users.(cid:160)(cid:160)During 2013, we used an average of 913 MMcf/d of CO2 (including CO2 from anthropogenic sources) 
for our tertiary activities.
Gulf Coast Anthropogenic CO2 Sources.(cid:160)(cid:160)In addition to our natural source of CO2, we are currently party to four long-term 
contracts to purchase man-made CO2 from four plants.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently purchase anthropogenic CO2 from an industrial facility in 
Port Arthur, Texas and from a plant in Geismar, Louisiana, and we anticipate taking deliveries in late 2014 from Mississippi Power's 
Kemper County Energy Facility.  We estimate these three sources will supply, in the aggregate, approximately 185 MMcf/d of 
CO2 to our EOR operations, although under certain circumstances they could provide higher or lower volumes.(cid:160)(cid:160)If the fourth plant 
for which we have a long-term CO2 purchase contract were also to be built (targeted for the 2018 time frame), we currently estimate 
this  source  in  Lake  Charles,  Louisiana  could  potentially  add  another  200  MMcf/d  of  CO2  volumes  to  our  anthropogenic 
sources.(cid:160)(cid:160)Construction of this remaining plant is considered probable, although such construction is contingent on the satisfactory 
resolution of various matters, including financing.(cid:160)(cid:160)Additionally, we are in ongoing discussions with other parties who have plans 
to construct plants near the Green Pipeline.
In addition to the potential CO2 sources discussed above, we continue to have ongoing discussions with owners of existing 
plants of various types that emit CO2 that we may be able to purchase and/or transport.  In order to capture such volumes, we (or 
the  plant  owner)  would  need  to  install  additional  equipment,  which  includes,  at  a  minimum,  compression  and  dehydration 
facilities.(cid:160)(cid:160)Most of these existing plants emit relatively small volumes of CO2, generally less than our contracted sources, but such 
volumes may still be attractive if the source is located near CO2 pipelines.(cid:160)(cid:160)The capture of CO2 could also be influenced by potential

federal legislation, which could impose economic penalties for atmospheric CO2 emissions.(cid:160)(cid:160)We believe that we are a likely 
purchaser of CO2 captured in our areas of operation because of the scale of our tertiary operations and our CO2 pipeline infrastructure.
Gulf Coast CO2 Pipelines.  We acquired the 183-mile NEJD CO2 pipeline that runs from Jackson Dome to near Donaldsonville, 
Louisiana, as part of the 2001 acquisition of our Jackson Dome source.(cid:160)(cid:160)Since 2001 we have acquired or constructed nearly 750 
miles of CO2 pipelines, which give us the ability to deliver CO2 throughout the Gulf Coast region.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, we 
have access to over 940 miles of CO2 pipelines in the Gulf Coast region.  In addition to the NEJD CO2 pipeline, the major pipelines 
are the Free State Pipeline (90 miles), the Delta Pipeline (110 miles), the Green Pipeline Texas (120 miles), and the Green Pipeline 
Louisiana (200 miles).
Completion of the Green Pipeline allowed for the first CO2 injection into Hastings Field, located near Houston, Texas, in 
2010, and gives us the ability to deliver CO2 to oil fields all along the Gulf Coast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Alvin, Texas.(cid:160)(cid:160)At 
the present time, most of the CO2 flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but we began receiving 
anthropogenic CO2 from an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas in 2012, and are currently transporting a third party's CO2 for 
a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field.(cid:160) We expect the volume of CO2 transported through the Green Pipeline to increase in 
future years as we develop our inventory of CO2 EOR projects in the Houston area.
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013
Mature properties.  Mature properties include our longest-producing properties which are generally located along our NEJD 
CO2 pipeline in southwest Mississippi and Louisiana and our Free State pipeline in east Mississippi.(cid:160)(cid:160)This group of properties 
includes our initial CO2 field, Little Creek, as well as several other fields (Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Lockhart Crossing, 
Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb and Soso fields).(cid:160)(cid:160)These fields accounted for 36% of our total 2013 CO2 EOR production and 
approximately 21% of our year-end proved tertiary reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)These fields have been producing for some time, and their production 
is generally declining.  Many of these fields contain multiple reservoirs that are amenable to CO2 EOR.  In 2014, we plan to invest 
approximately $115 million to further develop our mature tertiary properties.
In order to improve the oil recovery of our more mature CO2 EOR projects, we have experimented with various techniques 
such as cement squeezes (injection and producing wells), chemical squeezes, perforation design, mechanical isolation assemblies 
and operating pressure controls.(cid:160)(cid:160)We have also utilized water-alternating-gas injections, where water is substituted for the CO2 for 
a given volume and then CO2 is injected behind the water.  Each one of these processes has had some success, and we plan to 
continue to utilize them in the future where appropriate.
From the time we originally acquired these properties through December(cid:160)31, 2013, we have recovered all our costs relating 
to our mature properties, and the excess net cash flow (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, including the 
acquisition costs) from the mature properties through that date was $1.9 billion.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, the estimated PV-10 
Value of our mature properties was $1.6 billion.
Delhi Field.  Delhi Field is located east of Monroe, Louisiana.(cid:160)(cid:160)During May 2006, we purchased Delhi for $50 million, plus 
an approximate 25% reversionary interest to the seller after we receive $200 million in "total net cash flow," as defined.(cid:160)(cid:160)We began 
well and facility development in 2008 and began delivering CO2 to the field in the fourth quarter of 2009 via the Delta Pipeline, 
which  runs  from  Tinsley  Field  to  Delhi  Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)First  tertiary  production  occurred  at  Delhi  Field  in  the  first  quarter  of 
2010.(cid:160)(cid:160)Production from Delhi in the fourth quarter of 2013 averaged 4,793 Bbls/d, down from 5,237 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter 
of 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)This decline in production is primarily related to our efforts to remediate a release of well fluids within an area of Delhi 
Field in the second quarter of 2013, consisting of a mixture of carbon dioxide, saltwater, natural gas and oil.  During 2013, we 
recorded $114.0 million of lease operating expenses in our Consolidated Statement of Operations related to this incident.  Costs 
incurred as a result of the release, together with lower production levels, are currently expected to delay the effective date of the 
reversionary interest into 2014, the specific timing of which is dependent upon, among other things, the amount and timing of any 
potential insurance proceeds received and their application to the calculation of "total net cash flow," as well as oil prices, production, 
and production costs.  We currently estimate that the reversionary date could occur as late as the fourth quarter of 2014.  See Item 
7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Delhi Field Release 
and Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this matter.  In 
2014, we plan to invest approximately $40 million in this field, primarily to install a natural gas liquids extraction plant, which 
we anticipate will be operational in 2015.

From inception through December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had not yet recovered our investment in this field, and the remaining investment 
to be recovered (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, including acquisition costs) from Delhi Field was $111 
million.  As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, the estimated PV-10 Value of Delhi Field was $747.3 million.
Hastings Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas.(cid:160)(cid:160)We acquired a majority interest in this field in February 
2009 for $247 million.(cid:160)(cid:160)We initiated CO2 injection in the West Hastings Unit during the fourth quarter of 2010 upon completion 
of the construction of the Green Pipeline.(cid:160)(cid:160)Due to the large vertical oil column that exists in the field, we are developing the Frio 
reservoir using dedicated CO2 injection and producing wells for each of the major sand intervals.  We began producing oil from 
our EOR operations at Hastings Field in the first quarter of 2012, and we booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the West 
Hastings Unit in 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)During the fourth quarter of 2013, tertiary production from Hastings Field averaged 4,270 Bbls/d, compared 
to 3,409 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2012.  In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $75 million to continue developing the 
West Hastings Unit, including the development of additional patterns and expansion of the processing facilities.
From inception through December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had not yet recovered our investment in this field, and the remaining investment 
to be recovered (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, including the acquisition cost) from Hastings Field 
was $336 million.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, the estimated PV-10 Value of Hastings Field was $1.1 billion.
Heidelberg Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)Heidelberg Field is located in Mississippi and consists of an East Unit and a West Unit.(cid:160)(cid:160)Construction of 
the CO2 facility, connecting pipeline and well work commenced on the West Heidelberg Unit during 2008, with our first CO2 
injections into the Eutaw zone in the fourth quarter of 2008.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our first tertiary oil production occurred in the second quarter of 
2009, and during 2010, we added injection patterns and expanded the central processing facility.  In 2013, we began flooding the 
Christmas zone.(cid:160)(cid:160)During the fourth quarter of 2013, tertiary production at Heidelberg Field averaged 5,206 Bbls/d, compared to 
3,930 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $120 million to continue developing the East 
and West Heidelberg Units, including an expansion of our development of the Eutaw and Christmas zones and adjustments to our 
CO2 floods of existing zones to better direct the CO2 through the zones and optimize oil recovery from the field.
From inception through December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had not yet recovered our costs relating to the CO2 flood at Heidelberg Field, 
and the remaining investment to be recovered (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, including the acquisition 
costs) from the field was $10 million.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, the estimated PV-10 Value of Heidelberg Field was $1.1 billion.
Oyster Bayou Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)We acquired a majority interest in Oyster Bayou Field in 2007.  The field is located in southeast Texas, 
east of Galveston Bay.(cid:160)(cid:160)We began CO2 injections into Oyster Bayou in the second quarter of 2010.(cid:160)(cid:160)Oyster Bayou Field is somewhat 
unique when compared to our other CO2 EOR projects because the field covers a relatively small area of 3,912 acres. (cid:160)We commenced 
tertiary production from Oyster Bayou Field in the fourth quarter of 2011 from the Frio A-1 zone and booked initial proved tertiary 
reserves for the field in 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)During the fourth quarter of 2013, tertiary production at Oyster Bayou Field averaged 3,869 Bbls/
d, compared to 1,826 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2012.  In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $50 million to develop the 
Frio A-2 zone and optimize our Frio A-1 zone development.
From inception through December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had not yet recovered our investment in this field, and the remaining investment 
to be recovered (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, including the acquisition costs) from Oyster Bayou 
Field was $98 million.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, the estimated PV-10 Value of Oyster Bayou Field was $550.0 million.
Tinsley Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)We acquired Tinsley Field in 2006.  The field is located in Mississippi, was discovered and first developed in 
the 1930s and is separated into different fault blocks.(cid:160)(cid:160)As is the case with the majority of fields in Mississippi, Tinsley produces 
from multiple reservoirs.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations at Tinsley have thus far targeted the Woodruff formation, 
although there is additional potential in the Perry sandstone and other smaller reservoirs.(cid:160)(cid:160)We commenced tertiary oil production 
from Tinsley Field in the second quarter of 2008.(cid:160) In 2014, we expect to invest approximately $50 million to continue our 
development of the North Fault Block and to develop dedicated injection wells in the East Fault Block.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently expect our 
development of the Woodruff to be substantially complete by the end of 2014.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, the average 
tertiary oil production was 7,809 Bbls/d, compared to 8,166 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013
Webster Field.  We acquired our interest in Webster Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange 
Transaction.  The field is located in Texas, approximately eight miles northeast of our Hastings Field, which we are currently 
flooding with  CO2.   At  December(cid:160)31, 2013, Webster  Field had  estimated proved  non-tertiary reserves of  approximately 3.2 
MMBOE, net to our acquired interest.(cid:160)(cid:160)During the fourth quarter of 2013, non-tertiary production at Webster Field averaged 1,036 
BOE/d.(cid:160)(cid:160)Webster Field is geologically similar to our Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths; as a result, 
we believe it is well suited for CO2 EOR.  In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $105 million to drill or recomplete injection 
and production wells and begin water injections to re-pressurize the reservoir.  We currently expect to commence CO2 injections 
at Webster Field in 2015, with first tertiary production expected late that same year.
Conroe  Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)Conroe  Field,  our  largest  potential  tertiary  flood  in  the  Gulf  Coast  region,  is  located  north  of  Houston, 
Texas.(cid:160)(cid:160)We acquired a majority interest in this field in 2009 for $271 million in cash and 11.6 million shares of Denbury common 
stock, for a total aggregate value of $439 million.(cid:160)(cid:160)Conroe Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 12.3 
MMBOE at December(cid:160)31, 2013, net to our interest, nearly all of which are proved developed.(cid:160)(cid:160)During the fourth quarter of 2013, 
production at Conroe Field averaged 2,697 BOE/d, compared to 2,745 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)Given the size of the 
Conroe Field (approximately 20,000 acres), the volume of CO2 that could be injected is quite sizable, and much larger than any 
field we have developed to date.(cid:160)(cid:160)Therefore, the pace of development will be dictated in part by the amount of available CO2.
A pipeline must be constructed so that CO2 can be delivered to Conroe Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)This pipeline, which is planned as an extension 
of our Green Pipeline, is preliminarily estimated to cover approximately 90 miles at a cost of approximately $220 million.  We 
currently expect to begin construction of this pipeline in 2016 and to commence CO2 injections at Conroe Field in 2017, with first 
tertiary production currently expected in 2018.  In 2014, we plan to continue work on pipeline route selection, right-of-way 
acquisition, engineering, and regulatory permits while building our CO2 EOR development plan for Conroe Field.  In 2014, we 
also plan to invest approximately $30 million on non-tertiary well recompletions and to begin water injections into the area of the 
field in which we plan to commence CO2 injections to begin building reservoir pressure.
Thompson Field.  We acquired our interest in Thompson Field in June 2012 for $366 million.  The field is located in Texas, 
approximately 18 miles west of our Hastings Field.  Thompson Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 
15.4 MMBOE at December(cid:160)31, 2013, net to our interest, of which approximately 54% are proved developed.(cid:160)(cid:160)During the fourth 
quarter of 2013, non-tertiary production at Thompson Field averaged 1,331 BOE/d net to our interest, compared to 1,517 BOE/d 
in the fourth quarter of 2012.(cid:160) Thompson Field is geologically similar to Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar 
depths and we therefore believe it is well suited for CO2 EOR.  Under the terms of the Thompson Field acquisition agreement, 
after the initiation of CO2 injection, the seller will retain approximately a 5% gross revenue interest (less severance taxes) once 
average monthly oil production exceeds 3,000 Bbls/d.  In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $15 million on non-tertiary drilling 
opportunities and facility upgrades.  We currently plan to commence CO2 injections at Thompson Field in 2018, with first tertiary 
production expected in 2020.
Rocky Mountain Region
CO2(cid:160)Sources and Pipelines
LaBarge Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)We acquired an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in 
ExxonMobil's CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction.  LaBarge 
Field is located in southwestern Wyoming.  The gas composition from LaBarge Field is expected to be approximately 65% CO2, 
approximately 18% to 20% methane, less than one percent helium, and the remainder various other gases.
During December 2013, we received approximately 41 MMcf/d from ExxonMobil's Shute Creek gas processing plant at 
LaBarge Field.  Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO2, we currently expect to ultimately receive up to 65 
MMcf/d of CO2 in 2014, rising to approximately 115 MMcf/d of CO2 by 2021 from such plant.  We pay ExxonMobil a fee to

process and deliver the CO2, which we plan to use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods.  As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, our 
interest in LaBarge Field consisted of approximately 1.3 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves.
The Riley Ridge Federal Unit is also located in southwestern Wyoming and produces gas from the same LaBarge Field.  In 
a series of two acquisitions in 2010 and 2011, we acquired 100% of the operating interests in Riley Ridge for $347 million.(cid:160)(cid:160)These 
purchases included a gas processing facility that was under construction at the purchase dates to separate the helium and natural 
gas from the gas stream.(cid:160)(cid:160)We placed our gas processing facility at Riley Ridge into service in the fourth quarter of 2013.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, our interest in Riley Ridge and minor surrounding acreage contained net proved reserves of 399 
Bcf (67 MMBOE) of natural gas and 2.0 Tcf of CO2 reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)The CO2 reserve estimates are based on the gross working interest 
of the CO2 reserves, in which our net revenue interest is approximately 1.6 Tcf.(cid:160)(cid:160)The helium reserves at Riley Ridge are owned 
primarily by the U.S. government; however, we have the right to produce and sell the helium reserves to a third party on behalf 
of the government.  In exchange for this right, we pay the U.S. government a fee that fluctuates based upon realized sales 
proceeds.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our helium extraction agreement with the U.S. government has a minimum term extending 20 years from first production 
and continuing thereafter until either party terminates the contract.  Reserve volumes presented herein assume that the term of this 
helium extraction agreement continues beyond 20 years, given the benefit to both parties to the agreement.  As of December(cid:160)31, 
2013, we estimate that Riley Ridge contains proved helium reserves of 13.3 Bcf, which volume estimate is reduced to reflect the 
related fee we will remit to the U.S. government.(cid:160)(cid:160)In addition, we believe there is significant reserve potential in other acreage 
surrounding Riley Ridge in which we also own an interest.
The gas processing facility at Riley Ridge will separate for sale the natural gas and helium from the full well stream, and the 
remaining  gases,  including  CO2,  will  be  re-injected  into  the  producing  formation  or  a  deeper  formation  until  we  complete 
construction of a planned CO2 capture facility and pipeline later this decade.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently project that we will start to use CO2 
from Riley Ridge around 2020, following completion of the capture facility and planned CO2 pipeline connecting Riley Ridge to 
our existing Greencore Pipeline.
Other Rocky Mountain CO2 Sources.(cid:160)(cid:160)We began purchasing and receiving CO2 from the Lost Cabin plant in central Wyoming 
in the first quarter of 2013, under a contract that provides us as much as 50 MMcf/d of CO2 for use in our Rocky Mountain region 
CO2 floods.  Our volumes received from the plant averaged approximately 22 MMcf/d in 2013. (cid:160)We plan to continue to pursue 
additional sources for CO2 supply in the Rocky Mountain region.
Greencore Pipeline.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 20-inch Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO2 pipeline we have constructed in the Rocky 
Mountain region.(cid:160)(cid:160)We plan to use the pipeline as our trunk line in the Rocky Mountain region, eventually connecting our Lost 
Cabin, LaBarge and Riley Ridge CO2 sources (see Rocky Mountain Region CO2 Sources and Pipelines above) to the Cedar Creek 
Anticline in eastern Montana.  The initial 232-mile section of the Greencore Pipeline begins at the Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming 
and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana.(cid:160)(cid:160)We completed construction of this section of the pipeline in the fourth quarter of 
2012 and received our first CO2 deliveries from the Lost Cabin gas plant during the first quarter of 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)In the first quarter of 
2014, we completed construction of an interconnect between our Greencore Pipeline and an existing third-party CO2 pipeline in 
Wyoming, which will enable us to transport CO2 from LaBarge Field to our Bell Creek Field.
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013
Bell Creek Field.(cid:160)(cid:160)Bell Creek Field is located in southeast Montana.(cid:160)(cid:160)The oil-producing reservoir in Bell Creek Field is a 
sandstone reservoir with characteristics similar to those we have successfully flooded with CO2 in the Gulf Coast region; as a 
result, we believe it is well suited for CO2 EOR.  We acquired our interest in Bell Creek Field through the Encore merger in 2010 
and have worked since that time to commence a CO2 EOR project in the field.  We began first CO2 injections during the second 
quarter of 2013, recorded our first tertiary oil production in the third quarter of 2013, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves 
in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Tertiary production, net to our interest, during the fourth quarter of 2013 averaged 177 Bbls/d.(cid:160)(cid:160)In 
2014, we plan to invest approximately $55 million to expand our CO2 flood of Bell Creek Field.
From inception through December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had not yet recovered our investment in this field, and the remaining investment 
to be recovered (revenue less operating expenses and capital expenditures, including the acquisition costs) from Bell Creek Field 
was $432 million.  As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, the estimated PV-10 Value of Bell Creek Field was $739.0 million.

Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013
Cedar Creek Anticline.(cid:160)(cid:160)CCA is the largest potential EOR property that we own and currently our largest producing property.  
The field is primarily located in Montana but covers such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North 
Dakota.(cid:160)(cid:160)CCA is a series of 14 producing areas, each of which could be considered a field by itself.(cid:160)(cid:160)We acquired our initial interest 
in CCA as part of the Encore merger in 2010 and acquired additional interests (the "CCA Acquisition") from a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of ConocoPhillips in the first quarter of 2013.  See 2013 Business Developments above and Note 2, Acquisitions and 
Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction and information as to other recent 
acquisitions and divestitures by Denbury.  The 2013 CCA Acquisition added 42.2 MMBOE of incremental proved reserves.  
Production from CCA, net to our interest, averaged 18,601 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to pro forma 
production during the fourth quarter of 2012 of 19,493 BOE/d (including production associated with our newly acquired CCA 
assets of approximately 11,000 BOE/d and production from our previously owned CCA assets of 8,493 BOE/d).  The non-tertiary 
proved reserves associated with CCA were 105.4 MMBbls of oil and 6.0 Bcf of gas as of December(cid:160)31, 2013.
CCA is located approximately 110 miles north of Bell Creek Field, and we currently expect to ultimately connect this field 
to our Greencore Pipeline.(cid:160)(cid:160)In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $110 million to improve waterfloods, drill new wells, and 
recomplete existing wells.  We currently plan to commence CO2 injections at CCA after 2020.
Grieve Field.  In the second quarter of 2011, we entered into a farm-in agreement, under which we will obtain a 65% working 
interest in Grieve Field, located in Natrona County, Wyoming, in exchange for developing the Grieve Field CO2 flood.(cid:160)(cid:160)We 
completed a three-mile CO2 pipeline to deliver CO2 from an existing CO2 pipeline to the Grieve Field in the fourth quarter of 
2012, and are preparing for construction of the field's CO2 recycle facility.(cid:160)(cid:160)We began injecting CO2 into Grieve Field during the 
first quarter of 2013 and currently expect tertiary production to commence in 2015.
Hartzog Draw Field.  We acquired our interest in Hartzog Draw Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken 
Exchange Transaction.  The field is located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, approximately 12 miles from 
our Greencore Pipeline.  Hartzog Draw Field had estimated proved reserves of approximately 5.2 MMBOE at December(cid:160)31, 2013, 
net to our acquired interest, 1.9 MMBOE of which relate to the natural gas producing Big George coal zone.(cid:160)(cid:160)During the fourth 
quarter of 2013, non-tertiary production averaged 2,204 BOE/d.  We believe the oil reservoir characteristics of Hartzog Draw 
Field make it well suited for CO2 EOR.  In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $40 million to drill and complete six horizontal 
wells in the Shannon formation and re-frac eight existing wells.  We anticipate drilling additional horizontal wells in the Shannon 
formation over the next several years.  The drilling of these wells is expected to generate near-term cash flow, as well as complement 
our planned future CO2 EOR project in the field.  We must obtain regulatory approval and construct a CO2 pipeline from our 
existing Greencore Pipeline to Hartzog Draw Field before we can commence our planned CO2 EOR project.  We currently plan 
to commence CO2 injections at Hartzog Draw Field after 2020.
Other Non-Tertiary Oil Properties
Although almost all of our oil and natural gas properties are either existing or planned future tertiary floods (discussed above), 
we also produce oil and natural gas either from fields that are not amenable to EOR or out of specific reservoirs (within an existing 
tertiary field) that are not amenable to EOR.  For example, at Heidelberg Field, we produce natural gas from the Selma Chalk 
reservoir, which is separate from the Christmas and Eutaw reservoirs currently being flooded with CO2.  Production from these 
other non-tertiary properties totaled 6,994 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2013, compared to 18,615 BOE/d during the fourth 
quarter of 2012.  Production during the fourth quarter of 2012 includes 10,064 BOE/d of production from our Bakken area assets 
that were sold during that period.
 
OIL AND GAS ACREAGE, PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DRILLING ACTIVITY
In the data below, "gross" represents the total acres or wells in which we own a working interest and "net" represents the gross 
acres or wells multiplied by our working interest percentage.(cid:160)(cid:160)For the wells that produce both oil and gas, the well is typically 
classified as an oil or natural gas well based on the ratio of oil to natural gas production.

(1)  An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive 
of oil or natural gas in another reservoir.(cid:160) Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension 
well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well.(cid:160) A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas 
reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
(2)  A productive well is an exploratory or development well found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient
quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
(3)  A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well.
(4)  During 2013, 2012 and 2011, an additional 43, 56 and 46 wells, respectively, were drilled for water or CO2 injection purposes.

(2)  Production costs include $114 million of lease operating expenses recorded during 2013 to remediate an area of Delhi Field.  
Excluding estimated Delhi Field remediation costs, average production costs in 2013 totaled $25.93 per BOE for the Gulf 
Coast Region and $24.05 per BOE for the Company as a whole.
PRODUCTION AND UNIT PRICES
Further information regarding average production rates, unit sale prices and unit costs per BOE are set forth under Item 7, 
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Operating 
Results Table, included herein.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition 
of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant(cid:160)defects 
on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. (cid:160)We believe that title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and 
defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including 
encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding(cid:160)royalty and other similar interests.
SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING
Oil and gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis under short-term contracts at the current area market price.  The loss of any 
single purchaser would not be expected to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single 
purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact 
the prices we receive.(cid:160)(cid:160)For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural 
gas revenues: Marathon Petroleum Company (33%), Plains Marketing LP (15%), and Eighty-Eight Oil LLC (10%).  For the years 
ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon 
Petroleum Company (39% and 43% in 2012 and 2011, respectively) and Plains Marketing LP (17% and 16% in 2012 and 2011, 
respectively).
Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic 
production and imports of oil and gas, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines, the available capacity in 
such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our 
production in the Gulf Coast region is primarily from developed fields close to major pipelines or refineries and established 
infrastructure.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our production in the Rocky Mountain region is dependent on, among other factors, limited transportation options 
caused by oversubscribed pipelines and market centers that are distant from producing properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, we 
have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for all of our production as it becomes available or in transporting 
our production to those markets; however, there is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or 
obtain favorable prices.
Oil Marketing
Over the past couple of years, the oil produced in the Gulf Coast region has benefited from strong pricing differentials in 
relation to NYMEX and, where possible, we have attached our production to Louisiana Light Sweet ("LLS") pricing.  During 
2013, LLS pricing and NYMEX pricing have been much closer together, with the fourth quarter of 2013 quarterly average LLS-
to-NYMEX differential (on a trade-month basis) narrowing to a positive $2.58 per Bbl, suggesting a return to historical spreads 
compared to the wider-than-normal positive LLS-to-NYMEX spreads we experienced during 2012 and 2011.  During 2013, our 
light sweet oil production in this area, on average, sold for $7.44 per Bbl over NYMEX compared to more than $11.50 per Bbl 
over NYMEX in 2012 and 2011.(cid:160) The pricing of other Gulf Coast grades was relatively consistent with NYMEX pricing in 2013, 
with our light and medium sour crude production selling at a premium to NYMEX of $0.08 per Bbl. (cid:160)The market dynamics of the 
region suggest the possibility that differentials to NYMEX will narrow due to the influx of light sweet crude and condensate from 
producing regions outside of the Gulf Coast region by rail and publicly announced major pipeline projects.(cid:160) Our current markets, 
at various sales points along the Gulf Coast, have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance

of future demand.  We are, therefore, monitoring the marketplace for opportunities to strategically enter into long-term marketing 
arrangements.
The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to market 
centers  in  Guernsey, Wyoming;  Clearbrook,  Minnesota;  and Wood  River,  Illinois.(cid:160)(cid:160)Shipments  on  some  of  the  pipelines  are 
oversubscribed and subject to apportionment.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently have access to sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; 
however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the 
future.(cid:160)(cid:160)Expansion of pipeline and newly built rail infrastructure in the Rocky Mountain region is ongoing and, we believe, has 
improved the overall stability of oil differentials in the area.  However, because local demand for production is small in comparison 
to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to coastal markets.  Therefore, 
prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in those coastal 
markets. (cid:160)For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, the discount for our oil production in the Rocky Mountain region averaged $8.10 
per Bbl, compared to $11.86 per Bbl during 2012 and $5.15 per Bbl during 2011.  Excluding the Bakken area assets that we sold 
during the fourth quarter of 2012, our oil production in the Rocky Mountain region sold at a discount to NYMEX of $8.43 per 
Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2012.
Overall, during 2013, we sold approximately 46% of our crude oil at prices based on the LLS index price, approximately 23% 
at prices partially tied to the LLS index price, and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to NYMEX prices, 
primarily in the Rocky Mountain region.
Natural Gas Marketing
Virtually all of our natural gas production in the Gulf Coast region is close to existing pipelines; consequently, we generally 
have a variety of options to market our natural gas.(cid:160)(cid:160)However, our natural gas production in the Rocky Mountain region, like our 
oil production, is dependent on, among other factors, limited transportation options that can affect our ability to find markets for 
it.(cid:160)(cid:160)We sell the majority of our natural gas on one-year contracts, with prices fluctuating month to month based on published 
pipeline indices and with slight premiums or discounts to the index.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently receive near NYMEX or Henry Hub prices for 
most of our natural gas sales in Mississippi.(cid:160)(cid:160)For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, the amount received for our Mississippi 
natural gas production averaged $0.12 per Mcf over NYMEX prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)In the Texas Gulf Coast region, due primarily to its location, 
the price we received for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013 averaged $0.12 per Mcf below NYMEX prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)The CCA natural 
gas production in the Rocky Mountain region is sold at the wellhead on a percent-of-proceeds basis.(cid:160)(cid:160)We receive a percentage of 
proceeds on both the residue natural gas volumes and the natural gas liquids volumes.(cid:160)(cid:160)The natural gas has a significant component 
of propane, butanes and other higher-density hydrocarbons, resulting in a measurable natural gas liquids stream.(cid:160)(cid:160)In addition, we 
have coal bed methane production in the Hartzog Draw that is sold at the Cheyenne Hub.  For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, 
we averaged $0.57 per Mcf below NYMEX prices for our Rocky Mountain region natural gas production due primarily to its 
location, the natural gas liquids extracted from the CCA gas stream (resulting in a decreased net price), and the quality of the coal 
bed methane gas in Wyoming.
Helium Marketing
We placed the Riley Ridge gas processing facility in service in the fourth quarter of 2013.  During 2014, we expect to begin 
to supply helium to a third party purchaser under a 20-year helium supply arrangement.(cid:160) Helium will be sold under the contract 
at a price that will fluctuate based on helium deliveries, CPI and other factors over the 20-year term.
COMPETITION AND MARKETS
We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing 
properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO2 properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining 
goods, services and labor.(cid:160)(cid:160)Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources.(cid:160)(cid:160)Factors that affect 
our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our 
expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments.(cid:160)(cid:160)Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our 
tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of CO2 in the Gulf Coast and Rocky 
Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain 
aspects of our business.

The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists, 
geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with 
commodity prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel.(cid:160)(cid:160)In recent years, the competition for qualified technical personnel 
has been extensive, and our personnel costs have been escalating.  There have also been periods with shortages of drilling rigs 
and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled.(cid:160)(cid:160)These factors 
also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.(cid:160)(cid:160)We cannot be certain when we will experience 
these issues, and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating 
results, and cause significant delays in our development operations.
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS
Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry.(cid:160)(cid:160)Additions or changes to these laws 
and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment.  Compliance with this evolving 
regulatory burden is often difficult, and substantial penalties may be incurred for noncompliance.  Additionally, the future annual 
cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by 
several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements.  Management believes that continued compliance 
with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse 
effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance 
therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected 
production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us.(cid:160)(cid:160)We cannot predict the cost or impact
of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives.
Regulation of Natural Gas and Oil Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.(cid:160)(cid:160)Such regulation includes requiring 
permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; 
the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging 
and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our 
operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations.(cid:160)(cid:160)These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing 
or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)In 
addition, state conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict 
the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.(cid:160)(cid:160)The effect of these 
laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of 
wells or the locations at which we can drill.(cid:160)(cid:160)The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our costs of doing business 
and, consequently, affects our profitability.
Federal Regulation of Sales Prices and Transportation
The transportation of, and certain sales with respect to, natural gas in interstate commerce are heavily regulated by agencies 
of the U.S. federal government and are affected by, among other things, the availability, terms and cost of transportation.(cid:160)(cid:160)Notably, 
the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive U.S. federal and state regulation.(cid:160)(cid:160)The Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC") is continually proposing and implementing new and/or modified rules and regulations 
affecting the natural gas industry, some of which may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation 
service on interstate pipelines.(cid:160)(cid:160)While our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to FERC 
regulation, our ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on certain pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of 
service are subject to FERC regulation.(cid:160)(cid:160)Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are 
considered from time to time by Congress, FERC, state regulatory bodies and the courts, and we cannot predict when or if any 
such proposals or proceedings might become effective and their effect or impact, if any, on our operations.

Federal Energy and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
In early 2012, the President signed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011.  This act, among 
other things, updates federal pipeline safety standards, increases penalties for violations of such standards, gives the Department 
of Transportation (the "DOT") authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directs the DOT to prescribe 
new minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines, which safety standards could affect our operations and the costs thereof.  While 
the DOT has adopted or proposed to adopt a number of new regulations to implement this act, no such new minimum safety 
standards have been proposed or adopted for CO2 pipelines.(cid:160)(cid:160)In the future, Congress may create new incentives for alternative 
energy sources and may also consider legislation to reduce emissions of CO2 or other greenhouse gases which legislation, if 
enacted, could (1) impose a tax or other economic penalty on the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release 
CO2, (2) reduce the demand for, and uses of, oil, gas and other minerals, and/or (3) increase the costs incurred by us in our 
exploration and production activities.(cid:160)(cid:160)The Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") has promulgated regulations requiring 
permitting for certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions, along with requirements for wells used for geologic sequestration.(cid:160)(cid:160)At 
the same time, legislation to reduce the emissions of CO2 or other greenhouse gases could also create economic incentives for 
technologies and practices that reduce or avoid such emissions, including processes that sequester CO2 in geologic formations 
such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs.
Natural Gas Gathering Regulations
State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, 
nondiscriminatory-take requirements.(cid:160)(cid:160)With the increase in construction and operation of natural gas gathering lines in various 
states, natural gas gathering is receiving greater regulatory scrutiny from state regulatory agencies, which is likely to continue in 
the future.
Federal, State or Indian Leases
Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to 
numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes.  Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security 
regulations  and  other  permits  and  authorizations  issued  by  the  Bureau  of  Land  Management,  the  Bureau  of  Ocean  Energy 
Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state 
stakeholder agencies.
Environmental Regulations
Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO2, and the processing, handling and disposal 
of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials ("NORM") are subject to stringent regulation.(cid:160)(cid:160)We 
could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage 
and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental or other laws 
applicable to our operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our 
operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures.
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise 
relating  to  the  protection  of  the  environment,  directly  impact  our  oil  and  gas  exploration,  development  and  production 
operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved 
methods  of  disposal  for  certain  hazardous  and  nonhazardous  wastes;  (2)  the  Comprehensive  Environmental  Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes 
(including  wastes  disposed  of  or  released  by  prior  owners  or  operators),  property  contamination  (including  groundwater 
contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state 
and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on  air emissions from our operations, including 
those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO2; (4) the Oil Pollution Act of 
1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United 
States; (5) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage 
and disposal of hazardous wastes; (6) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species

(and their related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; and (7) state 
regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM.
Management  believes  that  we  are  currently  in  substantial  compliance  with  existing  applicable  environmental  laws  and 
regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated 
financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause 
significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash 
flows to be less than anticipated.
Hydraulic Fracturing
During 2013, we fracture stimulated one operated well at Hartzog Draw and two CO2 source wells at Jackson Dome, in each 
case utilizing water-based fluids with no diesel fuel component.  In 2014, we currently plan to hydraulically fracture approximately 
seven additional wells at Hartzog Draw using similar techniques.  We are familiar with the laws and regulations applicable to 
hydraulic fracturing operations and take steps to ensure compliance with these requirements.
ESTIMATED NET QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND PRESENT VALUE OF 
ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimates
Reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton ("D&M"), an independent 
petroleum engineering consulting firm located in Dallas, Texas, utilizing data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team 
and is the responsibility of management.  We rely on D&M's expertise to(cid:160)ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance 
with SEC rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques 
are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the 
Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled "Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information 
(Revision as of February 19, 2007)".(cid:160) The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a Senior Vice President 
at D&M; he is a Registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.  He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum 
Engineering at Texas A&M University in 1974, and he has in excess of 39 years of experience in oil and gas reservoir studies and 
evaluations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our Senior Vice President – Planning, Technology and CO2 Supply is primarily responsible for(cid:160)overseeing the 
independent petroleum engineering firm during the process.(cid:160) Our Senior Vice President – Planning, Technology and CO2 Supply 
has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering from Louisiana State University and over 32 years of industry experience 
working with petroleum reserve estimates.(cid:160)(cid:160)D&M relies on various data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team in 
preparing its reserve estimates, including such items as oil and natural gas prices, ownership interests, production information, 
operating costs, planned capital expenditures and other technical data.  Our internal reservoir engineering team consists of qualified 
petroleum engineers who maintain the Company's internal evaluation of reserves and compare the Company's information to the 
reserves prepared by D&M.  Management is responsible for designing the internal control procedures used in the preparation of 
our oil and gas reserves, which include verification of data input into reserve forecasting and economics evaluation software, as 
well as multi-discipline management reviews.(cid:160) The internal reservoir engineering team reports directly to our Senior Vice President 
– Planning, Technology and CO2 Supply.(cid:160) In addition, our Board of Directors’ Reserves and Health, Safety and Environment 
("HSE") Committee, on behalf of the Board of Directors, oversees the qualifications, independence, performance and hiring of 
our independent petroleum engineering firm and reviews the(cid:160)final report and(cid:160)subsequent(cid:160)reporting of our oil and natural gas reserve 
estimates.(cid:160) The Chairman of the Reserves and HSE Committee holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology and bachelor's degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics from Capital University in Ohio.  He has 34 years 
of industry experience, with responsibilities including reserves preparation and approval.
Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates
D&M prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December(cid:160)31, 2013, 2012 and 2011.(cid:160)(cid:160)See the 
summary of D&M’s report as of December(cid:160)31, 2013, included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.  These estimates of reserves were 
prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month 
within the 12-month period in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC.(cid:160)(cid:160)These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do 
not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage.(cid:160)(cid:160)The
- 22 -

reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)During 2013, we provided oil and gas reserve estimates for 
2012 to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our 
Form 10-K for the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2012.
Our proved nonproducing reserves primarily relate to reserves that are to be recovered from productive zones that are currently 
behind pipe.(cid:160)(cid:160)Since a majority of our properties are in areas with multiple pay zones, these properties typically have both proved 
producing and proved nonproducing reserves.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 179.9 MMBOE, or approximately 
38% of our estimated total proved reserves, an increase of 17.2 MMBOE from December(cid:160)31, 2012 levels.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our proved undeveloped 
oil reserves primarily relate to our CO2 tertiary operations (92.8 MMBOE), and our proved undeveloped natural gas reserves are 
primarily located in our Riley Ridge Field (66.6 MMBOE).(cid:160)(cid:160)We consider the CO2 tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower 
risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production, because all of these 
proved undeveloped reserves are associated with tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced 
substantial volumes of oil under primary production.
During 2013, we spent approximately $260 million to convert 16.7 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved 
developed reserves, primarily as a result of tertiary development activities at Heidelberg, Hastings, and Tinsley fields.  During 
2013, we added 30.0 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves, including 27.3 MMBOE related to our tertiary operations at Bell 
Creek Field, and recognized net positive proved undeveloped reserve revisions of 3.9 MMBOE.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, 26.7 MMBOE of our total proved undeveloped reserves are not scheduled to be developed within 
five years of initial booking, 26.1 MMBOE of which are part of CO2 EOR projects.  We believe these reserves satisfy the conditions 
to be included as proved reserves because (1) we have established and continue to follow the previously adopted development 
plan for each of these projects; (2) we have significant ongoing development activities in each of these CO2 EOR projects and (3) 
we have a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.

(4)  PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number 
and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number.(cid:160)(cid:160)The information used to calculate PV-10 Value is derived directly from 
data determined in accordance with FASC Topic 932.(cid:160)(cid:160)The difference between these two amounts, the discounted estimated 
future income tax was $3.505 billion at December(cid:160)31, 2013; $3.495 billion at December(cid:160)31, 2012; and $3.552 billion at 
December(cid:160)31, 2011.(cid:160)(cid:160)We believe that PV-10 Value is a useful supplemental disclosure to the Standardized Measure because 
the Standardized Measure can be impacted by a company’s unique tax situation, and it is not practical to calculate the 
Standardized Measure on a property-by-property basis.(cid:160)(cid:160)Because of this, PV-10 Value is a widely used measure within the 
industry and is commonly used by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies to evaluate the estimated future net 
cash flows from proved reserves on a comparative basis across companies or specific properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)PV-10 Value is commonly 
used by us and others in our industry to evaluate properties that are bought and sold and to assess the potential return on 
investment in our oil and gas properties.  PV-10 Value is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, 
nor should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Standardized Measure.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our PV-10 Value and the Standardized 
Measure do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.  See Glossary and Selected Abbreviations 
for the definition of "PV-10 Value" and see Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited), to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements for additional disclosures about the Standardized Measure.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, 
including many factors beyond our control.(cid:160)(cid:160)See Item 1A, Risk Factors – Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash 
flows is difficult to do with any certainty.(cid:160)(cid:160)See also Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited), to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
Item 1A.(cid:160)(cid:160)Risk Factors
Oil and natural gas prices are volatile.(cid:160)(cid:160)A substantial decrease in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our 
financial results.
Our future financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
depend primarily upon the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production.(cid:160)(cid:160)Oil and natural gas prices historically have 
been volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future.  Substantial decreases in commodity prices in the future could require 
us to record full cost ceiling test write-downs.(cid:160)(cid:160)The amount of any future write-down is difficult to predict and will depend upon 
oil and natural gas prices, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent.
Our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on the prices that we receive for oil.(cid:160)(cid:160)This price volatility also affects the 
amount of our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital.(cid:160)(cid:160)Oil prices 
currently affect us more than natural gas prices because oil comprised approximately 94% of our 2013 production and 83% of our 
proved reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013.
The prices for oil and natural gas are subject to a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control.(cid:160)(cid:160)These factors 
include the supply of, and demand for, these commodities, which fluctuate with changes in market and economic conditions and 
other factors, including:
• 
• 
• 
•
the level of worldwide consumer demand for oil and natural gas;
the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;
the degree to which domestic oil and natural gas production decreases U.S. imports of crude oil;
the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and 
production controls;
domestic governmental regulations and taxes;
the price and availability of alternative fuel sources;
storage levels of oil and natural gas;
• 
• 
• 
•  weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage oil and 
natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the Rocky 
Mountains that can delay or impede operations;
•  market uncertainty;
•  worldwide political events and conditions, including actions taken by foreign oil and natural gas producing nations; and

•  worldwide economic conditions.

These factors and the volatility of the energy markets generally make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural 
gas price movements.(cid:160)(cid:160)Also, prices for oil and prices for natural gas do not necessarily move in tandem.(cid:160)(cid:160)Declines in oil or natural 
gas prices would not only reduce revenue but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically.(cid:160)(cid:160)If 
the oil and natural gas industry experiences significant price declines, we may, among other things, be unable to meet all of our 
financial obligations or make planned expenditures.
Over the past six years oil prices have fluctuated significantly, reaching record highs of approximately $145 per Bbl in July 
2008, declining precipitously during the last half of 2008, and ending that year at a NYMEX price of $44.60 per Bbl.  Since 2008, 
oil prices have continued to fluctuate, ending 2013 at a NYMEX price of $98.42 per Bbl.(cid:160)(cid:160)If substantial volatility of oil prices 
continues, oil prices could decline to a level that makes some or all of our tertiary projects uneconomical.(cid:160)(cid:160)If that were to happen, 
we may decide to suspend future expansion projects, and if prices were to drop below our cash break-even point for an extended 
period of time, we may further decide to shut-in existing production, both of which could have a material adverse effect on our 
operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)We may also be required to reduce our capital expenditures in the event of declining commodity prices in order to 
compensate for diminished cash flow, which could reduce or eliminate our growth.  Since operating costs do not decrease as 
quickly as commodity prices, it is difficult to determine a precise break-even point for our tertiary projects; however, based on 
prior history, we currently estimate our economic break-even point (before corporate-related overhead and based on currently 
estimated expenses relative to these tertiary projects) occurs at oil prices in the low-to-mid $40-per-barrel range, depending on 
the specific field and area.
We have a current practice of hedging approximately 18 months to two years (from the current quarter) of forecasted production 
to mitigate the risks associated with price fluctuations (see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations – Market Risk Management and Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for details regarding our commodity derivative contracts).(cid:160)(cid:160)As of February 20, 2014, we have oil derivative contracts 
in place covering 58,000 Bbls/d during 2014 and 58,000 Bbls/d during the first three quarters of 2015.(cid:160)(cid:160)
The prices we receive for our crude oil often do not correlate with NYMEX prices and(cid:160)can vary from such prices depending 
on, among other factors, the quality of the crude oil we sell, the location of our crude oil production and the related markets to 
which we sell, variations in prices paid based upon different indices used, and the pricing contracts and indices at which we sell 
production.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our NYMEX differentials on a field-by-field basis over the last few years have ranged from approximately $25 per 
Bbl above NYMEX to approximately $25 per Bbl below NYMEX.(cid:160)(cid:160)On a corporate-wide basis, our NYMEX differentials over 
the last few years have ranged from approximately $11 per Bbl above NYMEX oil prices to approximately $5 per Bbl below 
NYMEX oil prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)These variances have been due to various factors and are difficult to forecast or anticipate, but they have a 
direct impact on the net oil price we receive.
Natural gas price volatility has been severe over the last few years as a result of, among other things, weak demand, increased 
production of natural gas, and significant natural gas storage in place, leading to excess gas supply.(cid:160)(cid:160)NYMEX natural gas prices 
averaged $4.03 per MMBtu during 2011, $2.82 per MMBtu during 2012, and $3.72 per MMBtu during 2013, and ended 2013 at 
$4.23 per MMBtu.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of February 20, 2014, we have natural gas derivative contracts in place covering 14,000 MMBtu/d during 
2014  and  6,000  MMBtu/d  during  2015  (see  Management's  Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of 
Operations – Market Risk Management and Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for details regarding our commodity derivative contracts).
Our production will decline if our access to sufficient amounts of carbon dioxide is limited.
Our long-term strategy is focused on our CO2 tertiary recovery operations.  The crude oil production from our tertiary recovery 
projects depends, in large part, on having access to sufficient amounts of CO2.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our ability to produce oil from these projects would 
be hindered if our supply of CO2 was limited due to, among other things, problems with our current CO2 producing wells and 
facilities, including compression equipment, or catastrophic pipeline failure.(cid:160)(cid:160)This could have a material adverse effect on our 
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Our anticipated future crude oil production from tertiary operations is 
also dependent on the timing, volumes and location of CO2 injections and, in particular, on our ability to increase our combined 
purchased and produced volumes of CO2 and inject adequate amounts of CO2 into the proper formation and area within each of 
our tertiary oil fields.

Our planned tertiary operations and the related construction of necessary CO2 pipelines could be delayed by difficulties 
in obtaining pipeline rights-of-way and/or permits, and/or by the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered.
The production of crude oil from our planned tertiary operations is dependent upon having access to pipelines to transport 
available CO2 to our oil fields at a cost that is economically viable.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our current and future construction of CO2 pipelines will 
require us to obtain rights-of-way from private landowners and from the federal government in certain areas.(cid:160)(cid:160)Certain states where 
we operate are considering the adoption of laws and regulations that would limit or eliminate a state’s (and, accordingly, its 
legislative delegates') ability to exercise eminent domain over private property, in addition to possible judicially imposed constraints 
on, and additional requirements for, the exercise of eminent domain.(cid:160)(cid:160)We also conduct operations on federal and other oil and 
natural gas leases inhabited by species, such as the sage grouse, that could be listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered 
Species Act, which listing could lead to material restrictions as to federal land use.(cid:160)(cid:160)These laws and regulations, together with any 
other changes in law related to the use of eminent domain or the listing of certain species as threatened or endangered, could inhibit 
or eliminate our ability to secure rights-of-way or otherwise access land for current or future pipeline construction projects.(cid:160)(cid:160)As a 
result, obtaining rights-of-way or other means of access may require additional regulatory and environmental compliance, and 
increased costs in connection therewith, which could delay our CO2 pipeline construction schedule and initiation of our pipeline 
operations, and/or increase the costs of constructing our pipelines.
Our level of indebtedness may adversely affect operations and limit our growth.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, our outstanding senior indebtedness consisted of $2.6 billion principal amount of subordinated 
notes, virtually all of which have maturity dates between 2020 and 2023 at interest rates ranging from 4.625% to 8.25% per annum 
at a weighted average interest rate of 6.29% per annum, and $340.0 million principal amount outstanding under our bank credit 
facility.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently have a borrowing base of $1.6 billion under our bank credit facility and, at December(cid:160)31, 2013, availability 
with respect to such borrowing base of $1.2 billion.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our bank borrowing base is adjusted semi-annually and upon requested 
special redeterminations, in each case at the banks’ discretion, and the amount is established and based, in part, upon certain 
external factors, such as commodity prices, over which we have no control.(cid:160)(cid:160)If the outstanding credit under our bank credit facility 
exceeds the then effective and redetermined borrowing base, we will be required to repay the excess amount over a period not to 
exceed four months.
We may incur additional indebtedness in the future under our bank credit facility in connection with, among other things, our 
acquisition and development of oil and natural gas properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)Further, as our cash flow from operations is highly dependent on 
the prices that we receive for oil and natural gas, if oil and natural gas prices decrease substantially and remain at depressed levels 
for an extended period of time, our degree of leverage could increase significantly.(cid:160)(cid:160)The level of our indebtedness could have 
important consequences, including but not limited to the following:
•
•
• 
•
•
•
our level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital 
expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate and other purposes;
our  vulnerability  to  general  adverse  economic  and  industry  conditions  may  be  greater  as  a  result  of  our  level  of 
indebtedness, and increases in interest rates thereon, potentially restricting us from making acquisitions, introducing new 
technologies or exploiting business opportunities;
our interest expense may increase in the event of increases in market interest rates;
a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations may be dedicated to servicing our indebtedness and would not 
be available for capital expenditures or other purposes;
our ability to, among other things, borrow additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments 
may be limited by the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness; and
our debt covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness may also affect our flexibility 
in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our industry, and our failure to comply with such covenants 
could result in an event of default under such debt instruments which, if not cured or waived, could have a material 
adverse effect on us.
If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on our 
indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants related to such indebtedness, including covenants in 
our bank credit facility, we would be in default under our debt instruments.  This default could permit the holders of such indebtedness
- 27 -
Table of Contents
Denbury Resources Inc.
to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness and could cause defaults under other indebtedness, which could have a material 
adverse effect on us.  Our ability to meet our obligations under our debt instruments will depend, in part, upon our future performance, 
which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions, commodity prices, and financial, business and other factors, including 
factors beyond our control.
Commodity derivative contracts may expose us to potential financial loss.
To reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative contracts in 
order to economically hedge a substantial portion of our oil and natural gas production.(cid:160)(cid:160)Derivative contracts expose us to risk of 
financial loss in some circumstances, including when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price 
in the hedging agreement and actual prices received, or when the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contractual 
obligations.  In addition, these derivative contracts may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices 
for oil and natural gas.(cid:160)(cid:160)Information as to these activities is set forth under Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Market Risk Management, and in Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements.
There are no assurances of our ability to pay dividends in the future and at what level.
On January 28, 2014, we declared our first quarterly cash common stock dividend of $0.0625 per share, payable March 25, 
2014, to shareholders of record on February 25, 2014.  We currently intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends in the future; 
however, our ability to pay dividends may be adversely affected if certain of the risks described herein were to occur.  Our payment 
of dividends is subject to, and conditioned upon, among other things, compliance with the covenants and restrictions contained 
in our bank credit facility and the indentures governing our subordinated notes.  All dividends will be paid at the discretion of our 
Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our earnings, financial condition and such other factors as our 
Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time.  There are no assurances as to our ability to pay dividends in the future 
or the level thereof.
A worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business 
and financial condition that we cannot control or predict.
Liquidity is essential to our business.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our liquidity could be substantially negatively affected by an inability to obtain capital 
in the long-term or short-term debt capital markets or equity capital markets or an inability to access bank financing.(cid:160)(cid:160)A prolonged 
credit crisis, including a sovereign debt crisis in Europe or turmoil in the global financial system, could materially affect our 
liquidity,  business  and  financial  condition.(cid:160)(cid:160)These  conditions  have  adversely  impacted  financial  markets  and  have  created 
substantial volatility and uncertainty, and may continue to do so, with the related negative impact on global economic activity and 
the financial markets.(cid:160)(cid:160)Negative credit market conditions could materially affect our liquidity and may inhibit our lenders from 
fully funding our bank credit facility or cause them to make the terms of our bank credit facility more costly and more restrictive.(cid:160)(cid:160)We 
are subject to semiannual, as well as unscheduled, reviews and redeterminations of our borrowing base under our bank credit 
facility, and we do not know, nor can we control, the results of such redeterminations or the effect of then-current oil and natural 
gas prices on any such redetermination.(cid:160)(cid:160)A negative economic situation could also adversely affect the collectability of our trade 
receivables or performance by our suppliers and cause our commodity hedging arrangements to be ineffective if our counterparties 
are unable to perform their obligations or otherwise seek bankruptcy protection.(cid:160)(cid:160)Additionally, negative economic conditions could 
lead to reduced demand for oil and natural gas, or lower prices for oil and natural gas, which could have a negative impact on our 
revenues.
Our future performance depends upon our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are 
economically recoverable.
Unless we can successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, resulting eventually in a decrease 
in oil and natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flows from operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)We have historically replaced reserves 
through both acquisitions and internal organic growth activities.(cid:160)(cid:160)In the future, we may not be able to continue to replace reserves 
at acceptable costs.(cid:160)(cid:160)The business of exploring for, developing or acquiring reserves is capital intensive.(cid:160)(cid:160)We may not be able to 
make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves if our cash flows from operations 
are reduced, whether due to lower oil or natural gas prices or otherwise, or if external sources of capital become limited or
- 28 -

unavailable.(cid:160)(cid:160)Further, the process of using CO2 for tertiary recovery, and the related infrastructure, requires significant capital 
investment up to five years(cid:160)prior to any resulting and associated production and cash flows from these projects, heightening 
potential capital constraints.(cid:160)(cid:160)If we do not continue to make significant capital expenditures, or if outside capital resources become 
limited, we may not be able to maintain our growth rate or otherwise meet expectations.
During the last few years, we have acquired several fields at a substantial cost because we believe that they have significant 
additional production potential through tertiary flooding, and we plan to continue acquiring other oil fields that we believe are 
tertiary flood candidates.(cid:160)(cid:160)We are investing significant amounts of capital as part of this strategy.(cid:160)(cid:160)If we are unable to successfully 
develop and produce the potential oil in these acquired fields, it would negatively affect our return on investment relative to these 
acquisitions and could significantly reduce our ability to obtain additional capital for the future or fund future acquisitions, and 
also negatively affect our financial results to a significant degree.
Oil and natural gas development and producing operations involve various risks.
Our operations are subject to all the risks normally incident and inherent to the operation and development of oil and natural 
gas properties and the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, including, without limitation, well blowouts; cratering and explosions; 
pipe failure; fires; formations with abnormal pressures; uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine or well fluids; release of 
contaminants into the environment and other environmental hazards and risks.
The nature of these risks is such that some liabilities could exceed our insurance policy limits or otherwise be excluded from, 
or limited by, our insurance coverage, as in the case of environmental fines and penalties, for example, which are excluded from 
coverage as they cannot be insured.(cid:160)(cid:160)We could incur significant costs related to these risks that could have a material adverse effect 
on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
Our CO2 tertiary recovery projects require a significant amount of electricity to operate the related facilities.(cid:160)(cid:160)If these costs 
were to increase significantly, it could have an adverse effect upon the profitability of these operations.(cid:160) Additionally, a portion of 
our production activities involves CO2 injections into fields with wells plugged and abandoned by prior operators.(cid:160)(cid:160)Although it is 
often difficult (or impracticable) to determine whether a well has been properly plugged prior to commencing injections and 
pressuring the oil reservoirs, we have budgeted $50 million for this effort for 2014.  We may incur significant costs in connection 
with remedial plugging operations to prevent environmental contamination and to otherwise comply with federal, state and local 
regulation relative to the plugging and abandoning of our oil, natural gas and CO2 wells.(cid:160)(cid:160)In addition to the increased costs, if 
wells have not been properly plugged, modification to those wells may delay our operations and reduce our production.
While mitigated somewhat by our significant emphasis on tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that have 
historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production, development activities are subject to many risks, 
including the risk that new wells drilled by us will not result in the discovery of commercially productive reservoirs or the risk 
that we will not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells.(cid:160)(cid:160)Drilling for oil and natural gas may involve unprofitable 
efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net reserves to return a profit 
after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.(cid:160)(cid:160)The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and 
cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project.  Further, our drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled 
as a result of numerous factors, including:
• 
• 
• 
• 
•
• 
•
unexpected drilling conditions;
title problems;
pressure or irregularities in formations;
equipment failures or accidents;
adverse weather conditions, including hurricanes and tropical storms in and around the Gulf of Mexico that can damage 
oil and natural gas facilities and delivery systems and disrupt operations, and winter conditions and forest fires in the 
Rocky Mountain region that can delay or impede operations;
compliance with environmental and governmental requirements; and
the cost of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, pipelines and services.

Certain of our operations may be limited during certain periods due to severe weather conditions and other regulations.
Certain of our operations in North Dakota, Montana and Wyoming, including the construction of CO2 pipelines, the drilling 
of new wells and production from existing wells, are conducted in areas subject to extreme weather conditions, including severe 
cold, snow and rain, which conditions may cause such operations to be hindered or delayed, or otherwise require that they be 
conducted only during non-winter months, and depending on the severity of the weather, could have a negative effect on our results 
of operations in these areas.  Further, certain of our operations in these areas are confined to certain time periods due to environmental 
regulations, federal restrictions on when drilling can take place on federal lands, and lease stipulations designed to protect certain 
wildlife, which regulations, restrictions and limitations could slow down our operations, cause delays, increase costs and have a 
negative effect on our results of operations.
Shortages of oil field equipment, services and qualified personnel could reduce our cash flow and adversely affect results 
of operations.
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the 
oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, causing periodic shortages 
in such personnel.(cid:160)(cid:160)In recent years, the competition for qualified technical personnel has been fierce, and our personnel costs have 
been escalating at a rate higher than general inflation.  During periods of high oil and natural gas prices, we have experienced 
shortages of oil field and other necessary equipment, as well as drilling rigs, as demand for equipment and rigs has increased in 
tandem with higher commodity prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)Additionally, higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand, which 
results in increased prices for drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, oilfield equipment and services, and personnel in our 
exploration and production operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)These types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, 
cash flow and operating results and/or restrict or delay our ability to drill wells and conduct those operations that we currently 
have planned and budgeted, causing us to miss our forecasts and projections.
The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation lines and other facilities, certain of which we do 
not control.  When these facilities are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.
The marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends, in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of 
transportation lines owned by third parties.  In general, we do not control these transportation facilities, and our access to them 
may be limited or denied.  A significant disruption in the availability of, and access to, these transportation lines or other production 
facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and thereby cause a significant interruption in 
our operations.
Governmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection are costly and stringent.
Our exploration, production, and marketing operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state, and local laws and 
regulations governing, among other things, the discharge of substances into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental 
protection.  These laws and regulations and related public policy considerations affect the costs, manner, and feasibility of our 
operations and require us to make significant expenditures in order to comply.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations 
may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory and remedial obligations, 
and the issuance of injunctions that could limit or prohibit our operations.  In addition, some of these laws and regulations may 
impose joint and several, strict liability for contamination resulting from spills, discharges, and releases of substances, including 
petroleum hydrocarbons and other wastes, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct.  Under such laws and 
regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed substances and property contamination, including 
wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators.  Changes in, or additions to, environmental laws and regulations occur 
frequently, and any changes or additions that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, cleanup 
or other environmental protection requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
Enactment of legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.
Numerous legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be 
introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by Congress and various federal agencies.(cid:160) Among these proposals are: (1) 
climate change/carbon tax legislation introduced in Congress, and EPA regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; (2)
- 30 -
Table of Contents
Denbury Resources Inc.
proposals contained in the President's budget, along with legislation introduced in Congress (none of which have passed), to impose 
new taxes on, or repeal various tax deductions available to, oil and gas producers, such as the current tax deductions for intangible 
drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses which deductions, if eliminated, could raise the cost of 
energy production, reduce energy investment and affect the economics of oil and gas exploration and production activities; (3) 
legislation previously considered by Congress (but not adopted) that would subject the process of hydraulic fracturing to federal 
regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act, and new or anticipated Department of Interior and EPA regulations to impose new 
and more stringent regulatory requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, particularly those performed on federal lands, and 
to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process; and (4) the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job 
Creation Act enacted in 2011, which increases penalties, grants new authority to impose damage prevention and incident notification 
requirements, and directs the Department of Transportation to prescribe minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines.  Any of the 
foregoing described proposals could affect our operations and the costs thereof.(cid:160)(cid:160)The trend toward stricter standards, increased 
oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in 
increased costs or additional operating restrictions that could have an effect on demand for oil and natural gas or prices at which 
it can be sold.(cid:160)(cid:160)However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not 
possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.
Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development 
may be eliminated, and additional state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.
In recent years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. federal income 
tax laws, including the elimination of certain U.S. federal income tax benefits and deductions currently available to oil and gas 
companies.  Such changes include, but are not limited to, (1) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas 
properties, (2) the increase of the amortization period of geological and geophysical expenses, (3) the elimination of current 
deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and qualified tertiary injectant expenses, and (4) the elimination of the 
deduction for certain U.S. production activities.  It is currently unclear whether any such proposals will be enacted into law and, 
if so, what form such laws might possibly take or impact they may have; however, the passage of such legislation or any other 
similar change in U.S. federal income tax law could eliminate, reduce or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available 
to us, and any such legislation or change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.
The derivatives market regulations promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act could have an adverse effect on our ability to 
hedge risks associated with our business.
The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and the SEC to promulgate rules and 
regulations establishing federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in 
that market, including swap clearing and trade execution requirements.  Our derivative transactions are not currently subject to 
such swap clearing and trade execution requirements; however, in the event our derivative transactions potentially become subject 
to such requirements, we believe that our derivative transactions would qualify for the "end-user" exception.  New or modified 
rules, regulations or requirements may increase the cost and availability to our counterparties of their hedging and swap positions 
that they can make available to us, and may further require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of 
their derivative activities to separate entities that may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties.  In addition, for uncleared 
swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require end-users to enter into credit support documentation or post margin 
collateral.  Any changes in the regulations of swaps may result in certain market participants deciding to curtail or cease their 
derivative activities.
While many rules and regulations have been promulgated and are already in effect, other rules and regulations, including the 
proposed margin rules, remain to be finalized or effectuated; therefore, the impact of those rules and regulations on us is uncertain 
at this time.  The Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated thereunder, could (1) significantly increase the cost, or decrease the 
liquidity, of energy-related derivatives we use to hedge against commodity price fluctuations (including through requirements to 
post collateral), (2) materially alter the terms of derivative contracts, (3) reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against 
risks we encounter, and (4) increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties.  If we reduce our use of derivatives as a 
result of the Dodd-Frank Act and applicable rules and regulations, our cash flow may become more volatile and less predictable, 
which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.

The loss of one or more of our large oil and natural gas purchasers could have an adverse effect on our operations.
For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, three purchasers individually accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas 
revenues and, in the aggregate, for 58% of such revenues.(cid:160)(cid:160)The loss of a large single purchaser could adversely impact the prices 
we receive or the transportation costs we incur.
Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.
Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process.(cid:160)(cid:160)It requires interpretations of available 
technical data and various assumptions, including assumptions relating to economic factors such as future commodity prices, 
production costs, severance and excise taxes, capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of 
governmental  rules  and  regulations.(cid:160)(cid:160)There  are  numerous  uncertainties  about  when  a  property  may  have  proved  reserves  as 
compared to potential or probable reserves, particularly relating to our tertiary recovery operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Forecasting the amount of 
oil reserves recoverable from tertiary operations, and the production rates anticipated therefrom, requires estimates, one of the 
most significant being the oil recovery factor.(cid:160)(cid:160)Actual results most likely will vary from our estimates.(cid:160)(cid:160)Also, the use of a 10% 
discount factor for reporting purposes, as prescribed by the SEC, may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount 
factor, given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject.(cid:160)(cid:160)Any 
significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions, or changes of conditions, could result in a reduction of the quantities 
and net present value of our reserves.
The reserves data included in documents incorporated by reference represent estimates only.(cid:160)(cid:160)Quantities of proved reserves 
are estimated based on economic conditions, including first-day-of-the-month average oil and natural gas prices for the 12-month 
period preceding the date of the assessment.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our reserves and future cash flows may be subject to revisions based upon changes 
in economic conditions, including oil and natural gas prices, as well as due to production results, results of future development, 
operating and development costs, and other factors.(cid:160)(cid:160)Downward revisions of our reserves could have an adverse effect on our 
financial condition and operating results.(cid:160)(cid:160)Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and 
costs used in our estimates.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, approximately 38% of our estimated proved reserves were undeveloped.(cid:160)(cid:160)Recovery of undeveloped 
reserves requires significant capital expenditures and may require successful drilling operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)The reserves data assumes that 
we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully, but these assumptions may not be accurate, 
and these expenditures and operations may not occur.
Significant acquisitions or other transactions could require substantial external capital and could change our risk and 
property profile.
To finance acquisitions, we may need to substantially alter or increase our capitalization through the use of our bank credit 
facility, the issuance of debt or equity securities, the sale of production payments, or by other means.(cid:160)(cid:160)Such changes in capitalization 
could significantly affect our risk profile.(cid:160)(cid:160)Additionally, significant acquisitions or other transactions can change the character of 
our  operations  and  business.(cid:160)(cid:160)The  character  of  the  new  properties  may  be  substantially  different  in  operating  or  geological 
characteristics or geographic location from that of our existing properties.
Our results of operations could be negatively affected as a result of goodwill impairments.
At December(cid:160)31, 2013, the Company's goodwill balance totaled $1.3 billion and represented approximately 10.9% of our 
total assets.  Goodwill is not amortized; rather it is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when facts or 
circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the Company's goodwill may be impaired, requiring an estimate of the fair values 
of the reporting unit's assets and liabilities.  An impairment of goodwill could significantly reduce earnings during the period in 
which the impairment occurs and would result in a corresponding reduction to goodwill and equity.  See Item 7, Management's 
Discussion  and Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  –  Critical Accounting  Policies  and  Estimates  – 
Impairment Assessment of Goodwill.

We may lose executive officers or other key management personnel, which could endanger the future success of our 
operations.
Our  success  depends  to  a  significant  degree  upon  the  continued  contributions  of  our  executive  officers  and  other  key 
management personnel.  Our employees, including our executive officers, are employed at will and do not have employment 
agreements.  If one or more members of our management team dies, becomes disabled or voluntarily terminates employment with 
us, there is no assurance that we will find a suitable or comparable substitute.  We believe that our future success depends, in large 
part, upon our ability to hire and retain highly skilled managerial personnel.  Competition for persons with these skills is intense, 
and we cannot assure that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such skilled personnel.  The loss of any of our management 
personnel could adversely affect our operations.
A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.
Our business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain 
of our exploration, development and production activities.(cid:160)(cid:160)We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas 
reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities 
related to our business.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber attacks or information security 
breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, 
reserves  information  or  other  proprietary  information  could  lead  to  data  corruption,  communication  interruption,  or  other 
operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.
To date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks, but there can be no assurance that we will not 
suffer such losses in the future.(cid:160)(cid:160)As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources 
to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.
Item 1B.(cid:160)(cid:160)Unresolved Staff Comments
There are no unresolved written SEC staff comments regarding our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 received 180 days or more before the end of the fiscal year to which this annual report on Form 10-K relates.

Item 3.(cid:160)(cid:160)Legal Proceedings
We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our businesses.(cid:160)(cid:160)While we currently 
believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect 
on our consolidated financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows, litigation is subject to inherent 
uncertainties.(cid:160)(cid:160)If an unfavorable ruling in one of these lawsuits or proceedings were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material 
adverse impact on our net income in the period in which the ruling occurs.(cid:160)(cid:160)We provide accruals for litigation and claims if we 
determine that we may have a range of legal exposure that would require accrual.

Tcf, 2.9 Tcf, 1.6 Tcf and 0.9 Tcf at December(cid:160)31, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.
(6)  Reserves associated with helium production rights include helium reserves located in the acreage in the Rocky Mountain 
region for which we have the contractual right to extract the helium on behalf of the U.S. government, who owns the helium.  
Our extraction agreement with the U.S. government gives us the ability to produce the helium on behalf of the U.S. government 
in exchange for a fee, which amount fluctuates based upon the realized sales proceeds we receive for the helium.(cid:160) The estimate 
of helium reserves is reduced to reflect the estimated fee we will remit to the U.S. government.  Our extraction agreement 
with the U.S. government has a minimum term extending 20 years from first production and continuing thereafter until either 
party terminates the contract.  Reserve volumes presented herein assume that the term of this helium extraction agreement 
continues beyond 20 years, given the benefit to both parties to the agreement.

Item(cid:160)7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes 
thereto included in Item(cid:160)8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Information.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our discussion and analysis includes forward-
looking information that involves risks and uncertainties and should be read in conjunction with Risk Factors under Item(cid:160)1A of 
this Form 10-K, along with Forward-Looking Information at the end of this section for information on the risks and uncertainties 
that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our forward-looking statements.
OVERVIEW
Denbury is a growing, dividend-paying, domestic oil and natural gas company.  Our primary focus is on enhanced oil recovery 
utilizing CO2, and our operations are focused in two key operating areas:  the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.  Our goal 
is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, drilling and proven engineering extraction 
practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to tertiary recovery operations.
Adoption of Growth and Income Strategy.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, following a comprehensive review of our long-
term plans, we announced our intention to expand our shareholder value proposition to include both growth and income.  Our 
focused strategy, significant inventory of development projects and proven track record of value creation give us confidence that 
we can deliver a long-term cash flow profile to stockholders that is unique among independent oil companies.  To enable our shift 
to a growth and income company in 2014, we modified our previous development timeline for future capital projects principally 
in the Rocky Mountain region, making our anticipated capital spending levels more consistent over the next five to ten years.  This 
smoothing effect on our anticipated capital expenditures allows us to accelerate our expected free cash flow.  These changes reduce 
our capital spending on major infrastructure projects over the next few years, accelerating our plan of providing a return to our 
shareholders through a dividend, while still growing our oil and natural gas reserves and production at nearly the previously 
anticipated growth rate.
With the declaration of the first cash dividend in our history on January 28, 2014, we have begun this program of distributing 
free cash flow to stockholders.  Our first quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per common share (a rate of $0.25 per share on an annualized 
basis) will be paid on March 25, 2014 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 25, 2014.  Based on our 
current financial projections and commodity price outlook, we expect to grow our regular annual dividend rate to between $0.50 
per share and $0.60 per share in 2015 and at a sustainable rate thereafter.  All dividends are subject to declaration by Denbury’s 
Board of Directors.
2013 Operating Highlights.  Our net income was $409.6 million, or $1.11 per diluted common share, during 2013, compared 
to net income of $525.4 million, or $1.35 per diluted common share, during 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)Although we had a $56.4 million increase in 
oil and natural gas revenues in 2013 compared to 2012 levels, driven by higher realized prices, this increase in revenues was more 
than offset by increases in expenses, including (1) a $198.2 million increase in lease operating expense in the current year, $114.0 
million of which constitutes remediation costs incurred or estimated for an area of Delhi Field, (2) an increase of $45.9 million 
in commodity derivatives expense, $27.3 million of which relates to a change in the noncash fair value adjustments on our 
commodity derivatives, a non-GAAP measure, between the two periods and (3) a $44.7 million loss on early extinguishment of 
debt.  These matters are further described throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis.  Our cash flow from operations 
was $1.4 billion in both 2013 and 2012.
During 2013, our oil and natural gas production, which was 94% oil, averaged 70,243 BOE/d, compared to 71,689 BOE/d 
produced during 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)This slight decline in production was primarily due to the inclusion of 11 months of production in 2012 
from the Bakken area assets sold in the Bakken Exchange Transaction (defined below), versus only nine months of production in 
2013 from the purchase of additional interests in the Cedar Creek Anticline ("CCA").  This decline was offset in part by a 9% 
increase in our tertiary oil production.  See Results of Operations – Production for more information.
Our average realized oil price per barrel, excluding the impact of commodity derivative contracts, was $100.67 per Bbl during 
2013, or about 4% higher than our average realized oil price of $97.18 per Bbl during 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our realized oil price during 2013 
was $2.62 per Bbl above NYMEX oil prices compared to $2.99 per Bbl above NYMEX oil prices in 2012.  The lower premium 
to NYMEX in 2013 is primarily due to a decline in Louisiana Light Sweet ("LLS") oil pricing relative to NYMEX prices, which

LLS-to-NYMEX differential averaged a positive $11.10 in 2013 compared to positive $16.46 in 2012, partially offset by improved 
differentials in the Rocky Mountain region, which were positively impacted by the sale of the Bakken area assets late in 2012, 
which assets generally sold at a more significant discount to NYMEX than the CCA assets we acquired in early 2013.(cid:160) See Results 
of Operations – Oil and Natural Gas Revenues below for more information.
Cedar Creek Anticline Acquisition.  On March 27, 2013, we closed our acquisition of producing assets in the CCA of 
Montana and North Dakota in a purchase from a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Company ("ConocoPhillips") for 
$1.0 billion in cash, after final closing adjustments (the "CCA Acquisition").  We funded the acquisition with a portion of the cash 
proceeds from the late-2012 Bakken Exchange Transaction.  The assets purchased include both additional interests in certain of 
our then-existing operated fields in CCA, as well as operating interests in other CCA fields.  In conjunction with this acquisition, 
we added 42.2 MMBOE of estimated proved reserves.
Rocky Mountain Tertiary Operations Startup.  In late 2012, we completed construction of the first section of the 20-inch 
Greencore Pipeline in Wyoming, our first CO2 pipeline in the Rocky Mountain region, and received our first CO2 deliveries from 
the Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming during the first quarter of 2013.  In December 2012, we completed the three-mile 
CO2 pipeline required to deliver CO2 from our source at LaBarge Field to Grieve Field in Wyoming, and began injecting CO2 into 
Grieve Field during the first quarter of 2013.  We currently expect tertiary production from Grieve Field to commence in 2015.  
We started injections at our Bell Creek Field in Montana during the second quarter of 2013, with the first tertiary oil production 
from this field during the third quarter of 2013.  During the first quarter of 2014, we completed the pipeline interconnect between 
a third party's existing CO2 pipeline and our Greencore pipeline, which will allow us to transport additional volumes of CO2 to 
Bell Creek Field.
Riley Ridge Plant.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, we placed our Riley Ridge gas processing facility in Wyoming into
service.
Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves.  Our estimated proved oil and gas reserves were 468.3 MMBOE as of December(cid:160)31, 
2013, compared to 409.4 MMBOE at December(cid:160)31, 2012.  We added total proved reserves of 84.6 MMBOE during 2013, including 
estimated proved tertiary reserves of 34.0 MMBbls at Bell Creek Field during the fourth quarter, 42.2 MMBOE from the acquisition 
of additional interests in CCA during the first quarter and 8.4 MMBOE of other additions or revisions.
Addition of Proved CO2 Reserves.  During the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, we added approximately 350 Bcf of estimated 
proved CO2 reserves as a result of successful drilling in the Jackson Dome area, our primary source of CO2 for the Gulf Coast 
region, replacing our 2013 CO2 production.
Debt Refinancing.  In February 2013, we issued $1.2 billion of 4 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023 (the "2023 
Notes").  The net proceeds of approximately $1.18 billion were used to repurchase or redeem our 9½% Senior Subordinated Notes 
due 2016 (the "9½% Notes") and our 9¾% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "9¾% Notes"), and to pay down a portion 
of outstanding borrowings on our bank credit facility.  We recognized a loss associated with the redemption of our 9½% Notes 
and 9¾% Notes of $44.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, which is included in our Consolidated Statement of 
Operations under the caption "Loss on early extinguishment of debt".  See Note 5, Long-Term Debt, to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for additional details surrounding the repurchase and redemption of our 9½% Notes and 9¾% Notes.
Delhi Field Release.  In June 2013, a release of well fluids, consisting of a mixture of carbon dioxide, saltwater, natural gas 
and oil, was discovered and reported within an area of the Denbury-operated Delhi Field located in northern Louisiana.  Denbury 
immediately took remedial action to stop the release and contain and recover well fluids in the affected area.  We have determined 
that the release originated from one or more wells in the affected area of the field that we believed had been previously and properly 
plugged and abandoned by a prior operator of the field.  We completed our remediation efforts during the fourth quarter of 2013; 
however, we will continue to monitor the area to ensure the remediation efforts were successful.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $114.0 million of lease operating expenses related to this release in 
our Consolidated Statement of Operations.  These expenses represent our current estimate of the costs related to the release, 
including remediation costs, based on actual costs incurred through December 31, 2013 of approximately $92.0 million, plus the 
Company’s estimate of future costs related to the satisfaction of known claims and liabilities.  Due to the possibility of new claims

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Denbury Resources Inc.(cid:160)
being asserted in the future in connection with the release, as well as variability in the estimated cost to continue to monitor the 
area to ensure the remediation efforts were successful, we cannot reliably determine at this time the full extent of the costs that 
may ultimately be incurred by the Company related to this release.  Although the Company maintains insurance policies that we 
believe cover certain of the costs, damages and claims related to the release, and we currently and preliminarily estimate that one-
third to two-thirds of our current cost estimate may be recoverable under such insurance policies, we have not reached any agreement 
with our insurance carriers as to recoverable amounts, and accordingly have not recognized any insurance recoveries in our financial 
statements as of December 31, 2013.  See Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for further discussion.
Costs incurred as a result of the release, together with lower production levels during the second half of 2013, are currently 
expected to delay into 2014 the effective date of the approximate 25% reversionary interest to the third party that sold the Delhi 
Field interest to us, the specific timing of which is dependent upon, among other things, the amount and timing of any potential 
insurance proceeds received and their application to the calculation of "total net cash flow" which determines the reversionary 
date, as well as oil prices, production, and production costs.  We currently estimate that the reversionary date could occur as late 
as the fourth quarter of 2014.
Bakken Exchange Transaction.  In late 2012, we closed a sale and exchange transaction with Exxon Mobil Corporation and 
its wholly-owned subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. (collectively, "ExxonMobil") under which we sold to ExxonMobil our Bakken area 
assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for (1) $1.3 billion in cash, (2) operating interests in Hartzog Draw and Webster 
fields in Wyoming and Texas, respectively, and (3) an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership 
interest in ExxonMobil's CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in Wyoming (the "Bakken Exchange Transaction").  The magnitude of 
the Bakken Exchange Transaction and the CCA Acquisition discussed above impact the comparability of our 2012 and 2013 
financial results in many ways, including oil and natural gas production, revenues, and operating expenses.  Our financial results 
for the year ended December 31, 2013 include the results from the CCA Acquisition beginning late in the first quarter of 2013.
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY
Overview.  Our primary sources of capital and liquidity are our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank 
credit facility.  Our business is capital intensive, and it is common for oil and natural gas companies our size to reinvest most or 
all of their cash flow into developing new assets.  We generally attempt to balance our capital spending with cash flow from 
operations, and we have repurchased 59.4 million shares of our common stock (approximately 14.8% of our outstanding shares 
at September 30, 2011) since commencement of our share repurchase program in October 2011 through February 20, 2014.  During 
2013, we purchased $277.8 million of our common stock, which was funded with a combination of cash flow from operations 
and incremental borrowings.  In early 2013, we refinanced two of our high-rate subordinated notes with ten-year notes carrying 
an interest rate of 4 5/8%, lowering our interest expense and reducing our outstanding bank borrowings with a portion of the 
proceeds.  We project that we will have more than adequate capital resources and liquidity for the foreseeable future because (1) 
we have refinanced our bank debt with low-cost subordinated debt, leaving significant borrowing capacity on our bank line; (2) 
we have oil hedges in place for a substantial portion of our forecasted proven oil production for the next two years, including fixed 
price swap derivative contracts for 2014 (see Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for further details regarding the prices and volumes of our commodity derivative contracts); (3) we expect to fund our projected 
capital expenditures for the next few years with cash flow from operations, which means that our expected growth in production 
and cash flow will gradually reduce our leverage (assuming oil prices are relatively consistent with current levels); (4) we expect 
to fund our planned dividends with cash flow from operations, (5) depending on the amount of shares of our common stock we 
repurchase in 2014, we might defer a portion of our planned 2014 capital expenditures, and (6) we can significantly reduce our 
capital expenditures for extended periods of time if necessary and still maintain current production levels as a result of our unique 
EOR operations.
2014  Capital  Spending.    We  anticipate  that  our  2014  capital  budget,  excluding  acquisitions,  will  be  $1.0  billion,  plus 
approximately $125 million in capitalized internal acquisition, exploration and development costs; capitalized interest; and pre-
production costs associated with new tertiary floods.(cid:160)(cid:160)This combined 2014 capital budget amount of $1.125 billion, excluding 
acquisitions, is comprised of the following:
•
$680 million allocated for tertiary oil field expenditures;
- 41 -
Table of Contents
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Denbury Resources Inc.(cid:160)
• 
• 
• 
•
$220 million allocated for other areas, primarily non-tertiary oil field expenditures;
$60 million for pipeline construction;
$40 million to be spent on CO2 sources; and
$125 million for other capital items such as capitalized internal acquisition, exploration and development costs; capitalized 
interest; and pre-production start-up costs associated with new tertiary floods.
Based on oil and natural gas commodity futures prices in early February 2014, our current production forecast, and our fixed-
price swaps covering a substantial portion of our anticipated 2014 production, we believe our anticipated 2014 cash flow from 
operations should be adequate to cover our combined 2014 capital budget and planned dividend payments.  If prices were to 
decrease or changes in operating results were to cause us to have a significant reduction in anticipated 2014 cash flows, we have 
ample availability on our bank credit facility to cover any potential shortfall, and we also have the ability to reduce our capital 
expenditures.
If we reduce our capital spending due to lower cash flows or to fund share repurchases, any sizeable reduction could lower 
our  anticipated  production  levels  in  future  years.(cid:160)(cid:160)For  2014  and  some  future  years,  we  have  contracted  for  certain  capital 
expenditures; therefore, we cannot eliminate all of our capital commitments without penalties (see Commitments and Obligations 
for further information regarding these commitments).
Stock Repurchase Program.  Our Board of Directors has approved a common share repurchase program for up to $1.162 
billion of Denbury common stock.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of February 20, 2014, we had spent $931.2 million to repurchase 59.4 million shares of 
our common stock under this program.  Our share repurchases are based on various parameters and, therefore, may be less than 
the remaining approved balance under the program, for which there is no set expiration date.  We anticipate that repurchases during 
2014 will be primarily funded with excess cash flow from operations or with borrowings under our bank credit facility or a reduction 
in capital spend.  See Note 7, Stockholders' Equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Bank Credit Facility.  We have a $1.6 billion bank credit facility that is secured by substantially all of our oil and natural 
gas properties.  As part of our semiannual bank review in late October 2013, the borrowing base for our bank credit facility was 
reaffirmed at $1.6 billion.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled on or around May 1, 2014.  We currently do not 
anticipate any reduction in our borrowing base as part of that redetermination, and we believe, based on current commodity prices 
and our proved reserves, that we could obtain lender approval to significantly increase the borrowing base under our bank credit 
facility above the current $1.6 billion level if we desired to do so.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of February 21, 2014, we had $645.0 million outstanding 
under our $1.6 billion bank credit facility and estimated cash of approximately $85.4 million, leaving us significant liquidity to 
fund capital expenditures and future dividends.
2014 Commencement of Payment of Dividends.  On January 28, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of 
$0.0625 per share on our common stock, to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 25, 2014.  We expect this 
dividend payment to be approximately $22 million and to be paid on March 25, 2014.  The declaration and payment of future 
dividends is at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and the amount thereof will depend on our results of operations, financial 
condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors.

costs associated with new tertiary floods.
(2)  Includes capital expenditures related to the Riley Ridge gas processing facility.
(3)  Property acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 include capital expenditures of approximately $1.0 
billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, related to acquisitions during the period that are not reflected as an Investing Activity 
on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows due to the movement of proceeds through a qualified intermediary to facilitate 
like-kind-exchange treatment under federal income tax rules.  In addition, property acquisitions in 2012 shown above include 
capital expenditures of approximately $0.6 billion representing the aggregate fair value of net assets acquired, excluding cash, 
in the Bakken Exchange Transaction.  See Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our 2013 capital expenditures, other than those for property acquisitions, were funded with $1.4 billion of cash flow from 
operations, and those for property acquisitions were funded with proceeds from the Bakken Exchange Transaction.  Our 2012 
capital expenditures were funded primarily with $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations, and our property acquisitions were 
funded with proceeds from the sale of non-core assets and the Bakken Exchange Transaction.  Our 2011 capital expenditures, 
excluding the Riley Ridge acquisition, were funded with $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations and cash on hand at the beginning 
of the period.(cid:160)(cid:160)The Riley Ridge acquisition was funded with incremental bank debt.

(1)  Represents future cash commitments under contracts in place as of December(cid:160)31, 2013, primarily for pipe, anthropogenic 
CO2 purchase contracts, drilling rig services and well-related costs.(cid:160)(cid:160)As is common in our industry, we commit to make certain 
expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program.(cid:160)(cid:160)These commitments generally 
relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or 
part of our capital budget (see 2014 Capital Spending above).(cid:160)(cid:160)In certain cases we have the ability to terminate contracts for 
equipment or supplies, in which case we would be liable only for the cost incurred by the vendor up to that point; however, 
as we currently do not anticipate canceling those contracts, these amounts include our estimated payments under those 
contracts.(cid:160)(cid:160)We  also  have  recurring  expenditures  for  such  things  as  accounting,  engineering  and  legal  fees;  software 
maintenance; subscriptions; and other overhead-type items.(cid:160)(cid:160)Normally these expenditures do not change materially on an 
aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses.(cid:160)(cid:160)We have not attempted to estimate 
the amounts of these types of recurring expenditures in this table, as most could be quickly canceled with regard to any specific 
vendor, even though the expense itself may be required for our ongoing normal operations.  Other obligations exclude 
approximately $980 million of potential costs for periods after 2017 to buy anthropogenic CO2 in accordance with purchase 
contracts under which we may not become obligated, as construction of the plants which may emit CO2 has not yet begun.
(2)  Commodity  derivative  liabilities  represent  the  fair  value  of  our  commodity  derivatives  presented  as  liabilities  in  our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December(cid:160)31, 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are 
unknown because they are subject to continuing market fluctuations.(cid:160)(cid:160)See further discussion of our commodity derivative 
contracts and their market price sensitivities in Market Risk Management below in this Management's Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
(3)  Represents the estimated future asset retirement obligations on an undiscounted basis.(cid:160)(cid:160)The present value of the discounted 
asset retirement obligation is $126.3 million, as determined under the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations topic 
of the FASC, and is further discussed in Note 3, Asset Retirement Obligations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  We have several operating leases relating to office space and other minor equipment 
leases.(cid:160)(cid:160)At  December(cid:160)31,  2013,  we  had  a  total  of  $11.7(cid:160)million  of  letters  of  credit  outstanding  under  our  bank  credit 
facility.(cid:160)(cid:160)Additionally, we have obligations that are not currently recorded on our balance sheet relating to various obligations for 
development and exploratory expenditures that arise from our normal capital expenditure program or from other transactions 
common to our industry.  These obligations are further described in Commitments and Obligations above.  In addition, in order 
to recover our undeveloped proved reserves, we must also fund the associated future development costs estimated in our proved 
reserve reports.(cid:160)(cid:160)For a further discussion of our future development costs, see Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures 
(Unaudited), to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

FINANCIAL OVERVIEW OF TERTIARY OPERATIONS
As discussed in Item 1, Business and Properties – Oil and Natural Gas Operations – Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview above, 
our tertiary operations represent a significant portion of our overall operations and have become our primary strategic focus.  The 
economics of a tertiary field and the related impact on our financial statements differ from a conventional oil and gas play and are 
explained further below.
While it is difficult to accurately forecast future production, we believe our tertiary recovery operations provide significant 
long-term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return, with relatively low risk.  Our rate of return from our tertiary 
operations has generally been higher than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations.  Generally, finding and development 
costs are lower and operating costs are higher than traditional oil and gas operations.  We have been developing tertiary oil properties 
for over 14 years, and the financial impact of such operations is reflected in our historical financial statements.  The summary 
below highlights our observations regarding how tertiary operations have impacted our financial statements.
Finding and Development Costs.  We currently expect finding and development costs (including future development and 
abandonment costs but excluding CO2 pipeline infrastructure capital expenditures) over the life of each field to be lower than the 
industry average costs for other oil properties.  See the definition of finding and development costs in the Glossary and Selected 
Abbreviations.
Timing of Capital Costs.(cid:160)(cid:160)There is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures on tertiary oil fields and the 
resulting production increases.(cid:160)(cid:160)We must build facilities, and often a CO2 pipeline to the field, before CO2 flooding can commence, 
and it usually takes six to twelve(cid:160)months before the field responds to the injection of CO2 (i.e., oil production commences).(cid:160)(cid:160)Further, 
we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proved reserves from fields we flood and, even after a 
field has proved reserves, significant amounts of additional capital will usually be required to fully develop the field.
Recognition of Proved Reserves.  In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either demonstrate production 
resulting from the tertiary process or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood.(cid:160) The magnitude of proved reserves 
that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods, the timing of the production response from new 
floods and the performance of our existing floods.  Typically, a high percentage of the potential reserves for a tertiary field are 
recognized when a production response is initially observed, and generally only modest increases are made thereafter.
Production Rates.  The production growth rate at a tertiary flood can vary from quarter to quarter, as a tertiary field’s production 
may increase rapidly when wells respond to the CO2, plateau temporarily, and then resume growth as additional areas of the field 
are developed.(cid:160)(cid:160)During a tertiary flood life cycle, facility capacity is increased from time to time, which occasionally requires 
temporary shutdowns during installation, thereby causing temporary declines in production.(cid:160)(cid:160)We also find it difficult to precisely 
predict when any given well will respond to the injected CO2, as the CO2 seldom travels through the rock consistently due to 
heterogeneity in the oil-bearing formations.(cid:160)(cid:160)We find all of these fluctuations to be normal, and generally expect oil production at 
a tertiary field to increase over time until the entire field is developed, albeit sometimes in inconsistent patterns.(cid:160)(cid:160)
Operating Costs.  Tertiary projects may be more expensive to operate than traditional industry operations because of the cost 
of injecting and recycling the CO2 (primarily due to the cost of the CO2 and the significant energy requirements to re-compress 
the CO2 back into a near-liquid state for re-injection purposes).(cid:160)(cid:160)The costs of our CO2 and the electricity required to recycle and 
inject this CO2 comprise almost half of our typical tertiary operating expenses.(cid:160)(cid:160)Since these costs vary along with commodity and 
commercial electricity prices, they are highly variable and will increase in a high-commodity-price environment and decrease in 
a low-price environment.(cid:160)(cid:160)Most of our CO2 operating costs are allocated to our tertiary oil fields and recorded as lease operating 
expenses (following the commencement of tertiary oil production) at the time the CO2 is injected.  These costs have historically 
represented approximately 20% to 25% of the total operating costs for our tertiary operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Since we expense all of the operating 
costs to produce and inject our CO2 (following the commencement of tertiary oil production), operating costs per barrel for a new 
flood will be higher at the inception of CO2 injection projects because of minimal related oil production at that time.

(2)  Noncash  fair  value  adjustments  on  commodity  derivatives  is  a  non-GAAP  measure  and  is  different  from  "Commodity 
derivatives expense (income)" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in that the noncash fair value adjustments on 
commodity derivatives represents only the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative 
positions, and excludes the impact of cash settlements on commodity derivatives during the period, which were cash receipts 
(payments) on settlements of $(0.7) million, $17.9 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 
2011,  respectively.   We  believe  that  noncash  fair  value  adjustments  on  commodity  derivatives  is  a  useful  supplemental 
disclosure to "Commodity derivatives expense (income)" in order to differentiate noncash fair market value adjustments from 
cash settlements on commodity derivatives during the period.  This supplemental disclosure is widely used within the industry 
and by securities analysts, banks and credit rating agencies in calculating EBITDA and in adjusting net income to present 
those measures on a comparative basis across companies, as well as to assess compliance with certain debt covenants.  Noncash 
fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor 
should it be considered in isolation or as a substitute for "Commodity derivatives expense (income)" in the Consolidated 
Statements of Operations.  See also the Glossary and Selected Abbreviations for the definition of noncash fair value adjustments 
on commodity derivatives.

(4)  Includes production from certain non-core Gulf Coast assets sold in late February 2012 and certain non-operated assets in the
Greater Aneth Field in the Paradox Basin of Utah sold in April 2012.
Total Production
We closed on our Bakken Exchange Transaction late in 2012 and utilized the proceeds from that transaction to purchase 
additional interests in CCA in late March 2013.  Accordingly, total production decreased 1,446 BOE/d (2%) between 2012 and 
2013, primarily due to the inclusion in 2012 of 11 months of production from our Bakken area assets, compared to the inclusion 
of only nine months of additional CCA production in our 2013 results.  This decline in production due to timing of transactions 
was partially offset by a 9% increase in tertiary production.
Total production increased 6,029 BOE/d (9%) between 2011 and 2012.  The increases were primarily due to production 
increases from our tertiary oil fields and increases from our Bakken area assets (which were sold late in the fourth quarter of 2012), 
offset by normal declines in most of our other non-tertiary properties.
Our production during 2013 was 94% oil compared to 93% for 2012 and 2011.(cid:160)(cid:160)The slight increase in oil production percentage 
in 2013 is due to increases in our tertiary production, which is primarily oil, as well as the sale of our Bakken area assets, which 
had a higher percentage of natural gas production than the CCA assets acquired.
Tertiary Production
Oil production from our tertiary operations increased to record levels during 2013, averaging 38,477 Bbls/d, a 9% increase 
over our 2012 tertiary production level of 35,206 Bbls/d, primarily due to production growth in response to continued field 
development and expansion of facilities in our tertiary floods at Delhi, Hastings, Heidelberg and Oyster Bayou fields.  Offsetting 
these 2013 production gains were production declines in our more mature tertiary fields.  Tertiary production during the fourth 
quarter of 2013 increased 3% over third-quarter levels, largely due to continued production growth at Heidelberg and Oyster Bayou 
fields, the completion of planned maintenance activities at Hastings Field, and increased CO2 injections into areas surrounding 
the impacted area of Delhi Field (see Overview – Delhi Field Release and Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this matter).  We started injections at our Bell Creek Field in Montana 
during the second quarter of 2013, with the first tertiary oil production from this field during the third quarter of 2013.  The ramp 
up of production at Bell Creek Field has been slower than anticipated due to the delayed completion of a CO2 pipeline interconnect 
originally scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2013 and the interruptions in CO2 delivery from the Lost Cabin gas plant.  With the 
completion of the pipeline interconnect during the first quarter of 2014, we have increased CO2 injections at Bell Creek Field and 
expect production at the field to increase at a faster pace during 2014.
Oil production from our tertiary operations averaged 35,206 Bbls/d during 2012, a 14% increase over our 2011 tertiary 
production level of 30,959 Bbls/d, primarily due to production growth in response to continued expansion of the tertiary floods at 
Tinsley and Delhi fields and production at our Oyster Bayou and Hastings fields, which experienced their initial tertiary production 
response in late December 2011 and early January 2012, respectively.(cid:160)(cid:160)Offsetting 2012 tertiary production gains were declines in 
our more mature tertiary fields.
Non-Tertiary Production
Continuing production from our non-tertiary operations, which excludes production from our Bakken and other non-core 
assets divested during 2012, increased to an average of 31,766 BOE/d during 2013, an increase of 10,130 BOE/d (47%) compared 
to 2012 continuing production levels.  The non-tertiary continuing production increases were primarily due to production from 
newly acquired fields, specifically the additional interests in CCA acquired in March 2013, Webster and Hartzog Draw fields 
acquired in the Bakken Exchange Transaction in late 2012, and Thompson Field acquired in June 2012.  With the exception of the 
impact of the production added from fields acquired during 2012 and 2013, production from our other non-tertiary properties is 
generally on decline, and in some instances the decline is pronounced due to the expansion of our tertiary floods, which causes 
non-tertiary production to be shut in for a period while the field is being pressured up.  Continuing production from our non-tertiary 
operations during the fourth quarter of 2013 decreased 3% from third-quarter levels, partially due to severe weather-related issues 
during the fourth quarter.  Continuing production from our non-tertiary operations decreased 5% from 2011 to 2012, due primarily
- 49 -
Table of Contents
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Denbury Resources Inc.(cid:160)
to non-tertiary oil production declines as a result of the expansion of our tertiary floods in those areas.  These declines were partially 
offset by production from acquisitions during 2012, which increased our production in Texas.
Oil and Natural Gas Revenues
Oil and natural gas revenues increased in each of the past two years.  The increase in oil and natural gas revenues in 2013 was 
the result of increases in commodity prices, slightly offset by a small decline in production, whereas the increase in oil and natural 
gas revenues in 2012 was attributable to higher production volumes, slightly offset by a decline in commodity prices.  The changes 
in revenues due to these factors, excluding any impact of our commodity derivative contracts, are reflected in the following table:

As reflected in the table above, our average net realized oil price increased 4% during 2013 compared to the average price 
received during 2012.  Company-wide average oil price differentials were $2.62 per Bbl above NYMEX in 2013, compared to an 
average differential of $2.99 per Bbl above NYMEX in 2012 and $4.95 per Bbl above NYMEX in 2011.  During 2013, we sold 
approximately 46% of our crude oil at prices based on the LLS index price, approximately 23% at prices partially tied to the LLS 
index price, and the balance at prices based on various other indexes tied to NYMEX prices, primarily in the Rocky Mountain 
region.  The net differential we received was primarily impacted by positive differentials in the Gulf Coast region, offset by 
unfavorable differentials in the Rocky Mountain region, each of which is discussed in further detail below.
We received favorable NYMEX differentials in the Gulf Coast region during 2013, 2012 and 2011, primarily due to the 
favorable differential for crude oil sold under LLS index prices.  During 2013, the quarterly average LLS-to-NYMEX differential 
(on a trade-month basis) decreased in each quarter of 2013, from the first quarter average of $20.15 per Bbl to $2.58 per Bbl in 
the fourth quarter.  In 2012 and 2011, the quarterly average LLS-to-NYMEX differential (on a trade-month basis) ranged from a 
positive $9.28 per Bbl to $23.36 per Bbl.
NYMEX oil differentials in the Rocky Mountain region during 2013 were $8.10 per Bbl below NYMEX compared to an 
average differential of $11.86 per Bbl below NYMEX in 2012.  The change in the differential between 2012 and 2013 was largely
- 50 -
Table of Contents
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Denbury Resources Inc.(cid:160)
impacted by the sale of our Bakken area assets in the fourth quarter of 2012, since oil from the Bakken area assets generally sold 
at a higher discount to NYMEX than the CCA production acquired in early 2013.
Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, 
including supply and/or demand factors and location differentials.  During the fourth quarter of 2013, we observed a decline in 
the favorable LLS-to-NYMEX differential and a widening of the Rocky Mountain differential, causing our overall NYMEX oil 
differential to be a negative $4.57 per Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2013.  This quarterly negative differential is the widest we have 
experienced in several years.  Although we have seen the LLS and Rocky Mountain differentials improve somewhat in early 2014, 
we do not expect the LLS-to-NYMEX differential to return to more favorable levels we have experienced during the last few years 
due to the oil transportation capacity that has been added, which allows more oil production access to the LLS market.
Our natural gas NYMEX differentials are generally caused by movement in the NYMEX natural gas prices during the month, 
as most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of each month.(cid:160)(cid:160)While the percentage change in NYMEX 
natural gas differentials can be quite large, these differentials are very seldom more than a dollar above or below NYMEX prices.
Commodity Derivative Contracts
From time to time, we enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to 
commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production.(cid:160)(cid:160)These contracts have consisted of price 
floors, collars and fixed price swaps.  The following table summarizes the impact our oil and natural gas derivative contracts had 
on our operating results for 2013, 2012 and 2011:

Changes in commodity prices and the expiration of contracts cause fluctuations in the estimated fair value of our oil and 
natural gas derivative contracts.(cid:160)(cid:160)Because we do not utilize hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, the period-

(1)  Excluding estimated lease operating expenses recorded during the year ended December 31, 2013 to remediate an area of 
Delhi Field, total lease operating expense per BOE averaged $24.05.  See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  Operations  –  Overview  –  Delhi  Field  Release,  and  Note  11,  Commitments  and 
Contingencies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this matter.
Total lease operating expense during 2013 increased on an absolute-dollar and per-BOE basis from 2012 primarily due to 
$114.0 million in incurred and estimated lease operating expenses recorded for the costs to remediate an area of Delhi Field 
impacted by a release of well fluids discovered during the second quarter (see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Overview – Delhi Field Release, and Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  Excluding these incurred and estimated remediation expenses, lease operating expense 
increased $84.2 million (16%) or $3.76 per BOE during 2013 compared to 2012 levels due primarily to increased expenses resulting 
from the expansion of our tertiary floods, including our new tertiary flood at Bell Creek Field; increases in the cost and utilization 
of CO2 between the comparative periods; and higher lease operating expenses at the fields we acquired in the Bakken Exchange 
Transaction relative to the Bakken assets we sold.  Lease operating expense increased 5% between 2011 and 2012 on an absolute-
dollar basis due to the expansion of our tertiary floods and decreased 4% on a per-BOE basis primarily due to the higher production 
volumes in our tertiary floods and growth in our Bakken production, which had a relatively low operating cost per barrel.
Excluding the incurred and estimated Delhi Field remediation expense, tertiary lease operating expense increased $50.6 million 
(16%) or $1.63 per Bbl during 2013 compared to 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)The increase was primarily a result of the expansion of our tertiary floods, 
including our new tertiary flood at Bell Creek Field, and increased CO2 expenses due to increases in the cost of CO2 and an increase 
in CO2 volumes injected into tertiary floods between years.  During 2012, tertiary lease operating expense increased 13% on an 
absolute-dollar basis compared to 2011 levels, but decreased slightly on a per-BOE basis.  The decrease in tertiary operating costs 
per barrel was due to the 14% increase in tertiary production, which more than offset the higher total tertiary operating expenses

resulting from the increase in the number of our active tertiary floods due to the tertiary floods at Hastings and Oyster Bayou fields.  
For any specific field, we expect our tertiary lease operating expense per barrel to be high initially, as we experienced in 2013 with 
our Bell Creek flood, and then decrease as production increases, ultimately leveling off until production begins to decline in the 
later life of the field, when operating expense per barrel will again increase.  One of our most substantial costs in our tertiary 
operations is our cost for fuel and utilities, averaging $6.64 per Bbl in 2013, $6.51 per Bbl in 2012 and $6.31 per Bbl in 2011, 
which has increased on a per-barrel basis due to the higher cost of these items and the continued expansion of our tertiary floods.
Currently, our CO2 expense comprises approximately one-fourth of our typical Gulf Coast tertiary operating expenses, and 
for the CO2 reserves we already own, consists of our CO2 production expenses, and for the CO2 reserves we do not own, consists 
of our purchase of CO2 from royalty and working interest owners and anthropogenic (man-made) sources.  During the year ended 
December 31, 2013, approximately 69% of the CO2 utilized in our Gulf Coast region CO2 floods consisted of CO2 owned and 
produced by us, and we purchased the remaining portion from third-party owners (primarily royalty owners).  The price we pay 
others for CO2 varies by source and is generally indexed to oil prices.  When combining the production cost of the CO2 we own 
with what we pay third parties for CO2, our average cost of CO2 for the Gulf Coast region during 2013 was approximately $0.33 
per Mcf, including taxes paid on CO2 production but excluding depletion and depreciation of capital expended at our Jackson 
Dome source and CO2 pipelines.  This rate during 2013 was higher than the $0.26 per Mcf spent during 2012 and 2011 primarily 
due to higher oil prices (to which the cost of CO2 is partially tied) and increased volumes purchased from anthropogenic sources 
during 2013, which volumes have a higher purchase price but require a smaller capital outlay than CO2 we obtain from the Jackson 
Dome area.  Including depletion expense related to the Jackson Dome CO2 production, but excluding depreciation of our CO2 
pipelines, our cost of CO2 was $0.42 per Mcf in 2013, $0.33 per Mcf in 2012 and $0.31 per Mcf in 2011.
Non-tertiary lease operating expense increased 15% on an absolute-dollar basis during 2013, compared to the prior year period, 
as declines resulting from the sale of our Bakken area assets were more than offset by increases in newly acquired fields, including 
Thompson field acquired in the second quarter of 2012, Webster and Hartzog Draw fields acquired in the Bakken Exchange 
Transaction in late 2012, and additional interests in CCA acquired in the first quarter of 2013.  On a per-BOE basis, non-tertiary 
lease operating expense increased 32% from 2012 to 2013 due to increases in newly acquired fields, which have a higher per-BOE 
operating cost than the properties disposed in the Bakken Exchange Transaction.  Non-tertiary lease operating expense decreased 
5% on an absolute-dollar basis and decreased 9% on a per-BOE basis during 2012 compared to 2011.  The lower operating expense 
per BOE was largely driven by increased production related to our Bakken area assets (which had lower operating costs than our 
other properties), and the sale of certain non-core assets during the first half of 2012, which had a higher operating cost per BOE 
compared to the average of our other properties.
Taxes other than income
Taxes other than income includes ad valorem, production and franchise taxes.  Taxes other than income increased $16.2 million 
between 2012 and 2013 and increased $12.5 million between 2011 and 2012.  The change in each period is generally aligned with 
fluctuations in oil and natural gas revenues.  The increase during 2013 is further impacted by the change in the mix of properties 
subject to production and ad valorem taxes as a result of the Bakken Exchange Transaction and CCA acquisition.

On an absolute-dollar basis, net G&A expense increased slightly between 2012 and 2013 and increased 15% between 2011
and 2012 and on a per-BOE basis increased 3% between 2012 and 2013 and 5% between 2011 and 2012.
Gross cash compensation and administrative costs increased $27.9 million (9%) between 2012 and 2013 and $50.6 million 
(21%) between 2011 and 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)The increase in both comparative periods is due to higher compensation-related costs from increases 
in headcount, annual merit increases and other employee-related costs such as health insurance.  Employee bonus expense was 
relatively unchanged from 2012 to 2013 despite the 5% increase in headcount, as bonuses were paid at a lower rate in 2013 than 
in 2012, but contributed to the increase in gross administrative cost between 2011 and 2012.
Gross stock-based compensation costs increased in 2013 compared to 2012 due to the increased number of employees during 
2013 compared to 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)The increase to gross stock-based compensation as a result of additional headcount during 2012 compared 
to 2011 was more than offset by a shift in the mix of compensation to more cash-based compensation.  Stock-based compensation, 
net of amounts capitalized or reclassified to field operations, was approximately $30.4 million in 2013, $26.5 million in 2012 and 
$30.3 million in 2011.
Our well operating agreements allow us, when we are the operator, to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the 
drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well.(cid:160)(cid:160)In addition, salaries associated with field 
personnel are initially recorded as gross cash compensation and administrative costs and are subsequently reclassified to lease 
operating expenses or capitalized to field development costs to the extent those individuals are dedicated to oil and natural gas 
production, exploration, and development activities.(cid:160)(cid:160)As a result of additional operated wells, increased compensation expense 
and an increase in the COPAS overhead rate, the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead recovery charges increased 
by 17% between 2012 and 2013, and 13% between 2011 and 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)Capitalized exploration and development costs also increased 
between the periods, primarily due to increased compensation costs subject to capitalization.

Interest expense, net decreased 8% between 2012 and 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)The decrease in interest expense is due to a lower average interest 
rate, partially offset by higher average debt outstanding and higher capitalized interest.  The decrease in the average interest rate 
between 2012 and 2013 is a result of refinancing our 9½% Notes and 9¾% Notes with our 2023 Notes, which carry a rate of 4 
5/8% (see Overview – Debt Refinancing above).  During 2014, we expect capitalized interest to decline due to the completion of 
various development projects during the fourth quarter of 2013.
Interest expense, net decreased 7% between 2011 and 2012, largely due to higher capitalized interest, offset in part by higher 
cash interest expense resulting from an increase in average debt outstanding during the period.  Capitalized interest increased 26% 
during 2012, compared to 2011 primarily due to incremental capitalized interest on the Riley Ridge gas processing facility and 
Greencore Pipeline construction projects.

We adjust our DD&A rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs.  In 
addition, under full cost accounting rules, the divestiture of oil and natural gas properties generally does not result in gain or loss 
recognition; instead, the proceeds of the disposition reduce the full cost pool.  As such, our DD&A rate has changed significantly 
over time, and it may continue to change in the future.(cid:160)(cid:160)Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties decreased 7% 
on an absolute-dollar basis and 4% on a per-BOE basis between 2012 and 2013.  These decreases were primarily due to the Bakken 
Exchange Transaction in late 2012, which resulted in a decrease in capitalized costs relating to the sales proceeds credited to the 
full cost pool and a significant reduction in future development costs relating to the sold proved reserves, partially offset by the 
reduction in total proved reserves.  This decrease in DD&A was partially offset by the impact of the CCA Acquisition in the first 
quarter of 2013 and the movement of Bell Creek reserves from unevaluated to proved reserves during the fourth quarter of 2013.

Depletion and depreciation of oil and natural gas properties increased 16% on an absolute-dollar basis and 6% on a per-BOE 
basis between 2011 and 2012.  During the first nine months of 2012, our DD&A rate for our oil and natural gas properties was 
$16.90 per BOE, which was higher than 2011 levels due to higher finding and development costs related to our Bakken capital 
program.  However, in the fourth quarter of 2012, our DD&A rate for our oil and natural gas properties decreased to $14.39 per 
BOE due to the Bakken Exchange Transaction.
During 2013, we added 84.6 MMBOE of estimated proved reserves, including tertiary reserves of 34.0 MMBbls at Bell Creek 
Field based on the field's response to CO2 injections, 42.2 MMBOE from the acquisition of additional interests in CCA Fields and 
8.4 MMBOE of other additions and revisions.  We reclassified approximately $417.6 million from unevaluated properties to the 
full cost pool relating to Bell Creek Field, representing the acquisition costs and development expenditures incurred on the field 
prior to recognizing proved reserves.  Our depletion and depreciation rate of oil and natural gas properties increased to $16.90 per 
BOE during the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily as a result of the reclassification of Bell Creek costs to the full cost pool, increased 
finding and development costs, and the related recognition of additional proved reserves.
Depletion and depreciation of our CO2 properties, pipelines, plants, and other property and equipment increased on an absolute-
dollar and per-BOE basis during 2013 from 2012 levels, primarily due to an increase in CO2 properties, pipelines and plants subject 
to depreciation as a result of continued development.  The increase in 2013 was further impacted by a change in classification of 
our equipment leases from operating to capital during the second quarter of 2012, and the amount on a per-BOE basis was also 
impacted by lower oil and natural gas production during 2013.  Depletion and depreciation of our CO2 properties increased on an 
absolute-dollar and per-BOE basis in 2012 compared to 2011 due to increased drilling activity at Jackson Dome, and depreciation 
of other fixed assets increased during the same period due to incremental pipeline depreciation and the change in classification of 
our equipment leases.
Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation.(cid:160)(cid:160)Under these rules, the full 
cost ceiling value is calculated using a 12-month average price based on the first-day price of every month during the period.(cid:160)(cid:160)We 
did not have a ceiling test write-down during 2013, 2012 or 2011.(cid:160)(cid:160)However, if oil prices were to decrease significantly in subsequent 
periods, we may be required to record write-downs under the full cost pool ceiling test in the future.(cid:160)(cid:160)The possibility and amount 
of any future write-down is difficult to predict, and will depend, in part, upon oil and natural gas prices, the incremental proved 
reserves that may be added each period, revisions to previous reserve estimates and future capital expenditures, as well as additional 
capital spent.

Our income tax provisions for 2013 and 2011 were based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38%, while the 2012 
tax provision was based on an estimated statutory rate of approximately 38.5%.(cid:160)(cid:160)The fluctuation in our statutory rate is significantly 
driven by a shift in the amount of revenues we earn in each state due to acquisitions and divestitures and other production changes.  
Our 2013 effective tax rate was lower than our statutory rate due to the revaluation of our deferred taxes as a result of the lower 
overall statutory rate compared to 2012, as well as the change in treatment of certain items between our 2012 tax provision and 
our 2012 tax returns.  Our effective tax rate was consistent with our estimated statutory rates in 2012 and 2011.
During 2012, for federal income tax purposes, we structured the divestitures of our Bakken area assets and certain non-core 
assets as like-kind-exchange transactions for interests acquired in Thompson, Webster, Hartzog Draw and LaBarge fields as well

as the CCA Acquisition in 2013 (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements), thereby 
deferring the majority of the taxable gain on those divestitures.  The increase in current income tax expense during 2012 included 
$42 million of current taxes resulting from the taxable gain recognized in the Bakken Exchange Transaction that we were unable 
to defer through a like-kind exchange transaction.  Current income tax expense during 2013 is primarily related to state income 
taxes while current income tax during 2012 and 2011 also includes our alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with 
enhanced oil recovery credits, as well as state income taxes.(cid:160) We currently expect our cash taxes in the future to increase over 2013 
cash taxes.  Our current income tax expense during 2011 was offset by a net benefit due to the change in treatment for certain 
items between our 2010 tax provision and our 2010 filed tax return.(cid:160) This change in treatment resulted in a reclassification of 
approximately $16.9 million from current to deferred taxes.
As of December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had an estimated $15.0 million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward related to our 
tertiary operations, and $34.8 million of alternative minimum tax credits that can be utilized to reduce our current income taxes 
during 2014 or future years.(cid:160)(cid:160)These enhanced oil recovery credits do not begin to expire until 2025.(cid:160)(cid:160)Since the ability to earn 
additional enhanced oil recovery credits is based upon the level of oil prices, we would not currently expect to earn additional 
enhanced oil recovery credits unless oil prices were to significantly deteriorate.

MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2012 consisted of proceeds from the Bakken Exchange 
Transaction (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the Consolidated Financial Statements) previously held by a qualified 
intermediary  and  which  were  restricted  for  application  towards  future  potential  acquisitions  to  enable  a  like-kind-exchange 
transaction for federal income tax purposes.  We managed and controlled counterparty credit risk related to this restricted cash 
using a trust agreement, whereby the assets held in trust must be segregated from the financial institution's assets, and in the event 
of its bankruptcy, the funds would not be subject to payments to the creditors of the financial institution.
Debt
We finance some of our acquisitions and other expenditures with fixed and variable rate debt.(cid:160)(cid:160)These debt agreements expose 
us to market risk related to changes in interest rates.(cid:160)(cid:160)At December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had $340.0 million in outstanding borrowings on 
our bank credit facility.(cid:160)(cid:160)None of our existing debt has any triggers or covenants regarding our debt ratings with rating agencies, 
although under the NEJD financing lease, in the event of significant downgrades of our corporate credit rating by the rating agencies, 
certain credit enhancements can be required from us, and possibly other remedies made available under the lease.(cid:160)(cid:160)The fair value 
of our senior subordinated debt is based on quoted market prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)The following table presents the principal cash flows and fair

Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts
From time to time, we enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to 
commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production.(cid:160)(cid:160)These contracts have consisted of price 
floors, collars and fixed price swaps.(cid:160)(cid:160)We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. (cid:160)The production 
that we hedge has varied from year to year, depending on our levels of debt and financial strength and expectation of future 
commodity prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently employ a strategy to hedge a portion of our forecasted production for approximately 18 months 
to two years in the future from the current quarter, as we believe it is important to protect our future cash flow for that time in 
order to give us time to adjust to commodity price fluctuations, particularly since many of our expenditures have long lead times 
(see Capital Resources and Liquidity above).  Now that we are paying a dividend, we may look to extend the periods covered by 
our hedges further into the future, possibly for periods up to three years, in order to provide greater certainty around oil and natural 
gas prices and projected cash flows.  Also, in December 2013, we converted our 2014 oil collars to fixed-price swaps and in early 
2014, we converted a portion of our 2015 oil collars to fixed-price swaps.  See Note 9, Commodity Derivative Contracts, to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our commodity derivative contracts.
All of the mark-to-market valuations used for our oil and natural gas derivatives are provided by external sources.(cid:160)(cid:160)We manage 
and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed on an ongoing

basis.(cid:160)(cid:160)We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and 
diversification.(cid:160)(cid:160)All of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our bank credit facility.(cid:160)(cid:160)We have 
included an estimate of nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts, which 
we have measured for nonperformance risk based upon credit default swaps or credit spreads.
For accounting purposes, we do not apply hedge accounting to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts.(cid:160)(cid:160)This means that 
any changes in the fair value of these commodity derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of 
charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion to earnings.
At December(cid:160)31, 2013, our commodity derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net liability of 
approximately $47.3 million, a $40.4 million increase from the $6.9 million net liability recorded at December(cid:160)31, 2012.(cid:160)(cid:160)This 
change is primarily related to the expiration of oil derivative contracts during 2013, new commodity derivative contracts we entered 
into during 2013 for future periods, and to the oil and natural gas futures prices as of December(cid:160)31, 2013.
Commodity Derivative Sensitivity Analysis
Based on NYMEX and LLS crude oil futures prices and natural gas futures prices as of December(cid:160)31, 2013, and assuming 
both a 10% increase and decrease thereon, we would expect to make or receive payments on our crude oil and natural gas derivative 
contracts as shown in the following table:

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select 
certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our significant 
accounting policies are included in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(cid:160)(cid:160)These 
policies, along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application, have a significant impact 
on our consolidated financial statements.(cid:160)(cid:160)Following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates, judgments and 
uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements.
Full Cost Method of Accounting, Depletion and Depreciation and Oil and Natural Gas Properties
Businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil 
and gas industry.(cid:160)(cid:160)We apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)Another acceptable method 
of accounting for oil and natural gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting.(cid:160)(cid:160)In general, the primary 
differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment.(cid:160)(cid:160)Under the 
full cost method, all geological and geophysical costs, exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool, 
whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred.(cid:160)(cid:160)In the assessment of impairment of oil and 
natural gas properties, the successful efforts method follows the FASB guidance under the Accounting for the Impairment or 
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets topic of the FASC, under which the net book value of assets is measured for impairment against 
the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Under the full cost method, 
the full cost pool (net book value of oil and natural gas properties) is measured against future cash flows discounted at 10% using 
the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12-month period ended as of each quarterly 
reporting period.(cid:160)(cid:160)The financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting
- 59 -

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Denbury Resources Inc.(cid:160)
that an oil and gas entity applies.(cid:160)(cid:160)Further, we do not designate our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as hedge instruments 
for accounting purposes under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC (see below), and as a result, these contracts are not 
considered in the full cost ceiling test.
We make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and natural gas revenues, production, 
capitalized costs and operating expenses.(cid:160)(cid:160)We calculate these estimates with our best available data, which includes, among other 
things, production reports, price posting, information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices, and 
analysis of historical results and trends.(cid:160)(cid:160)While management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates, there will likely 
be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, re-allocations by 
the purchaser/pipeline, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry, many of which will require 
retroactive application.(cid:160)(cid:160)These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period 
during which the adjustment occurs.
Under full cost accounting, the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the 
related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact 
on the underlying financial statements.(cid:160)(cid:160)The process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex, requiring significant 
decisions in the evaluation of all available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data.(cid:160)(cid:160)The data for a given field 
may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving 
production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions.(cid:160)(cid:160)As a result, 
material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time.(cid:160)(cid:160)Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure 
that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible, including the hiring of independent engineers 
to prepare reported estimates, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates 
generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures.(cid:160)(cid:160)Over the last four years, annual revisions 
to our reserve estimates have averaged approximately 2.0% of the previous year’s estimates and have been both positive and 
negative.
Changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities.(cid:160)(cid:160)Between 2011 and 2012, oil and natural gas prices used to 
calculate reserve quantities in our year-end proved reserve report decreased, resulting in a decrease in our proved reserves of 6.7 
MMBOE.(cid:160)(cid:160)Between 2012 and 2013, oil and natural gas prices used to calculate year-end proved reserves increased, resulting in 
an increase in our proved reserves of 3.0 MMBOE.  These changes in quantities affect our DD&A rate, and the combined effect 
of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation.(cid:160)(cid:160)For example, we estimate that a 5% 
increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter 2013 DD&A rate from $16.90 per 
BOE to approximately $16.12 per BOE, and a 5% decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our DD&A rate 
to approximately $17.76 per BOE.(cid:160)(cid:160)Also, reserve quantities and their ultimate values, determined solely by our lenders, are the 
primary factors in determining the maximum borrowing base under our bank credit facility.
Under full cost accounting rules, we are required each quarter to perform a ceiling test calculation.(cid:160)(cid:160)The net capitalized costs 
of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the cost center ceiling.(cid:160)(cid:160)The cost center ceiling is 
defined as (1) the present value of our future net revenues from proved reserves before future abandonment costs calculated using 
the average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas price for each month during the 12-month period then ended, discounted at 
10%; plus (2) the cost of properties not being amortized; plus (3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties 
included in the costs being amortized, if any; less (4) related income tax effects.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our future net revenues from proved reserves 
are not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO2 reserves nor for those related to the 
cost of constructing CO2 pipelines, as those costs have already been incurred by the Company.(cid:160)(cid:160)Therefore, we include in the ceiling 
test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of our capitalized CO2 costs related to CO2 reserves and CO2 pipelines that 
we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)The fair value of our oil and 
natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedge instruments for 
accounting purposes.
We did not have a full cost pool ceiling test write-down in 2013, 2012 or 2011.(cid:160)(cid:160)Crude oil prices decreased between 2011 and 
2012, and increased during 2013, with first-day-of-the-month NYMEX oil prices during 2013 averaging $96.94 per Bbl during 
the year.  First-day-of-the-month unweighted average NYMEX natural gas prices during 2013 of $3.67 per Mcf were higher than 
unweighted average natural gas prices for 2012.  Commodity prices have historically been volatile and are expected to continue

to be so in the future.(cid:160)(cid:160)If oil and natural gas prices should decrease, we may be required to record write-downs due to the full cost 
ceiling test.(cid:160)(cid:160)The amount of any future write-down is difficult to predict and will depend upon the oil and natural gas prices utilized 
in the ceiling test, the incremental proved reserves that might be added during each period and additional capital spent.
Tertiary Injection Costs
Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years; 
however, in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves, we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced 
recovery techniques such as CO2 injection until we can demonstrate production resulting from the tertiary process or unless the 
field is analogous to an existing flood.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our costs associated with the CO2 we produce (or acquire) and inject are principally our 
cash out-of-pocket costs of production, transportation and acquisition, and to pay royalties.
We capitalize, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not 
yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e., a production response).(cid:160)(cid:160)These capitalized development costs 
will be included in our unevaluated property costs if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field.(cid:160)(cid:160)After we see a 
production response to the CO2 injections (i.e., the production stage), injection costs will be expensed as incurred, and any previously 
deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion upon recognition of proved tertiary reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)During 
2013, 2012 and 2011, we capitalized $38.7 million, $36.8 million and $65.3 million, respectively, of tertiary injection costs 
associated with our tertiary projects.
Income Taxes
We make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes.(cid:160)(cid:160)These 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and 
recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our federal and state income tax returns are generally 
not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared; therefore, we estimate the tax basis of our assets 
and  liabilities  at  the  end  of  each  period  as  well  as  the  effects  of  tax  rate  changes,  tax  credits  and  net  operating  loss 
carryforwards.(cid:160)(cid:160)Adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we finalize our 
income tax returns.(cid:160)(cid:160)Further, we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets (primarily 
our enhanced oil recovery credits and state loss carryforwards).(cid:160)(cid:160)If recovery is not likely, we must record a valuation allowance 
against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover, which would result in an increase to our income 
tax expense.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December 31, 2013, we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet 
will ultimately be recovered.(cid:160)(cid:160)If our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets, our 
tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not likely.(cid:160)(cid:160)A 1% increase in our effective tax rate would 
have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately $6.4 million, $8.6 million and $9.2 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.(cid:160)(cid:160)See Note 6, Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements and see 
Income Taxes above for further information concerning our income taxes.
Fair Value Estimates
The FASC defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value 
measurements. It does not require us to make any new fair value measurements, but rather establishes a fair value hierarchy that 
prioritizes the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the 
fair value hierarchy, as they represent observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in 
active markets as of the reporting date, while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority, as they represent unobservable inputs 
that are not corroborated by market data.  Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored.  See Note 
10,  Fair  Value  Measurements,  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  for  disclosures  regarding  our  recurring  fair  value 
measurements.
Significant uses of fair value measurements include:
•
allocation  of  the  purchase  price  paid  to  acquire  businesses  to  the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  those 
acquisitions;
- 61 -

Denbury Resources Inc.(cid:160)
• 
• 
•
assessment of impairment of long-lived assets;
assessment of impairment of goodwill; and
recorded value of commodity derivative instruments.
Acquisitions
Under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated 
to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of 
acquisition.(cid:160)(cid:160)The FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to 
sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (often 
referred to as the "exit price").  A fair value measurement is based on the assumptions of market participants and not those of the 
reporting entity.(cid:160)(cid:160)Therefore, entity-specific intentions do not impact the measurement of fair value unless those assumptions are 
consistent with market participant views.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value (as defined by the FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic) 
of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.(cid:160)(cid:160)A significant amount of judgment is involved 
in estimating the individual fair values involving long-term tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets and long-term asset 
retirement obligations.(cid:160)(cid:160)We use all available information to estimate the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in 
an acquisition and engage a third-party consultant to review certain assumptions utilized in our valuations.
Specifically, the FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic requires us to value oil properties recoverable through 
enhanced oil recovery by estimating the cost a third party market participant would pay for CO2.  A third party's economics and 
access to CO2 is substantially different in our operating regions than our own, as CO2 is limited and there may be no known CO2 
available in a given area except through our own sources.  These factors generally result in our estimation of the cost of CO2 to a 
market  participant  being  higher  than  our  cost.    Because  of  our  strategic  advantage  relating  to  CO2  supply  and  associated 
infrastructure, a third party's economics (the required basis for allocating values) for a potential EOR flood will be less than ours.  
Therefore, we cannot attribute much, if any, of our purchase price relating to the future EOR flood to unevaluated properties, even 
though we may have attributed value to the future flood when we made the purchase decision.  As such, we must attribute the 
unallocated purchase price to goodwill, which has resulted in our recognition of more goodwill than most of our industry peers.
The fair values used to allocate the purchase price of an acquisition are often estimated using the expected present value of 
future cash flows method, which requires us to project related future cash inflows and outflows and apply an appropriate discount 
rate.(cid:160)(cid:160)The estimates used in determining fair values are based on assumptions believed to be reasonable but that are inherently 
uncertain. Accordingly, actual results may differ from the projected results used to determine fair value.
Impairment Assessment of Goodwill
We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances 
change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.(cid:160)(cid:160)The need to test for 
impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of oil or natural gas, a full-cost ceiling 
write-down of oil and natural gas properties, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of 
production, other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level.(cid:160)(cid:160)Denbury applies SEC full cost accounting rules, under which 
the acquisition cost of oil and gas properties is recognized on a cost center basis (country), of which Denbury has only one cost 
center (United States).(cid:160)(cid:160)Goodwill is assigned to this single reporting unit.

Denbury Resources Inc.(cid:160)
In each period that a goodwill impairment test is performed, we have the option to assess qualitative factors to determine if 
it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount.(cid:160)(cid:160)The following events and circumstances 
are certain of the qualitative factors we consider in evaluating whether it is more likely than not the fair value of our reporting unit 
is less than its carrying amount:
•
•  Macroeconomic conditions, such as deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, or
other developments in equity and credit markets;
Industry and market conditions, such as deterioration in the environment in which we operate, including significant 
declines in oil prices, inability to access oil field equipment and/or qualified personnel and regulations impacting the oil 
and natural gas industry, among others;
•  Cost factors, such as increases in power and labor costs;
•  Overall financial performance, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenues or
earnings;
or litigation;
share price.
•  Other relevant Company-specific events, such as material changes in management or key personnel, a change in strategy
•  Material events, such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of our reporting unit’s net assets, including
acquisitions and dispositions; and
•  Consideration of the relationship of our market capitalization to our book value, as well as a sustained decrease in our
If we determine that it is more likely than not that our reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we will 
proceed to step 1 of the 2-step quantitative goodwill assessment, in which we perform a calculation to compare the fair value of 
our reporting unit to its carrying cost.(cid:160)(cid:160)In any given period, we have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed 
directly to step 1 of the 2-step quantitative goodwill impairment test.
Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing for impairment of our goodwill is estimated using the expected present value 
of future cash flows method, and comparative market prices and net asset value when appropriate.  The Company also takes into 
consideration the Company's market capitalization, including a control premium.(cid:160)(cid:160)A significant amount of judgment is involved 
in performing these fair value estimates for goodwill, since the results are based on forecasted assumptions.(cid:160)(cid:160)Significant assumptions 
include projections of future oil and natural gas prices, projections of estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, projections 
of future rates of production, timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projected availability and cost of CO2, 
projected recovery factors of tertiary reserves and risk-adjusted discount rates.(cid:160)(cid:160)We base our fair value estimates on projected 
financial information that we believe to be reasonable.(cid:160)(cid:160)However, actual results may differ from those projections.
We  completed  our  goodwill  impairment  assessment  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2013  and  did  not  record  any  goodwill
impairment during 2013, nor have we recorded a goodwill impairment historically.
Oil and Natural Gas Derivative Contracts
We enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future 
oil and natural gas production.(cid:160)(cid:160)These contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or collars, and 
fixed price swaps.(cid:160)(cid:160)We do not designate these commodity derivative contracts as hedge instruments for accounting purposes under 
the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic.(cid:160)(cid:160)This means that any changes in the fair value of these commodity derivative contracts 
will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the 
balance to earnings.(cid:160)(cid:160)While we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we were to apply hedge accounting 
treatment as permitted by the FASC Derivatives and Hedging topic, we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying 
hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost, time and effort to comply with hedge accounting.

Environmental and Litigation Contingencies
The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for contingencies such as environmental remediation 
or ongoing litigation.  Liabilities are recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is reasonably 
estimable.  Assessments of liabilities are based on information obtained from independent and in-house experts, loss experience 
in similar situations, actual costs incurred, and other case-by-case factors.  Actual costs can vary from such estimates for a variety 
of reasons.  The costs of environmental remediation or litigation can vary from estimates due to new developments regarding the 
facts  and  circumstances  of  each  event,  including  in  the  case  of  environmental  remediation,  the  timing  of  remediation,  our 
understanding  of  the  environmental  impact,  remediation  methods  available,  and  regulatory  requirements,  and  in  the  case  of 
litigation, differing interpretations of laws and facts and assessments of damages asserted and/or incurred.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Denbury Resources Inc.:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the 
financial position of Denbury Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries at December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012, and the results of their operations 
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December(cid:160)31, 2013 in conformity with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America.(cid:160)(cid:160)Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective 
internal control over financial reporting as of December(cid:160)31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated 
Framework (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).(cid:160)(cid:160)The Company's 
management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and 
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements 
and  on  the  Company's  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  based  on  our  integrated  audits.(cid:160)(cid:160)We  conducted  our  audits  in 
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).(cid:160)(cid:160)Those standards require that 
we  plan  and  perform  the  audits  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material 
misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our audits 
of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall 
financial statement presentation.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design 
and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our audits also included performing such other procedures 
as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability 
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles.(cid:160)(cid:160)A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)(cid:160)pertain 
to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets 
of the company; (ii)(cid:160)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are 
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)(cid:160)provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because  of  its  inherent  limitations, internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or  detect  misstatements.(cid:160)(cid:160)Also, 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies
Organization and Nature of Operations
Denbury Resources Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a growing, dividend-paying, domestic oil and natural gas company.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our 
primary focus is on enhanced oil recovery utilizing CO2, and our operations are focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast 
and Rocky Mountain regions.  Our goal is to increase the value of our acquired properties through a combination of exploitation, 
drilling and proven engineering extraction practices, with the most significant emphasis relating to tertiary recovery operations.
Principles of Reporting and Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in  the  United  States  ("GAAP")  and  include  the  accounts  of  Denbury  and  entities  in  which  we  hold  a  controlling  financial 
interest.(cid:160)(cid:160)Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis.(cid:160)(cid:160)All intercompany balances 
and transactions have been eliminated.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
that affect the reported amount of certain assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period.(cid:160)(cid:160)Management believes its 
estimates  and  assumptions  are  reasonable;  however,  such  estimates  and  assumptions  are  subject  to  a  number  of  risks  and 
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates.(cid:160)(cid:160)Significant estimates underlying these financial 
statements include (1) the fair value of financial derivative instruments; (2) the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas 
reserves used to compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties, the related present value of estimated future net cash flows 
therefrom and the ceiling test; (3) the estimated quantities of proved and probable CO2 reserves used to compute depletion of CO2 
properties; (4) accruals related to oil and natural gas sales volumes and revenues, capital expenditures and lease operating expenses; 
(5) the estimated costs and timing of future asset retirement obligations; (6) estimates made in the calculation of income taxes; 
and (7) estimates made in determining the fair values for purchase price allocations, including goodwill.(cid:160)(cid:160)While management is 
not aware of any significant revisions to any of its estimates, there will likely be future revisions to its estimates resulting from 
matters such as revisions in estimated oil and natural gas volumes, changes in ownership interests, payouts, joint venture audits, 
re-allocations by purchasers or pipelines, or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry, many 
of which require retroactive application.(cid:160)(cid:160)These types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated and will be recorded in the 
period in which the adjustment occurs.(cid:160)
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  Such reclassifications had
no impact on our reported net income, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, total liabilities or stockholders' equity.
Cash Equivalents
We consider all highly liquid investments to be cash equivalents if they have maturities of three months or less at the date of
purchase.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash at December(cid:160)31, 2012 consisted of proceeds from the exchange of oil and gas properties with Exxon Mobil 
Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, XTO Energy Inc., (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures) previously held by a 
qualified  intermediary  and  which  were  restricted  for  application  towards  future  acquisitions  to  enable  like-kind-exchange 
transactions for federal income tax purposes, which exchange transactions took place in 2013.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Capitalized Costs.(cid:160)(cid:160)We follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)Under this method, all 
costs related to acquisitions, exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized and accumulated in a 
single cost center representing our activities, which are undertaken exclusively in the United States.(cid:160)(cid:160)Such costs include lease 
acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenditures, lease rentals on undeveloped properties, costs of drilling both productive 
and nonproductive wells, capitalized interest on qualifying projects, and general and administrative expenses directly related to 
exploration and development activities, and do not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or similar 
activities.(cid:160)(cid:160)We assign the purchase price of oil and natural gas properties we acquire to proved and unevaluated properties based 
on  the  estimated  fair  values  as  defined  in  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  Board  Codification  ("FASC")  Fair  Value 
Measurements and Disclosures topic.(cid:160)(cid:160)Proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated costs except when the 
sale represents a significant disposal of reserves, in which case a gain or loss would be recognized.  A disposal of 25% or more 
of our proved reserves would be considered significant.
Depletion and Depreciation.(cid:160)(cid:160)The costs capitalized, including production equipment and future development costs, are 
depleted or depreciated using the unit-of-production method, based on proved oil and natural gas reserves as determined by 
independent petroleum engineers.(cid:160)(cid:160)Oil and natural gas reserves are converted to equivalent units on a basis of 6,000 cubic feet of 
natural gas to one barrel of crude oil.
Under full cost accounting, we may exclude certain unevaluated costs from the amortization base pending determination of 
whether proved reserves can be assigned to such properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)The costs classified as unevaluated are transferred to the full cost 
amortization base as the properties are developed, tested and evaluated.
Ceiling Test.(cid:160)The net capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties are limited to the lower of unamortized cost or the 
cost center ceiling.(cid:160)(cid:160)The cost center ceiling is defined as (1) the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved oil 
and natural gas reserves before future abandonment costs (discounted at 10%), based on the average first-day-of-the-month oil 
and natural gas price for each month during the 12-month period prior to the end of a particular reporting period; plus (2) the cost 
of properties not being amortized; plus (3) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs 
being amortized, if any; less (4) related income tax effects.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves are 
not reduced for development costs related to the cost of drilling for and developing CO2 reserves nor those related to the cost of 
constructing CO2 pipelines, as those costs have previously been incurred by the Company.(cid:160)(cid:160)Therefore, we include in the ceiling 
test, as a reduction of future net revenues, that portion of our capitalized CO2 costs related to CO2 reserves and CO2 pipelines that 
we estimate will be consumed in the process of producing our proved oil and natural gas reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)The fair value of our oil and 
natural gas derivative contracts is not included in the ceiling test, as we do not designate these contracts as hedge instruments for 
accounting purposes.(cid:160)(cid:160)The cost center ceiling test is prepared quarterly.(cid:160)(cid:160)We did not have a ceiling test write-down during the years 
ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, 2012 or 2011.(cid:160)
Joint Interest Operations.(cid:160) Substantially all of our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are conducted 
jointly with others.(cid:160)(cid:160)These financial statements reflect only our proportionate interest in such activities, and any amounts due from 
other partners are included in trade receivables.
(cid:160)
Tertiary Injection Costs.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts 
of oil over many years; however, in accordance with the SEC rules and regulations for recording proved reserves, we cannot 
recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques, such as CO2 injection, until there is a production response 
to the injected CO2, or unless the field is analogous to an existing flood.(cid:160)(cid:160)
We capitalize, as a development cost, injection costs in fields that are in their development stage, which means we have not 
yet seen incremental oil production due to the CO2 injections (i.e., a production response).(cid:160)(cid:160)These capitalized development costs 
are included in our unevaluated property costs if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field.(cid:160)(cid:160)After we see a production 
response to the CO2 injections (i.e., the production stage), injection costs are expensed as incurred, and once proved reserves are 
recognized, previously deferred unevaluated development costs become subject to depletion.

CO2 Properties
Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We own and produce CO2 reserves, a non-hydrocarbon resource, that are used in our tertiary oil recovery operations on our 
own behalf and on behalf of other interest owners in enhanced recovery fields, with a portion sold to third-party industrial users.(cid:160)(cid:160)We 
record revenue from our sales of CO2 to third parties when it is produced and sold.(cid:160)(cid:160)Expenses related to the production of CO2 are 
allocated  between  volumes  sold  to  third  parties  and  volumes  consumed  internally  that  are  directly  related  to  our  tertiary 
production.(cid:160)(cid:160)The expenses related to third-party sales are recorded in "CO2 discovery and operating expenses," and the expenses 
related to internal use are recorded in "Lease operating expenses" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, or are capitalized 
as oil and gas properties in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending on the stage of the tertiary flood that is receiving the CO2 
(see Tertiary Injection Costs above for further discussion).
Costs incurred to search for CO2 are expensed as incurred until proved or probable reserves are established.(cid:160)(cid:160)Once proved or 
probable reserves are established, costs incurred to obtain those reserves are capitalized and classified as "CO2 properties" on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.(cid:160)(cid:160)Capitalized CO2 costs are aggregated by geologic formation and depleted on a unit-of-production 
basis over proved and probable reserves.
During 2010 and 2011, we acquired interests in the Riley Ridge Federal Unit ("Riley Ridge"), which contains helium and 
CO2 reserves (non-hydrocarbon resources) as well as natural gas reserves (a hydrocarbon resource).(cid:160)(cid:160)It is not possible to separately 
identify the capitalized costs related to the development of each product in the commingled gas stream; thus, these costs are 
allocated  to  each  product  based  on  the  relative  future  revenue  value  of  each  product  line  and  classified  accordingly  on  the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The portion of our capitalized CO2 costs related to CO2 reserves and CO2 pipelines that we estimate will be consumed in the 
process of producing our proved oil reserves is included in the ceiling test as a reduction to future net revenues.(cid:160)(cid:160)The remaining 
net capitalized CO2 properties, equipment and pipelines balance is evaluated for impairment by comparing the net carrying costs 
to the expected future net revenues from (1) the production of our probable and possible tertiary oil reserves and (2) the sale of 
CO2 to third-party industrial users.
Pipelines and Plants
CO2 used in our tertiary floods is transported to our fields through CO2 pipelines.(cid:160)(cid:160)Costs of CO2 pipelines under construction 
are not depreciated until the pipelines are placed into service.(cid:160)(cid:160)Pipelines are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated 
useful lives, which range from 15 to 50 years.
Pipelines and plants include the Riley Ridge gas processing facility in southwestern Wyoming.  We placed the Riley Ridge 
gas processing facility in service in the fourth quarter of 2013.  Individual components of the plant are depreciated on a straight-
line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from 20 to 50 years.
Property and Equipment – Other
Other  property  and  equipment,  which  includes  furniture  and  fixtures,  vehicles,  computer  equipment  and  software,  and 
capitalized leases, is depreciated principally on a straight-line basis over each asset's estimated useful life.(cid:160)(cid:160)Vehicles and furniture 
and fixtures are generally depreciated over a useful life of five to ten years, and computer equipment and software are generally 
depreciated over a useful life of three to five years.(cid:160)(cid:160)Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful 
life or the remaining lease term.
Leased property meeting certain capital lease criteria is capitalized, and the present value of the related lease payments is 
recorded as a liability.(cid:160)(cid:160)Amortization of capitalized leased assets is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of 
the estimated useful life or the initial lease term.
Maintenance and repair costs that do not extend the useful life of the property or equipment are charged to expense as incurred.

Asset Retirement Obligations
Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In general, our future asset retirement obligations relate to future costs associated with plugging and abandoning our oil, 
natural gas and CO2 wells, removing equipment and facilities from leased acreage, and returning land to its original condition.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 
fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred, discounted to its present 
value using our credit-adjusted-risk-free interest rate, and a corresponding amount capitalized by increasing the carrying amount 
of the related long-lived asset.(cid:160)(cid:160)The liability is accreted each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of 
the related asset.(cid:160)(cid:160)Revisions to estimated retirement obligations will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and 
corresponding liability.(cid:160)(cid:160)If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded to the 
full cost pool, unless significant.
Asset retirement obligations are estimated at the present value of expected future net cash flows and are discounted using our 
credit-adjusted-risk-free rate.(cid:160)(cid:160)We utilize unobservable inputs in the estimation of asset retirement obligations that include, but are 
not limited to, costs of labor and materials, profits on costs of labor and materials, the effect of inflation on estimated costs, and 
the discount rate.(cid:160)(cid:160)Accordingly, asset retirement obligations are considered a Level 3 measurement under the FASC Fair Value 
Measurements and Disclosures topic.
Commodity Derivative Contracts
We utilize oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with our future 
oil and natural gas production.(cid:160)(cid:160)These derivative contracts have historically consisted of options, in the form of price floors or 
collars, and fixed price swaps.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability 
measured at fair value.(cid:160)(cid:160)We do not apply hedge accounting to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts; accordingly, the changes 
in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of change.
Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk and Concentrations of Credit Risk
Our financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade and 
accrued production receivables, and the derivative instruments discussed above.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our cash equivalents represent high-quality 
securities placed with various investment-grade institutions.(cid:160)(cid:160)This investment practice limits our exposure to concentrations of 
credit risk.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our trade and accrued production receivables are dispersed among various customers and purchasers; therefore, 
concentrations of credit risk are limited.(cid:160)(cid:160)We evaluate the credit ratings of our purchasers, and if customers are considered a credit 
risk, letters of credit are the primary security obtained to support lines of credit.(cid:160)(cid:160)We attempt to minimize our credit risk exposure 
to the counterparties of our oil and natural gas derivative contracts through formal credit policies, monitoring procedures and 
diversification.(cid:160)(cid:160)All of our derivative contracts are with banks, which are part of the syndicate of banks in our bank credit facility, 
or with their affiliates.(cid:160)(cid:160)There are no margin requirements with the counterparties of our derivative contracts.
Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired in the acquisition 
of a business.  Goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and when events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill has been reduced 
below  its  carrying  value.    The  impairment  test  requires  allocating  goodwill  and  other  assets  and  liabilities  to  reporting 
units.(cid:160)(cid:160)However, we have only one reporting unit.(cid:160)(cid:160)To assess impairment, we have the option to qualitatively assess if it is more 
likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value.(cid:160)(cid:160)Absent a qualitative assessment, or, through 
the qualitative assessment, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying 
value, a quantitative assessment is prepared to calculate the fair market value of the reporting unit.(cid:160)(cid:160)If it is determined that the fair 
value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the recorded goodwill is impaired to its implied fair value with a charge 
to operating expense.(cid:160)(cid:160)We completed our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of 2013 and did not 
record any goodwill impairment during 2013, nor have we recorded a goodwill impairment historically.

Our intangible assets subject to amortization primarily consist of amounts assigned in purchase accounting to helium production 
rights at the Riley Ridge Federal Unit in Wyoming and a CO2 purchase contract with ConocoPhillips to offtake CO2 from the Lost 
Cabin gas plant in Wyoming.  We amortize our helium production rights on a unit-of-production basis over estimated helium 
reserves and amortize the CO2 contract intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the contract term.  Total amortization expense 
related to these assets was $1.3 million during the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013.  The following table summarizes the intangible

The recoverability of the carrying amount of intangible assets is assessed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable.  An impairment loss would be assessed when estimated 
undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
group.  Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.  
Fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals, as appropriate.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue Recognition.  Revenue is recognized at the time oil and natural gas is produced and sold.(cid:160)(cid:160)Any amounts due from
purchasers of oil and natural gas are included in accrued production receivable.

Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
We follow the sales method of accounting for our oil and natural gas revenue, whereby we recognize revenue on all oil or 
natural gas sold to our purchasers regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property.(cid:160)(cid:160)A receivable 
or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining 
proved reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012, our aggregate oil and natural gas imbalances were not material to our 
consolidated financial statements.
We recognize revenue and expenses of purchased producing properties at the time we assume effective control, commencing 
from either the closing or purchase agreement date, depending on the underlying terms and agreements.(cid:160)(cid:160)We follow the same 
methodology in reverse when we sell properties by recognizing revenue and expenses of the sold properties until the closing date.
Significant Oil and Natural Gas Purchasers.  Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term 
contracts at the current area market price.(cid:160)(cid:160)We do not expect that the loss of any purchaser would have a material adverse effect 
upon our operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)For the year ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural 
gas revenues: Marathon Petroleum Company (33%), Plains Marketing LP (15%), and Eighty-Eight Oil LLC (10%).  For the years 
ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Marathon 
Petroleum Company (39% and 43% in 2012 and 2011, respectively) and Plains Marketing LP (17% and 16% in 2012 and 2011, 
respectively).
Income Taxes
Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized for 
the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets 
and liabilities using the enacted statutory tax rates in effect at year end.(cid:160)(cid:160)The effect on deferred taxes for a change in tax rates is 
recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.(cid:160)(cid:160)A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded 
when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be 
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.(cid:160)(cid:160)The tax benefits recognized 
in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood 
of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
Net Income Per Common Share
Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing the net income attributable to common stockholders by the 
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.(cid:160)(cid:160)Diluted net income per common share is 
calculated in the same manner, but includes the impact of potentially dilutive securities.  Potentially dilutive securities consist of 
stock options, stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), nonvested restricted stock and nonvested performance equity awards.  For each 
of the three years in the period ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, there were no adjustments to net income for purposes of calculating 
basic and diluted net income per common share.

Basic weighted average common shares excludes shares of nonvested restricted stock.  As these restricted shares vest, they 
will be included in the shares outstanding used to calculate basic net income per common share (although all restricted stock is 
issued and outstanding upon grant). (cid:160)For purposes of calculating diluted weighted average common shares, the nonvested restricted 
stock is included in the computation using the treasury stock method, with the deemed proceeds equal to the average unrecognized 
compensation during the period, adjusted for any estimated future tax consequences recognized directly in equity.  Stock options 
and SARs of 3.6 million, 4.1 million and 5.0 million shares for the years ended December(cid:160)31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, 
were not included in the computation of diluted net income per share as their effect would have been antidilutive.
Environmental and Litigation Contingencies
The Company makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for contingencies such as environmental remediation 
or ongoing litigation.(cid:160) Liabilities are recorded when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is reasonably 
estimable.(cid:160) Assessments of liabilities are based on information obtained from independent and in-house experts, loss experience 
in similar situations, actual costs incurred, and other case-by-case factors.(cid:160) Any related insurance recoveries are recognized in our 
financial statements during the period received or at the time receipt is determined to be virtually certain.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Balance Sheet-Offsetting Assets and Liabilities.(cid:160)(cid:160)In December(cid:160)2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") 
issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2011-11, Disclosure about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ("ASU 2011-11").(cid:160)(cid:160)ASU 
2011-11 requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements 
to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position.(cid:160)(cid:160)In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-01, Clarifying 
the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ("ASU 2013-01").  The update clarifies that the scope of ASU 
2011-11 applies to derivatives accounted for in accordance with the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASC, including bifurcated 
embedded derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending 
transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement.  ASU 2011-11 and 
ASU 2013-01 became effective for our fiscal year beginning January(cid:160)1, 2013, and have been applied retrospectively for all 
comparative  periods  presented.(cid:160)(cid:160)The  adoption  of ASU  2011-11  and ASU  2013-01  did  not  affect  our  consolidated  financial 
statements, but required additional disclosures in the notes thereto.
Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Fair Value
The FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (often referred 
to as the "exit price").  The fair value measurement is based on the assumptions of market participants and not those of the reporting 
entity.  Therefore, entity-specific intentions do not impact the measurement of fair value unless those assumptions are consistent 
with market participant views.
The fair value of oil and natural gas properties is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which the FASC 
Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic defines as Level 3 inputs.(cid:160)(cid:160)Key assumptions may include (1)(cid:160)NYMEX oil and 
natural gas futures (this input is observable); (2) dollar-per-acre values of recent sale transactions (this input is observable); (3) 
projections of the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves, including those classified as proved, probable and possible; 
(4) estimated oil and natural gas pricing differentials; (5) projections of future rates of production; (6) timing and amount of future 
development and operating costs; (7) projected costs of CO2 (to a market participant); (8) projected reserve recovery factors; and 
(9) risk-adjusted discount rates.
2013 Acquisition
Cedar Creek Anticline Acquisition.  In January 2013, we entered into an agreement to acquire producing assets in the Cedar 
Creek  Anticline  ("CCA")  of  Montana  and  North  Dakota  from  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  ConocoPhillips  Company 
("ConocoPhillips") for $1.05 billion ($1.0 billion after final closing adjustments primarily for revenues and costs of the purchased

properties from the January 1, 2013 effective date to the closing date).  We closed the acquisition on March 27, 2013, funding the 
purchase price with a portion of the cash proceeds from the Bakken Exchange Transaction (described below).  This acquisition 
meets the definition of a business under the FASC Business Combinations topic.  Accordingly, we estimated the fair value of assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed as of the closing date of the acquisition, using a discounted future net cash flow model.
We finalized our estimate of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during 2013, after consideration of final 
closing adjustments, evaluation of oil and natural gas properties, other assets and related asset retirement obligations.  The following 
table presents a summary of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the CCA acquisition:

Bakken Exchange Transaction.  In late 2012, we closed a sale and exchange transaction (the "Bakken Exchange Transaction") 
with Exxon Mobil Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary XTO Energy Inc. (collectively, "ExxonMobil") in which we sold 
to ExxonMobil our Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for (1) $1.3 billion in cash (after closing 
adjustments), (2) ExxonMobil's operating interests in Webster Field in Texas and Hartzog Draw Field in Wyoming, and (3) 
approximately a one-third overriding royalty ownership interest in ExxonMobil's CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in Wyoming.

Thompson Field Acquisition.  In June 2012, we acquired a nearly 100% working interest and 84.7% net revenue interest in 
Thompson Field for $366.2 million after closing adjustments.  The field is located in close proximity to Hastings Field (an enhanced 
oil recovery field that we are currently flooding with CO2), which is the current terminus of the Green Pipeline, which transports 
CO2 both from the Jackson Dome area near Jackson, Mississippi, and from various anthropogenic sources along the route of the 
pipeline.  Thompson Field is similar to Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths, and is also a planned 
future tertiary field.  Under the terms of the Thompson Field acquisition agreement, the seller will retain approximately a 5% gross 
revenue interest (less severance taxes) once average monthly oil production exceeds 3,000 Bbls/d after the initiation of CO2 
injection.

Our 2013 property acquisition costs were primarily related to the fair value allocated to the purchase of additional interests 
in the CCA.  Our 2012 property acquisition costs were primarily related to the fair value allocated to our Hartzog Draw and 
Thompson fields.(cid:160)(cid:160)Property acquisition costs for 2010 and prior were primarily related to the fair value allocated to CO2 tertiary 
potential at our Cedar Creek Anticline properties, acquired as part of the merger with Encore Acquisition Company ("Encore"),

as well as CO2 tertiary potential at Conroe Field.  Exploration and development costs shown as unevaluated properties are primarily 
associated with our(cid:160)tertiary oil fields that are under development but did not have proved reserves at December(cid:160)31, 2013.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 
most significant development costs incurred during 2013, 2012 and 2011 relate to development in preparation for the CO2 flood 
at Grieve field, which began in 2013.  We have not yet recognized proved reserves in this field.
During 2013, we established proved reserves at Bell Creek Field and, as a result, transferred $417.6 million of costs incurred 
on these projects into the amortization base.  Costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as projects are 
evaluated and proved reserves established or impairment determined.(cid:160)(cid:160)We review the excluded properties for impairment at least 
annually.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently estimate that evaluation of most of these properties and the inclusion of their costs in the amortization base 
is expected to be completed within five to ten years.(cid:160) Until we are able to determine whether there are any proved reserves attributable 
to the above costs, we are not able to assess the future impact on the amortization rate of the full cost pool.

$1.6 Billion Revolving Credit Agreement
In March 2010, we entered into a $1.6 billion revolving credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPMorgan"), 
as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto (as amended, the "Bank Credit Agreement").(cid:160)(cid:160)Availability under the Bank 
Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base, which is redetermined semi-annually on or prior to May 1 and November 1 of 
each year, and additionally upon requested special redeterminations.(cid:160)(cid:160)The borrowing base is adjusted at the lenders' discretion and 
is based in part upon external factors over which we have no control (including approval by the lenders party to the Bank Credit 
Agreement).(cid:160)(cid:160)If our outstanding credit under the Bank Credit Agreement exceeds the then effective borrowing base, we would be 
required to repay the excess amount over a period not to exceed four months.(cid:160)(cid:160)As part of the semi-annual review completed in 
October 2013 pursuant to the terms of the Bank Credit Agreement, our borrowing base was reaffirmed at $1.6 billion effective 
November 1, 2013, with approval by all of the lenders.(cid:160)(cid:160)The weighted average interest rate(cid:160)on borrowings outstanding as of 
December(cid:160)31, 2013 under the Bank Credit Agreement was 1.9%.  Loans under the Bank Credit Agreement mature in May 2016.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
The Bank Credit Agreement is secured by substantially all of the proved oil and natural gas properties of DRI's restricted 
subsidiaries (which does not include minor subsidiaries) and by the equity interests of such restricted subsidiaries.(cid:160)(cid:160)In addition, 
our obligations under the Bank Credit Agreement are guaranteed jointly and severally by DRI's restricted subsidiaries.
The Bank Credit Agreement contains several restrictive covenants including, among others:
• 
•
• 
•
a requirement to maintain a current ratio, as determined under the Bank Credit Agreement, of not less than 1.0 to 1.0;
a requirement to maintain a maximum permitted ratio of consolidated total debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in 
the Bank Credit Agreement) of DRI and its restricted subsidiaries of not more than 4.25 to 1.0;
a prohibition against incurring debt, subject to permitted exceptions; and
a limitation on the aggregate amount of forecasted oil and natural gas production that can be economically hedged with 
oil or natural gas derivative contracts.
Under the Bank Credit Agreement, we are permitted to make unlimited distributions in the form of repurchases of Denbury 
common stock and payments of cash dividends on Denbury common stock, provided that (1) prior to and after making any such 
distribution (a) no default or borrowing base deficiency exists, and (b) we are in compliance with the first two financial covenants 
described immediately above (calculated on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the making of any such distribution), and (2) 
we have minimum availability of at least 10% of our borrowing base on the date such distribution is made.
Loans under the Bank Credit Agreement are subject to varying rates of interest based on (1)(cid:160)the total outstanding credit in 
relation to the borrowing base and (2)(cid:160)whether the loan is a Eurodollar loan or a base rate loan.(cid:160)(cid:160)Eurodollar loans bear interest at 
the Adjusted Eurodollar Rate (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin in a range from 1.5% to 2.5% 
based on the ratio of outstanding credit to the borrowing base, and base rate loans bear interest at the Base Rate (as defined in the 
Bank Credit Agreement) plus the applicable margin in a range from 0.5% to 1.5% based on the ratio of outstanding credit to the 
borrowing base.(cid:160)(cid:160)The "Eurodollar rate" for any interest period (either one, two, three, six, and, if available to all lenders, nine or 
twelve months, as selected by us) is the rate per year equal to LIBOR, as published by Reuters or another source designated by 
JPMorgan, for deposits in dollars for a similar interest period.(cid:160)(cid:160)The "base rate" is calculated as the highest of (1)(cid:160)the annual rate 
of interest announced by JPMorgan as its "prime rate," (2)(cid:160)the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, and (3)(cid:160)the Adjusted Eurodollar 
Rate (as defined in the Bank Credit Agreement) for a one-month interest period plus 1.0%.(cid:160)(cid:160)We incur a commitment fee of either 
0.375% or 0.5%, based on the ratio of outstanding credit to the borrowing base, on the unused availability under the Bank Credit 
Agreement.
Senior Subordinated Notes
Repurchase and Redemption of 9½% Notes and 9¾% Notes.  In January 2013, we commenced cash tender offers to 
purchase the outstanding $426.4 million principal amount of our 9¾% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the "9¾% Notes") 
at 105.425% of par and the outstanding $224.9 million principal amount of our 9½% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2016 (the 
"9½% Notes") at 106.869% of par.  During February 2013, we accepted for purchase $191.7 million principal amount of the 
outstanding 9¾% Notes and $186.7 million principal amount of the outstanding 9½% Notes.  The purchases under these tender 
offers were funded by a portion of the proceeds received in February 2013 from the issuance of our 4 5/8% Senior Subordinated 
Notes due 2023 (the "2023 Notes").  In March 2013, we repurchased all of the remaining $234.7 million principal amount outstanding 
of our 9¾% Notes at 104.875% of par.  In May 2013, we repurchased all of the remaining $38.2 million principal amount outstanding 
of our 9½% Notes at 104.75% of par.
We recognized a loss associated with the debt repurchases of $44.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, consisting 
of both premium payments made to repurchase or redeem the 9¾% Notes and 9½% Notes and the elimination of unamortized 
debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums related to these notes.  The loss is included in our Consolidated Statement of Operations 
under the caption "Loss on early extinguishment of debt".

6 3/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021.  In February 2011, we issued $400 million of 6 3/8% Senior Subordinated 
Notes due 2021 ("2021 Notes").(cid:160)(cid:160)The 2021 Notes, which carry a coupon rate of 6.375%, were sold at par.(cid:160)(cid:160)The net proceeds of

interest.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 2021 Notes are not subject to any sinking fund requirements.
4 5/8% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2023.  In February 2013, we issued $1.2 billion of 2023 Notes.  The 2023 Notes, 
which carry a coupon rate of 4.625%, were sold at par.  The net proceeds, after issuance costs, of $1.18 billion were used to 
repurchase or redeem our 9½% Notes and 9¾% Notes (see Repurchase and Redemption of 9½% Notes and 9¾% Notes above) 
and to pay down a portion of outstanding borrowings under our Bank Credit Agreement.
The 2023 Notes mature on July(cid:160)15, 2023, and interest is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 
15, 2013.  We may redeem the 2023 Notes in whole or in part at our option beginning January 15, 2018, at a redemption price of 
102.313% of the principal amount, and at declining redemption prices thereafter, as specified in the indenture.  Prior to January(cid:160)15, 
2016, we may at our option redeem up to an aggregate of 35% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price of 
104.625% of par with the proceeds of certain equity offerings.  In addition, at any time prior to January(cid:160)15, 2018, we may redeem 
100% of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a "make-whole" 
premium and accrued and unpaid interest.
Restrictive Covenants in Indentures for Senior Subordinated Notes.  Each of the indentures for the 2020 Notes, 2021 
Notes and 2023 Notes contains certain covenants which are generally consistent and which restrict our ability and the ability of 
our restricted subsidiaries to take or permit certain actions, including restrictions on our ability and the ability of our restricted 
subsidiaries to (1) incur additional debt; (2) make investments; (3) create liens on our assets or the assets of our restricted subsidiaries; 
(4) create restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to DRI or other restricted 
subsidiaries; (5) engage in transactions with our affiliates; (6) transfer or sell assets or subsidiary stock; (7) consolidate, merge or 
transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries; and (8) make restricted payments (which 
includes paying dividends on our common stock or redeeming, repurchasing or retiring such stock or subordinated debt), provided 
that the restricted payments covenant in the indenture for the 2023 Notes (the "2023 Indenture") permits us in certain circumstances 
to make unlimited restricted payments so long as we maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (both as defined in the 2023 Indenture) 
of at least 2.5 to 1 (both before and after giving effect to any restricted payment), although we will not be able to realize the practical 
benefit of the restricted payment covenant flexibility in the 2023 Indenture until the 2020 Notes and 2021 Notes have been redeemed 
or retired.

amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of each related facility.(cid:160)(cid:160)Remaining unamortized 
debt issuance costs were $58.9 million and $56.5 million at December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(cid:160)(cid:160)These balances are included 
in "Other assets" in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
For federal income tax purposes, we structured the 2012 divestitures of our Bakken area assets and certain non-core assets 
as like-kind-exchange transactions for interests acquired in Thompson, Webster, Hartzog Draw and LaBarge fields in 2012 and 
the CCA Acquisition in 2013 (see Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures), thereby deferring the majority of the taxable gain on 
those divestitures.  The increase in current taxes during 2012 is primarily due to the taxable gain recognized in the Bakken Exchange 
Transaction that we were unable to defer through a like-kind-exchange transaction.
At December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had tax-effected federal net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") totaling $20.2 million, state 
NOLs totaling $41.4 million, an estimated $15.0 million of enhanced oil recovery credits to carry forward related to our tertiary 
operations, and $34.8 million of alternative minimum tax credits.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our state NOLs expire in various years, starting in 2018, although 
most do not begin to expire until 2024.  Our enhanced oil recovery credits will begin to expire in 2025.
At December(cid:160)31, 2013, we had $13.0 million of excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation that was not recorded 
as an increase to additional paid-in capital in the period that the stock award vested and/or was exercised.  At the time these excess 
tax benefits reduce current taxes payable and thus, are deemed to be realized by the Company, a corresponding increase to additional 
paid-in capital will be recognized.
Deferred income taxes reflect the available tax carryforwards and the temporary differences based on tax laws and statutory 
rates in effect at the December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012 balance sheet dates.(cid:160)(cid:160)We believe that we will be able to realize all of our deferred 
tax assets at December(cid:160)31, 2013, and therefore, have provided no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets.
Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012 are as follows:

Stock Repurchase Program
In October 2011, we commenced a common share repurchase program for up to $500 million of Denbury common shares, as 
approved by the Company's Board of Directors.(cid:160)(cid:160)During 2012 and 2013, the Board of Directors increased the dollar amount of 
Denbury common shares that could be purchased under the program to an aggregate of $1.162 billion.  The program has no pre-
established ending date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.(cid:160)(cid:160)We are not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount 
or specific number of shares of our common stock under the program.(cid:160)(cid:160)The following table presents a summary of repurchases

equity.  See Note 14, Subsequent Events, for additional information.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
We have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan that is authorized to issue up to 11,900,000 shares of common stock.(cid:160)(cid:160)As of 
December(cid:160)31, 2013, there were 1,601,230 authorized shares remaining to be issued under the plan.(cid:160)(cid:160)In accordance with the plan, 
eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of their base salary, and we match 75% of their contribution.(cid:160)(cid:160)The combined funds 
are used to purchase previously unissued Denbury common stock or treasury stock that we purchased in the open market for that 
purpose, in either case, based on the market value of our common stock at the end of each quarter.(cid:160)(cid:160)We recognize compensation 
expense for the 75% Company match portion, which totaled $6.5 million, $5.7 million and $4.8 million for the years ended 
December(cid:160)31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.(cid:160)(cid:160)This plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of 
Directors.

Note 8. Stock Compensation Plans
Stock Incentive Plans
We have two stock compensation plans.(cid:160)(cid:160)The first plan (providing only for the issuance of stock options) has been in existence 
since 1995 (the "1995 Plan") and expired in August 2005 (although options granted under the 1995 Plan prior to that time can 
remain outstanding for up to 10 years).(cid:160)(cid:160)The second plan, the 2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan"), was 
approved by the stockholders in May 2004 and will expire in May 2024.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 2004 Plan provides for the issuance of incentive 
and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, SARs settled in stock, and performance awards 
that may be issued to officers, employees, directors and consultants.(cid:160)(cid:160)Awards covering a total of 34.5 million shares of common 
stock have been authorized for issuance pursuant to the 2004 Plan, of which awards covering no more than 27.2 million shares 
may be issued in the form of restricted stock or performance-vesting awards.(cid:160)(cid:160)At December(cid:160)31, 2013, 10.8 million shares were 
available under the 2004 Plan for future issuance of awards, all of which could be issued in the form of restricted stock or performance 
vesting awards.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our incentive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.
Prior to January 1, 2006, we granted incentive and non-qualified stock options to our employees.(cid:160)(cid:160)Effective January 1, 2006, 
we completely replaced the use of stock options for employees with SARs settled in stock, as SARs are less dilutive to our 
stockholders while providing an employee with essentially the same economic benefits as stock options.(cid:160)(cid:160)The stock options and 
SARs generally become exercisable over a three- or four-year vesting period, with the specific terms of vesting determined at the 
time of grant based on guidelines established by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.(cid:160)(cid:160)The stock options and 
SARs expire over terms not to exceed 10 years from the date of grant, 90 days after termination of employment, 90 days or one 
year after permanent disability, depending on the plan, or one year after the death of the optionee.(cid:160)(cid:160)The stock options and SARs 
are granted at the fair market value at the time of grant, which is defined in the 2004 Plan as the closing price on the NYSE on the 
date of grant.
Holders of restricted stock awards have the rights and privileges of owning the shares (including voting rights) except that 
the holders are not entitled to delivery of a portion thereof until certain requirements are met.(cid:160)(cid:160)Beginning in 2014, restricted stock 
awards granted by the Company provide the holders with forfeitable dividend rights until the award vests.  Restricted stock awards 
vest over three-to-four-year vesting periods, with the specific terms of vesting determined at the time of grant.
Annually, the Board of Directors grants performance-based equity awards to officers of Denbury.(cid:160)(cid:160)These performance-based 
awards generally vest over 1.25 to 3.25 years and the number of performance-based shares earned (and eligible to vest) during the 
performance period will depend upon two sets of factors: (1) our level of success in achieving specifically identified performance 
targets ("Performance-based Operational Awards") and (2) performance of our stock relative to that of a designated peer group 
("Performance-based TSR Awards").(cid:160)(cid:160)Generally,  one-half  of  the  maximum  number  of  shares  that  could  be  earned  under  the 
performance-based awards will be earned for performance at the designated target levels (100% target vesting levels) or upon any 
earlier change of control, and twice the number of shares will be earned if the maximum target levels are met.(cid:160)(cid:160)If performance is 
below the designated minimum levels for all performance targets, no performance-based shares will be earned.(cid:160)(cid:160)Performance-
based Operational Awards are valued using the fair market value of Denbury stock on the grant date, and Performance-based TSR 
Awards are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation.
Stock-based compensation expense associated with our field employees is included in "Lease operating expense," while such 
expense associated with non-field employees is included in "General and administrative expenses" in the Consolidated Statements 
of  Operations.(cid:160)(cid:160)Stock-based  compensation  associated  with  our  employees  involved  in  exploration  and  drilling  activities  is 
capitalized as part of "Oil and natural gas properties" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The fair value of each SAR award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the 
assumptions noted in the following table.(cid:160)(cid:160)The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the 
U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.(cid:160)(cid:160)The expected life of stock options and SARs granted was derived from 
examination of our historical option grants and subsequent exercises.(cid:160)(cid:160)The contractual terms (cliff vesting and graded vesting) are 
evaluated separately for the expected life, as the exercise behavior for each is different.(cid:160)(cid:160)Expected volatilities are based on the 
historical volatility of our common stock.(cid:160)(cid:160)Implied volatility was not used in this analysis, as our tradable call option terms are 
short and the trading volume is low.

Note 9. Commodity Derivative Contracts
We do not apply hedge accounting treatment to our oil and natural gas derivative contracts; therefore, the changes in the fair 
values of these instruments are recognized in income in the period of change.(cid:160)(cid:160)These fair value changes, along with the cash 
settlements of expired contracts, are shown under "Commodity derivatives expense (income)" in our Consolidated Statements of 
Operations.
From time to time, we enter into various oil and natural gas derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure 
to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future oil and natural gas production.(cid:160)(cid:160)We do not hold or issue derivative 
financial instruments for trading purposes.(cid:160)(cid:160)These contracts have consisted of price floors, collars and fixed price swaps.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 
production that we hedge has varied from year to year depending on our levels of debt and financial strength and expectation of 
future commodity prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)We currently employ a strategy to hedge a portion of our forecasted production approximately 18 months 
to two years in the future from the current quarter, as we believe it is important to protect our future cash flow to provide a level 
of assurance for our capital spending in those future periods in light of current worldwide economic uncertainties and commodity 
price volatility.
We manage and control market and counterparty credit risk through established internal control procedures that are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis.  We attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to counterparties through formal credit policies, monitoring 
procedures, and diversification, and all of our commodity derivative contracts are with parties that are lenders under our Bank 
Credit Agreement.  As of December 31, 2013, all of our outstanding derivative contracts were subject to enforceable master netting 
arrangements whereby payables on those contracts can be offset against receivables from separate derivative contracts with the 
same counterparty.  It is our policy to classify derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on our balance sheets, even if the 
contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements.

Note 10. Fair Value Measurements
The FASC Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an 
asset or would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit 
price).(cid:160)(cid:160)We  utilize  market  data  or  assumptions  that  market  participants  would  use  in  pricing  the  asset  or  liability,  including 
assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.(cid:160)(cid:160)These inputs can be readily observable, 
market corroborated or generally unobservable.(cid:160)(cid:160)We primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements 
and endeavor to utilize the best available information.(cid:160)(cid:160)Accordingly, we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of 
observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.(cid:160)(cid:160)We are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability 
of those inputs.(cid:160)(cid:160)The FASC establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.(cid:160)(cid:160)The hierarchy 
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) 
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).(cid:160)(cid:160)The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
•  Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
•  Level 2 — Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or 
indirectly observable as of the reported date.(cid:160)(cid:160)Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models 
or  other  valuation  methodologies.(cid:160)(cid:160)Instruments  in  this  category  include  non-exchange-traded  oil  and  natural  gas 
derivatives that are based on NYMEX pricing.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our swap contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model based 
upon forward commodity price curves.  Our costless collars are valued using the Black-Scholes model, an industry 
standard option valuation model that takes into account inputs such as contractual prices for the underlying instruments, 
including maturity, quoted forward prices for commodities, interest rates, volatility factors and credit worthiness, as well 
as other relevant economic measures.(cid:160)(cid:160)Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout

the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which 
transactions are executed in the marketplace.
•  Level 3 — Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources.(cid:160)(cid:160)These 
inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.(cid:160) At 
December 31, 2013, instruments in this category include non-exchange-traded oil collars that are based on regional pricing 
other than NYMEX (i.e., Louisiana Light Sweet).  Our costless collars are valued using the Black-Scholes model, which 
is described above.  We obtain and ensure the appropriateness of the significant inputs to the calculation, including 
contractual prices for the underlying instruments, maturity, forward prices for commodities, interest rates, volatility factors 
and credit worthiness, and the fair value estimate is prepared and reviewed on a quarterly basis.  Implied volatilities 
utilized in the valuation of Level 3 instruments are developed using a benchmark, which is considered a significant 
unobservable input.  A one percent increase or decrease in implied volatility would result in a change of approximately 
$0.1 million in the fair value of these instruments as of December 31, 2013.
We adjust the valuations from the valuation model for nonperformance risk, using our estimate of the counterparty’s credit 
quality for asset positions and our credit quality for liability positions.(cid:160)(cid:160)We use multiple sources of third-party credit data in 
determining counterparty nonperformance risk, including credit default swaps.
The following table sets forth by level within the fair value hierarchy our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted
for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012:

Since we do not use hedge accounting for our commodity derivative contracts, any gains and losses on our assets and liabilities
are included in "Commodity derivatives expense (income)" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
During 2012, we recorded a $15.1 million impairment charge for an investment in the preferred stock of an entity that was 
created to develop a gasification plant (in which we would offtake its CO2 to use in our tertiary oil operations) as a result of this 
project not moving forward.  This charge is classified as "Impairment of assets" in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for 
the year ended December 31, 2012.
Other Fair Value Measurements
The carrying value of our revolving bank credit facility approximates fair value, as it is subject to short-term floating interest 
rates that approximate the rates available to us for those periods.(cid:160)(cid:160)We use a market approach to determine fair value of our fixed-
rate debt using observable market data.  The fair values of our senior subordinated notes are based on quoted market prices.(cid:160)(cid:160)The 
estimated fair value of our total long-term debt as of December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012, excluding pipeline financing and capital lease 
obligations, is $2,956.8 million and $2,956.9 million, respectively.(cid:160)(cid:160)We have other financial instruments consisting primarily of 
cash, cash equivalents, short-term receivables and payables that approximate fair value due to the nature of the instrument and the 
relatively short maturities.

We have entered into long-term commitments to purchase CO2(cid:160)that are either non-cancelable or cancelable only upon the 
occurrence of specified future events.(cid:160)(cid:160)The commitments continue for up to 20 years.(cid:160)(cid:160)The price we will pay for CO2 generally 
varies depending on the amount of CO2 delivered and the price of oil.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our annual commitment under these contracts could range 
from $100 million to $170 million per year, assuming a $90 per Bbl NYMEX oil price.
We are party to long-term contracts that require us to deliver CO2 to our industrial CO2 customers at various contracted prices, 
plus we have a CO2 delivery obligation to Genesis related to three CO2 volumetric production payments ("VPPs").  Based upon 
the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the VPPs, we estimate that we may be obligated to 
deliver up to 367 Bcf of CO2 to these customers over the next 15 years.  The maximum volume required in any given year is 
approximately 119 MMcf/d, which we judge to be minor given the size of our Jackson Dome proven CO2 reserves at December(cid:160)31, 
2013, our current production capabilities and our projected levels of CO2 usage for our own tertiary flooding program.
In conjunction with the August(cid:160)2011 Riley Ridge acquisition, we assumed the 20-year helium supply contract under which 
the original participants in Riley Ridge agreed to supply helium to a third-party purchaser.(cid:160)(cid:160)After the commencement date, the 
contract provides for the delivery of a minimum contracted quantity of helium, subject to adjustment after start-up of the Riley 
Ridge gas processing facility, which, if not supplied in accordance with the terms of the contract, may obligate us to compensate 
the third-party helium purchaser for the amount of the shortfall in an amount not to exceed $8.0 million per year, or $46.0 million 
over the term of the contract.

Delhi Field Release
Denbury Resources Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
In June 2013, a release of well fluids, consisting of a mixture of carbon dioxide, saltwater, natural gas and oil, was discovered 
and reported within an area of the Denbury-operated Delhi Field located in northern Louisiana.(cid:160) Denbury immediately took remedial 
action to stop the release and contain and recover well fluids in the affected area.  We have determined that the release originated 
from one or more wells in the affected area of the field that we believed had been previously and properly plugged and abandoned 
by a prior operator of the field.  We completed our remediation efforts during the fourth quarter of 2013; however, we will continue 
to monitor the area to ensure the remediation efforts were successful.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded $114.0 million of lease operating expenses related to this release in 
our Consolidated Statement of Operations, and as of December 31, 2013, we had a corresponding $22.0 million liability classified 
as "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities" in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.  These expenses represent our current estimate 
of the costs related to this release, including remediation costs, based on actual costs incurred through December 31, 2013 of 
approximately $92.0 million, plus the Company's estimate of future costs related to the satisfaction of known claims and liabilities.  
Due to the possibility of new claims being asserted in the future in connection with the release, as well as variability in the estimated 
cost to continue to monitor the area to ensure the remediation efforts were successful, we cannot reliably estimate at this time the 
full extent of the costs that may ultimately be incurred by the Company related to this release.  Although the Company maintains 
insurance policies that we believe cover certain of the costs, damages and claims related to the release, and we currently and 
preliminarily estimate that one-third to two-thirds of our current cost estimate may be recoverable under such insurance policies, 
we have not reached any agreement with our insurance carriers as to recoverable amounts, and accordingly have not recognized 
any insurance recoveries in our financial statements as of December 31, 2013.  Insurance recoveries will be recognized in our 
financial statements during the period received or at the time receipt is determined to be virtually certain.
Litigation
We are involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to our businesses.(cid:160)(cid:160)While we currently 
believe that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect 
on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations or cash flows, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties.(cid:160)(cid:160)If 
an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our net income in the period in 
which the ruling occurs.(cid:160)(cid:160)We provide accruals for litigation and claims if we determine that a loss is probable and the amount can 
be reasonably estimated.
Other Contingencies
We are subject to audits in the various states in which we operate for sales and use taxes and severance taxes, and from time 
to time receive assessments for potential taxes that we may owe.(cid:160) In the past, settlement of these matters has not had a material 
adverse financial impact on us, and currently we have no material assessments for potential taxes.
We are subject to various possible contingencies that arise primarily from interpretation of federal and state laws and regulations 
affecting the oil and natural gas industry.(cid:160)(cid:160)Such contingencies include differing interpretations as to the prices at which oil and 
natural gas sales may be made, the prices at which royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases, environmental 
issues and other matters.(cid:160)(cid:160)Although we believe that we have complied with the various laws and regulations, administrative rulings 
and interpretations thereof, adjustments could be required as new interpretations and regulations are issued.(cid:160)(cid:160)In addition, production 
rates, marketing and environmental matters are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies.
Note 12. Additional Balance Sheet Details
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
We record an allowance for doubtful accounts for receivables that we determine to be uncollectible based on the specific 
identification basis.  The allowance for doubtful accounts, which is netted against "Trade and other receivables" on the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets, was $0.3 million at December(cid:160)31, 2013 and 2012.

Oil and Natural Gas Reserves
Net proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates for all years presented were prepared by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, 
independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas.(cid:160)(cid:160)These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value 
for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage.(cid:160)(cid:160)The reserve estimates 
represent our net revenue interest in our properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)See Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes 
Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves below for a discussion of the effect of the different prices on reserve 
quantities and values.(cid:160)(cid:160)Operating costs, production and ad valorem taxes, and future development costs were based on current 
costs.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of 
production and timing of development expenditures.(cid:160)(cid:160)The following reserve data represents estimates only and should not be 
construed as being exact.(cid:160)(cid:160)Moreover, the present values should not be construed as the current market value of our oil and natural 
gas reserves or the costs that would be incurred to obtain equivalent reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)Estimates of reserves as of year-end 2013, 2012 
and 2011 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a 
field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the applicable fiscal 12-month period.(cid:160)(cid:160)All of our reserves are located in 
the United States.

(1)  Improved recovery reflects reserve additions that result from the application of secondary recovery methods such as water 
flooding, or tertiary recovery methods such as CO2 flooding. (cid:160)In order to recognize proved tertiary oil reserves, we must either 
have an oil production response to CO2 injections or the field must be analogous to an existing tertiary flood.  The magnitude 
of proved reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods and the timing of the 
production response.
Acquisitions of minerals in place during 2013 were primarily related to the acquisition of additional interests in certain of our 
existing operated fields in CCA, as well as operating interests in other CCA fields.  Reserves added as a result of improved recovery 
represent initial proved tertiary oil reserves at Bell Creek Field.
We added 114.2 MMBOE of estimated proved reserves during 2012, including tertiary reserves of 69.5 MMBbls, primarily 
at Hastings and Oyster Bayou fields; 25.9 MMBOE from the acquisition of interests in the Thompson, Webster and Hartzog Draw 
fields; and 11.5 MMBOE from our Bakken area assets prior to their sale in the fourth quarter of 2012.  These increases were offset 
by the disposition of 123.9 MMBOE of reserves associated with disposed properties, including our Bakken area assets, and non-
core assets in the Gulf Coast region and Paradox Basin in Utah.
Acquisitions of minerals in place during 2011 were primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining interest in Riley Ridge, 
and extensions and discoveries that year primarily included proved undeveloped reserves added primarily through additional 
drilling in the Bakken.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural 
Gas Reserves
The Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows and Changes Therein Relating to Proved Oil and Natural 
Gas Reserves ("Standardized Measure") does not purport to present the fair market value of our oil and natural gas properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)An 
estimate of such value should consider, among other factors, anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas, the probability of 
recoveries in excess of existing proved reserves, the value of probable reserves and acreage prospects, and perhaps different 
discount rates.(cid:160)(cid:160)It should be noted that estimates of reserve quantities, especially from new discoveries, are inherently imprecise 
and subject to substantial revision.
Under the Standardized Measure, future cash inflows were estimated by applying a first-day-of-the-month 12-month average 
price to the estimated future production of year-end proved reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)The product prices used in calculating these reserves have 
varied widely during the three-year period.(cid:160)(cid:160)These prices have a significant impact on both the quantities and value of the proved 
reserves, as reductions in oil and natural gas prices can cause wells to reach the end of their economic life much sooner and can 
make certain proved undeveloped locations uneconomical, both of which reduce the reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)The following representative oil 
and natural gas prices were used in the Standardized Measure.(cid:160)(cid:160)These prices were adjusted by field to arrive at the appropriate 
corporate net price.

Future cash inflows were reduced by estimated future production, development and abandonment costs based on current cost, 
with no escalation to determine pre-tax cash inflows.(cid:160)(cid:160)Our future net inflows do not include a reduction for cash previously expended 
on our capitalized CO2 assets that will be consumed in the production of proved tertiary reserves.(cid:160)(cid:160)Future income taxes were 
computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess of net cash inflows over our tax basis in the associated proved oil and 
natural  gas  properties.(cid:160)(cid:160)Tax  credits  and  net  operating  loss  carryforwards  were  also  considered  in  the  future  income  tax 
calculation.(cid:160)(cid:160)Future  net  cash  inflows  after  income  taxes  were  discounted  using  a  10%  annual  discount  rate  to  arrive  at  the 
Standardized Measure.

(1)  Proved CO2 reserves in the Gulf Coast region consist of reserves from our reservoirs at Jackson Dome and are presented on 
a gross working interest (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest was approximately 4.8 Tcf, 4.8 Tcf and 5.3 Tcf at 
December(cid:160)31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and include reserves dedicated to volumetric production payments of 28.9

(2)  Proved CO2 reserves in the Rocky Mountain region consist of our reserves at Riley Ridge (presented on a gross working 
interest (8/8ths) basis) and our overriding royalty interest in LaBarge Field, of which our net revenue interest was approximately 
2.9 Tcf, 2.9 Tcf and 1.6 Tcf at December(cid:160)31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(3)  Reserves associated with helium production rights include helium reserves located in acreage in the Rocky Mountain region 
for which we have the right to extract the helium on behalf of the U.S. government, who owns the helium.  Our extraction 
agreement with the U.S. government gives us the ability to produce the helium on behalf of the U.S. government in exchange 
for a fee, which amount fluctuates based upon the realized sales proceeds we receive.  The estimate of helium reserves is 
reduced to reflect the estimated fee we will remit to the U.S. government.  Our extraction agreement with the U.S. government 
has a minimum term extending 20 years from first production and continuing thereafter until either party terminates the 
contract.  Reserve volumes presented herein assume that the term of this helium extraction agreement continues beyond 20 
years, given the benefit to both parties to the agreement.

(cid:160)
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure 
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) was performed under the supervision and with the 
participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer.(cid:160)(cid:160)Based on that evaluation, 
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as 
of December(cid:160)31, 2013, to ensure that information that is required to be disclosed in the reports the Company files and submits 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded; that it is processed, summarized and reported within the time periods 
specified in the(cid:160)SEC's rules and forms; and that information that is required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated 
and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief 
Financial Officer, we have determined that, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, there were no changes in our internal control 
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial 
reporting.
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined 
in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.(cid:160)(cid:160)Under the supervision and with the 
participation  of  our  management,  including  our  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  our  Chief  Financial  Officer,  we  assessed  the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report based on the framework 
in "Internal Control – Integrated Framework" (1992) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission.(cid:160)(cid:160)Based on that assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our internal 
control over financial reporting was effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting 
and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles.
The  effectiveness  of  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December(cid:160)31,  2013,  has  been  audited  by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in the report that appears herein.
Important Considerations
The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to 
various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of 
future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud.(cid:160)(cid:160)Moreover, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time.(cid:160)(cid:160)Because of these 
limitations, there can be no assurance that any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial 
reporting will be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to 
the appropriate levels of management.

Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any 
Bank, if reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable 
law or reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as will enable the Withholding Agent to determine whether or not 
such Bank is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the 
contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than 
such documentation set forth in Section 13.6(d)(i)(A) and (i)(B) and Section 13.6(j) below) shall not be required if in the 
Bank’s  reasonable  judgment  such  completion,  execution  or  submission  would  subject  such  Bank  to  any  material 
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Bank.
(i)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that Borrower is a U.S. Person,
(A)
any Bank that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Withholding Agent on or prior to the date

executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3)
in the case of a Foreign Bank claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio

that such Foreign Bank is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent 
shareholder” of Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign 
corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) 
executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN; or
(4)
to the extent a Foreign Bank is not the beneficial owner, executed originals of IRS 
Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate 
substantially in the form of Exhibit K-2 or Exhibit K-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents 
from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Bank is a partnership and one or more 
direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Bank are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Bank 
may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit K-4 on behalf of each such 
direct and indirect partner; and
(C)
any Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Withholding 
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such 
Foreign Bank becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable 
request of the Withholding Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis 
for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such 
supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Withholding Agent to 
determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
Each Bank agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate 
in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Withholding Agent in writing of 
its legal inability to do so.

the Credit Agreement, which new subsections shall read in full as follows:

Each Bank shall severally indemnify Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for 
(i) any Non-Excluded Taxes attributable to such Bank (but only to the extent that Borrower has not already indemnified 
Administrative Agent for such Non-Excluded Taxes and without limiting the obligation of Borrower to do so), (ii) any 
Taxes attributable to such Bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 14.9(b)(iii) relating to the maintenance 
of a Participant Register and (iii) any Taxes that are excluded from indemnification under Section 13.6(a) attributable to 
such Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Papers, and any 
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed 
or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered 
to  any  Bank  by  Administrative  Agent  shall  be  conclusive  absent  manifest  error.  Each  Bank  hereby  authorizes 
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Bank under any Loan Paper or
- 6 -
otherwise payable by Administrative Agent to the Bank from any other source against any amount due to Administrative 
Agent under this paragraph (i).
(j)
If a payment made to a Bank under this Agreement would be subject to United States federal withholding 
tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank fails to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including 
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Withholding 
Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent, 
such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and 
such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Withholding Agent as may be necessary for the Withholding 
Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank’s obligations

maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated 
interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Revolving Loans or other obligations under the Loan Papers (the “Participant 
Register”); provided that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register 
(including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any commitments, loans, 
letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Papers) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is 
necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 
5f.102-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent 
manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of

doubt, Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a

of the annual retainer fee by the Company for Participants(cid:160)who are not in office for the entire Plan Year.
(b)
Payment of Fees. Unless a Participant makes an election pursuant to Section(cid:160)7(c), the Participant shall be paid 
in cash on the(cid:160)respective Issue Dates Director Fees earned in a given Plan Year; provided, however, that the Company may pay 
all Director Fees to a Participant in such form and manner as determined by the Company.(cid:160)
(c)
Election to Receive Common Stock in lieu of Directors Fees.  Prior to the first day of each Plan Year, each 
Participant may make an election (“Stock Election”) to receive all or a(cid:160)portion (in increments determined by the Committee) of
- 3 -
the Director Fees he or she will be paid for such(cid:160)Plan Year in the form of Common Stock in lieu of cash. This Stock Election shall 
be in(cid:160)writing in such form and manner provided by the Committee and must be returned to the(cid:160)Committee prior to the beginning 
of the Plan Year in question. This Stock Election, once made, shall remain in effect unless the Participant changes or revokes the 
election for a succeeding fiscal quarter prior to the commencement or such quarter. Such changes or revocations of elections may 
be made no more than once per fiscal quarter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Participant who is(cid:160)newly elected or appointed 
to the Board after the first day of a Plan Year may make a Stock Election with respect to(cid:160)Director Fees not yet earned in such Plan 
Year, no later than the(cid:160)earlier of: (i) thirty (30) days or (ii) the first Issue Date, on or after the date of such Participant's election or 
appointment to the Board, such Director Fees to be prorated based upon months of Board service. If a(cid:160)Participant elects to receive 
any portion of his or her Director Fees in(cid:160)Common Stock pursuant to a Stock Election, the number of shares of Common Stock 
calculated in(cid:160)accordance with Section(cid:160)7(d) shall be issued to the Participant(cid:160)on the respective Issue Dates except to the extent that 
the Participant makes a deferral election under Section 8(a)(1).(cid:160)
(d)
Calculation of Number of Shares Issued.  If a Participant makes a Stock Election, the number of whole shares 
of Common Stock to be issued , or deferred as DSUs if a deferral election is made under Section 8(a)(1), shall be calculated as 
the quotient of Section 7(d)(1) divided by Section 7(d)(2), where:
(i)
equals the amount of the Director Fees to be received in the form of Common Stock on any such Issue
Date (the numerator); and
(ii)
equals the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on such Issue Date (the denominator),
with any fractional shares of Common Stock owed to the Participant on any such Issue Date to be(cid:160)paid to the Participant by the 
Company in cash, unless such cash amount, at the Committee's sole discretion, is rolled forward for payment to the Participant on 
the next succeeding Issue Date.
Notwithstanding any Stock Election to the contrary, if on any Issue Date the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable 
to all Participants hereunder shall exceed the(cid:160)number of reserved shares of Common Stock remaining available under the Plan, 
the available shares of Common Stock shall be allocated proportionally among the Participants, as determined by the Committee, 
in the ratio that the total number of shares of Common Stock a Participant is entitled to receive on such Issue Date bears to the 
total number of shares of Common Stock to be received by all Participants on such Issue Date. Any remaining unpaid Fees shall 
be payable in cash.
(e)
Failure to Elect. Should a Participant fail to timely and properly make a Stock Election with respect to a particular
Plan Year, that Participant's Director Fees shall be paid in cash as set forth in Section 7(b).
(f)
Effect of Certain Changes in Capitalization. In the event of any(cid:160)recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock 
split,  dividend,(cid:160)reorganization,  merger,  consolidation,  spin-off,  combination,(cid:160)repurchase  or  share  exchange,  or  other  similar 
corporate transaction(cid:160)or event affecting the Common Stock, the maximum number of shares(cid:160)available under the Plan, the number 
or class of shares of Common Stock to be delivered hereunder shall be adjusted by the Committee to(cid:160)reflect any such change in 
the number or class of issued shares of(cid:160)Common Stock or securities into which the Common Stock is convertible(cid:160)or exchangeable.(cid:160)
8.

(i)

Deferral Election deferring the receipt of some or all of his or her Director Fees for that Plan Year (subject to such limits 
and restrictions as to any dollar amount, percentage or otherwise as may be permitted by the Committee or otherwise 
provided in this Plan).  The amount of Director Fees subject to such a timely and proper Deferral Election will be credited 
to such Participant's Account, as specified by the Participant in the Deferral Election, either: (a) in cash equivalents to a 
Cash Deferred Account or (b) as a DSU Award to be credited to the Deferred Stock Unit Account; or (c) or both, in such 
proportions as elected by the Participant in such Deferral Election and as permitted by the Committee or otherwise provided 
in this Plan.  In the event that the Participant elects that some or all of his or her Director Fees are to be credited as a DSU 
Award, the Participant then shall receive a DSU Award in whole Deferred Stock Units in an amount substantially equal
- 4 -
to the quotient of (i) divided by (ii), where:
(i)
equals the amount of Participant's Director Fees subject to a Deferral Election as a DSU Award
for a Plan Year (the numerator); and
(ii)
equals the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on what otherwise would be the
Issue Date of the Director Fees absent the Deferral Election  (the denominator),
with any fractional DSUs to be credited, in cash, to the Participant's Cash Deferred Account, unless such cash amount, at the 
Company's sole discretion, is rolled forward for payment to the Participant on the next succeeding Issue Date.
(ii)
LTI.  A Participant also may elect to defer receipt of an LTI award which otherwise is awarded or to 
be awarded to him or her under the Incentive Plan during the next following Plan Year. In order to effect such deferral, 
the Participant must enter into a Deferral Election deferring some or all of any such LTI (subject to such limits and 
restrictions as to any dollar amount, percentage or otherwise as may be established from time to time by the Committee 
or otherwise provided in this Plan). If a Participant elects to defer receipt of all or a portion of an LTI for a Plan Year, the 
Company, pursuant to the Deferral Election, instead will grant the Participant a DSU Award under the Incentive Plan 
substantially equal to the number of shares of Common Stock covered by LTI Awards to which the Participant would be 
entitled under the Incentive Plan and which are also subject to a Deferral Election for a Plan Year.
(b)
Deferral Elections.
(i)
Timing.  Deferral Elections (or revocations thereof) shall be made by the Participant and filed with the 
Committee not later than the last day of the calendar year before the beginning of next succeeding Plan Year and shall 
be effective on the first day of such succeeding Plan Year with respect to Director Fees to be earned or LTI to be granted 
in such subsequent Plan Year.  A Deferral Election with respect to Director Fees or LTI shall be an irrevocable election 
for the next following Plan Year (and shall become irrevocable immediately prior to the first day of the Plan Year to which 
such Deferral Election relates.)
(ii)
Content.  A Deferral Election made pursuant to this Section 8 shall be made in a form and manner
prescribed by the Committee, which Deferral Election may be effectuated as follows:
(i)
The Committee shall permit a Participant the right to defer the receipt of some or all of his or 
her Director Fees and/or LTI (stated as a whole percentage of either 50% or 100% or such other amounts or 
percentages as may be permitted by the Committee) to be credited to the Participant's Accounts under the Plan 
for the immediately following Plan Year.
(ii)
A Participant's Deferral Election of his or her Director Fees and/or LTI shall set forth the 
amount to be credited to the Cash Deferred Account and the portion to be credited to the Deferred Stock Unit 
Account, as appropriate.  If a Participant fails to properly allocate any Director Fees subject to the Deferral 
Election between any Accounts as determined by the Committee, the Committee may credit any and all of such 
Director Fees to one or more Accounts as the Committee determines is appropriate.
(iii)
The Deferral Election may set forth a Specified Payment Date, if any, on which the Participant 
shall receive the distributions of his or her Accounts with respect to the Director Fees or LTI deferred under such 
Deferral Election.
(c)
Credits to a Participant's Account.
(i)
DSU Award.    Each  DSU  credited  to  a  Deferred  Stock  Unit Account  represents  the  Company's 
commitment to issue such Participants a fixed number of shares of Common Stock upon a Distribution Event.  No actual 
shares of Common Stock shall be issued until a Distribution Event described in Section 10 occurs, with such shares to 
be issued by the Company under the Incentive Plan, or under this Plan, as appropriate.  The Deferred Stock Units under 
any DSU Award shall not be considered issued and outstanding shares for purposes of shareholder voting rights or for 
purposes of receiving dividends and other distributions, if any (other than as provided in Section 8(c)(3) below.)
- 5 -
(ii)
Cash.  Directors Fees deferred by Participants in cash shall be credited to a Cash Deferred Account, 
on the first business day coincident with or immediately following the Issue Date for such Director Fees, until a Distribution 
Event described in Section 10 occurs.  Cash Deferred Accounts shall not be credited with any earnings or income by the 
Company.
(iii)
Dividend Equivalents.  In the event Director Fees or LTIs are deferred in the form of DSUs, and in 
the event the Company pays and/or distributes dividends on its Common Stock, Dividend Equivalents on such DSUs 
shall be credited in cash to the Participant's Cash Deferred Account. The amount of cash credited shall be equal to the 
product of (i) the per-share amount of the dividend paid by the Company in respect of its Common Stock and (ii) the 
number of DSUs help in the Participant's Deferred Stock Unit Account on the record date for such dividend being paid 
on the underlying Common Stock represented by such DSUs. Dividend Equivalents shall be credited to a Participant's 
Cash Deferred Stock Account at the time dividends are paid by the Company in respect to its Common Stock. Such 
Dividend Equivalents shall be deferred until and distributed at the same time as the corresponding DSU upon which the 
Dividend Equivalent was credited. If the DSU with respect to which the Dividend Equivalent is credited is forfeited, all 
Dividend Equivalents credited with respect to that forfeited DSU also shall be forfeited.
(d)
Participant Reports. At the end of each Plan Year (or on a more frequent basis as determined by the Committee), 
a report shall be issued to each Participant who has an Account, and such report will set forth the value of each such Account and, 
as applicable, the number of DSUs credited to a Participant's Deferred Stock Unit Account and/or the amount of cash equivalents 
credited to his or her Cash Deferred Account.
(e)
Suspension of Deferral Election.   Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Section(cid:160)4(b),  the  Committee  upon 
written  application  by  a  Participant,  may  authorize  the  suspension  of  a  Participant's  Deferral  Election(s)  in  the  event  of  an 
Unforeseeable Emergency. Any suspension authorized by the Committee shall become effective as soon as practicable after the 
Committee's receipt of a suspension application, but no later than the period beginning thirty (30) days after the receipt of such 
suspension application. Such suspension shall be effective for the remainder of the Plan Year and shall be deemed an annual election 
for each succeeding Plan Year unless a subsequent Deferral Election is filed with the Company pursuant to Section(cid:160)4(b).
(f)
No Change in Specified Payment Date Permitted.  If a Participant has selected a Specified Payment Date 
with respect to a Deferral Election for a Plan Year, subject to the provisions of Section 10(a) herein, such election becomes 
irrevocable as of the last day of the Plan Year immediately preceding the Plan Year to which the Deferral Election relates.
9.
VESTING
(a)
Director Fees.  Amounts attributable to deferred Director Fees which are deferred into either or both of a 
Participant's Cash Deferred Account or Deferred Stock Units are 100% vested under the Plan immediately upon being credited to 
a Participant's Account under the Plan and at all times thereafter.
(b)
LTI.  Deferred Stock Units attributable to deferred LTIs will vest, in whole or in installments, in accordance 
with the “Restricted Period” (as defined in the Incentive Plan) with respect to the applicable LTI award, or such other period as

however, that, if such thirty (30) day period ends in the taxable year following the year in which such Distribution Event occurs, 
the Participant shall not have the right to designate the year of payment and the Distribution Event shall occur in the taxable year 
in which such thirty (30) day period ends.
(b)
Distribution upon a Specified Payment Date.  If a Participant's Deferral Election provides for distributions 
based on the occurrence of a Specified Payment Date, upon such Specified Payment Date, that portion (or all) of the Account

Distribution upon an Unforeseeable Emergency. A Participant may request a distribution of some or all of 
his or her Account due to an Unforeseeable Emergency by submitting a written request to the Committee accompanied by evidence

due to an Unforeseeable Emergency is approved, the amount of the distribution is limited to an amount sufficient to meet the need 
resulting from the Unforeseeable Emergency (in the sole discretion of the Committee). The permissible distribution shall be payable 
in a form determined by the Committee as soon as possible after approval of such distribution.

day period ends
(ii)
For purposes of Section 10, “Change in Control” shall mean any one of the following:

Control.

Distribution in the Event of Taxation.
(i)
If, for any reason, it has been determined that the Plan fails to meet the requirements of Code Section 
409A, and the failure is not or cannot be corrected under a Service correction program for such failure, the Committee 
shall distribute to the Participant the portion of the Participant's Account that is required to be included in income as a 
result of the failure of the Plan to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.

no such action shall, without the(cid:160)consent of a Participant, affect the rights of such Participant in any(cid:160)Common Stock issued to such

in adverse tax consequences for the Participant or any of his or her beneficiaries or transferees.

Shares which may be subject to or delivered under Awards granted under this Plan and shall be available for future Awards

Notwithstanding any provision in this Plan to the contrary, no person whose compensation may be 
subject to the limitations on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code shall be eligible for a grant during a single 
Plan Year of an Award with respect to, or measured by, more than 500,000 Reserved Shares.  The limitation under this 
Section 3(b) shall be construed so as to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code.
4.
Conditions for Grant of Awards.
(a)
Without limiting the generality of the provisions hereof which deal specifically with each form of Award,
Awards shall only be granted to such one or more Eligible Persons as shall be selected by the Committee.
(b)
In granting Awards, the Committee shall take into consideration the contribution the Eligible Person 
has made or may be reasonably expected to make to the success of the Company and such other factors as the Committee 
shall determine.  The Committee shall also have the authority to consult with and receive recommendations from officers 
and other personnel of the Company with regard to these matters.  The Committee may from time to time in granting 
Awards under this Plan prescribe such terms and conditions concerning such Awards as it deems appropriate, including, 
without limitation, relating an Award to achievement of specific goals established by the Committee or, subject to Section 
4(d), to the continued employment of the Eligible Person for a specified period of time, provided that such terms and 
conditions are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan.
(c)
Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to Employees, and all other Awards may be granted to
any Eligible Person.
(d)
This Plan shall not confer upon any Holder any right with respect to continuation of employment by 
the Company, or any right to provide services to the Company, nor shall it interfere in any way with his or her right or 
the Company's right to terminate his or her employment at any time.
(e)
The Awards granted to Eligible Persons shall be in addition to regular salaries, pension, life insurance 
or other benefits (if any) related to their service to the Company, and nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the ability 
of the Company to enter into any other compensation arrangements with any Eligible Person.
(f)
The Administrator shall determine in each case whether periods of military or government service shall
constitute a continuation of employment or service for the purposes of this Plan or any Award.
(g)
Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary, each Award which in whole or in part involves 
the issuance of Reserved Shares may provide for the issuance of such Reserved Shares for consideration consisting of

2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan for Denbury Resources Inc.
- 6 -
cash or cash equivalents, or such other consideration as the Committee may determine, including (without limitation) as 
compensation for past services rendered.
(h)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Committee may delegate in writing to 
the Administrator the authority to grant Awards to Employees (other than Senior Management, Section 16 officers (as 
defined in rule 16a-1 under the 1934 Act) and Covered Employees (as defined below)), provided that such authority is 
not otherwise expressly delegated to the Committee under the terms of this Plan and contains limits on the maximum 
amount or number of Awards that the Administrator may grant under such authority.  Such authority shall also designate 
the terms and conditions for these grants.
5.
Grant of Options.
(a)
The Committee may grant Options to Eligible Persons from time to time, alone, in addition to, or in 
tandem with, other Awards granted under this Plan.  An Option granted hereunder shall be either an Incentive Stock 
Option or a Non-Qualified Stock Option, and shall clearly state whether it is (in whole or in part) an Incentive Stock 
Option or a Non-Qualified Stock Option; provided, that failure of an Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option to 
qualify as an Incentive Stock Option will not affect its validity, and the portion which does not qualify as an Incentive 
Stock Option shall be a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
(b)
If both Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Stock Options are granted to a Holder, the right to 
exercise, to the full extent thereof, Options of either type shall not be contingent in whole or in part upon the exercise of, 
or failure to exercise, Options of the other type.
(c)
The aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the Date of Grant) of the Reserved Shares with 
respect to which any Incentive Stock Option is exercisable for the first time by a Holder during any Plan Year under this 
Plan and all such plans of the Company (as defined in Section(cid:160)424 of the Code) shall not exceed $100,000; provided, 
without limitation, that any portion of an Option designated as an Incentive Stock Option which exceeds such $100,000 
limit will, notwithstanding such designation, be a validly granted Non-Qualified Stock Option.
(d)
The Committee may at any time offer to buy out, for a payment in cash, an Option previously granted, 
based  on  such  terms  and  conditions  as  the  Committee  shall  establish  and  as  communicated  to  the  Holder  by  the 
Administrator at the time that such offer is made, provided that no such offer or payment may be made in a manner that 
would violate the prohibition of the NYSE(or other national securities exchange upon which the Company's securities 
are listed for trading) against the repricing of "underwater" options (options with an exercise price above the then-current 
price of the Common Stock on the NYSE) without shareholder approval.
6.
Option Price.
(a)
The Option Price shall be any price determined by the Committee which is not less than one hundred 
percent (100%) of the Fair Market Value per Share on the Date of Grant; provided, however, that in the case of an Incentive 
Stock Option granted to a 10% Person the Option Price shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value per Share 
on the Date of Grant.  The Administrator shall determine the Fair Market Value per Share in accordance with the terms 
set forth in the definition thereof.
(b)
Unless further limited by the Committee in any Option, the Option Price may be paid in cash, by certified 
or cashier's check, by wire transfer, by money order, through a Broker Assisted Exercise, with Shares (but with Shares 
only if expressly permitted by the terms of the Option and only with Shares owned by the Holder for at least 6 months 
prior to the exercise date), or by a combination of the above; provided, however, that the Administrator may accept a 
personal check in full or partial payment.  If the Option Price is permitted to be, and is, paid in whole or in part with 
Shares, the value of the Shares surrendered shall be the Shares' Fair Market Value on the date delivered to the Administrator.
7.
Exercise of Options.  An Option shall be deemed exercised when (i)(cid:160)the Administrator has received written 
notice of such exercise in accordance with the terms of the Option, and (ii) full payment of the aggregate Option Price plus required 
withholding tax amounts, if any, described in Section 15, of the Reserved Shares as to which the Option is exercised has been 
made.  Separate stock certificates shall be issued by the Parent for any Reserved Shares acquired as a result of exercising an

- 7 -
Incentive Stock Option and a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
8.
Vesting of Options.
(a)
Without limitation, each Option shall Vest in whole or in part, and Reserved Shares subject to such 
Option shall become Vested Option Shares, or shall expire, according to the terms of the Option as expressly provided 
in such Option.
(b)
The Committee, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the date on which all or any portion of an otherwise
unvested Option shall Vest or restrictions on Restricted Shares will lapse.
9.
Termination of Option Period.
(a)
Unless the terms of an Option expressly provide for a different date of termination, the unexercised 
portion of an Option shall automatically and without notice terminate and become null and void at the time of the earliest 
to occur of the following:
(1)
on the 90th day following Holder's Separation for any reason except death, Disability or for
Cause;
(2)
(3)
(4)
(5)
immediately upon Separation as a result, in whole or in material part, of a discharge for Cause;
on the first anniversary of a Separation by reason of death or Disability;
in the case of a 10% Person, on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Date of Grant; or
on the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Date of Grant.
(b)
Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in the event of the proposed dissolution or 
liquidation of the Parent, or in the event of a proposed sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the 
proposed merger of the Parent with or into another corporation (each a "Transaction"), unless otherwise expressly 
provided (by express reference to this Section 9(b)) in the terms of an Option, after the public announcement of the 
Transaction, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, direct the Administrator to deliver a written notice ("Cancellation 
Notice") to any Holder of an Option, canceling the unexercised Vested portion (including the portion which becomes 
Vested by reason of acceleration or by virtue of the Transaction being proposed), if any, of such Option, effective on the 
date specified in the Cancellation Notice ("Cancellation Date").  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Cancellation Date 
may not be earlier than the last to occur of (i) the 15th day following delivery of the Cancellation Notice, and (ii) the 60th 
day prior to the proposed date for the consummation of the Transaction ("Proposed Date").  Without limitation, the 
Cancellation Notice will provide that, unless the Holder elects in writing to waive, in whole or in part, a Conditional 
Exercise, that the exercise of the Option will be a Conditional Exercise, provided that the Holder will not be entitled to 
waive an exercise of an Option being a Conditional Exercise to the extent such exercise covers a portion of an Option 
which becomes Vested solely by virtue of the applicable Transaction being proposed.  A "Conditional Exercise" shall 
mean that in the event the Transaction does not occur within 180 days of the Proposed Date, the exercising Holder shall 
be refunded any amounts paid to exercise such Holder's Option, such Option will be reissued, and the purported exercise 
of such Option shall be null and void ab intitio.
10.
Acceleration.
(a)
Unless otherwise expressly provided in the Award, in the event the Holder's Separation is by reason of 
the Holder's death or Disability, all Awards granted to the Holder shall become fully exercisable, Vested, or the Restricted 
Period shall terminate, as the case may be (hereafter, in this Section 10, such Award shall be "accelerated").
(b)
Unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award, in the event of a Change in Control (i) all Awards 
shall be accelerated, and (ii) in the sole discretion of the Committee, the value of some or all Awards may be cashed out 
on the basis of the Change in Control Price, at any time during the 60-day period immediately preceding any bona fide
As amended and restated effective on December 12, 2013
2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan for Denbury Resources Inc.
- 8 -
transaction constituting a Change in Control; provided, that if a date prior to such occurrence is selected for a cash out, 
any subsequent increase in the Change in Control Price will be paid to each Holder on the date of such occurrence, or as 
soon thereafter as reasonably possible, but not later than 75 days from the occurrence of the Change in Control.  Any 
acceleration for RSU Awards shall apply only to the extent permitted under Section 409A.
11.
Adjustment(cid:160)of(cid:160)Reserved Shares.
(a)
If at any time while this Plan is in effect or Awards with respect to Reserved Shares are outstanding, 
there shall be any increase or decrease in the number of issued and outstanding Shares through the declaration of a stock 
dividend or through any recapitalization resulting in a stock split-up, combination or exchange of Shares, then and in 
such event:
(i)
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the maximum number of Reserved Shares which may 
be granted under Section 3, and equitably in the Reserved Shares which are then subject to each Award, so that 
the same proportion of the issued and outstanding Common Stock shall continue to be subject to grant under 
Section 3, and to such Award; and
(ii)
in addition, and without limitation, in the case of each Award (including, without limitation, 
Options) which requires the payment of consideration by the Holder in order to acquire Reserved Shares, an 
appropriate equitable adjustment shall be made in the consideration (including, without limitation the Option 
Price) required to be paid to acquire each Reserved Share, so that (A) the aggregate consideration to acquire all 
of  the  Reserved  Shares  subject  to  the Award  remains  the  same,  and  (B)  so  far  as  possible,  (and  without 
disqualifying an Incentive Stock Option), the relative cost of acquiring each Reserved Share subject to such 
Award remains the same.
All such determinations shall be made by the Board in its sole discretion.
(b)
The Committee may change, or may direct the Administrator to change, the terms of Options outstanding 
under this Plan, with respect to the Option Price or the number of Reserved Shares subject to the Options, or both, when, 
in the Committee's judgment, such adjustments become appropriate by reason of a corporate transaction (as defined in 
Treasury Regulation §(cid:160)1.424-1(a)(3)); provided, however, that if by reason of such corporate transaction an Incentive 
Stock Option is assumed or a new Incentive Stock Option is substituted therefor, the Committee, or at the direction of 
the Committee, the Administrator, may only change the terms of such Incentive Stock Option such that (i)(cid:160)the excess of 
the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the substituted Incentive Stock Option immediately after the 
substitution or assumption, over the aggregate Option Price of such Shares at such time, is not more than the excess of 
the aggregate Fair Market Value of all Reserved Shares subject to the Incentive Stock Option immediately before such 
substitution or assumption over the aggregate Option Price of such Reserved Shares at such time, and (ii)(cid:160)the substituted 
Incentive Stock Option, or the assumption of the original Incentive Stock Option does not give the Holder additional 
benefits which such Holder did not have under the original Incentive Stock Option.  Without limiting the generality of 
any other provisions hereof, including, without limitation, Section 23, except to the minimum extent, if any, required by 
Section 424(a) of the Code with respect to Incentive Stock Options, no change made under the authority of this Section 
11(b) in the terms of an Option shall alter such Option's material provisions in a way that makes such Option less valuable 
to its Holder.
(c)
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the issuance by the Parent of shares of its capital stock 
of any class, or securities convertible into shares of capital stock of any class, either in connection with direct sale for 
adequate consideration, or upon the exercise of rights or warrants to subscribe therefor, or upon conversion of shares or 
obligations of the Parent convertible into such shares or other securities, shall not affect, and no adjustment by reason 
thereof shall be made with respect to, Reserved Shares subject to Awards granted under this Plan.
(d)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the existence of outstanding Awards with respect to 
Reserved Shares granted under this Plan shall not affect in any manner the right or power of the Parent to make, authorize 
or consummate (1)(cid:160)any or all adjustments, recapitalizations, reorganizations or other changes in the Parent's capital 
structure or its business; (2) any merger or consolidation of the Parent; (3)(cid:160)any issue by the Parent of debt securities, or 
preferred  or  preference  stock  which  would  rank  above  the  Reserved  Shares  subject  to  outstanding Awards;  (4)  the
As amended and restated effective on December 12, 2013
2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan for Denbury Resources Inc.
- 9 -
dissolution or liquidation of the Parent; (5) any sale, transfer or assignment of all or any part of the assets or business of 
the Company; or (6) any other corporate act or proceeding, whether of a similar character or otherwise.
12.
Transferability of Awards.
(a)
Awards made under this Plan shall not be transferable by the Holder other than by will or the laws of 
descent and distribution, and so long as a Holder lives, only such Holder or his or her guardian or legal representative 
shall have the right to exercise any Award that is an Incentive Stock Option.
With respect to Awards made under this Plan (other than Incentive Stock Options), a Holder may file 
with the Administrator a written designation, on such form as may be prescribed by the Administrator, of the person(s) 
that in the event of the Holder's death are authorized to (i) exercise any Options or SARs awarded to the Holder and to 
receive Holder's rights pursuant to Holder's Awards and/or (ii) receive payment of any cash awards awarded to the Holder.  
To the extent that the Holder has completed such a designation for Awards made under this Plan, such designation will 
remain in effect and shall prevail with respect to any Award issued hereunder until changed in writing by the Holder, 
which Holder may do at any time by written notice to the Administrator, to the extent enforceable under Applicable Laws.  
In the event that the Holder has filed no such designation with respect to the Holder's Awards under this Plan, or where 
the person(s) designated by the Holder has dissolved or predeceases him or her (as applicable), the following rules apply:
(i)
the  Holder's  beneficiary  designation  for  the  basic  life  insurance  benefits  provided  by  the
Company shall then apply; and
(ii)
in the absence of a valid basic life insurance beneficiary designation under Section 12(a)(i), 
the Company will allow the legal representative of the Holder's estate to exercise any and all rights under an 
Award, and the Holder's estate may receive any corresponding issuance of Reserved Shares or other payment 
authorized under the terms of this Plan.
(b)
In order to avoid the termination of Non-Qualified Stock Options or SARs following the death of a 
Holder, any and all outstanding Non-Qualified Stock Options or SARs which become Vested upon the Holder's death are 
deemed to be exercised on the day immediately prior to the first anniversary of the Holder's Separation by death if not 
exercised before that date, with any subsequent transfer by the Company to the then Holder of Reserved Shares to be 
made as soon as practicable, but within 75 days after the deemed exercise of the Non-Qualified Stock Options or SARs.  
Without limitation, any exercise under this Section 12(b) of any and all Non-Qualified Stock Options shall be effectuated 
by the Company on behalf of the Holder through a Broker Assisted Exercise.  Any and all SARs exercised under this 
Section 12(b) shall be deemed to comply with the exercise requirements of Section 18(c).  Any Options or SARs exercised 
pursuant to this Section 12(b) shall be exercised only if “in the money” as determined by the Administrator.
13.
Issuance of Reserved Shares.  No Holder shall be, or have any of the rights or privileges of, the owner of 
Reserved Shares subject to an Award unless and until (a) certificates representing the Common Stock shall have been issued and 
delivered to such Holder; or (b)a book entry of the Holder's ownership of such Common Stock has been made, in both cases subject 
to Restriction.
 
 
As a condition of any issuance of Common Stock, the Administrator may obtain such agreements or undertakings, if any, 
as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable to assure compliance with any law or regulation or shareholder agreement 
including, but not limited to, a representation, warranty or agreement to be bound by any legends that are, in the opinion of the 
Administrator, necessary or appropriate to comply with the provisions of any securities law deemed by the Administrator to be 
applicable to the issuance of the Reserved Shares and which are endorsed upon the Share certificates.
Share certificates issued to the Holder receiving such Reserved Shares who is a party to any shareholders agreement, 
voting trust, or any similar agreement shall bear the legends contained in such agreements.  Notwithstanding any provision hereof 
to the contrary, no Reserved Shares shall be required to be issued with respect to an Award unless counsel for the Parent shall be 
reasonably satisfied that such issuance will be in compliance with applicable federal or state securities laws.
In no event shall the Company be required to sell or issue Reserved Shares under any Award if the sale or issuance thereof 
would constitute a violation of applicable federal or state securities law or regulation or a violation of any other law or regulation
As amended and restated effective on December 12, 2013
2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan for Denbury Resources Inc.
- 10 -
of any governmental authority or any national securities exchange.  As a condition to any sale or issuance of Reserved Shares, the 
Company may place legends on Reserved Shares, issue stop transfer orders, and require such agreements or undertakings as the 
Company may deem necessary or advisable to assure compliance with any such law or regulation.
Without limitation, the Company shall use its best efforts to register the Reserved Shares with the Securities and Exchange
Commission under a Form S-8.
14.

indemnify and agree to defend and save harmless any member of the Committee, and the Administrator, with respect to 
any liabilities asserted or incurred in connection with the exercise and performance of their powers and duties hereunder, 
unless such liabilities are judicially determined to have arisen out of such person's gross negligence, fraud or bad faith.  
Such indemnification shall include attorney's fees and all other costs and expenses reasonably incurred in defense of any 
action arising from such act of commission or omission.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the Company's ability 
to insure itself with respect to its obligations hereunder.
(e)
In particular, and without limitation, except for the authority granted to the Administrator under Section 
4(h) to make determinations described in subsections (i), (ii), and (iii) below while carrying out the general delegation

Section 4(h)) shall have the authority to adopt, alter, and repeal any or all of its rules, guidelines, and practices with 
respect to this Plan, and all questions of interpretation, with respect to this Plan or any Award shall be decided by the 
Committee (or by the Administrator in carrying out its duties under Section 4(h)), whose decision shall be final, conclusive 
and binding upon the Company and each other affected party.
(g)
Without limitation, the Committee in its sole discretion may limit or expand the authority granted, or 
previously granted, hereunder by the Committee to the Administrator by notifying the Administrator in writing of such 
change.
15.
Tax Withholding.  On or immediately prior to the date on which a payment is made to a Holder hereunder or, 
if earlier, the date on which an amount is required to be included in the income of the Holder as a result of an Award, the Holder 
shall be required to pay to the Company, in cash, or in Shares (but in Shares only if expressly permitted in the Award, or by written 
authorization of the Administrator, and then only in the minimum amount required to satisfy the minimum withholding requirements 
with respect to such Award), the amount (if any) which the Company reasonably determines to be necessary in order for the 
Company to comply with applicable federal or state tax withholding requirements, and the collection of employment or other 
applicable taxes; provided, further, without limitation, that the Administrator may require that such payment be made in cash.
16.
Restricted Shares, DSUs and RSUs.
(a)
Restricted Shares
(i)
The  Committee  may  grant  Restricted  Share Awards  to  any  Eligible  Person,  for  no  cash 
consideration,  for  such  minimum  consideration  as  may  be  required  by  applicable  law,  or  for  such  other 
consideration as may be specified in the grant.  The terms and conditions of Restricted Share Awards shall be 
specified in the Award.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine what rights, if any, the person to 
whom a Restricted Share Award is made shall have in the Restricted Shares during the Restricted Period and the 
Restrictions applicable to the particular Award, including, without limitation, whether the holder of the Restricted 
Shares shall have the right to vote the Restricted Shares and the extent, if any, of Holder's right to receive 
Restricted Share Distributions.  Unless otherwise provided in the Restricted Share Award, upon the expiration 
of Restrictions, the Restricted Shares shall cease to be Restricted Shares.
(ii)
Generally, time-based Restrictions on Restricted Share Awards shall lapse in whole, or in 
installments, over whatever Restricted Period shall be selected by the Committee, provided that the length of 
the period over which the Restrictions shall lapse on Restricted Shares awarded to corporate officers of the 
Company (as so designated pursuant to the Company's bylaws) is not less than (i) three (3) years for Restricted 
Share Awards which are not performance-based or (ii) one (1) year for Restricted Share Awards which are 
performance-based.
(iii)  Without limitations, the Committee may accelerate the date on which Restrictions lapse, are 
waived or are accelerated with respect to Restricted Shares which comprise five percent (5%) or less of the total 
number of Reserved Shares authorized for issuance under this Plan under the first sentence of Section 3(a).
(iv)
During the Restricted Period, stock certificates or transfer agent book entries representing the 
Restricted Shares, and any Restricted Share Distributions, shall be registered in the Holder's name and bear a 
restrictive legend disclosing the Restrictions, the existence of this Plan, and the existence of such Restricted 
Share Award.  Such certificates shall be deposited by the Holder with the Company, or book entries made, 
together with stock powers or other instruments of assignment, each endorsed in blank, which will permit the 
transfer to the Company of all or any portion of the Restricted Shares, and any assets constituting Restricted 
Share Distributions, which shall be forfeited in accordance with the terms of such Restricted Share Award.  
Restricted Shares shall constitute issued and outstanding Common Stock for all corporate purposes and the
As amended and restated effective on December 12, 2013
2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan for Denbury Resources Inc.
- 12 -
Holder shall have all rights, powers and privileges of a holder of unrestricted Shares except those that are expressly 
excluded under the terms of the Restricted Share Award.  The Holder will not be entitled to delivery of the stock 
certificates (or comparable evidence of ownership) until all Restrictions shall have terminated, and the Company 
will retain custody of all related Restricted Share Distributions (which will be subject to the same Restrictions, 
terms, and conditions as the related Restricted Shares) until the conclusion of the Restricted Period with respect 
to the related Restricted Shares; provided, that any Restricted Share Distributions shall not bear interest or be 
segregated into a separate account but shall remain a general asset of the Company, subject to the claims of the 
Company's creditors, until the conclusion of the applicable Restricted Period; provided, further, that any material 
breach of any terms of the Restricted Share Award, as reasonably determined by the Administrator, will cause 
a forfeiture of both Restricted Shares and Restricted Share Distributions.  Notwithstanding anything in this 
paragraph to the contrary, this Section 16(a)(iv) does not apply to DSU Awards or RSU Awards.
(b)
RSUs and DSUs
(i)
The Committee may grant Deferred Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units to any Eligible 
Person, for no cash consideration, for such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law, or for 
such other consideration as may be specified in the grant.  The terms and conditions of Deferred Stock Units 
and Restricted Stock Units shall be reflected in an Award agreement.  No shares of Common Stock shall be 
issued at the time a Deferred Stock Unit or Restricted Stock Unit is granted, and the Company will not be required 
to set aside a fund for the payment of any such Award.  An Eligible Person shall have no voting rights with 
respect to any Deferred Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units granted hereunder.
(ii)
Deferred Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units awarded to any Eligible Person shall be subject 
to (A) forfeiture until fully Vested, and satisfaction of any applicable Performance Measures during such period, 
to the extent provided in the applicable Award agreement, and to the extent such Deferred Stock Units or Restricted 
Stock Units are forfeited, all rights of the Eligible Person to such Deferred Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units 
shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company and (B) such other terms and conditions 
as may be set forth in the applicable Award.  At any time prior to full Vesting, the Committee shall have the 
authority to fully Vest Deferred Stock Units or Restricted Stock Units whenever it may determine that, by reason 
of changes in Applicable Laws or other changes in circumstances arising after the date the Deferred Stock Units 
or Restricted Stock Units are granted, such action is appropriate and consistent with the requirements of Section 
409A of the Code.
(iii)
The Director Deferred Compensation Plan and any DSU Awards shall set forth the Dividend 
Equivalent rights, if any, related to any DSUs issued under this Plan, along with the distribution to be made on 
and settlement procedures pertaining to, such DSU Awards.
(iv)
With respect to any outstanding Restricted Stock Units, when payable pursuant to the terms 
of any Award, the Company shall deliver to the Eligible Person, or his or her beneficiary, without charge, one 
Reserved Share for each such outstanding Restricted Stock Unit and either cash equal to any Dividend Equivalents 
credited with respect to each such Restricted Stock Unit in accordance with appllicable provisions of this Plan 
or Restricted Stock Unit Awards, or Shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to such Dividend 
Equivalents, provided, however, that, if explicitly provided in the applicable Award, the Committee may, in its 
sole discretion, elect to pay cash or part cash and part Common Stock in lieu of delivering only Shares of Common 
Stock for Restricted Stock Units.  If a cash payment is made in lieu of delivering Shares of Common Stock, the 
amount of such payment shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the date on which 
the Restrictions lapsed with respect to each Restricted Stock Unit.  Dividend Equivalents credited on Restricted 
Stock Units shall be subject to the same Vesting requirements as the underlying Common Stock with respect to 
which the Dividend Equivalents are credited, and will be paid or distributed at the same time as the Restricted 
Stock Units are settled or paid.  If the Restricted Stock Unit with respect to which the Dividend Equivalent is 
credited is forfeited, such Dividend Equivalent also shall be forfeited.  Dividend Equivalents shall be settled 
either in cash or in Common Stock, at the discretion of the Committee, subject to the terms of any Award.

Performance Awards.
(a)
Performance Awards during a Plan Year may be granted to any member of Senior Management subject 
to Section 162(m) of the Code ("Covered Employees") and shall in all events be specifically designated as Performance 
Awards, and may also be granted to other Employees.  Performance Awards shall be conditioned on the satisfaction of 
such criteria, including those comprising the Performance Measures, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may select.
(b)
Without limitation, the Committee's grant of Performance Awards may, in its sole discretion, be made 
in Reserved Shares or in cash, or in a combination of Reserved Shares and cash, but the cash portion of such Award 
granted during any one Plan Year to any Person may not exceed $2,000,000 in a Plan Year.  Under no circumstance shall 
dividends or Dividend Equivalents be granted on unearned Performance Awards.
(c)
The Committee shall select the Performance Measures which will be required to be satisfied during the 
Performance Period in order to earn the Performance Award.  Such Performance Measures, and the duration of any 
Performance Period (provided that such Performance Period is not less than one (1) year), may differ with respect to each 
Covered Employee, or with respect to separate Performance Awards issued to the same Covered Employee.  The selected 
Performance  Measures,  the  Performance  Period(s),  and  any  other  conditions  to  the  Company's  obligation  to  pay  a 
Performance Award shall be set forth in each Performance Award on or before the first to occur of (i) the 90th day of the 
selected Performance Period, (ii) the first date on which more than 25% of the Performance Period has elapsed, and (iii) 
the first date, if any, on which satisfaction of the Performance Measure(s) is no longer substantially uncertain.
(d)
Performance Awards shall be paid in a single payment, but will not be paid prior to the date on which 
the Performance Measures are attained, except that such payment may be accelerated upon the death or Disability of the 
Covered Employee, or as a result of a Change in Control, it being understood that if such acceleration events occur prior 
to the attainment of the Performance Measures, the Performance Award will not be exempt from Section 162(m) of the 
Code.  Any accelerated payment made upon death or Disability (as defined in Section 409A of the Code or rules or 
regulations thereunder) or as a result of a Change in Control (as defined in Section 409A of the Code or rules or regulations 
thereunder) will be paid no later than March 15th of the calendar year following the end of the taxable year in which the 
death or such Disability of the Covered Employee occurs or in which such Change in Control occurs.
(e)
The extent to which any applicable Performance Measure has been achieved shall be conclusively 
determined by the Committee, but may be specifically delegated to the Administrator.  Without limitation, where a Covered 
Employee has satisfied the Performance Measures with respect to a Performance Award, if permitted under the terms of 
such Performance Award, the Committee, in its sole discretion, may reduce the maximum amount payable under such 
Performance Award.
18.
Stock Appreciation Rights.
(a)
The Committee shall have authority to grant (i) a SAR with respect to Reserved Shares, including, 
without limitation, Reserved Shares covered by any Option ("Related Option"), or (ii) a SAR with respect to, or as to 
some or all of, a Performance Award ("Related Performance Award").  A SAR granted with respect to a Related Option 
or Related Performance Award must be granted on the Date of Grant of such Related Option or Related Performance 
Award.
(b)
For the purposes of this Plan, the following definitions shall apply:
(i)
The term "SAR" shall mean a right granted under this Plan, including, without limitation, a 
right granted in tandem with an Award, that shall entitle the Holder thereof to an amount equal to the SAR Spread 
payable as described in this Section 18(d).
(ii)
The term "SAR Spread" shall mean with respect to each SAR an amount equal to the product 
of (1) the excess of (A) the Fair Market Value per Share on the date of exercise, over (B) (y) if the SAR is granted 
in tandem with an Option, the Option Price per Reserved Share of the Related Option, or (z) if the SAR is either 
granted in tandem with a Performance Award or granted by itself with respect to a designated number of Reserved 
Shares, the Agreed Price which, without limitation, is the Fair Market Value of the Reserved Shares on the Date
As amended and restated effective on December 12, 2013
2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan for Denbury Resources Inc.
- 14 -
of Grant, in each case multiplied by (2) the number of Reserved Shares with respect to which such SAR is being 
exercised; provided, however, without limitation, that with respect to any SAR granted in tandem with an 
Incentive Stock Option, in no event shall the SAR Spread exceed the amount permitted to be treated as the SAR 
Spread under applicable treasury regulations or other legal authority without disqualifying the Option as an 
Incentive Stock Option.
(c)
To exercise the SAR, the Holder shall:
(i)
Give written notice thereof to the Company, specifying the SAR  being exercised and the
number of Reserved Shares with respect to which such SAR is being exercised; and
(ii)
If requested by the Company, deliver within a reasonable time the agreement evidencing the 
SAR being exercised and, if applicable, the Related Option agreement, or Related Performance Award agreement, 
to the Secretary of the Company who shall endorse or cause to be endorsed thereon a notation of such exercise 
and return all agreements to the Holder.
(d)
As soon as practicable, but within 75 days after the exercise of a SAR, the Company shall transfer to 
the Holder Reserved Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the SAR is exercised equal to the SAR Spread; 
provided, however, without limiting the generality of Section 15, that the Company, in its sole discretion, may withhold 
from such transferred Reserved Shares any amount necessary to satisfy the Company's minimum obligation for federal 
and state withholding taxes with respect to such exercise.
(e)
A SAR may be exercised only if and to the extent that it is permitted under the terms of the Award
which, in the case of a Related Option, shall be only when such Related Option is eligible to be exercised.
(f)
Upon the exercise or termination of a Related Option, or the payment or termination of a Related
Performance Award, the SAR with respect to such Related Option or Related Performance Award shall terminate.
(g)
A SAR shall be transferable (i) only to the extent, if any, provided in the agreement evidencing the 
SAR, or (ii) if granted with respect to a Related Option, or Related Performance Award, only to the extent, if any, that 
such Related Option, or Related Performance Award, is transferable, and under the same conditions.
(h)
Each SAR shall be on such terms and conditions not inconsistent with this Plan as the Committee may
determine, provided that the term of a SAR may not extend beyond the tenth (10th) anniversary of its Date of Grant.
(i)
The Holder shall have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the related Reserved Shares as a result
of the grant of a SAR.
(j)
With respect to a Holder who, on the date of a proposed exercise of a SAR is an officer (as that term 
is used in Rule 16a-1 promulgated under the 1934 Act or any similar rule which may subsequently be in effect), such 
proposed exercise may only occur as permitted by Rule 16b-3, including, without limitation, paragraph (e)(3)(iii) (or any 
similar rule which may subsequently be in effect promulgated pursuant to Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act).
19.
Section(cid:160)83(b)(cid:160)Election.  If as a result of receiving an Award, a Holder receives Restricted Shares, then such 
Holder may elect under Section 83(b) of the Code to include in such person's gross income, for such person's taxable year in which 
the Restricted Shares are transferred to such Holder, the excess of the Fair Market Value (determined without regard to any 
Restriction other than one which by its terms will never lapse), of such Restricted Shares at the Date of Grant, over the amount (if 
any) paid for the Restricted Shares.  If the Holder makes the Section(cid:160)83(b) election described above, the Holder shall (i) make 
such election in a manner that is satisfactory to the Administrator, (ii) provide the Administrator with a copy of such election, (iii) 
promptly notify the Company if any Internal Revenue Service or state tax agent, on audit or otherwise, questions the validity or 
correctness of such election or of the amount of income reportable on account of such election, and (iv) pay the withholding 
amounts described in Section 15.
Vesting of Restricted Shares, Options or SARs Upon Retirement Vesting Date.  The unVested portion of 
each outstanding Award granted to a Holder in the form of Restricted Shares (other than those granted as Performance Awards,
20.

2004 Omnibus Stock and Incentive Plan for Denbury Resources Inc.
- 15 -
for which Vesting in connection with a Retirement Vesting Date is provided in Section 21 below), Options or SARs will vest 100% 
on the Holder's Retirement Vesting Date, provided that such date must be at least one year following the Date of Grant of such 
Award.
21.
Vesting of Performance Awards in Connection With Retirement Vesting Date.  The unVested portion of 
each Award granted to a Holder in the form of Performance Awards (or other forms of Awards which are newly instituted) will 
Vest in connection with a Holder's Retirement Vesting Date based on the express terms of each such Performance Award.
22.
Interpretation.

If any provision of this Plan is held invalid for any reason, such holding shall not affect the remaining 
provisions hereof, but instead this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provision had never been included in 
this Plan.

23.

authorization of the Board), may from time to time amend this Plan or any Award; provided, however, that (except to the extent 
provided in Section 9(b)) no such amendment may, without approval by the shareholders of the Parent, (a)(cid:160)increase the number 
of Reserved Shares or change the class of Eligible Persons, (b)(cid:160)permit the granting of Awards which expire beyond the maximum 
10-year period described in Section 9(a)(5), or (c) make any change for which applicable law or regulatory authority (including 
the regulatory authority of the NYSE or any other market or exchange on which the Common Stock is traded) would require 
shareholder approval or for which shareholder approval would be required for Awards to qualify as performance based awards 
under Section 162(m) of the Code; and provided, further, that no amendment or suspension of this Plan or any Award issued 
hereunder shall, except as specifically permitted in this Plan or under the terms of such Award, substantially impair any Award 
previously granted to any Holder without the consent of such Holder.
24.
Effective Date and Termination Date.  This Plan shall be effective as of the Effective Date, and shall terminate 
on the Termination Date; provided, without limitation, that unless otherwise expressly provided in an Award, the termination of 
this Plan shall not terminate an Award which is outstanding on such date.
25.
Section 409A.  Notwithstanding DSU Awards and RSU Awards, it is the intention of the Company that no Award 
shall be “deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code, unless and to the extent that the Committee specifically 
determines otherwise, and this Plan and the terms and conditions of all Awards shall be interpreted accordingly.(cid:160)(cid:160)The terms and

agreement, deferral election forms and procedures, and rules established by the Committee, and shall comply in all respects with 
Section 409A of the Code.(cid:160)(cid:160)The following rules will apply to Awards intended to be subject to Section 409A of the Code ("409A 
Awards"):

(b)
The Company shall have no authority to accelerate distributions relating to 409A Awards in excess of
the authority permitted under Section 409A.
(c)
Any distribution of a 409A Award following a Separation that would be subject to Code Section 409A
(a)(2)(A)(i) as a distribution following a Separation from service of a "specified employee" as defined under Code Section 
409A(a)(2)(B)(i), shall occur no earlier than the expiration of the six-month period following such Separation.
(d)
In the case of any distribution of a 409A Award, if the timing of such distribution is not otherwise 
specified in this Plan or an Award agreement or other governing document, the distribution shall be made not later than 
the end of the calendar year during which the settlement of the 409A Award is specified to occur.

forfeiture, if the time of such distribution or settlement is not otherwise specified in this Plan or an Award agreement or 
other governing document, the distribution or settlement shall be made not later than March 15 of the year following the 
year in which the Award Vested or the risk of forfeiture lapsed.

compensation” within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code shall be made in compliance with the requirements of 
Section 409A of the Code; (ii) any adjustments made pursuant to Section 11 of this Plan to Awards that are not considered 
“deferred compensation” subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be made in such a manner as to ensure that, after such 
adjustment, the Awards either continue not to be subject to Section 409A of the Code or comply with the requirements 
of Section 409A of the Code; (iii) the Administrator and the Committee shall not have the authority to make any adjustments 
pursuant to Section 11 of this Plan to the extent that the existence of such authority would cause an Award that is not 
intended to be subject to Section 409A of the Code to be subject thereto; and (iv) if any Award is subject to Section 409A 
of the Code, Section 10 of this Plan shall be applicable only to the extent specifically provided in the Award agreement

Delaware  corporation  (“DRI,”  and  together  with  its  subsidiaries,  collectively,  the  “Company”),  and  Robert  L.  Cornelius 
(“Cornelius”) on December(cid:160)18, 2013 (the “Execution Date”) and will become effective as of the end of the day on December 31, 
2013 (the “Effective Date”) unless earlier revoked by Cornelius pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 9(c).
W I T N E S S E T H:
WHEREAS, Cornelius has been employed by DRI since September 2006 and has served as an officer of DRI for over 
seven  years,  currently  serving  as  DRI’s  Senior Vice  President  -  Commercial  Development,  Government Affairs  and  Project 
Management;
WHEREAS, DRI and Cornelius have reached certain agreements as to the terms and conditions of Cornelius’ resignation 
as an officer, director, member and/or manager of the Company, and his continued employment related to operational, technical 
and engineering matters; and
WHEREAS, Cornelius has been in a position of special responsibility and trust with the Company during his employment, 
with access to highly sensitive, valuable, confidential and proprietary information regarding the Company’s methods of operations, 
current and future  business plans and strategies, personnel and finances, and other confidential and/or non-public information of 
the Company;
NOW, THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of  the  premises  and  mutual  covenants  herein  contained,  and  other  valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, DRI and Cornelius agree as follows:
1.
Resignation as Senior Vice President.  Cornelius and DRI agree that as of the end of business on the Effective 
Date, Cornelius shall resign as (a) Senior Vice President - Commercial Development, Government Affairs and Project Management 
of DRI and (b) an officer, director, member and/or manager of all other DRI subsidiaries, and shall not thereafter serve the Company 
in an officer’s, director’s, member’s or manager’s capacity.
2.
Resignation Consideration.  In exchange for, and in reliance on, the promises and covenants Cornelius makes 
in this Agreement, the Company covenants and agrees to pay or provide Cornelius with the following resignation compensation 
(the “Resignation Benefits”):
(a)
the  lump  sum  amount  of  $395,000.00  in  cash  (the  “Lump  Sum Amount”),  provided  that  on  or 
immediately prior to the date on which such one-time payment is to be made to Cornelius or, if earlier, the date on which 
an amount is required to be included in the income of Cornelius as a result of such payment, Cornelius shall be required 
to pay to the Company, in cash, the amount which the Company reasonably determines to be necessary in order for the 
Company to comply with applicable federal or state tax withholding and the collection of employment taxes.
(b)
During the Continuation Period (as defined below), the applicable premium payment under COBRA, 
when due, for Cornelius and his qualified beneficiaries for the cost of benefit continuation under the Company’s major 
medical benefit plan, dental plan and vision insurance program, but excluding coverage under the Company’s flexible 
spending account plan and other insurance or other benefits provided by the Company (“COBRA Benefits”) in which 
Cornelius has enrolled for the 2014 plan year, as such COBRA Benefits change as permitted by COBRA, beginning on 
January 1, 2014 and continuing and ending on June 30, 2015 (the “Continuation Period”).  If Cornelius does not properly 
elect COBRA coverage in accordance with the applicable benefit plans, Cornelius will not receive the COBRA Benefits. 
For purposes of clarity, the COBRA Benefits provided pursuant to this paragraph will run concurrently with any period 
of COBRA coverage Cornelius may be entitled to receive under applicable law and the applicable benefit plans, determined 
without regard to this paragraph.
(c)
The Company’s payment of the Resignation Benefits is subject to applicable federal, state, and local
taxes and withholding, specifically including the withholding from any benefits payable under Sections 2(a) and 2(b).
- 1 -
(d)
The payment of the Lump Sum Amount will be made, if possible, on the next regularly-scheduled 
payroll following the Effective Date, and in no event later than March 1, 2014, but only if this Agreement is not revoked 
pursuant  to,  and  in  accordance  with,  Section  9(c).  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein,  no 
Resignation Benefits or any other amounts shall be due or otherwise payable or commence under this Agreement if this 
Agreement is revoked pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 9(c).
3.
Equity Awards; Cash Awards.  Those equity awards (consisting of Stock Option Awards, a Performance Stock 
Award, Total Shareholder Return Performance Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Awards, and Stock Appreciation Rights Agreements) 
and cash awards (consisting of a Performance Cash  Award) held by Cornelius immediately prior to the Effective Date shall be 
treated, governed and interpreted according to the terms of such awards, and as applicable, of DRI’s equity compensation plans 
under which they have been issued, including the vesting provisions thereof, and in a manner which accommodates both Cornelius’ 
transition from a full-time employee to a part-time employee under the terms of Section 4 below, and his no longer being an officer 
of the Company as provided in Section 1 above.
4.
Continued  Employment.    Cornelius  shall  be  employed  by  the  Company  on  a  part-time  basis  for  work  on 
operational, technical and engineering matters and government affairs for the period (the “Employment Period”) commencing on 
the Effective Date and ending on October(cid:160)31, 2015 (the “Non-Competition Termination Date”), and in lieu of and in replacement 
of Cornelius’ current salary, during the Employment Period Cornelius shall be paid a salary at the rate of $24,000.00 per year in 
accordance  with,  and  subject  to,  the  Company’s  payroll  policies  that  apply  to  other  employees  of  the  Company.  Cornelius’ 
employment shall not require him to render services to the Company on a full-time basis, but consistent with the provisions of 
Section 6(d) hereof, on a basis as requested from time to time by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer or Chief Operating 
Officer, at such places as may reasonably be agreed upon.  In the event that Cornelius is requested to work more than five (5) full 
days during any calendar month, Cornelius shall be entitled to be paid an additional $1,000 per day for each additional full day 
worked, or a commensurate proportion of such $1,000 amount for less than a full day’s work.  In connection with Cornelius’ part-
time employment by the Company during the Employment Period, Cornelius shall be entitled to reimbursement for reasonable 
and necessary expenses incurred in furtherance of the Company’s business in accordance with the Company’s policies, and upon 
presentation of documentation in accordance with the expense reimbursement policies of the Company as they may exist from 
time to time, and submission to the Company of adequate documentation in accordance with federal income tax regulations.
5.
Non-Eligibility for Company Plans.  Other than as expressly set forth herein, after the Effective Date Cornelius 
will not be eligible to receive awards under DRI’s equity compensation plans made available to employees, nor will he be eligible 
to receive any severance benefits under the terms of any of DRI’s severance protection plans.
6.
Cornelius’ Non-Competition and Other Covenants and Agreements.  In consideration of the compensation paid 
and to be paid to Cornelius, to which Cornelius acknowledges he is not otherwise entitled, as well as the continued access to the 
Company’s confidential information during the Employment Period, and the agreements to be performed which are contained 
herein, Cornelius agrees to the following covenants as reasonable and necessary for the protection of the Company’s business 
interests:
(a)
Definitions:
“Competing Business” means any person or entity that competes with or would compete with or displace, or 
that engages in any other activities so similar in nature or purpose to those of the Company set forth below so as to compete 
with, or displace or attempt to compete with or displace (i) in those geographic areas where the Company currently has 
activities as of the Effective Date or where it anticipates doing future business as part of the Company’s business plan 
disclosed to or developed by or in consultation with Cornelius prior to the Effective Date, any of the activities of the 
Company which involve or encompass the purchase, ownership or development of CO2, in any form, CO2 pipelines, or 
the injection of CO2 into previously producing oil fields for the purpose of tertiary recovery of remaining oil, or (ii) in 
the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions where the Company currently has activities as of the Effective Date, the 
purchase, ownership or development of oil fields with remaining oil potentially recoverable through CO2 enhanced oil 
recovery operations.
- 2 -
as of the Execution Date, or hired by the Company prior to November(cid:160)1, 2015.
“Covered Persons” means any person employed by the Company either as an employee, consultant or advisor,
(b)
No Unfair Competition; Non-Solicitation Agreement.  Cornelius agrees that for the Employment
Period, Cornelius will not, either directly or indirectly (whether personally or through another business, entity or 
person):
work for, supervise, assist or participate in, a Competing Business in any capacity (as owner, 
(i) 
employee, consultant, advisor, contractor, officer, director, lender, investor, agent, or otherwise) or 
otherwise engage in any Competing Business, or
(1)(cid:160)recruit, solicit, or induce, (2)(cid:160)attempt to recruit, solicit or induce, or (3)(cid:160)encourage others 
(ii) 
to recruit, solicit or induce, any Covered Person to diminish, curtail, divert, or cancel its or their business 
relationship  with,  or  employment  by,  the  Company,  specifically  including  providing  directly  or 
indirectly a reference to a recruiter, acquaintance or competitor that an employee, consultant or advisor 
to the Company may be amenable to recruitment from a third party.
This Section creates a narrowly tailored restraint in order to avoid unfair competition and irreparable harm to 
the Company and is not intended or to be construed as a general restraint from Cornelius engaging in a lawful profession 
or a general covenant against competition in the oil and gas industry through the Non-Competition Termination Date.  To 
this end, within the constraints of the preceding provisions of this Section 6(b), DRI agrees that this Section 6(b) will not 
prohibit Cornelius’ work, engagement, or investment in the oil and gas industry (the “Activities”) so long as the Activities 
do not involve Cornelius or entities, persons or groups for whom Cornelius works, consults or invests (x) competing with 
or displacing the specified activities of the Company in those geographic areas or regions enumerated above in Section 
6(a), or (y) using the Company’s data or non-public business plans disclosed or known to Cornelius during his employment 
by the Company, in both cases provided that Cornelius obtains the prior express written approval of DRI’s Chief Executive 
Officer of any such work, engagement or investment in such Activities, provided that nothing in this Section 6 will prohibit 
the ownership of less than 10% of the publicly traded capital stock of an entity so long as this is not a controlling interest 
or mutual fund investments.
If Cornelius wishes to pursue the Activities prior to the Non-Competition Termination Date, he will present to 
the Chief Executive Officer of DRI, a written description of any such proposed Activities.  It is expected that any such 
proposal shall include, among other things and as applicable, (i) the geographical area within which Cornelius desires to 
pursue the Activities, (ii) the terms of any proposed acquisition of properties or leases, and (iii) a complete geological 
review of the proposal.  DRI agrees to respond in writing to Cornelius’s request within 10 business days of receipt of 
such written description, at the address provided in Section 11 below, stating DRI’s approval (which can only be provided 
by DRI’s Chief Executive Officer and which may be granted subject to the satisfaction of various conditions) or disapproval 
of such Activities and the specific reasons for any applicable disapproval to the extent DRI can do so without disclosing 
to Cornelius otherwise non-public information.  DRI agrees not to unreasonably withhold consent to Cornelius’ request 
to engage in future Activities.
(c)
No Personal Use of Company Oil and Gas Resources.  Cornelius agrees that in conjunction with his 
continuing employment by the Company, he will not utilize Company oil and gas resources, including, but not limited 
to, maps, seismic information, feasibility studies, personnel, computers, software, books and records, or any other corporate 
assets, in connection with the Activities for his own account or the account of any entity, persons or groups for whom he 
works or consults or in which he invests, unless DRI’s Chief Executive Officer provides his prior express written consent.
(d)
Cooperation and Assistance.  In exchange for the compensation, covenants, and other good and valuable 
consideration provided by DRI herein, Cornelius agrees that he will until the expiration of the Employment Period (i) 
make himself reasonably available to the Company to provide assistance to the Company as deemed necessary by the 
Company from time to time in its business operations; (ii) provide whatever cooperation and/or assistance is needed for 
any legal matters, proceedings or issues, the Company may face; and (iii) cooperate with and assist the Company and its 
employees in effecting an orderly transition of all functions, duties and responsibilities of Cornelius as an officer, director 
and manager to one or more other employees of the Company, as the Company shall reasonably request. Additionally, 
Cornelius agrees to provide such assistance in a professional manner, and in no event take any action that does, or could
- 3 -
reasonably, create a conflict of interest between himself and the Company, or that could subject either him or the Company 
to civil or criminal liability or is contrary to the policies or procedures of the Company.
(e)
Nondisparagement.  The parties hereto agree that they will refrain from engaging in any conduct, verbal 
or otherwise, that would disparage or harm the reputation of the other or, insofar as this Agreement pertains to DRI, its 
former and present parents, subsidiaries, and/or affiliates, along with its predecessors, successors and/or assigns, if any, 
as well as their respective former and present officers, directors, managers, general or limited partners, representatives, 
agents, employees and/or attorneys, if any, jointly and severally (collectively, the “DRI Released Parties”), and Cornelius 
further agrees that he will not say anything of a disparaging nature about the operations, management, or performance 
of the DRI Released Parties.  Such conduct shall include, but not be limited to, any negative statements made orally or 
in writing by either of the parties about the other or any of the DRI Released Parties.
Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit Cornelius from providing, or limiting, testimony in response to a valid 
subpoena, court order, regulatory request or other judicial, administrative or legal process or otherwise as required by 
law.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, Cornelius agrees to notify the Company as promptly as practicable after 
receiving any request for testimony or information in response to a subpoena, court order, regulatory request or other 
judicial, administrative or legal process or otherwise as required by law.
(f)
Confidential Information and Property.  Cornelius will be entitled to retain the Company-issued laptop 
computer, cellular telephone and iPad which he is currently using.  Cornelius agrees that he has returned, or within three 
(3) days after the Effective Date will return, to the Company any and all originals and/or copies of documents relating to 
the business of the Company or any of the other DRI Released Parties, although in conjunction with his part-time 
employment under the provisions of Section 4 above he may be provided with or have access to Company “confidential 
information,” which he will return to the Company upon request.  Cornelius further agrees that he will not directly or 
indirectly disclose to anyone, or use for his own benefit or the benefit of anyone other than the Company, any “confidential 
information” that he has received through his employment with the Company.  “Confidential information” shall be 
information that has been disclosed or made available to, or created by, Cornelius, and which was at the time of disclosure, 
availability or creation confidential or proprietary to the Company, and involves the Company’s current and future business 
plans and strategies, methods of operations or operational techniques, management and employee information, information 
regarding the Company’s practices and processes, or other non-public information.  Cornelius further agrees that in the 
event it appears that he will be compelled by law or judicial process to disclose any such confidential information to avoid 
potential liability, he will notify the Company in writing immediately upon his receipt of a subpoena or other legal process.
7.
Mutually Dependent.  The provisions of Section 4 above regarding Cornelius’ continued employment related to 
operational, technical and engineering matters and DRI’s continuing obligations to Cornelius which are related thereto, and the 
covenants and agreements of Cornelius set forth in Section 6 above, are mutually dependent, and Cornelius understands and agrees 
that a violation of any of the provisions of Section 6 above will be considered a material breach of this Agreement, and further 
acknowledges  and  agrees  that  irreparable  harm  to  the  Company  would  result  from  breach  by  him  of  any  such  provisions. 
Accordingly, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Cornelius will permanently forfeit any rights to 
continued employment by the Company as set out under the provisions of Section 4 above, and the Company may immediately 
terminate such employment, beginning on the date that either (i) Cornelius violates any provision of Section 6 above, or (ii) all or 
any part of, or the application of, Section 6 above is held or found invalid or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever by a court 
of competent jurisdiction in an action between Cornelius and DRI, and on such date any continuing obligations of the Company 
to Cornelius tied to his continued employment shall be extinguished.
8.
Release and Waiver by Parties.  For and in consideration of the payments provided to be made under the provisions 
of Section 2 above, and the continued employment by Cornelius under the provisions of Section 4 hereof, as well as the covenants 
contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Cornelius, on behalf of himself and his family, 
assigns, representatives, agents, and/or heirs, if any (collectively with Cornelius, the “Cornelius Parties”), hereby covenants not 
to sue and fully, finally and forever releases, acquits and discharges the DRI Released Parties from any and all claims, demands, 
actions, or liabilities of whatever kind or character, whether known or unknown, which the Cornelius Parties, or any one of them, 
has or might claim to have against the DRI Released Parties, or any one of them, for any and all injuries, damages (actual or 
punitive), losses, attorneys’ fees, if any, incurred by any Cornelius Party arising out of or in connection with any occurrence which 
transpired prior to the execution of this Agreement, including, without limitation:
- 4 -

without limitation, breach of contract, fraud, estoppel, misrepresentation, express or implied duties of good faith and fair 
dealing, wrongful discharge, discrimination, retaliation, harassment, negligence, gross negligence, false imprisonment, 
assault and battery, conspiracy, intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, slander, libel, defamation, refusal 
to perform an illegal act and invasion of privacy.

Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, the Americans With Disabilities Act, the Fair Labor 
Standards Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act as amended (except

Texas Government Code, as well as any claims for compensation of any nature whatsoever, employee benefits, vacation 
pay, expense reimbursement, consulting, equity awards, severance pay, pension or profit sharing benefits, health or welfare

Cash Awards,” and Paragraph 4, “Continued Employment.”

other injury, loss, damage or expense or any other legal or equitable remedy of any kind whatsoever.
(d)
All claims and causes of action arising out of or in any way connected with, directly or indirectly, 
Cornelius’ employment with the Company, or any incident thereof, including, without limitation his treatment by the 
Company; the terms and conditions of his employment; the manner or amounts in which Cornelius was paid or compensated 
by the Company; and the separation of Cornelius’ employment.
(e)
All claims and causes of action of any kind or character which could have been alleged in any lawsuit 
or administrative charge, claim or proceeding that could have been filed against the DRI Released Parties (or any one of 
them) by any Cornelius Party on its own behalf or on behalf of any other person.
Nothing  in  this Agreement  will  prevent  Cornelius  from  filing  a  charge  or  complaint  with  the  Equal  Employment 
Opportunity Commission or any other federal or state administrative agency, or participating in any investigation conducted by 
any federal or state administrative agency; provided, however, that Cornelius agrees that any right to personal legal or equitable 
relief he may have in connection with such charge, complaint or investigation are hereby barred.
Cornelius acknowledges and agrees that the compensation referenced in Section 2 above does not constitute monies to 
which he would otherwise be entitled as a result of his prior or current employment with the Company, and that these monies 
constitute fair and adequate compensation for the promises and covenants of Cornelius set forth in this Agreement.  Cornelius 
agrees and acknowledges that no further amounts are due to him for cash compensation of any nature whatsoever, including salary, 
severance pay, or bonuses, or for equity awards, employee benefits, deferred compensation, commissions, vacation pay, pension, 
profit sharing benefits, health or welfare benefits, expense reimbursement, consulting, outplacement services, attorneys’ fees, pay 
in lieu of notice, or for any other amounts, except as specifically set forth in Paragraph 2, “Resignation Consideration,” Paragraph 
3, “Equity Awards; Cash Awards,” and Paragraph 4, “Continued Employment.”
DRI also agrees not to sue and fully, finally and forever releases, acquits and discharges Cornelius from any and all claims, 
demands, actions or liabilities of whatever kind or character, whether known or unknown as of the Effective Date, which DRI or 
anyone acting on its behalf has or might claim to have against Cornelius for any and all injuries, damages (actual and punitive), 
losses, attorneys’ fees, if any, incurred by DRI.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, DRI 
acknowledges that the Indemnification Agreement dated September 1, 2006 by and between DRI and Cornelius shall continue in 
full force and effect pursuant to the terms set forth, and for all purposes contemplated, therein.

EXHIBIT A
DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES
1.
Applicable Law/Arbitration.  Venue for the arbitration provided under Section 17(a) of the Agreement shall 
be in Plano, Collin County, Texas.  Except for the limited rights described in Paragraph 9 below, the parties waive their right to 
file a lawsuit in a court of law to prosecute any Dispute.
2.
Negotiation.  When a Dispute has arisen and negotiations have reached an impasse, either party may give the 
other party written notice of the Dispute. In the event such notice is given, the parties shall attempt to resolve the Dispute promptly 
by negotiation.  Within ten (10) days after delivery of the notice, the receiving party shall submit to the other a written response. 
Thereafter, the parties shall promptly attempt to resolve the Dispute. All reasonable requests for information made by one party 
to the other will be honored.
3.
Confidentiality of Settlement Negotiations.  All negotiations and proceedings pursuant to Paragraph 2 above 
are confidential and shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence and 
any additional confidentiality protections provided by applicable law.
4.
Commencement of Arbitration.  If the Dispute has not been resolved by negotiation within fifteen (15) days 
of the disputing party’s notice, or if the parties have failed to confer within fifteen (15) days after delivery of the notice, either 
party may then initiate arbitration by providing written notice of arbitration to the other party.  In order to be valid, the notice shall 
contain a precise and complete statement of the Dispute. Within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice initiating arbitration, the 
receiving party shall respond by providing a written response which shall include its precise and complete response to the Dispute, 
and which includes any counter Dispute that the responding party may have.
5.
Selection of Arbitrator(s).  The arbitration may be conducted and decided by a single person that is mutually 
agreeable to the parties and knowledgeable and experienced in the type of matter that is the subject of the Dispute if a single 
arbitrator can be agreed upon by the parties.  If the parties cannot agree on a single arbitrator within ten (10) days of the date of 
the response to the notice of arbitration, then the arbitration shall be determined by a panel of three (3) arbitrators.  To select the 
three arbitrators, each party shall, within ten (10) days of the expiration of the foregoing ten day period, select a person that it 
believes has the qualifications set forth above as its designated arbitrator, and such arbitrators so designated shall mutually agree 
upon a similarly qualified third person to complete the arbitration panel and serve as its chairman.  In the event that the persons 
selected by the parties are unable to agree upon a third member of the arbitration panel within ten (10) days after the selection of 
the latter of the two arbitrators, then he/she shall be selected from the CPR (as defined below) panel using the CPR rules.  Once 
selected, no arbitrator shall have any ex parte communications with either party.
6.
Arbitration Process.  The arbitration hearing shall commence within a reasonable time after the selection of 
the arbitrator(s), as set by the arbitrator(s).  The arbitrator(s), shall allow the parties to engage in pre-hearing discovery, to include 
exchanging (i) requests for and production of relevant documents, (ii) up to fifteen (15) interrogatories, (iii) up to fifteen (15) 
requests for admissions, and producing for deposition and at the arbitration hearing, up to four (4) persons within each parties’ 
control.  Any additional discovery shall only occur by agreement of the parties or as ordered by the arbitrator(s) upon a finding of 
good cause.  The arbitration shall be conducted under the rules of the CPR International Institute for Conflict Prevention & 
Resolution (“CPR”) in effect on the date of notice of the Dispute for dispute resolution rules for non-administered arbitration of 
business disputes.  The parties may agree on such other rules to govern the arbitration that are not set out in this provision as they 
may mutually deem necessary.
7.
Arbitration Decision.  The arbitrator(s) shall have the power to award interim relief, and to grant specific

Exhibit 99
January 31, 2014
Denbury Resources Inc.
5320 Legacy Drive
Plano, Texas 75024
Ladies and Gentlemen:
Pursuant to your request, we have conducted a reserves evaluation of the net proved crude oil, condensate, natural gas 
liquids (NGL), and natural gas reserves, as of December 31, 2013, of certain properties that Denbury Resources Inc. (Denbury) 
has represented it owns. In addition, we have made estimates of the extent of Denbury's proved carbon dioxide reserves. We have 
also made estimates of certain proved helium reserves that Denbury has the right to extract and sell for a fee on behalf of the 
owners of the helium reserves. This evaluation was completed on January 31, 2014. The properties appraised consist of working 
and royalty interests located in the states of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. 
Denbury has represented that these properties account for 100 percent of Denbury's net proved reserves as of December 31, 2013. 
The net proved reserves estimates prepared by us have been prepared in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) 
(1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC. This report was prepared in accordance with guidelines specified in Item 1202(a)(8) of 
Regulation S-K and is to be used for inclusion in certain United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings by 
Denbury.
While Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC do not allow reporting of carbon dioxide or helium reserves, 
at your request we have evaluated the carbon dioxide and helium reserves using the technical and economic criteria of the SEC 
for petroleum reserves.
Reserves included herein are expressed as net reserves. Gross reserves are defined as the total estimated petroleum to be 
produced from these properties after December 31, 2013. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable 
to the interests owned by Denbury after deducting all interests owned by others.
Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, natural gas, carbon dioxide, and helium reserves and future net revenue should be 
regarded only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only 
are such reserves and revenue estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject 
to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such information.
Data used in this evaluation were obtained from reviews with Denbury personnel, Denbury files, from records on file 
with  the  appropriate  regulatory  agencies,  and  from  public  sources.  In  the  preparation  of  this  report  we  have  relied,  without 
independent verification, upon such information furnished by Denbury with respect to property interests, production from such 
properties, current costs of operation and development, current prices for production, agreements relating to current and future 
operations and sale of production, and various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination 
of the properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report.
Methodology and Procedures
Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles 
and techniques that are in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication 
of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled "Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves 
Information (Revision as of February 19, 2007)." The method or combination of methods used in the analysis of each reservoir 
was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production 
history.
When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP) and the original gas in 
place (OGIP). Structure and isopach maps were constructed to estimate reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core 
analyses, and other available data were used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and 
water saturation. When adequate data were available and when circumstances justified, material balance and other engineering 
methods were used to estimate OOIP or OGIP.
Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP or OGIP. These recovery factors 
were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the reservoirs, analyses of the petroleum, the structural positions of 
the properties, and the production histories. When applicable, material balance and other engineering methods were used to estimate 
recovery factors. An analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate, reservoir pressure, and gas-oil ratio behavior, 
was used in the estimation of reserves.
For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in producing-rate trends or other 
diagnostic  characteristics,  reserves  were  estimated  by  the  application  of  appropriate  decline  curves  or  other  performance 
relationships. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production or 
to the limit of the production licenses as appropriate.
Gas quantities estimated herein are expressed as sales gas. Sales gas is defined as that portion of the total gas to be 
delivered into a gas pipeline for sale after separation, processing, fuel use, and flare. Gas reserves are expressed at a temperature 
base of 60 degrees Fahrenheit (°F) and at the legal pressure base of the state in which the interest is located. Condensate reserves 
estimated herein are those to be recovered by conventional lease separation. NGL reserves are those attributed to the leasehold 
interests according to processing agreements.
Definition of Reserves
Petroleum reserves estimated by us and included in this report are classified as proved. Only proved reserves have been 
evaluated for this report. Reserves classifications used by us in this report are in accordance with the reserves definitions of Rules 
4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC. Reserves are judged to be economically producible in future years from known 
reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using 
conventional production methods and equipment. In the analyses of production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to 
the limit of economic rates of production under existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with 
the effective date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements 
but not including escalations based upon future conditions. The petroleum reserves are classified as follows:
Proved oil and gas reserves - Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of 
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given 
date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government 
regulations-prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal 
is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. The project 
to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the 
project within a reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the 
reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible 
oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii)  In  the  absence  of  data  on  fluid  contacts,  proved  quantities  in  a  reservoir  are  limited  by  the  lowest  known 
hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable 
technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the 
potential exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of 
the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact 
with reasonable certainty.
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including, 
but not limited to, fluid injection) are included m the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the 
reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence 
using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or 
program was based; and (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, 
including governmental entities.
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be 
determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period 
covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each 
month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon 
future conditions.
Developed oil and gas reserves - Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be 
recovered:
(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required 
equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the 
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves - Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to 
be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required 
for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are 
reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes 
reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted 
indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances justify a longer 
time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an 
application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have 
been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in [section 210.4-10 
(a) Definitions], or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.
The extent to which probable and possible reserves ultimately may be recategorized as proved reserves is dependent upon 
future drilling, testing, and well performance. The degree of risk to be applied in evaluating probable and possible reserves is 
influenced by economic and technological factors as well as the time element. No probable or possible reserves have been evaluated 
for this report. In this report, estimates of carbon dioxide and helium reserves have been prepared consistent with the evaluation 
criteria of the SEC for petroleum reserves.
Our estimates of Denbury's net proved reserves attributable to the reviewed properties are based on the definitions of 
proved reserves of the SEC and are as follows, expressed in thousands of barrels (Mbbl), millions of cubic feet (MMcf), and 
thousands of barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe):

In our opinion, the information relating to estimated proved reserves, estimated future net revenue from proved reserves, 
and present worth of estimated future net revenue from proved reserves of oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and gas contained 
in  this  report  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  Paragraphs  932-235-50-4,  932-235-50-6,  932-235-50-7,  932-235-50-9, 
932-235-50-30, and 932-235-50-31(a), (b), and (e) of the Accounting Standards Codification Topic 932, Extractive Industries - 
Oil and Gas of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and Rules 4-10(a) (1)-(32) of Regulation S-X and Rules 302(b), 1201, 
1202(a) (1), (2), (3), (4), (8), and 1203(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission; provided, however, that 
(i) future income tax expenses have not been taken into account in estimating the future net revenue and present worth values set 
forth herein and (ii) estimates of the proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves are not presented at the beginning of the 
year.
In addition to the natural gas reserves shown in the foregoing tabulation, Denbury's net proved carbon dioxide gas reserves 
in Mississippi and Wyoming, as of December 31, 2013, are estimated to be 7,700,339 MMcf. This amount includes 5,464,511 
MMcf  of  developed  reserves  and  2,235,828  MMcf  of  undeveloped  reserves.  Denbury's  proved  carbon  dioxide  gas  reserves 
attributable to its working interest are 7,961,140 MMcf, of which 5,184,769 MMcf are developed. The gross proved carbon dioxide 
reserves for the appraised properties are 11,923,625 MMcf, of which 9,130,625 MMcf are developed. Net helium reserves, all 
undeveloped, are estimated to be 13,251 MMcf. Denbury does not have title to helium, which is produced in conjunction with 
hydrocarbon and carbon dioxide fields operated by Denbury. While the U.S. Government retains title to the helium, Denbury has 
the right to extract and sell the helium for a fee. The helium reserves are presented net of the fee remitted to the U.S. Government. 
The carbon dioxide and helium reserves estimates have been prepared by applying the reserves definitions of Rules 4-10(a) (1)-
(32) of Regulation S-X of the SEC as those for natural gas. No revenue estimates have been made for the carbon dioxide and 
helium reserves.
Primary Economic Assumptions
The following economic assumptions were used for estimating existing and future prices and costs:
Oil and Condensate Prices
Denbury has represented that the oil and condensate prices were based on a 12-month average price (reference price), 
calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first(cid:173) day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-
month period prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Denbury 
supplied differentials by field to a NYMEX reference price of $96.94 per barrel and the prices were held constant 
thereafter. The volume-weighted average price was $100.35 per barrel.
NGL Prices
Denbury has represented that the NGL prices were based on a 12-month average price (reference price), calculated 
as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period
prior to the end of the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Denbury supplied 
differentials by field to a reference price of $96.94 per barrel and the prices were held constant thereafter. The volume-
weighted average price was $41.60 per barrel.
Natural Gas Prices
Denbury has represented that the natural gas prices were based on a reference price, calculated as the unweighted 
arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within the 12-month period prior to the end of 
the reporting period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements. The gas prices were calculated for each 
property using differentials to the NYMEX reference price of $3.671 per million British thermal units furnished by 
Denbury and held constant thereafter. The volume-weighted average price was $3.426 per thousand cubic feet.
Operating Expenses and Capital Costs
Operating expenses and capital costs, based on information provided by Denbury, were used in estimating future 
costs required to operate the properties. In certain cases, future costs, either higher or lower than existing costs, may 
have been used because of anticipated changes in operating conditions. These costs were not escalated for inflation.
Abandonment costs, net of salvage, were provided by Denbury for all properties.
The estimated future revenue and expenditures attributable to the production and sale of Denbury's net proved reserves
of the properties appraised, as of December 31, 2013, is summarized in thousands of dollars (M$) as follows:
Future Gross Revenue, M$

* Future income tax expenses were not taken into account in the preparation of these estimates.
Estimates of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, and natural gas reserves and future net revenue should be regarded 
only as estimates that may change as further production history and additional information become available. Not only are such 
reserves and revenue estimates based on that information which is currently available, but such estimates are also subject to the 
uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors.
While the oil and gas industry may be subject to regulatory changes from time to time that could affect an industry 
participant's ability to recover its oil and gas reserves, we are not aware of any such governmental actions which would restrict 
the recovery of the December 31, 2013, estimated oil and gas reserves. The reserves estimated in this report can be produced under
