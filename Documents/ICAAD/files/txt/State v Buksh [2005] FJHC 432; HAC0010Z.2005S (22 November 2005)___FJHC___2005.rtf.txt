Dr. J. Cameron for 1st & 5th Accused

RULING

Defence counsel make several applications in this case, arising from the rather unusual turn of events which have followed after the escape from custody, and apprehension of, the 3rd Accused, Are Aemai. The first, which I accept, is that Ms Malimali can no longer continue as counsel in this case after her withdrawal as counsel for the 3rd Accused. The second is, that the prosecution should be either temporarily or permanently stayed for abuse of the process, on the ground that the grant of State immunity to the 3rd Accused following his apprehension, would result in unfairness to the other accused. The third is that the trial is likely to be unfair to the 1st and 5th Accused on the ground that the prosecution has failed to particularise the basis of their prosecution.

The case history

Each of the five accused persons, is charged with the murder of Ashok Kumar on the 7th of January 2005 at Samabula. The basis of the prosecution case, as State counsel has declared from the earliest pre-trial conference hearing, is that the 2nd Accused actually caused the death of the deceased, by tying a ligature around his neck, with malice aforethought, and that the other accused persons are prosecuted with him, for murder on the basis of the law of joint enterprise. Counsel for the 1st and 5th Accused has made representations to the DPP indicating willingness to plead to the lesser charge of robbery with violence, but the State has chosen to proceed with the murder charge.

All counsel have declared the positions of their clients at the outset. The 1st and 5th Accused will not dispute their presence during the incident but will deny any knowledge of the murder, or any foresight of the murder. They will say that the murder was not a probable consequence of the robbery.

The 2nd Accused will not dispute presence at the scene, or the tying of the ligature. He will dispute causation and malice aforethought. The 3rd and 4th Accused initially disputed their presence at the scene. They both indicated their intention to call alibi evidence. They therefore both disputed the admissibility and truth of their police interviews and the trial commenced with a trial within a trial to determine admissibility. However on the morning of the trial, the 3rd Accused absented himself by escaping from police custody. The State filed a new Information excluding the 3rd Accused and the trial proceeded on that basis. The assessors were sworn in, and were excused for the trial within a trial. In the middle of the trial within a trial, the 3rd Accused was apprehended. He spoke to Ms Malimali, who also represented the 4th Accused, and said that he no longer disputed his interview, no longer disputed his presence at the scene, but did dispute a joint enterprise and that the murder was a probable consequence of the planned robbery. He offered himself as a State witness. The State agreed to grant him immunity from prosecution in return for a plea to robbery with violence. Simultaneously Ms Malimali informed the court that the defences run by the 3rd and 4th Accused were now conflicting and that she could not represent the 3rd Accused any further. I agreed that their defences were in conflict, because the 3rd Accused had named the 4th Accused as one of the persons involved in the incident. I granted her leave to withdraw as counsel for the 3rd Accused.

At the end of the trial within a trial, I ruled that the 4th Accuseds admissions were admissible and were given voluntarily. Ms Malimali then applied to withdraw as counsel for the 4th Accused, saying that she could not, in all conscience, cross-examine the 3rd Accused as a witness when she was formerly his lawyer.

I called for submissions from all counsel at the stage of the trial. All counsel agree that Ms Malimali cannot, as a matter of professional ethics, continue as counsel in this case. My attention was drawn to the case of Fordham v. The Legal Practitioners Complaints Committee (1998) High Court of Australia, 22 October 1998, which is authority for the proposition that a legal practitioner should not be in a position whereby he or she must cross-examine a former client in a matter in which he/she has received instructions from that client. The conflict is obvious. There is a real possibility of the 4th Accuseds defence being prejudiced by his counsels dilemma. Ms Malimali was given leave to withdraw.

The 3rd and 4th Accused are now unrepresented. Although the 3rd Accused is no longer, strictly speaking, an accused in the case before me, it is desirable that he be given legal advice before he accepts the States offer of conditional immunity. In the case of the 4th Accused, he is now unrepresented through no fault of his own. This will not be a simple case (if there is any such a thing as a simple case). I will be hearing submissions on joint enterprise, probable consequence, causation and malice aforethought. One or more of the accused, may give sworn evidence and the other accused persons may cross-examine. The question of the status of a witness who is given immunity will arise. It is clearly desirable that the 4th Accused is represented, to prevent the risk of prejudice. An adjournment to allow him to obtain the services of counsel, is the only logical step to take at this stage.

Abuse of the Process

Counsel for the 1st and 5th Accused however, submits that the trial be permanently stayed on the ground that it would be an abuse of the process to continue with it. He says that not only is it unclear why his clients have been charged, but that the grant of immunity to a man who has given several inconsistent stories about his involvement in this case is so unreasonable, that the DPPs decision to grant him immunity must be an abuse of the prosecution process.

In relation to the alleged lack of clarity in the States position in relation to the 1st and 5th Accused, I cannot agree with counsel that the accused persons are prejudiced by the nature of the disclosure. Both the 1st and 5th Accused admitted, to the police, their involvement in a robbery on the deceased. The 1st Accused in his statement (which he will not dispute) said that he arranged to meet with the 2nd Accused on the 6th of January 2005, in order to rob the deceaseds shop with him. It was always contemplated, that the deceased would be in the shop at the time of the robbery, and that it would be the 2nd Accuseds responsibility to hold the owner of the shop to allow a search to be conducted. Later he told the 2nd Accused, to cover the deceaseds eyes with a scarf. He also said that saw the 2nd Accused punching the deceased. Whether the tying of the face, and the punching are probable consequences both in an objective and subjective sense, must surely be a matter for the assessors, or for the trial court having heard all the prosecution evidence. I see no lack of clarity in the prosecution position at this stage of the trial in relation to the 1st Accused.

The 5th Accused in his statement (the contents of which he does not dispute either) admitted that on the 7th of January 2005, between 5am and 6am, he was waiting outside the deceaseds shop with the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Accused, to rob the deceased. The details of the plan had been told to him by the 2nd Accused, who also told them that an Indian boy had discussed the plan with him previously. The way in which the interview continued could be read as implying a consent to the plan. They all went to the shop. At Q45, the 5th Accuseds answer was: Upon arrival Jitoko then showed us the shop and we separated in twos to wait for the Indian man according to the plan. That plan, according to his answer at Q46 was: For myself and Are to wait for Pau and Jitoko after they had tied the Indian man then for us to run into the shop.

There is an admission therefore of a plan to inflict some sort of force, and that all the accused excluding the 1st Accused was party to the plan. Whether the death of the deceased, who was the anticipated victim of the alleged robbery with violence, was a probable consequence of the plan is a question of fact for the assessors. I cannot accept therefore, in relation to the 5th Accused that there is a lack of clarity in the disclosed prosecution case. Certainly there are no grounds to order a temporary stay of proceedings on the ground of insufficient disclosure.

The next issue raised by defence counsel, is abuse of the process on the part of the prosecution. The common law on a judicial stay of proceedings for abuse of process developed to protect persons from being prosecuted in circumstances where it would be seriously unjust to do so. (Attorney-General of Trinidad and Tobago v. Phillip [1995] 1 AC 396). An abuse of the process is something so unfair and wrong that the courts should not allow a prosecutor to proceed with what is in all other respects a regular proceeding. The two main grounds for the exercise of a stay are, firstly where the accused would not receive a fair trial and secondly where it would be unfair for the accused to be tried at all. This second ground would include cases where the prosecution has manipulated or misused a process of the court to deprive the accused of a protection provided by the law, or to take unfair advantage of a technicality (R v. Derby Crown Court ex parte Brooks, 80 Cr. App. R. 164). Also included are cases where it would be contrary to the public interest in the integrity of the criminal justice system that a trial should take place (R v. Mullen [1999] 2 Cr. App. R. 143). An example of the latter was the case of R v. Horseferry Road Magistrates Court ex p Bennet [1994] 1 AC 42. In that case the accused had been taken to Britain as a result of collaboration between British and foreign government authorities, in disregard of extradition procedures. If the accused had been taken to Britain as a result of extradition proceedings, he would certainly have received a fair trial. Indeed it was not suggested, despite the offending collaboration, that the accused would not receive a fair trial. Nevertheless, the House of Lords held that the court had the power to interfere with the prosecution because the judiciary accepted a responsibility for the maintenance of the rule of law which included a check on executive action and the refusal to tolerate conduct which threatened basic human rights or the rule of law (per Griffiths L.J).

Where the complaint is of prosecution misconduct, such as late or no disclosure, the defence must show, on a balance of probabilities (R v. Telford JJ ex p Badhan [1991] 2 QB 78, 93 Cr. App. R. 171) that it is not possible for the accused to have a fair trial. Further, a stay will not be granted where the trial itself has a process which may deal with the complaint. Thus matters such as complaints of the improper obtaining of evidence, or the tampering with evidence would not normally amount to an abuse of the courts process, because these are trial issues. (Attorney-Generals Reference (No. 1 of 1990) [1992] QB 630).

The matter complained of in this trial, is the granting of immunity to the 3rd Accused. Counsel says that the 3rd Accused is so unreliable a witness that no reasonable prosecutor would consider granting him State immunity. State counsel says that the decision is one for the DPP, that all counsel may cross-examine the 3rd Accused, and that the decision to grant the 3rd Accused immunity was based on a concern that Ms Malimali was in a position of conflict, that the 3rd Accused was unrepresented and that he would probably be granted an adjournment to brief counsel. This then would result in delay which would affect the remaining accused person, all of whom had a right to a trial within a reasonable time.

It is not suggested that the State has deliberately manipulated the courts process for some dishonest or improper motive. What is alleged is unreasonableness.

I am not persuaded that this is a suitable case for a stay of proceedings. If the State has chosen to grant immunity to an accused person in exchange for a reduction of the charge, each counsel will have the opportunity to cross-examine him. The assessors can draw their own conclusions. This surely is a trial issue, and I see no resulting prejudice to the other accused. To suggest that the State should continue to prosecute the 3rd Accused with murder, or to suggest that immunity should instead be granted to the 1st or 5th Accused, would be tantamount to a direct interference with the DPPs discretion to prosecute. In the absence of evidence that the DPP is in some way deliberately manipulating or abusing the court process, such interference cannot be justified.

In Hui Chui-Ming v. R [1992] 1 AC 34, the Privy Council considered a prosecutorial decision to prosecute a secondary party for murder, when the principal offender had been convicted of manslaughter and pleas of guilty to manslaughter had been accepted from other secondary offenders. The court held that this decision was not oppressive nor an abuse of the process of the court. The appellant had chosen to run a defence which, if it had succeeded, would have resulted in an acquittal rather than conviction for manslaughter.

Examples of improper prosecution conduct, which have led to stays include a decision to recharge the accused on charges which were fundamentally the same as charges for which another court had found no case to answer (R v. Horsham JJ ex p Reeves 75 Cr. App. R. 236) and a decision by the prosecution in R v. Lincoln Magistrates Court ex parte Wickes Building Supplies Ltd, The Times August 6 1993, to deliberately accumulate Informations at a time when the law in relation to Sunday trading was uncertain because of a challenge in the European Court of Justice, and when there was no possibility of immediate conviction so that the Sunday trading was in effect stayed until further notice. In R v. Brentford JJ ex parte Wong 73 Cr. App. R. 65, a prosecutor before reaching a final decision to prosecute, laid a charge just within the statutory time limit, so he could keep his options open. This was held to be a manipulation of the courts process especially when the accused was not summoned for several months thereafter.

On a consideration of the principles of the common law on judicial stay of prosecutions, I consider that there is no manipulation of the court process by the prosecution. Indeed, it appears that the prosecutions primary concern is delay and ensuring that all accused are represented. These are concerns shared by the court, and no doubt by the defence. If the decision to grant immunity is an unwise one, as submitted by defence counsel, then the prosecution must deal with that alleged lack of wisdom, within the trial process itself. I see no prejudice to the other accused.

However, an adjournment is now inevitable, because the 4th Accused is, in effect unrepresented. Fortunately, no evidence has been led before the assessors, so the delay in proceeding to trial will not jeopardize their ability to remember the evidence. Subject to counsels availability, I am able to continue with this trial on the 18th of January 2006. In the meantime, every effort will be made by the court to obtain the services of a lawyer for the 4th Accused.

The application for stay and for more details of the charge are refused. The trial is adjourned.
