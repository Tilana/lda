<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted a 
</p>
<p>country visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 21 May to 3 June 2009, 
during which she met with senior Government officials and a broad range of human 
rights defenders. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights 
defenders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in light of the principles set forth in 
the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of 
Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms (hereafter the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders). 
</p>
<p>Following an introductory section, in section II the Special Rapporteur describes 
the legal and institutional framework for the promotion and protection of human rights in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. While the legal framework for the protection of 
human rights has been progressively strengthened over the years, it remains marred by 
severe gaps and shortcomings that result in the diluting of any benefits that human rights 
defenders could draw from positive developments. In addition, the Special Rapporteur 
notes the existence of several institutions aimed at upholding human rights, which on 
paper may have a positive impact on the work of human rights defenders, but devoid of 
adequate financial and human resources, and strong political support, are doomed to 
failure. 
</p>
<p>In section III, the Special Rapporteur details the current challenges faced by 
human rights defenders in the country in their legitimate activities. After giving an 
overview of the civil society in the country, she points out the stigmatization and the 
related insecurity suffered by defenders, who are killed, disappeared, tortured, 
threatened, arbitrarily arrested and detained, under surveillance, banned from travelling, 
displaced or forced into exile. Another cause of great concern is the widespread impunity 
for violations committed against defenders by State authorities and members of armed 
groups. Finally, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern about illegitimate restrictions 
on the exercise of the right to association, the right to peaceful assembly and the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>In section IV, the Special Rapporteur presents the important role played by the 
international community in contributing to a safe environment for human rights 
defenders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>Finally, in section V, the Special Rapporteur formulates her conclusions and 
recommendations for consideration by all stakeholders.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 and Human Rights Council 
resolution 7/8, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders conducted 
an official visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 21 May to 3 June 2009, at 
the invitation of the Government.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur also visited the country in her capacity as one of the seven 
thematic special procedures mandated to report on the progress made with regard to 
technical assistance to the Government and on the development of the situation in the east 
of the country, further to Council resolution 10/33 adopted in March 2009. A separate 
report, which should be read in conjunction with the present one, will be submitted to the 
Human Rights Council at its thirteenth session. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur was unable to undertake the visit jointly with Reine Alapini-
Gansou, then Special Rapporteur on human rights defenders of the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, due to calendar restraints, as initially planned. The Special 
Rapporteur still believes that joint visits between United Nations special procedures and 
regional mechanisms constitute a best practice for raising awareness about the situation of 
human rights defenders and mutually reinforcing each mandate, and she will pursue such 
collaboration. 
</p>
<p>4. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation of human rights defenders in the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo in light of the principles set forth in the Declaration on 
the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and 
Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereinafter 
&#8220;the Declaration on human rights defenders&#8221; or &#8220;the Declaration&#8221;). An examination of the 
legal framework in the country, the institutional policies, and the mechanisms for 
promotion and protection of human rights were of particular importance to this assessment.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its ongoing 
cooperation with special procedures of the Human Rights Council, for extending the 
invitation to her, and for its collaboration prior to and during the mission. During her visit, 
she had the opportunity to meet with the Prime Minister; the Minister for Human Rights; 
the Minister for Gender, the Family and the Child; the Minister of Communications; the 
Advisor in charge of the judicial reform within the Ministry of Justice; the President of the 
Senate; the President of the National Assembly; the Head of the national police <i>(</i>Police 
Nationale du Congo, or PNC); and the Special Advisor to the President on security issues. 
The Special Rapporteur regrets that she was unable to meet the Minister of Justice, despite 
repeated requests. 
</p>
<p>6. In addition to Kinshasa, the Special Rapporteur visited Kananga (Western Kasa&#239; 
province) and Bukavu (South Kivu) where she met with the respective governors and local 
authorities, including the police and the military. Due to logistical constraints, she was 
unable to visit Kisangani (Oriental province) as initially planned. Throughout her stay in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Special Rapporteur met with a broad segment of 
civil society and with human rights defenders engaged in a wide range of civil, political, 
economic, social and cultural rights work.  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank all organizations and individuals who 
worked hard to coordinate her meetings with the defender&#8217;s community. In particular, she 
would like to thank the Special Representative of the Secretary-General in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo (MONUC), his Deputy for Rule of Law, the Director of the United </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Nations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO), his Deputy, staff in Kinshasa, Kananga and 
Bukavu, and Heads of MONUC in Kananga and Bukavu, for the excellent support provided 
in organizing the visit.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Legal and institutional framework for the promotion  
and protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Domestic level 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Constitution 
</i></p>
<p>8. The Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, adopted in 2005 and 
promulgated in 2006, expresses, in its preamble, the Congolese people&#8217;s attachment to 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, as contained in the international legal instruments 
to which the country has acceded. It stresses that these rights and freedoms form part of the 
Constitution. Article 215 further provides that duly ratified or approved international 
instruments, once published, take precedence over national legislation. 
</p>
<p>9. Title II of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo encompasses a 
set of human rights, with the first chapter devoted to civil and political rights and the 
second to economic, social and cultural rights. These rights include, inter alia, the right to 
equal treatment before the law (art. 12), the right to be free from discriminatory treatment 
based upon any grounds whatsoever (art. 13), the right to life and to physical and mental 
integrity (art.  16), the right to liberty of person (art. 17), the right to freedom of thought, 
conscience, or religion (art. 22), the right to freedom of opinion and expression (art. 23), the 
right to freedom of the press (art. 24), the right to freedom of association (arts. 25, 37 and 
38), the right to freedom of assembly (art. 26), the right to freedom of movement (art. 30), 
the right to private property (art. 34), the right to work (art. 36), the right to strike (art. 39), 
the right to education (art. 43), the right to take part in cultural activity (art. 46),  the right to 
health and food security (art. 47) and the right to adequate housing (art. 48).  
</p>
<p><i> (b) The 2001 law on freedom of association 
</i></p>
<p>10. Law No. 004/01 of 20 July 2001 on non-profit organizations and institutions of 
public benefit (&#8220;&#233;tablissements d&#8217;utilit&#233; publique&#8221;) governs the exercise of the right to 
freedom of association for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working for the 
promotion and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p><i> (c)  The 2006 circular note on freedom of peaceful assembly  
</i></p>
<p>11. Article 26 of the 2006 Constitution replaced the principle of pre-required 
authorization to hold public demonstrations with the principle of pre-required notification. 
The note of the Ministry of Interior No. 002/2006 of 29 June 2006 on public meetings and 
manifestations, addressed to provincial governors and the city of Kinshasa, endorsed this 
new regime. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) The 1996 law on freedom of the press 
</i></p>
<p>12. In addition to articles 23 and 24 of the 2006 Constitution, article 8 of Law No. 96-
002 of 22 June 1996 guarantees the freedom of the press and spells out the modalities of the 
exercise of such freedom. A draft law amending Law No. 96-002, which proposes to 
decriminalize a number of press offences and to reduce the harshness of the current range </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>of sanctions, has reportedly been prepared by the Government, but has not yet been 
submitted to the Parliament.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Regional level 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has ratified the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights, and its Protocol on the establishment of an African Court on Human 
and Peoples&#180; Rights. Furthermore, it has signed the Protocol to the Charter on Human and 
Peoples&#8217; Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa.  
</p>
<p>14. The Democratic Republic of the Congo participated in the First Organization of 
African Unity Ministerial Conference on Human Rights in Africa, held from 12 to 16 April 
1999 in Grand Bay, Mauritius. At the end of the conference, the Grand Bay Declaration and 
Plan of Action were adopted. Article 19 of the Declaration states that &#8220;[t]he Conference 
notes that the adoption of the Declaration on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders by 
the fifty-fourth session of the former United Nations Commission on Human Rights marks 
a significant turning point, and calls on African Governments to take appropriate steps to 
implement the Declaration in Africa&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>15. The Democratic Republic of the Congo also participated in the First African Union 
Ministerial Conference on Human Rights in Africa, held on 8 May 2003 in Rwanda, at the 
end of which the Kigali Declaration was adopted. Article 28 of the Declaration provides 
that &#8220;the Conference&#8230; recognizes the important role of civil society organizations (CSOs) 
in general, and human rights defenders in particular, in the promotion and protection of 
human rights in Africa; calls upon Member States and regional institutions to protect them 
and encourage the participation of CSOs in decision-making processes with the aim of 
consolidating participatory democracy and sustainable development; and underscores the 
need for CSOs to be independent and transparent&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>16. The International Organization of the Francophonie (IOF), of which the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo is a member State, adopted the 2000 Bamako Declaration. Article 
4(D)(23) states that the IOF commits itself to &#8220;establishing, mainstreaming and 
strengthening national institutions of promotion of human rights, consultative or not, and to 
supporting the creation within national administrative structures dedicated to human rights, 
as well as the work of human rights defenders&#8221;. In 2006, the IOF further adopted the Saint-
Boniface Declaration. Article 31 of the Declaration states that Ministers and Heads of 
French-speaking State delegations &#8220;commit to promoting the work of human rights 
defenders and to ensuring their protection&#8221;. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. International level 
</b></p>
<p>17. As at August 2009, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a State party to the 
major United Nations human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights and its Optional Protocol concerning the right of individual petition; 
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women; the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; and the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child and its Optional Protocols on the involvement of children in armed conflict as 
well as on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>18. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also a party to the Geneva Conventions of 
12 August 1949 and to their Additional Protocols I and II, the Convention on the 
Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, as well as to the Rome Statute.  </p>

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Ministry for Human Rights  
</b></p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Human Rights, who apprised her 
of the mandate of his Ministry. Pursuant to ordinance No. 08/074 of 24 December 2008, the 
functions of the Ministry are, inter alia, the promotion and protection of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms; the popularization and education of human rights; the monitoring of 
the respect for human rights; the examination of blatant cases of human rights violations; 
and the drafting and submission of initial and periodic reports to international and regional 
human rights treaty bodies. The Ministry for Human Rights has reportedly started to 
reactivate provincial representations throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>20. The Minister for Human Rights stated that the protection of human rights defenders 
is a daily concern for his Ministry. The Minister reportedly meets regularly with members 
of civil society. He stressed the necessity to sensitize all actors on the legitimate work of 
human rights defenders. To this end, he mentioned the relevance of passing a national law 
on the protection of human rights defenders. He further acknowledged the necessity to 
translate the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders into the four main local languages. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Ministry for Gender, Family and Children 
</b></p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Gender, Family and Children. The 
Ministry is in charge, inter alia, of studying and implementing all measures which aim at 
ending all forms of discrimination and violence against women, and ensuring the 
participation of women in the development of the nation and a significant gender 
representation within national, provincial and local institutions. The Minister for Gender, 
Family and Children mentioned the establishment in March 2009 of local women councils 
(<i>conseils locaux de la femme</i>), which are participatory mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>22. The Minister for Gender, Family and Children expressed her full support for the 
work of women defenders and for the adoption of a national law on the protection of human 
rights defenders.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. The Inter-ministerial technical committee on drafting and following up on initial and 
periodic human rights reports 
</b></p>
<p>23. This committee was established in 2001 by a decree of the Minister for Human 
Rights. Besides the drafting of reports, the Committee is mandated to monitor the 
implementation of human rights treaties, as well as the recommendations emanating from 
human rights treaty bodies.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. The human rights liaison entity (<i>entit&#233; de liaison</i>) 
</b></p>
<p>24. On 12 August 2009, the Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo  
signed a decree on the establishment, organization and functioning of the human rights 
liaison entity, which is designed to be a framework for consultation and collaboration with 
regards to human rights in the country. This entity is composed of the Minister for Human 
Rights, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Defence, the Minister of Justice, the 
Minister for Gender, Family and Children, members of Parliament, the Attorney General 
and the Heads of the PNC, the armed forces (FARDC) and the national intelligence agency, 
ANR (Agence nationale des renseignements), the Head of UNJHRO and his Deputy, and 
two civil-society representatives. At the time of drafting the present report, the decree had 
yet to be implemented by the Minister for Human Rights. The Special Rapporteur would 
like to be fully apprised on the achievements of this entity by the Government in March 
</p><p>2010.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Superior Council of Audiovisual and Communication 
</b></p>
<p>25. Article 112 of the 2006 Constitution allows for the establishment of a Superior 
Council of Audiovisual and Communication  which mission is to &#8220;guarantee and ensure 
freedom and protection of the press, as well as of all means of mass communication, while 
respecting the law&#8221;. It monitors the respect of ethics with regard to information and 
equitable access for political parties, associations and citizens to official means of 
information and communication&#8221;. At the time of drafting the present report, the draft law 
on the organization and functioning of the Superior Council of Audiovisual and 
Communication had been passed by the National Assembly and the Senate, and was 
pending before the Supreme Court of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. Legislative Human Rights Network 
</b></p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur held meetings with the President of the Senate, the President 
of the National Assembly and groups of Parliamentarians from the Governing party and 
opposition. The Special Rapporteur was informed of the creation of a human rights network 
within the national Parliament, composed of members of the Senate and the National 
Assembly. The mandate of this network is reportedly to alert Parliamentarians on serious 
human rights issues which require the urgent attention of the Parliament, and to initiate 
and/or support pertinent draft laws. While the Special Rapporteur was not apprised of the 
achievements of this network since its inception, she nevertheless thinks it has the potential 
to improve the situation of human rights defenders by channelling concerns on their 
situation. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Law enforcement authorities 
</b></p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to meet the heads of the national and 
provincial PNC, heads of provincial FARDC, and the Special Adviser to the President on 
security issues. 
</p>
<p>28. The national head of the PNC in Kinshasa informed the Special Rapporteur that a 
human rights focal point within the police collaborates with all NGOs which are willing to 
work with the police. This is allegedly an opening on the part of the PNC. MONUC-
Bukavu praised the provincial head of the police in Bukavu for its handling of public 
demonstrations, in close collaboration with MONUC-police.  
</p>
<p>29. The head of the military in Kananga mentioned the existence of a human rights focal 
point within the army, who briefs his hierarchy about grievances brought to his attention. 
He added that at each military parade, the commander delivers a message concerning 
respect for human rights and eradication of sexual violence. The heads of the military in 
Kananga and Bukavu acknowledged that soldiers sometimes commit human rights 
violations, and drastic action is taken against them. Training on the rule of law by MONUC 
was delivered to army officers and members of the military court. A military prosecutor 
(<i>auditeur de garnison</i>) in Kananga said that NGOs are important collaborators who report 
violations committed by soldiers to him, which triggers action from the court.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Special Adviser to the President on 
security issues that the intelligence service, ANR, has its own prerogatives, different from 
those of the police: ANR has the competence to arrest people because, according to the 
Special Advisor, the boundary between public security and State security is not clearly 
defined. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Follow-up committees on human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>31. Two follow-up committees were established at the provincial level in a joint effort 
by MONUC, the PNC and the FARDC to look at complaints brought by civilians against </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>Congolese law enforcement authorities. These committees are supposed to meet once a 
month, and a monthly report is normally prepared by both committees.  
</p>
<p><b> 9. Judicial system 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur was briefed by the advisor in charge of judicial reform 
within the Ministry of Justice on the ongoing judicial reform in the country. Law No. 
08/013 of 5 August 2008 established a higher judicial committee. A Supreme Civil Court 
(Cour de cassation) and a Supreme Administrative Court (Conseil d&#8217;Etat) are still to be 
established. The Plan for the Reform of the Justice System contains a human rights section, 
and specifically mentions the work of defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Shortcomings in the legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Shortcomings in the legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>33. While the legal framework for the protection of human rights has been progressively 
strengthened over the years, it remains marred by severe gaps and shortcomings that result 
in the diluting of any benefits that human rights defenders could draw from positive 
developments. Indeed, the absence of a specific legal framework protecting human rights 
defenders contributes to a large extent to their highly precarious situation in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur firmly believes that the adoption of a national law on the 
protection of human rights defenders, including women defenders, will certainly enhance 
and give legitimacy to their work.1<b> </b>The Special Rapporteur voiced her concern in that 
regard with the President of the National Assembly, the President of the Senate and groups 
of Parliamentarians from the governing party and the opposition. She welcomed the 
acknowledgement made by the President of the National Assembly and the President of the 
Senate of the necessity to adopt such legislation, and was encouraged by their willingness 
to examine a future draft law during their next session. To this end, the Special Rapporteur 
called on human rights defenders to unite their efforts in proposing a sound draft law on the 
protection of human rights defenders to Parliamentarians willing to sponsor such initiative, 
in consultation with key international stakeholders, including the UNJHRO. This is a 
unique opportunity for human rights defenders to initiate a process which aims at 
concretely ensuring a safer, more enabling and more accepting environment for their work. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur further believes that national legislation on the protection of 
human rights defenders is by no means incompatible with similar initiatives at the 
provincial level. In that regard, she welcomed the recent attempt to adopt a similar law in 
the South Kivu province, and called on provincial parliamentarians to adopt a revised text 
in the near future, in close consultation with civil society and UNJHRO. A clear reference 
should be given regarding the legitimate work of women defenders. Such adoption at the 
provincial level will be landmark setting an example, not only for the whole country, but 
also for the African continent.  
</p>
<p>36. While meeting Parliamentarians, the Special Rapporteur inquired about the status of 
the draft law on the establishment of a national human rights commission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. She was informed that the draft law was adopted by the Senate in 
July 2008, and was still pending before the National Assembly. At the time of drafting the 
</p>
<p>  
 1 As already stated in the combined report of seven thematic special procedures on technical assistance 
</p>
<p>to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and urgent examination of the situation 
in the east of the country (A/HRC/10/59) of 5 March 2009, para. 114. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>present report, no progress had reportedly been made towards the adoption of this law. The 
Special Rapporteur calls upon the National Assembly to finalize such adoption as soon as 
possible. The Special Rapporteur believes that the adoption of this law has the potential to 
support and strengthen the work of human rights defenders, should the Paris Principles 
relating to the status of national human rights institutions be fully respected. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>37. Another serious concern for the Special Rapporteur is the absence of a legal 
framework governing the activities and prerogatives of the ANR. From the discussions the 
Special Rapporteur had with different parties, including the Special Adviser to the President 
on security matters, it appears that the boundaries between the powers and prerogatives of 
the police, military and ANR are not clear. Human rights defenders are often held 
incommunicado in ANR detention facilities, with no access to UNJHRO officers and 
others, and with no judicial oversight, despite the fact that the President of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo issued a directive on 5 July 2005 ordering all security forces, 
intelligence services and judicial authorities to provide unhindered access to UNJHRO 
staff. In fact, ANR assumes several functions which are usually carried out by the police 
and military services in many countries. The adoption of a legal framework for the 
activities and prerogatives of ANR should be in accordance with the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur voices further concern about the lack of implementation at 
the legislative level of article 156 of the 2006 Constitution which limits the jurisdiction of 
military courts to offences committed by members of the armed forces and the national 
police. This important constitutional provision has yet to be incorporated into the Military 
Judicial Code, which provides the military justice system with jurisdiction over civilians, 
and therefore human rights defenders, in several instances. 
</p>
<p>39. At the time of drafting the present report, it was brought to the attention of the 
Special Rapporteur that journalists, and presumably members of NGOs, who report on 
conflict-related issues or criticize the army, may be tried before a military court, under 
article 87 of the Military Criminal Code (&#8220;insult to the flag or to the army&#8221;). The persons 
condemned face a prison sentence of six months to five years, and lose their media 
accreditation. The Special Rapporteur expresses great concern about this new practice 
which may be very harmful to the work of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>40. Finally, there is currently no legislation on the protection of victims and witnesses in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Special Rapporteur believes that the best way 
to remedy this gap is to incorporate the Rome Statute, which provides in exhaustive terms 
for such protection in its article 68, into domestic law.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Shortcomings in the institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes the existence of several institutions aimed at 
upholding human rights, which on paper may have a positive impact on the work of human 
rights defenders but, devoid of adequate financial and human resources or strong political 
support, are doomed to failure. There also seems to be duplication of work between these 
institutions in several areas, which might be problematic given the lack of resources. 
Furthermore, such a proliferation of human rights institutions may have a detrimental effect 
in encouraging competition among these institutions for funds from donors. Streamlining of 
and coordination among these institutions, at both central and provincial levels, is therefore 
important. In this context, it is important to bear in mind the independence of the future 
National Human Rights Commission in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the work undertaken by the Ministries for Human 
Rights and Gender, Family and Children respectively, but regrets that they lack resources 
and most of all visibility and support within the Government. Both ministries have 
insufficient human and financial capacity to properly identify human rights trends and lack </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>enough political support to make sure they are taking into account in the policy-making 
process at the national level. Furthermore, it appears that the work of provincial 
representatives of the Ministry for Human Rights, as well as that of the local women&#8217;s 
councils of the Minister for Gender, Family and Children, is not always fully respected or 
appreciated by local authorities.  
</p>
<p>43. Concerning the inter-ministerial technical committee on the drafting and follow-up 
to human rights reports, its drafting methodology to meet in a timely manner the reporting 
obligations of the Government to United Nations treaty bodies must be improved, with the 
support of the UNJHRO. This also applies to the Ministry for Human Rights, which has a 
severe backlog of communications sent by special procedures to which it has not yet 
responded. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur notes the establishment of the human rights liaison entity, 
and the future establishment of the national human rights commission. She, however, fears 
that these institutions may face the same fate as the two ministries. It is imperative that a 
substantive budget be allocated to the national human rights commission to enable it to 
fulfil its mandate. Similarly, it is important to support the human rights liaison entity to 
allow it to operate. 
</p>
<p>45. With regards to shortcomings in the performance of law enforcement authorities and 
in the judicial system, the Special Rapporteur stresses the main concerns raised by the 
seven thematic special procedures in their 2009 combined report on technical assistance to 
the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and urgent examination of the 
situation in the East of the country.2 She is further concerned that the human rights section 
of the Plan for the Reform of the Justice System is neglected by donors. 
</p>
<p>46. With regard to sensitization on the work of human rights defenders, the Special 
Rapporteur was informed by the Ministry for Human Rights, the police and military that no 
training on the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders or the legitimate work of defenders 
has been provided for security forces or magistrates. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
such sensitization is essential to make the environment of defenders more enabling. The 
Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the Ministry for Human Rights, with the support 
of the UNJHRO and civil society, is the key in this sensitization process.  
</p>
<p>47. From the discussions that the Special Rapporteur had with the military and the 
police, it was not clear how the police and the military address the situation of women 
defenders who are most at risk.3 The immediate deployment of additional female police and 
military officers is much needed, together with specific protective measures. 
</p>
<p>48. One major problem with regard to the follow-up committees which was brought to 
the attention of the Special Rapporteur is that they do not deal specifically with violations 
committed against human rights defenders. Another recurring problem relates to the fact 
that victims of violations have difficulties identifying the perpetrators. Therefore, it is of the 
utmost importance to give a sense of responsibility to commanders, who must identify these 
perpetrators. Finally, it seems that these committees do not meet on a regular basis and 
follow-up on cases registered is inconsistent, because of a lack of will imputable to most 
FARDC and PNC authorities.

</p>
<p><b> III. Current challenges faced by human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview of the civil society in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>49. In the course of her visit, the Special Rapporteur had the opportunity to engage with 
members of civil society active in the field of civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights. These included members of non-governmental organizations, women human rights 
defenders, journalists, lawyers, trade unionists, teachers, church workers, land activists, aid 
workers, health workers, development actors and defenders promoting good governance. 
Meetings were organized in Kinshasa, notably with the Synergie des ONG des droits de 
l&#8217;homme (a coalition of the 13 largest NGOs in the country), in Kananga and Bukavu, 
during which human rights defenders were able to voice their concerns.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was informed that NGO networks, including networks on 
the protection of victims, witnesses and defenders, are found in the capital and in all 
provinces. These networks are generally fairly well organized; however, most of these 
networks suffer from isolation. The NGO network in Kinshasa, which meets the UNJHRO 
once a month, reportedly hardly speaks about the situation of defenders in remote places. 
Furthermore, bar associations, which are influential networks of defenders, are not present 
outside provincial capitals. It is of the utmost importance that a strong, coordinated and 
sustainable national network of NGOs is developed so as to increase the protection and 
safety of all defenders present in the country. This is particularly important considering the 
fact that MONUC will one day leave the country, when its mission is over. 
</p>
<p>51. Human rights defenders suffer from a chronic lack of resources and funding, 
especially those who operate outside the capital and the eastern provinces where the 
international community mostly concentrates its efforts in assisting civil society. Such a 
situation generates harsh competition for funding among NGOs. Defenders throughout the 
country are in need of capacity building and empowerment (communication facilities, 
Internet access, offices, etc.). To a large extent, empowering human rights defenders 
contributes to increasing their protection.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges the lack of professionalism of a number of 
human rights organizations and of some journalists, which impacts negatively on the work 
of credible organizations and media, and more broadly weakens civil society as a whole. 
The Special Rapporteur also regrets that some NGOs do not cooperate actively with the 
follow-up committees. In Kananga, it was reported that NGOs hardly submit any cases of 
human rights violations to these committees. This is a lost opportunity to voice concern 
directly with authorities. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Stigmatization of human rights defenders and related insecurity 
</b></p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur pays tribute to human rights defenders for their courage 
while operating under very difficult conditions, especially in the eastern part of the country. 
Defenders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo face numerous challenges that 
seriously impede their legitimate activities: they are killed, disappeared, tortured, 
threatened, arbitrarily arrested and detained, under surveillance, banned from travelling, 
displaced or forced into exile. Perpetrators of violations against defenders range from 
police, military and intelligence officers to members of armed groups. 
</p>
<p>54. Pascal Kabungulu, Polycarpe Mpoy, Franck Ngycke and his wife H&#233;l&#232;ne Mpaka, 
Bapua Mwanmba, Serge Maheshe, Didace Namujimbo and Georges Kateta have paid the 
highest price for their peaceful engagement in promoting and defending human rights. At 
the time of writing this report, the Special Rapporteur was very saddened to learn of the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>death of another journalist, Bruno Koko Chirambiza, in Bukavu (South Kivu) on 23 August 
</p><p>2009. This latest murder tragically illustrates the extremely precarious situation of human 
rights defenders operating in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a region 
which has been torn by armed conflicts for years.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned about the ongoing stigmatization by 
authorities in the capital and in provinces, as well as by non-State actors, of defenders who 
are seen as &#8220;enemies&#8221; or &#8220;opponents&#8221;. While such stigmatization is largely deliberate, it 
appeared that several State authorities were unaware of the definition of human rights 
defenders, i.e. anyone who, individually or in association with others, acts to promote or 
protect human rights.4  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur was notably troubled by the statement of the Minister of 
Communication on 28 July 2009 at a press conference in Kinshasa during which he labelled 
three international human rights NGOs, namely Human Rights Watch, the International 
Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH), and Global Witness, as &#8220;humanitarian 
terrorists&#8221;, following the publication of reports by these NGOs. This statement is extremely 
worrying and epitomizes the stigmatization suffered by human rights defenders in the 
country.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Repression against defenders denouncing human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>57. Human rights defenders, and in particular journalists, who report on human rights 
abuses committed by State and non-State actors are killed, tortured, threatened or arbitrarily 
arrested and detained, their offices are raided and their equipment confiscated or damaged.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>58. In Kinshasa, defenders who denounce the high incidence of arbitrary detention, 
torture and the current climate of impunity in the capital are particularly at risk.  
</p>
<p>59. On 15 March 2009, following the organization of a press conference at the premises 
of RENADHOC (R&#233;seau national des ONG des droits de l&#8217;homme de la R&#233;publique 
D&#233;mocratique du Congo) in Kinshasa concerning the then inter-institutional tension in the 
country, Floribert Chebeya Bahizire, Executive Director of the<b> </b>Voix des Sans Voix pour les 
Droits de l&#8217;Homme (VSV) and National Executive Secretary of - RENADHOC, Dolly 
Ibefo Mbfunga, Executive Deputy Director of VSV, Donat Tshikaya, staff member of 
RENADHOC, and Coco Tanda, video cameraman at Canal Num&#233;rique T&#233;l&#233;vision (CNTV), 
were arrested by members of the PNC, brought to the headquarters of the ANR and then 
detained in Kin Mazi&#232;re prison. Computers and video cameras were reportedly seized. 
Those arrested were released on 17 March. The objective of their press conference was to 
announce a peaceful demonstration in front of the Parliament, organized by the Synergie 
coalition of human rights NGOs, with the intention of delivering a memorandum to the 
Presidents of the Senate and National Assembly concerning the &#8220;preservation of the 
democracy in the DRC&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>60. In South-Kivu, several journalists have been killed these last few years because they 
denounced acts of violence in the region. On 21 November 2008, Didace Namujimbo, a 
journalist for Radio Okapi, was shot in the head near his home in Bukavu. Local authorities 
immediately opened an investigation but were unsuccessful in identifying the perpetrators 
or the persons who ordered the murder.  
</p>
<p>61. In 2008, in Bukavu, the UNJHRO pointed out tensions surrounding the trial at the 
appeal level for the murder of Serge Maheshe, another journalist with Radio Okapi killed 
on 13 June 2007. In March 2008, several NGO members observing the trial were subjected 
</p>
<p>  
 4 Article 2 of the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>to intimidation by the superior military court (<i>auditeur militaire</i>) for highlighting violations 
of the right to a fair trial. In April 2008, four observers received anonymous death threats 
via phone text messages from the same telephone number: Sophie Roudil of NGO 
Protection Internationale, Jean Bedel, a lawyer and member of Pacte international pour la 
protection des journalistes, Jean-Paul Ngongo, a member of Voix des sans voix, and 
Dieudonn&#233; Sango, vice-president of the R&#233;seau provincial des organisations de droits de 
l&#8217;homme de la RDC (REPRODHOC). 
</p>
<p>62. On 3 April 2008, Georges Kapiamba, a lawyer and Vice-President of 
ASADHO/Katanga, received death threats, following the joint press release ASADHO 
issued with two other NGOs on the decision of the provincial authorities of Katanga to 
prevent them from going to Kilwa. There, they were to meet civilian victims from 
demonstrations that were violently quashed by law enforcement authorities in October 
</p><p>2004. Following the issuance of this press release, Mr. Kapiamba was interviewed by the 
BBC, during which he criticized violations of the rights of Kilwa victims by the Congolese 
justice system. 
</p>
<p>63. In October 2008, church workers from the Dungu-Doruma diocese denouncing 
human rights violations committed against the civilian population by LRA troops present in 
the Garamba park (killings, rapes, disappearances, forced recruitment, looting, etc.), and 
who were sheltering this population, were attacked.  
</p>
<p>64. In Orientale province, Georges Mwamba Wa Mwamba, from the NGO Groupe 
Lotus, was arrested when he tried to deliver an invitation for a university event to the 
Director of ANR in Kisangani. He was ill-treated while in detention by ANR agents and 
accused of &#8220;espionage&#8221; and &#8220;subversion&#8221;, charges which were later changed to an &#8220;attempt 
to set  fire&#8221; and &#8220;communication with a political prisoner&#8221;. He was released on 10 June 
2008.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Threats against NGOs and defenders fighting impunity and supporting the work of 
the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>65. In 2008, threats against human rights defenders engaged in the fight against 
impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo intensified. Following the arrest and 
indictment of Jean-Pierre Bemba in May 2008, four national NGOs were threatened by 
people close or belonging to the Mouvement de Lib&#233;ration du Congo, or MLC), then led by 
Jean-Pierre Bemba, former candidate in the 2006 presidential elections. Dismas Kitenge, 
President of the Groupe Lotus and vice-president of FIDH, was accused on 28 May 2008 of 
having &#8220;sold Bemba to the FIDH and to the West&#8221;, and was warned that he would face 
consequences if Bemba was condemned. Furthermore, in the Equateur province, where 
Jean-Pierre Bemba is from, NGOs denouncing arbitrary arrests and detentions of MLC 
members are constantly harassed by authorities who accuse them of being pro-Bemba.  
</p>
<p>66. In June 2008, members of the Union des Patriotes Congolais threatened several 
members of the NGO Justice Plus working in Bunia following their public stand concerning 
the ICC&#8217;s decision of 13 June 2008 to suspend the proceedings against Thomas Lubanga. 
Two defenders were forced to leave Bunia in fear of their safety. 
</p>
<p>67. In July 2008, members of the family of Carine Bapita, member of the NGO Femmes 
et enfants pour les droits de l&#8217;homme (FEDHO) and lawyer defending victims before the 
ICC in the case of Thomas Lubanga, were forced to go into hiding after receiving threats. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur was recently informed of the case of Rebecca Agamile, 
treasurer for Solidarit&#233; F&#233;minine pour la Paix et le D&#233;veloppement (SOFEPADI), an NGO 
which promotes and protects women&#8217;s rights in Bunia (Oriental province). On 1 October 
2009, a group of unidentified armed men threatened to kill and rape Ms. Agamile and her 
16-year-old daughter, allegedly because of the work of SOFEPADI in cooperating with the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>ICC and sharing information about human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of 
the Congo. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Harassment of defenders protecting economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>69. Human rights defenders who denounce the damaging effects of the illegal mining 
and logging activities of private actors - with the reported collusion of local authorities - as 
well as cases of corruption, face threats and are hampered in their work. 
</p>
<p>70. In March 2008, Hubert Tshiswaka, then the director of Action contre l'impunit&#233; et 
pour les droits de l&#8217;homme (Action against Impunity and in Support of Human Rights), 
based in Lubumbashi (Katanga province), and a member of the Open Society Institute for 
Southern Africa, was arrested by the ANR for having distributed a flyer denouncing alleged 
embezzlement by local authorities. He was released shortly afterwards. 
</p>
<p>71. In early January 2009, Nginamau Malaba, president of the trade union within the 
Ministry of National Economy and Foreign Trade, was arrested by five ANR agents while 
he was about to distribute a memorandum in which he denounced the alleged 
embezzlement of public funds by the Minister of National Economy and Foreign Trade. On 
11 and 16 January 2009, Richard Kambale Ndayango and Isra&#235;l Kanumbaya Yambasa, two 
other trade unionists who were signatories of the memorandum, were arrested. Messrs. 
Malaba, Ndayango and Yambasa, who were released on 23 March, were reportedly ill-
treated while in detention, but reportedly no investigation has been conducted in order to 
identify and prosecute the perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur was recently informed of the sentencing to a one-year 
suspended prison sentence for &#8220;threat to national security&#8221; and &#8220;defamation&#8221; of Golden 
Misabiko, president of the Katanga section of Association africaine pour la d&#233;fense des 
droits de l'Homme (ASADHO/Katanga, or African Association for the Defense of Human 
Rights)  who was arrested on 24 July 2009 following the publication of a report by 
ASADHO/Katanga on the clandestine exploitation of the Shinkolobwe uranium mine, with 
the alleged complicity of members of FARDC, PNC and the military court (<i>auditorat 
militaire</i>).  
</p>
<p>73. On 16 and 17 September 2009, Emmanuel Umpuda, executive director of ACIDH, 
Timoth&#233;e Mbuya, vice-president of ASADHO/Katanga, Gr&#233;goire Mulumba, member of the 
Centre des droits de l&#8217;Homme et du droit humanitaire, and Dominique Munongo, member 
of the Centre de d&#233;veloppement pour la femme, faced acts of reprisals from unknown 
authors because of their endorsement of the above-mentioned ASADHO/Katanga report.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Plight of women human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>74. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met several women human rights defenders 
active in promoting and protecting women&#8217;s rights in the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo, and in supporting victims of sexual violence. As in each mission she has 
undertaken, the Special Rapporteur was genuinely impressed by their courage and 
remarkable commitment in promoting and defending women&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>75. She expresses serious concern about the plight of women human rights defenders in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo - especially those operating in rural areas - who face 
the same gamut of human rights violations as their male colleagues, in addition to gender-
specific violations. Women defenders are perceived by State authorities, and largely by the 
public, as rebelling against the society, bearing in mind the legal and de facto 
discrimination against women. Authorities often fail to take human rights violations 
committed against women defenders seriously. Regrettably, women defenders may face </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>even more discrimination than their male colleagues. Finally, women human rights 
defenders tend to be less aware of their defender status than their male colleagues.  
</p>
<p>76. Women defenders have repeatedly risked their lives when denouncing sexual 
violence and those operating in the east of the country are certainly most at risk. On 18 May 
2008, Wahibu Kasuba, a member of Voix des sans voix ni libert&#233; and a social worker at the 
centre for victims of sexual violence in Panzi, was killed in South-Kivu because of her 
human rights activities. In March 2008, Therese Kerumbe, a member of the NGO 
SOFEPADI, and close collaborator of Julienne Lusenge, coordinator of SOFEPADI, 
received threats from unknown individuals looking for Ms. Lusenge, who was then abroad. 
On 6 April 2008, the house of Julienne Lusenge was raided by a group of armed militia 
men who were looking for her. The requests for protection by SOFEPADI to local 
authorities were reportedly ignored, and Ms.  Kerumbe was forced to leave Bunia following 
the renewal of threats against her.  
</p>
<p>77. In July 2008, staff members of the psycho-medical centre for the rehabilitation of 
victims of torture (CPMRVT/Kitshanga) of the NGO Solidarit&#233; pour la promotion sociale 
et la paix (SOFROP) were threatened by members of the political party Congr&#232;s national 
pour la D&#233;fense du Peuple (CNDP), who wanted to obtain the medical registries containing 
the names of victims of sexual violence treated in the centre. 
</p>
<p>78. During the night of 7 and 8 November 2008, Noella Usumange Aliswa, a member of 
SOFEPADI, and her family were attacked at their home in Bunia, and were seriously 
injured. This attack was probably linked to the work of SOFEPADI in support of female 
victims of the conflict. Two militiamen were arrested but then released after reportedly 
paying a sum of money. 
</p>
<p>79. These are only a few of the cases brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur 
during her mission, which illustrate the difficulties encountered by women defenders in 
their crucial work. Women defenders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are in dire 
need of protection. The Special Rapporteur expresses her full support for their 
commendable work, and reiterates that women defenders need &#8220;specific and enhanced 
protection as well as targeted and deliberate efforts to make the environment in which they 
operate a safer, more enabling and accepting one&#8221;.5 <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Culture of impunity for abuses committed against defenders 
</b></p>
<p>80. Another cause of great concern is the widespread impunity for violations committed 
against human rights defenders by State authorities and members of armed groups. 
Complaints filed by human rights defenders are seldom thoroughly investigated or expose 
defenders to reprisals from the alleged perpetrators. In Bukavu, the Special Rapporteur met 
with the provincial Prosecutor General and raised the issue of the lack of diligence of his 
office in investigating violations against human rights defenders. She also mentioned the 
issue of material evidence since threats by phone text messages are not considered as 
admissible by the judicial authorities in charge of the prosecution. The Special Rapporteur 
calls on the authorities to systematically seek the names of the authors of threatening phone 
text messages from the telephone companies, and to prosecute them.  
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur is further troubled that trials often fall short of international 
fair trial standards, such as the trial on the killing of Serge Maheshe. This trial was marred 
by several procedural irregularities at the first and appeal levels, and lawyers, journalists

</b></p>
<p>and national and international observers were intimidated by reprisal for their human rights 
activities, as highlighted by UNJRHO in a special report.6<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur is particularly concerned about the forthcoming trial for the 
murder of Didace Namujimbo. At the time of drafting the present report, no starting date 
for the trial had been set. The Special Rapporteur wants to stress that this trial should be 
absolutely free of irregularities, and should be seen as a test case for the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo of its will to put an end to impunity.  
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur highlights that justice is crucial for sustaining peace and 
encouraging and uplifting the work of human rights defenders. <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. Illegitimate restrictions on the exercise of fundamental rights  
</b></p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur expresses further concern about illegitimate restrictions on 
the exercise of fundamental rights in the country. Despite meeting all administrative 
requirements, several NGOs have not been granted legal personality, and therefore are 
unable to file complaints before courts and receive funding from donors. In fact, the 
procedure for registration is not well known to NGOs, and is often arbitrarily interrupted by 
authorities. Therefore, NGOs receive temporary authorization to operate, but rarely receive 
the final decree granting them legal personality. This situation has been used by authorities 
to discredit them. On 9 September 2008, the Minister of Justice published a list in the 
national press of 140 NGOs operating illegally, despite the fact that they had received 
authorisation to function.  
</p>
<p>85. During the various meetings the Special Rapporteur held with civil society, it 
appeared that the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly has also proven to be 
problematic: the regime of notification introduced by the 2006 Constitution of the 
Democratic Republic of the Congo is often not respected in practice and defenders need to 
seek the authorization of the authorities to hold demonstrations. The Special Rapporteur 
reminds the authorities that &#8220;the right to protest is an essential element of the right to 
participation in any democratic dispensation, and restrictions imposed on this right must be 
closely scrutinized with respect to their necessity and reasonableness&#8221;.7 
</p>
<p>86. As for the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the 
environment in which journalists operate is largely hostile: journalists who criticize the 
Government or advocate for good governance are targeted. The media are sometimes 
suspended, and authorities discriminate against journalists who do not support the 
Government. On 9 September 2008, the Minister of Communication signed a decree 
prohibiting the broadcasting of five television channels and two radio stations which 
reported on human rights violations committed by both sides in the conflict in the East of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Government accused them of organizing 
propaganda and supporting the political opposition. On 26 July 2009, the Congolese 
authorities interrupted the signal of Radio France International (RFI), accusing the radio 
service of destabilizing the Democratic Republic of the Congo by broadcasting &#8220;untrue and 
unconfirmed&#8221; information related to the conflict. In addition, journalists often censor 
themselves for fear of reprisals. Finally, journalists are denied access to information by 
authorities, especially when the information is deemed sensitive. This is a real problem 
since journalists may report wrong information in good faith. The Minister for

<p>defenders to the General Assembly (A/61/312) of 5 September 2006, para. 56. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/13/22/Add.2

</p>
<p>Communications acknowledged that the issue of access to information is a serious issue. 
The Special Rapporteur calls upon him to tackle all the above-mentioned issues 
appropriately. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Role of the international community in protecting  
human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur met with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, his Deputy for Rule of Law, the Director 
of the UNJHRO and his Deputy. The Special Rapporteur also met with representatives of 
United Nations agencies and diplomatic missions present in the country. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur commends the work of the UNJHRO, in particular the 
Protection Unit, which ran the Protection of Victims, Witnesses and Human Rights 
Defenders programme, funded by the European Union (EU), until its closure in March 
</p><p>2009. The programme was then absorbed by MONUC through the work of the Protection 
Unit. Between the inception of the programme in June 2007 and June 2009, the Protection 
Unit assisted 516 victims, witnesses and defenders in nine provinces, including in the 
eastern DRC. The Special Rapporteur commends the important work of human rights 
officers from the Protection Unit in the capital and provinces. This Unit constitutes best 
practice within the United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and should be 
replicated in other missions.  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur also supports the work of the United Nations Protection 
Cluster chaired by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
(UNHCR) and composed of several components of MONUC (including UNJHRO), United 
Nations humanitarian, human rights and development agencies as well as NGOs active in 
protection. However, the Special Rapporteur regrets the reported lack of active participation 
of civil society in the Protection Cluster.  
</p>
<p>90. Finally, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the role played by diplomatic missions in 
assisting the Democratic Republic of the Congo in support of human rights defenders. With 
respect to diplomatic missions of the EU, the Special Rapporteur welcomes a series of 
positive actions with regards to the situation of defenders, notably in relation to the cases 
of. Pascal Kabungulu, Serge Maheshe and Didace Namujimbo. EU diplomatic missions 
publicly condemned the killing of Didace Namujimbo, publicly denounced the threats made 
against observers of the Serge Maheshe trial, and appointed a diplomat to the sessions of 
the appeal trial. The Special Rapporteur further welcomes the establishment of the EU 
Human Rights Group, which brings together diplomatic missions and NGOs on a monthly 
basis to discuss the overall human rights situation in the country. However, it was brought 
to the attention of the Special Rapporteur that the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, 
the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, the Manual for the EU Guidelines on 
Human Rights Defenders, and the EU local implementation strategies for the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo8 (finalized in July 2008) may not be sufficiently known to all EU 
missions.

<p>

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Following decades of dictatorship, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is 
engaged in a political, economic and social transition. However, a conducive 
environment in which human rights defenders can operate has yet to fully emerge. 
The Special Rapporteur commends the political will of the Government to build a 
modern democratic society, and in particular the efforts of the Ministers for Human 
Rights and Gender, Family and Children, who, despite meager resources and limited 
political support, are trying to improve the prospects for the promotion and 
protection of human rights. However, these Government efforts are clearly not 
enough, given the magnitude of the violations suffered by human rights defenders, 
including women defenders, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.   
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur stresses that human rights defenders are crucial and 
play a major role in the democratization process in the country. The Government of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo must create a space for human rights 
defenders,  notably by giving recognition to their legitimate work, and establishing a 
sustainable dialogue with them in all provinces, so as to put an end to their 
stigmatization. The culture of impunity which currently prevails in the country must 
finally stop. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The forthcoming local and presidential elections generate fear and anxiety 
among the human rights defenders community. The Government of the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo will have to fully allow human rights defenders to monitor 
these elections, which will echo its commitment to the principles of democracy and 
human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur looks forward to a continued constructive dialogue 
with the Government o on the situation of human rights defenders in all parts of the 
country. She calls on the UNJHRO, United Nations agencies and other international 
actors to continue assisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
in fulfilling its human rights obligations, with a view to ensuring a better environment 
for human rights defenders. 
</b></p>
