TASEKO EXPANDS LAND PACKAGE AT GIBRALTAR
August  9,  2016,  Vancouver,  BC –  Taseko  Mines  Limited  (TSX:  TKO;  NYSE  MKT:  TGB)
(“Taseko”  or  the  "Company")  is  pleased  to  announce  that  it  has  acquired  new  mineral  claims
which are adjacent to existing Gibraltar claims, although well outside current mining areas.
In  total,  these  new  claims  represent  nearly  6,000  acres  of  land  located  approximately  two
kilometres to the northwest of the Extension Zone which forms part of Gibraltar’s mineral reserves
and resources.
The  newly  acquired  ground  was  explored  roughly  30  years  ago  with  Induced  Polarization
identifying  magnetic  highs  associated  with  porphyry  deposits.  Limited  drilling  has  been
undertaken  since  initial  exploration  activities.  Projections  of  mineral  occurrences,  based  on  a
desktop evaluation undertaken prior to purchasing this new exploration land package, indicate
mineralization is trending to the north-northwest and beyond previous claim boundaries onto the
newly acquired property.
A recently completed exploratory drill hole located northwest of the extension zone area supports
the results of the desk top evaluation. The Company is in the late stages of compiling assay data
from this hole along with other historical geological data.

uncertainties related to the ability to obtain necessary licenses permits for development
projects and project delays due to third party opposition;
uncertainties related to unexpected judicial or regulatory proceedings;
changes in, and the effects of, the laws, regulations and government policies affecting our
