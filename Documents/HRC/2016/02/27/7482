<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous

</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i>The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its resolutions 15/14 and 24/9. 
It is the first report submitted by Victoria Tauli Corpuz, who assumed her mandate on 2 
June 2014. In the report, the Special Rapporteur presents some preliminary reflections on 
the status of operationalization of international standards relating to indigenous peoples and 
her vision for her work as Special Rapporteur in that context. There are a number of 
addenda to the present report, all reports by the previous Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur notes that there is a strong legal and policy foundation upon 
which to move forward with the implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and there 
have been many advances, which the Special Rapporteur hopes to examine and document 
during the course of her mandate. Nevertheless, many challenges continue to confront 
indigenous peoples throughout the world. In accordance with Human Rights Council 
resolution 15/14, a core aspect of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur is to examine ways 
and means of overcoming existing obstacles to the full and effective protection of the rights 
of indigenous peoples. As an initial step, and given that the present report is her first to the 
Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur identifies in broad strokes some of those 
obstacles, which are found to some extent in all countries in which indigenous peoples are 
living. 
</p>
<p>The obstacles identified in section III of the report include (a) the failure or 
reluctance of governments to recognize indigenous peoples; (b) challenges in the 
development of practical implementation measures; (c) reconciliation and redress for 
historical wrongs yet to be completed; (d) ongoing negative attitudes towards indigenous 
peoples on the part of broader societies in which they live; and (e) social and economic 
conditions preventing the full exercise of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights. The list is 
neither comprehensive nor exhaustive, and the obstacles identified are in many ways 
interrelated. It is meant, however, to provide a framework for understanding where further 
work is needed and to assist in developing measures for action. While the Special 
</p>

<p>Rapporteur fully acknowledges the difficulties in confronting and overcoming those 
continuing problems, she hopes to be able to make headway on tackling some of the 
obstacles during the course of her mandate. 
</p>
<p>In accordance with her mandate from the Council, the Special Rapporteur intends to 
carry out her work within those areas generally targeted by special procedures mandate 
holders, i.e.: the promotion of good practices, country assessments, communications 
concerning alleged human rights violations and thematic studies. While carrying out work 
in those areas, she will coordinate her activities with the other two United Nations 
mechanisms with a specific mandate concerning indigenous peoples, as well as with the 
treaty bodies and regional human rights systems. In all of that work, the Special Rapporteur 
intends to follow up and reinforce the observations and recommendations made by her 
predecessors. There are numerous issues that merit thematic attention. Nevertheless, in 
order to maximize the impact of her investigations, the Special Rapporteur intends to focus 
particular efforts over the next three years of her mandate on issues surrounding the 
economic, social, cultural and environmental rights of indigenous peoples.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of 
indigenous peoples to the Human Rights Council pursuant to its resolutions 15/14 and 24/9. 
It is the first report submitted by Victoria Tauli Corpuz, who assumed her mandate on 2 
June 2014. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Human Rights Council for 
entrusting her with the important task of fulfilling that mandate and she commits herself to 
do so in an impartial and constructive manner and in accordance with the requirements set 
forth by the Council. She also would like to express her gratitude to the numerous 
indigenous groups and organizations that have already engaged with her mandate, and to 
affirm her strong commitment to her role as Special Rapporteur, acknowledging with 
humility the responsibility it represents. 
</p>
<p>2. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur sets out some preliminary reflections on 
the status of operationalization of international standards relating to indigenous peoples and 
her vision for her work as Special Rapporteur in that context. The report consists of four 
parts. Section II provides a background to the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. Section 
III discusses structural problems that present obstacles to the full realization of the rights of 
indigenous peoples. Section IV presents some preliminary comments regarding the vision 
and work areas of the current Special Rapporteur for her three-year mandate. Finally, 
section V offers conclusions made on the basis of the comments provided in the present 
report. 
</p>
<p>3. There are a number of addenda to the present report, all of which are reports issued 
by the previous Special Rapporteur. Addendum 1 is his report on the situation of 
indigenous peoples in Panama, addendum 2 is his report on the situation on indigenous 
peoples in Canada, and addendum 3 is his report on the situation of indigenous peoples in 
the context of extractive industries in Peru, which includes an annex on the proposed 
expansion of the Camisea gas project. Addendum 4 contains observations on 
communications sent and replies received. As indicated in that report, the communications 
contained therein were sent by the previous Special Rapporteur and contain observations 
and recommendations made by him.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate of the Special Rapporteur 
</b>4. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous people was originally established by the Commission 
on Human Rights in 2001 (resolution 2001/57) and subsequently extended by the 
Commission (resolution 2004/62), by the General Assembly (resolution 60/251) and by the 
Human Rights Council (resolutions 5/1, 6/12, 15/14 and 24/9). In 2010, the name of the 
mandate was changed to the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples in 
Council resolution 15/14. The first two mandate holders were Rodolfo Stavenhagen, from 
Mexico, and James Anaya, from the United States of America. The Special Rapporteur 
would like to recognize and honour the outstanding work of her predecessors and hopes 
that she will continue to build upon the important contributions they have made to the 
advancement of the rights of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>5. The Human Rights Council has entrusted the Special Rapporteur with a mandate to 
examine ways and means of overcoming existing obstacles to the full and effective 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples; to identify, exchange and promote best 
practices; to gather, request, receive and exchange information and communications from 
all relevant sources, including governments, indigenous peoples and their communities and 
organizations, on alleged violations of the rights of indigenous peoples; and to formulate </p>


<p>recommendations and proposals on appropriate measures and activities to prevent and 
remedy violations of the rights of indigenous peoples (Council resolution 15/14). In 
carrying out her mandate, the Special Rapporteur is to coordinate with other human rights 
bodies, including the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism on 
the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, as well as with the treaty bodies and regional human 
rights mechanisms. The Human Rights Council has also asked the Special Rapporteur to 
pay particular attention to the situation of indigenous women and children, an aspect of her 
mandate to which she intends to devote particular attention, as noted further below.  
</p>
<p>6. The principal normative framework for the mandate is the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the Human Rights Council 
specifically requests the Special Rapporteur in its resolution 15/14 to promote that 
Declaration and international instruments relevant to the advancement of the rights of 
indigenous peoples, where appropriate. Other instruments that the Special Rapporteur will 
promote throughout her mandate include the International Labour Organization Convention 
No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries, which 
has been widely ratified by countries in Latin American and is thus of particular relevance 
in that region. Also important are the core United Nations human rights treaties, especially 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, all of which have been authoritatively interpreted by 
the corresponding treaty monitoring bodies to protect a range of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>7. At the regional level, the American Convention on Human Rights and the American 
Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man also contain provisions relevant to indigenous 
peoples. Since 2001, the inter-American human rights system has developed a rich body of 
jurisprudence on the basis of those instruments which affirms indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to 
lands and resources, the duty of States to consult in the context of natural resource 
development, and the right of indigenous peoples to political participation. The African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights has also more recently addressed indigenous 
rights in the Endorois case from Kenya and through its Working Group on Indigenous 
Populations/Communities in Africa, established in 2000, which has carried out several 
research-based missions to individual countries to assess their human rights situations. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur has also been mandated by the General Assembly to 
participate in the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly, to be known as the 
World Conference on Indigenous Peoples, in September 2014. The General Assembly, in 
its resolution 65/198, in which it decided to organize the World Conference, invited the 
President of the General Assembly to conduct open-ended consultations with Member 
States and with representatives of indigenous peoples and the Special Rapporteur. 
Accordingly, on 17 and 18 June 2014, the Special Rapporteur participated in an interactive 
consultation convened by the President of the General Assembly in New York, and 
provided comments on priority issues for indigenous peoples in the context of development 
and the post-2015 agenda. In a second resolution on the World Conference (resolution 
66/296), the General Assembly decided that the Special Rapporteur should participate in 
the interactive panel discussion during the conference, which is to focus on indigenous 
peoples&#8217; development and the post-2015 development agenda. As noted in more detail 
below, that is also the subject to which the Special Rapporteur is dedicating her first report 
to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p>9. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the World Conference represents an important 
opportunity for States to recommit to implementing the rights of indigenous peoples and for 
direct negotiations between Member States and indigenous peoples&#8217; representatives on key 
outstanding issues. The Special Rapporteur is committed to participating in all stages of 
planning for the World Conference and follow-up to any outcome document. </p>


<p><b> III. Ongoing obstacles to the full realization of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights 
</b></p>
<p>10. There is a strong legal and policy foundation upon which to build the 
implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, and there have been many advances, which 
the Special Rapporteur hopes to examine and document during the course of her mandate. 
Nevertheless, many challenges continue to confront indigenous peoples throughout the 
world. As noted above, a core aspect of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur is to 
examine ways and means of overcoming existing obstacles to the full and effective 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples. As an initial step, and given that the present 
report is her first to the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
identify in broad strokes some of those obstacles which are found to some extent in all 
countries in which indigenous peoples are living. 
</p>
<p>11. The obstacles identified in the present section are (a) the failure or reluctance of 
governments to recognize indigenous peoples; (b) challenges in the development of 
practical implementation measures; (c) reconciliation and redress for historical wrongs yet 
to be completed; (d) ongoing negative attitudes towards indigenous peoples on the part of 
the broader societies in which they live; and (e) social and economic conditions preventing 
the full exercise of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights. The list is of course neither 
comprehensive nor exhaustive and the obstacles identified above are in many ways 
interrelated. It is meant, however, to provide a framework for understanding where further 
work is needed and to assist in developing measures for action. While the Special 
Rapporteur fully acknowledges the difficulties in confronting and overcoming those 
continuing problems, she hopes to be able to make headway on tackling some of the 
obstacles during the course of her mandate.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Recognition of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>12. One barrier to the implementation of the international human rights standards 
concerning indigenous peoples relates to how the concept of &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221; is 
applied in relation to certain groups, as its application can be both under- and over-
inclusive: the indigenous rights framework can be applied in relation to groups that share 
characteristics similar to indigenous peoples worldwide and, to a somewhat lesser extent, to 
groups that do not. Clearly, the human rights situation of groups around the world is diverse 
and complex, and varies from country to country and community to community, and yet 
there are issues and circumstances that are common to certain groups that are generally 
identified as indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, by failing to 
recognize groups as indigenous peoples, States and other powerful actors avoid applying 
the international standards and protection mechanisms that are most appropriate to address 
the kinds of human rights concerns that these groups face in common with groups which 
are generally identified as indigenous around the world. 
</p>
<p>13. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that this is not a 
problem resulting from, or which can be resolved by, attempting to arrive at an 
international definition of &#8220;indigenous peoples&#8221;. As is often repeated in the literature on the 
subject, no such definition exists. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples does not attempt to provide one, although it does affirm that indigenous 
peoples have the right to determine their own identity or membership in accordance with 
their customs and traditions (art. 33). For its part, International Labour Organization 
Convention No. 169 (1989) concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent 
Countries refers to self-identification &#8220;as a fundamental criterion for determining the groups 
to which the provisions of this Convention apply&#8221; (art. 1, para. 2) and notes that the </p>


<p>Convention will apply to those peoples &#8220;whose social, cultural and economic conditions 
distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is 
regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions&#8221;, as well as those 
descended from pre-colonial populations and who retain some or all of their own social, 
economic, cultural and political institutions (art. 1, para. 1).  
</p><p>14. The Special Rapporteur notes with particular concern that a number of States have 
somewhat restrictive criteria relating to the recognition of indigenous status. That may 
result in approaches to land rights, socioeconomic policy and development, for example, 
that may fail to recognize the distinct circumstances, problems and experiences faced by 
indigenous peoples, including connections to land, distinct cultures and ways of life, 
discrimination and exclusion, and disadvantage. Approaches that do not recognize 
indigenous peoples or acknowledge that certain groups may face distinct challenges similar 
to other indigenous peoples around the world, do not allow for key tools and resources 
offered by the international indigenous framework to be employed &#8212; a framework that was 
developed precisely to respond to indigenous peoples&#8217; concerns in a way that takes into 
consideration their distinct contexts and experiences. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur fully acknowledges that this is a sensitive topic in many 
areas, especially in the context of Africa and Asia, where many groups can be considered in 
a literal sense indigenous or native to the areas in which they continue to live. That concern 
was addressed by the Working Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations/Communities 
in Africa of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, which observed 
rightly that &#8220;if the concept of <i>indigenous</i> is exclusively linked with a colonial situation, it 
leaves us without a suitable concept for analysing internal structural relationships of 
inequality that have persisted after liberation from colonial dominance&#8221;. Thus, the Working 
Group noted that the understanding of the term indigenous peoples &#8220;should put much less 
emphasis on the early definitions focusing on aboriginality ... The focus should be more on 
the more recent approaches focusing on <i>self-definition </i>as indigenous and distinctly different 
from other groups within a state&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p>16. There is therefore a need to implement a flexible approach that takes into account 
the core attributes that distinguish indigenous peoples from minority groups or other local 
communities. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes and adopts the approach of 
the previous Special Rapporteur, which focuses on the rights at stake and asks whether the 
international framework with respect to the rights of indigenous peoples proves useful in 
addressing the issues and concerns faced by the group in question. In particular, the 
previous Special Rapporteur stated that the mandate is relevant to those groups &#8220;who are 
indigenous to the countries in which they live and have distinct identities and ways of life, 
and who face very particularized human rights issues related to histories of various forms of 
oppression, such as dispossession of their lands and natural resources and denial of cultural 
expression&#8221; (A/HRC/15/37/Add.1, para. 213). In any case, in line with the practice of other 
international human rights mechanisms and the previous Special Rapporteur, the Special 
Rapporteur will not necessarily accept prima facie a State&#8217;s determination of a group&#8217;s 
indigenous status, without looking at other factors when examining the specific human 
rights situation of a group within a particular country.

 African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights, Report of the African Commission's Working 
</p>
<p>Group of Experts on Indigenous Populations Communities, submitted in accordance with the 
&#8220;Resolution on the Rights of Indigenous Populations/Communities in Africa&#8221;, adopted by the African 
Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights at its 28th ordinary session (2005), pp. 92&#8211;93. </p>


<p><b> B. Challenges to the practical implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights 
</b></p>
<p>17. As the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was adopted 
by the General Assembly only in 2007, its implementation is still somewhat in a formative 
stage. States are facing various difficulties in the operationalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights, which include a lack of awareness about the rights and standards, difficulties in 
identifying practical steps for implementation and conflicting interpretations of the content 
of rights. Certainly, in addition to addressing the issues identified in the present subsection, 
it is also necessary for States to demonstrate political will, technical capacity and financial 
commitment in order for operationalization to take place and be successful, although the 
Special Rapporteur will not go into depth on those factors here.   
</p>
<p><b>1. Lack of awareness and understanding of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>18. An initial issue is the lack of awareness and understanding of the Declaration and 
other relevant instruments among State and non-State actors. In his first report to the 
Human Rights Council, the previous Special Rapporteur identified various mechanisms for 
the operationalization of the Declaration, and specifically recommended that States &#8220;make 
efforts to raise awareness [about the Declaration] and provide technical training to 
government officials, members of the legislative branch and of national human rights 
institutions, judicial authorities and all other relevant actors, including civil society and 
indigenous peoples themselves&#8221; (A/HRC/9/9, para. 58). While many States have made 
significant headway in that regard, within other States there is still very insufficient 
knowledge among relevant actors about the international standards concerning indigenous 
peoples.  
</p>
<p><b>2. Need for concerted implementation efforts 
</b></p>
<p>19. However, even when State authorities are aware of international standards, there is 
need for further guidance on how to implement the standards. A first step is undoubtedly, 
together with indigenous peoples, to assess needs, identify priorities and develop strategic 
action plans with goals and time frames for implementation. Planning that takes into 
account and incorporates steps to implement indigenous peoples&#8217; rights can take place in 
the context of the development of broader education, health, housing, elections, local 
governance and resource development strategies (see A/HRC/24/41, paras. 49&#8211;51), as well 
as in other areas. Involving indigenous peoples at the outset in planning will go a long way 
in speeding up implementation and avoiding conflicts about how implementation is carried 
out down the road; yet, it is a step that is often overlooked. 
</p>
<p>20. As part of the planning process, baselines and indicators can also serve as steady 
reference points for guiding action and measuring progress. They can be established at both 
the international and national levels, through the creation of new indicators and new forms 
of data collection, or through the disaggregation of data to ensure that indigenous peoples&#8217; 
situations are understood and their needs are assessed. At the most basic level, the 
indicators should assist with the detection of discrimination, inequality and exclusion, and 
allow for comparisons to be made between indigenous peoples and other social groups. In 
any case, it is essential that indigenous peoples participate in defining the issues to be 
addressed and the indicators used, and that indigenous peoples&#8217; own views on well-being 
and their visions for the future are taken into account.  
</p>
<p>21. It is of course also useful in that connection to identify what has worked and to try to 
replicate successful experiences in other contexts. While it is no secret that good practices 
for the promotion and protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights are still few and far </p>


<p>between, examples are emerging. In that regard, a core aspect of the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur is the identification of good practices and she hopes to contribute to 
documenting positive experiences during the course of her mandate. States, indigenous 
peoples themselves, non-governmental organizations and the United Nations system also 
play important roles in exchanging experiences about where good practices are occurring, 
and they should take advantage of reporting processes before international human rights 
mechanisms, such as the United Nations treaty bodies and the universal periodic review, to 
highlight examples.  
</p>
<p>22. It is also important to obtain reports on good practices and obstacles from various 
United Nations agencies, programmes and funds and other multilateral institutions that 
have policies on indigenous peoples for which the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples was used as a reference point. Related to that is the extent of 
implementation of the human rights-based approach to development has been applied to 
address the specific situations of indigenous peoples. The common understanding of a 
rights-based approach championed by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
on Human Rights, jointly with the United Nations Development Group, is one important 
framework which links the development agenda with economic, social and cultural rights.    
</p>
<p><b>3. Conflicting interpretations about the content of core rights 
</b></p>
<p>23. Yet, the steps outlined above will still not resolve some of the more complex issues 
related to implementation. There are still conflicting interpretations among key actors of the 
content of core rights of indigenous peoples and disagreement about how rights are to be 
applied in specific situations, especially when competing rights and interests may be at 
stake and balancing of rights needs to take place. Differing interpretations of rights by 
States, indigenous peoples, business enterprises, non-governmental organizations and 
others result in an uneven application of the standards and stymie progress in 
implementation. The Special Rapporteur has observed that differences in interpretation 
exist especially in relation to rights to lands and resources; the application of the duty of 
States to consult with and seek the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples 
in matters that affect them; and harmonizing State and customary indigenous governance 
and justice systems.  
</p><p>24. The Special Rapporteur observes that much work remains to be done to ensure that 
States and indigenous peoples come together to find common ground and agreement on the 
most controversial issues. In that regard, States and indigenous peoples often settle into 
entrenched positions and take adversarial approaches, a tendency that is especially notable 
in the context of natural resource development.  
</p>
<p>25. Assistance and guidance by international human rights mechanisms and other 
external experts is essential in that regard. First, the international and other external actors 
can help provide guidance and a deeper understanding of the content of international human 
rights standards. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur can play, and already has played, a 
crucial role in that regard, as has the work of other international human rights mechanisms, 
including the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, the United Nations treaty bodies and regional human rights 
mechanisms, and the work of the Secretariat. Second, beyond just engaging in thematic 
analysis and interpretation of particular rights, assistance from the international system and 
other experts can provide technical assistance, including mediation, to help States and 
indigenous peoples work through conflicts and disagreements where they arise. In this 
second area in particular, much more work can be done. 
</p>
<p>26. In situations in which agreement simply cannot be reached and decisions must be 
taken, recourse mechanisms must be available at the national and international levels. At 
the national level, domestic courts are intended to provide that oversight, although in some </p>


<p>cases there is debate as to their effectiveness. At the international level, there are already 
various mechanisms for monitoring State compliance, including the treaty bodies, the 
Human Rights Council&#8217;s universal periodic review process, regional human rights oversight 
mechanisms and the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. 
Of those mechanisms, only the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate focuses on monitoring how 
the rights of indigenous peoples in particular are respected, protected and fulfilled.   
</p>
<p><b> C. Unfulfilled need for reconciliation and redress for historical wrongs 
</b></p>
<p>27. Also presenting barriers to the full and effective realization of the rights of 
indigenous peoples are steps that have not yet been taken towards reconciliation with 
indigenous peoples and redress for past violations of human rights. Indigenous peoples 
around the world in the past have suffered gross and systematic violations of their human 
rights and those violations have ongoing consequences in the present day that continue to 
affect their human rights situation. In most countries in which indigenous peoples live, 
however, meaningful reconciliation efforts have yet to place. Without such efforts, it will 
be difficult for indigenous peoples to overcome their situations of extreme marginalization, 
and to ensure sustainable relationships based on trust, mutual respect and partnership, 
between indigenous peoples and the States within which they live.  
</p>
<p>28. There is no one path or fast track towards reconciliation, and the history and context 
in each country will necessarily make responses different. However, the process generally 
includes a first step of acknowledging a history of wrongdoing. In some countries, 
reconciliation efforts have included a formal apology to indigenous peoples for past 
wrongdoing or particularly egregious human rights violations. For example, in 2008 the 
Government of Australia issued a formal apology to aboriginal peoples, &#8220;for the laws and 
policies of successive Parliaments and governments that have inflicted profound grief, 
suffering and loss&#8221; and in particular for &#8220;the removal of Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander children from their families, their communities and their country&#8221;.2 Similarly, in 
2008 in Canada, the Government apologized to aboriginal peoples for its role in the Indian 
Residential Schools system, recognizing that &#8220;the absence of an apology has been an 
impediment to healing and reconciliation&#8221;.3 Other States that have issued formal apologies 
are the United States with regard to historical suffering inflicted upon Native Americans; 
Norway and Sweden, with respect to past treatment of the Sami peoples; and New Zealand, 
where formal apologies often form part of negotiated settlement agreements under the 
Treaty of Waitangi. 
</p>
<p>29. It is worth noting that the public nature of those apologies contributes to their 
efficacy. In a counter-example mentioned by the previous Special Rapporteur in his report 
on the situation of indigenous peoples in the United States (A/HRC/21/47/Add.1), although 
the Government made the important step in 2010 of issuing a formal apology to Native 
Americans which acknowledged widespread wrongdoing by the Government &#8220;strangely, 
the apology was buried deep in a defense appropriations act, and apparently few indigenous 
people, much less the public in general, were made aware of it&#8221; (ibid., para. 74). Public 
recognition is fundamental for numerous reasons, including providing recognition to 
indigenous victims, demonstrating a commitment on the part of the State to put an end to or 
remedy violations and educating the broader society about the history of mistreatment of 
indigenous peoples and the Government&#8217;s role in that regard.

<p>30. Also essential to reconciliation are affirmative steps of redress to remedy the 
ongoing manifestations of harm. Throughout the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples there are calls for &#8220;effective mechanisms&#8221; for redress in connection 
with a range of rights. Indeed, as noted by the previous Special Rapporteur in his first 
report to the Human Rights Council, the Declaration in its entirety can be understood as 
fundamentally a &#8220;remedial&#8221; instrument that &#8220;aims at repairing the ongoing consequences of 
the historical denial of the right to self-determination and other basic human rights affirmed 
in international instruments of general applicability&#8221; (A/HRC/9/9, para. 36). Specifically, 
redress is required for any action aimed at depriving indigenous peoples of their integrity as 
distinct peoples (art 8, para. 2 (a)); any action with the aim or effect of dispossessing them 
of their lands, territories or resources (art. 8, para. 2 (b)); any form of forced assimilation or 
integration (art. 8, para. 2 (d)); for the taking of their cultural, intellectual, religious or 
spiritual property (art 11); depriving them of their means of subsistence (art. 20, para. 2); as 
well as for the development, utilization or exploitation of their mineral, water or other 
resources (art. 32, para. 2).  
</p><p>31. Perhaps the clearest manifestation that redress is still needed for indigenous peoples 
around the world is their continued lack of access to and security over their traditional 
lands. In that regard, in article 28 of the Declaration, it is stated that &#8220;indigenous peoples 
have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not possible, 
just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they 
have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, 
taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed consent&#8221; and that 
this compensation &#8220;shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, 
size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress&#8221;. While 
advances have without a doubt been made over the past several decades in returning lands 
to indigenous peoples and protecting their existing land bases, more remains to be done 
nearly everywhere. There are, of course, a number of ways in which land restitution can 
and has taken place, including through executive decrees, judicial decisions or negotiated 
arrangements, although complications can arise, especially when competing private third 
party interests are involved. 
</p>
<p>32. Finally, meaningful reconciliation must also include steps to ensure the non-
recurrence of violations. This is essential for rebuilding trust and restoring confidence in the 
State and indeed, it is difficult to envision true healing by indigenous peoples in an 
environment in which violations continue to occur. While States have gone a long way 
towards putting an end to the most egregious human rights violations against indigenous 
peoples, abuses are still occurring in all the countries in which they live. Current violations 
often present the most urgent issues that need addressing and are often the focus of 
attention of the international human rights system. However, addressing those violations 
does not take the place of the still much needed deeper reconciliation efforts that 
recognition and redress can provide.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur would like to point out that implementing all of the above-
mentioned measures does not necessarily guarantee that true reconciliation will occur. An 
essential component of the process also involves shifting attitudes on a personal and 
societal level, which the Special Rapporteur fully acknowledges is not an easy task. She 
discusses particular concerns in that regard in the following section. It should also be noted 
that, in 2014, the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples continued its 
study entitled &#8220;Access to justice in the promotion and protection of the rights of indigenous 
peoples &#8212; restorative justice, indigenous juridical systems and access to justice for 
indigenous women, children and youth, and persons with disabilities&#8221; (see 
A/HRC/EMRIP/2014/3/Rev.1), including a discussion on restorative justice and provides 
further comments on the issue. </p>


<p><b> D. Ongoing negative attitudes towards and distorted perceptions of 
indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>34. Linked with reconciliation yet to be completed and preventing the full enjoyment of 
the rights of indigenous peoples are the ongoing negative perceptions of indigenous peoples 
among the broader societies in which they live, including within governments. As noted 
further below, the Special Rapporteur observes that there is a range of such attitudes 
towards indigenous peoples, from those that are outwardly prejudicial, to those that ignore 
or undervalue indigenous peoples&#8217; distinct identities and ways of life, to those that fail to 
understand the reasons for protecting indigenous rights. One or more of those attitudes may 
be present at any time. Each has effects both on a State&#8217;s efforts to respond to indigenous 
peoples&#8217; concerns and on indigenous peoples themselves, potentially resulting in negative 
self-image or the suppression of indigenous identities. 
</p>
<p>35. Ongoing discrimination against indigenous peoples has its roots in the perceived 
superiority of the colonial population and its descendants, perceptions that were historically 
accompanied by laws and policies aimed at suppressing or eliminating indigenous identity 
and assimilating indigenous peoples into the dominant culture. In many countries, 
constitutional provisions and laws contained expressly racist language and barred 
indigenous peoples from carrying out a range of their own activities, such as performing 
cultural and religious ceremonies, and from participating in the life of the State, such as 
through voting or owning land. Some of the most notorious examples of such policies were 
those that overtly aimed at eliminating or &#8220;breeding out&#8221; aboriginal identity by removing 
indigenous children from their families and communities and placing them in non-
indigenous environments, and by forbidding them to speak their own languages or practise 
their cultural traditions.  
</p>
<p>36. Racist laws and policies of that kind have almost entirely been eliminated around the 
world and are no longer tolerated. However, it has to be noted that, to date, the legal 
frameworks in some countries continue to officially refer to indigenous peoples as primitive 
tribal groups, subhumans or creatures. In most countries where indigenous peoples live, 
there have been many advances in furthering the rights of indigenous peoples, safeguarding 
their distinct cultures and ways of life and recognizing and combating the injustices that 
they still endure. Nevertheless, the laws and policies of the past have left in their wake 
continued discriminatory attitudes that distort perceptions of indigenous peoples and hinder 
their ability to thrive as distinct communities with their cultures, traditions and way of life 
intact. Those attitudes are evident at the individual, societal and institutional levels and can 
be perpetuated by public figures, the media and popular culture, everyday language and 
imagery, and even by children&#8217;s schoolbooks.  
</p>
<p>37. One kind of negative attitude involves discrimination, prejudice and the stereotyping 
of indigenous peoples. This can take many different forms, including the perception that 
indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures and traditions are backward, primitive or underdeveloped, or 
that they suffer from widespread and entrenched social problems, such as alcoholism or 
violence against women. Such attitudes can be accompanied by the perception that 
indigenous peoples are incapable of managing their own affairs, or simply that the State can 
do it better, resulting in paternalistic laws and policies that limit or remove indigenous 
peoples&#8217; control over decisions relating to their own affairs, including their governmental or 
judicial systems.  
</p><p>38. Alternatively, indigenous peoples all but disappear from public awareness and 
discourse and are rendered invisible to the mainstream in the countries in which they live, 
their contributions to the history and the present-day social and cultural make-up of those 
countries unknown or not valued. This is especially evident in countries with a small 
number of indigenous peoples or where they live in rural and isolated areas and interaction </p>


<p>with the mainstream society is minimal. Such invisibility hampers the ability of indigenous 
peoples to access national communications or the media, and to have their voices heard in 
decision-making centres, and can result in non-indigenous people speaking for them or 
making decisions on their behalf or in spite of them. 
</p>
<p>39. Other kinds of distorted views about indigenous peoples demonstrate a lack of 
understanding of why and how indigenous peoples&#8217; rights should be protected. Certainly, 
there are still many among the non-indigenous population who hold the view that 
indigenous peoples should just join the mainstream, or that they should &#8220;get over&#8221; their 
pasts and &#8220;move on&#8221;. In that connection, indigenous peoples may be viewed as receiving 
special entitlements and privileges not enjoyed by the rest of the population, resulting in 
feelings of resentment among the broader society. Even if those views may not be 
outwardly pernicious, they can inhibit the development of differentiated rights protection 
and affirmative action measures that are needed for remedying ongoing situations of 
marginalization and ensuring that indigenous peoples can survive as distinct peoples. 
</p>
<p>40. Finally, the Special Rapporteur has also seen examples of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
interests being viewed as standing in opposition to those of the mainstream. This is 
especially true in the context of natural resource development. Rather than focusing 
attention on addressing the concerns raised by indigenous peoples in the context of specific 
projects, public figures and others instead portray indigenous peoples as &#8220;blocking&#8221; 
projects that could bring economic benefits to the country as a whole, or as having some 
ideological or categorical opposition to natural resource development. In those situations, 
rather than the interests of the State and the broader society being considered as 
encompassing indigenous peoples&#8217; interests, indigenous peoples are perceived as posing an 
impediment to national interests. Of course, such perceptions add to a climate that is not 
conducive to governmental and public support for the promotion of the rights of indigenous 
peoples. 
</p>
<p>41. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in various 
articles, promotes as one of its central themes the elimination of discrimination against 
indigenous peoples. In particular, article 15 provides that &#8220;States shall take effective 
measures, in consultation and cooperation with the indigenous peoples concerned, to 
combat prejudice and eliminate discrimination and to promote tolerance, understanding and 
good relations among indigenous peoples and all other segments of society&#8221;. Shifting 
attitudes and entrenched perceptions is no easy task, but it can be assisted to a great extent 
by increasing indigenous peoples&#8217; participation in decision-making, through widespread 
education and awareness-raising programmes and, perhaps obviously, by governments 
themselves demonstrating a commitment to the implementation of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights. The Special Rapporteur notes that the United Nations system can contribute to these 
efforts. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Social and economic conditions  
</b></p>
<p>42. The nearly universal disadvantageous social and economic conditions of indigenous 
peoples as compared to the majority of the population in the societies in which they live 
present barriers to the full exercise of their human rights. Unless indigenous peoples enjoy 
certain minimum conditions of well-being, they will be unable to truly thrive with their 
rights intact. According to many different indicators, indigenous peoples fare worse than 
their non-indigenous counterparts in terms of their development, including with regard to 
levels of poverty, education, health, unemployment, housing conditions, clean water and 
sanitation.  
</p>
<p>43. Certainly, a number of countries in which indigenous peoples live face enormous 
developmental challenges and indigenous peoples may be one group among many within a </p>


<p>country that experiences difficulties in that regard. Nevertheless, indigenous peoples face 
distinct challenges, and measures to address social and economic disparities must be 
differentiated from measures targeting other disadvantaged groups.  
</p>
<p>44. First of all, it is necessary to understand the linkages between indigenous peoples&#8217; 
current disadvantaged situations and their history of being denied self-determination land 
and resource rights, and related rights essential to their economic and social development. 
In fact, development around the world has historically taken place and still takes place 
today at the expense of indigenous peoples; it has often been the case that indigenous 
peoples&#8217; lands and resources have been taken, to their detriment and to the benefit of the 
development of others. Responses aimed at bettering the social and economic situation of 
indigenous peoples must take that history into account and attempt to restore to indigenous 
peoples what has been lost, including sufficient land to ensure a basis for economic 
development, and the means to exercise their self-determination over their development. 
Indeed, numerous studies have shown that increasing indigenous peoples&#8217; control over their 
internal decision-making results in better economic growth outcomes. 
</p>
<p>45. An additional factor is that indigenous peoples often live in rural and isolated areas, 
which complicates the delivery of programmes and services designed to respond to their 
social and economic concerns. This, of course, is not an issue that can or should be resolved 
by moving indigenous peoples to urban areas as some countries have attempted to do, 
which could result in a violation of a number of their human rights. Rather, measures must 
be put in place to ensure that indigenous peoples can enjoy the same social and economic 
rights as other segments of the population, without having to sacrifice important aspects of 
their cultures and ways of life, which include their attachment to their traditional lands. 
</p>
<p>46. Furthermore, given their unique cultures and ways of life, it must also be noted that 
social and economic development for indigenous peoples may be different than for other 
sectors of the population. Responses aimed at addressing ongoing problems must take into 
account special factors, including indigenous peoples&#8217; languages, traditions and ways of 
doing things. This is fundamental to the success of any relevant measures. One way to 
ensure the accommodation of indigenous peoples&#8217; cultures is by including them in the 
design and development of programming. In that connection, throughout the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, reference is made to the need for 
indigenous peoples to develop their own priorities for development and to be consulted and 
included in the process of crafting State programmes. 
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that improving the social and economic 
conditions of indigenous peoples may be one of the most difficult problems for States to 
address. In her first report to the General Assembly, which will be presented in October 
2014, she will focus on the issue of development, discuss the post-2015 development 
agenda and provide some views on sustainable development for indigenous peoples. 
Furthermore, as discussed in more detail below, throughout her mandate she hopes to pay 
special attention to issues related to the social, cultural, economic and environmental rights 
of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Preliminary comments on the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s vision for 
the mandate 
</b></p>
<p>48. In accordance with her mandate from the Human Rights Council, the Special 
Rapporteur intends to carry out her work within those areas generally targeted by special 
procedures mandate holders, i.e.: the promotion of good practices, country assessments, 
communications concerning alleged human rights violations and thematic studies. While 
carrying out work in those areas, she will coordinate her activities with the two other </p>


<p>United Nations mechanisms with a specific mandate concerning indigenous peoples, as 
well as with the treaty bodies and regional human rights systems. In all of that work, the 
Special Rapporteur intends to follow up and reinforce the observations and 
recommendations made by her predecessors. 
</p>
<p>49. In the present global context, where the international community is in the process of 
defining the post-2015 development agenda, the Special Rapporteur sees the importance of 
monitoring how indigenous peoples&#8217; rights to, among other things, development, lands, 
territories and resources and culture are going to be considered in that global effort. She is 
aware how the human rights-based approach to development and human rights 
mainstreaming are still quite marginal in the overall global and national development 
agendas. That reality is reflected in how indigenous peoples have been generally sidelined 
in the design, targets, indicators and implementation of the Millennium Development 
Goals.   
</p>
<p>50. Closely related to the development agenda are the global and regional multilateral, 
plurilateral and bilateral investment and trade treaties and agreements entered into by States 
in which indigenous peoples are found. Many of those treaties and agreements have direct 
implications for how lands, territories, resources and traditional knowledge systems of 
indigenous peoples are regarded and used. In the past, some indigenous peoples have 
engaged in the negotiations of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
Property Rights of the World Trade Organization because of the implications for their 
rights to their traditional knowledge, such as their knowledge and use of medicinal plants. 
Some agreements which allow for the liberalization and deregulation of existing laws and 
policies, and have the effect of undermining existing human rights, social and 
environmental standards, can have detrimental effects on indigenous peoples. Much more 
needs to be done to understand fully how such treaties and agreements can undermine or 
reinforce indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and how they shape the trajectories of national 
economic development plans.   
</p>
<p>51. With the worsening environmental crisis and the increased efforts of the 
international community to deal with it, the Special Rapporteur recognizes the need to 
analyse the impacts of the crisis on indigenous peoples and ensure that measures to mitigate 
the impacts do not lead to further marginalization of indigenous peoples and violations of 
their rights. She intends to examine how the human rights of indigenous peoples are 
affected by the environmental situation and how decisions, policies and programmes under 
multilateral environmental agreements take into account indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, issues 
and contributions in addressing this problem.  
</p>
<p>52. Clearly, existing and future economic investment and trade agreements and treaties, 
as well as conventions on the environment and on culture, have a direct impact on the 
economic, social, environmental and cultural rights of indigenous peoples. There are 
numerous issues that merit thematic attention. Nevertheless, in order to maximize the 
impact of her investigations, the Special Rapporteur intends to focus her efforts over the 
next three years of her mandate on issues surrounding economic, social, cultural and 
environmental rights of indigenous peoples, which could include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Poverty, inequality and development issues facing indigenous peoples, including 
their right to determine their own development visions and strategies, and how those 
issues should be addressed in the processes of defining sustainable development 
goals and the post-2015 development agenda; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The health situation of indigenous peoples, including issues of access to culturally 
appropriate health services and traditional medicine and the role of  indigenous 
health-related knowledge, innovations and healing practices in that regard; </p>


<p>&#8226; Issues related to the right to education of indigenous peoples, especially bilingual 
and intercultural education and access to appropriate and culturally sensitive 
educational services; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Measures to protect and promote indigenous cultural heritage and traditional 
knowledge, including developments in conventions and standard-setting processes 
related to the protection of traditional knowledge and respect for the right to culture 
and the equitable sharing of benefits which accrue from the use of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; knowledge, innovations and practices;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Economic and social rights and other human rights issues regarding indigenous 
women and children in various settings, such as migration, trafficking of women and 
girls, violent conflicts, the informal economy, child labour, etc.; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The impacts of policies and programmes of international and regional financial 
institutions, multilateral and bilateral investment and trade agreements and foreign 
aid on indigenous peoples, especially in relation to development projects affecting 
indigenous peoples, including good practices of such cooperation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The impact of policies, programmes, decisions under legally binding multilateral 
environmental agreements4 on indigenous peoples, particularly with regard to how 
their rights enshrined in the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 
International Labour Organization Convention No. 169 (1989) and other related 
human rights instruments are being protected, respected and fulfilled in the 
implementation of those Conventions at the national level.  
</p>
<p>53. While the previous mandate holders have integrated a focus on women and children 
areas into their works, including during country visits, as required under the mandates 
established by the Human Rights Council, women and children have never been the focus 
of a thematic report. The present Special Rapporteur considers that it is time to rectify that. 
She recognizes the need to coordinate closely with other special procedures mandate 
holders, especially those dealing with issues of women and children, as well as with treaty 
bodies such as the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child.  
</p>
<p>54. A crucial element for the success of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate will be 
assessments of the situation of indigenous peoples in specific countries. To the extent that 
time and resources are limited, such visits will have to be prepared carefully for maximum 
results. During the first year of her mandate, the Special Rapporteur hopes to carry out 
country visits within each of the regions. She notes that the previous Special Rapporteurs, 
in addition to visits to northern countries such as the Nordic countries, the United States 
and Canada, have carried out numerous visits to the Latin American region. The Special 
Rapporteur acknowledges that this is due in large part to the openness of countries within 
the Latin American region to visits by the Special Rapporteur to look into issues related to 
indigenous peoples. She hopes that countries in other regions, especially in Asia and Africa, 
will demonstrate a similar openness during the course of her mandate. The Special 
Rapporteur also envisions that visits to specific countries could feed in to her thematic 
studies.  
</p>
<p>55. The mandate of the Special Rapporteur relies on establishing fluid communications 
with indigenous organizations and receiving communications from individuals and peoples 
regarding their human rights conditions. She has already written several communications to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
  Among others, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Convention on 
</p>
<p>Biological Diversity, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.  </p>


<p>governments concerning issues brought to her attention. She would like to recall that the 
Human Rights Council has urged to States cooperate with, and assist, the special 
procedures in the performance of their tasks and to provide all information in a timely 
manner, as well as to respond to communications transmitted to them by the special 
procedures without undue delay (resolution 5/2, para. 2). To the extent possible within the 
restrictions of available resources, the Special Rapporteur would also like to continue the 
practice initiated by the previous Special Rapporteur of carrying out on-site visits to 
examine in depth particular cases of allegations of violations of human rights brought to her 
attention. 
</p>
<p>56. As noted above, in her work, the Special Rapporteur hopes to contribute to the 
operationalization of the rights of indigenous peoples though: raising awareness about those 
rights of indigenous peoples; helping to develop indicators against which to assess 
progress; identifying good practices; helping to find common ground between the positions 
of States and indigenous peoples; and providing guidance in the interpretation of rights. In 
connection with the barriers identified in section III above regarding ongoing 
discriminatory attitudes towards indigenous peoples on the part of the mainstream society, 
the Special Rapporteur foresees that a major component of her work will be awareness-
raising among the broader public about the rights and concerns of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions  
</b>57.<b> At both the international and domestic levels, there is a strong legal and policy 
foundation upon which to move forward with the implementation of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights, and there have been many advances in that regard.  
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> Nevertheless, there are still numerous obstacles preventing indigenous peoples 
from fully enjoying their human rights, found to some extent in all countries where 
indigenous peoples are living.  
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> One barrier to the implementation of the international human rights standards 
concerning indigenous peoples relates to the application of the concept of &#8220;indigenous 
peoples&#8221; in relation to certain groups.  
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> By failing to recognize groups as indigenous peoples, States and other actors 
avoid applying the international standards and protection mechanisms that are most 
appropriate to address the kinds of human rights concerns that these groups face in 
common with groups that are generally identified as indigenous around the world. 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> There is a need to employ a flexible approach that takes into account the core 
attributes that distinguish indigenous peoples from minority groups or other local 
communities. That approach focuses on the rights at stake and asks whether the 
international framework with respect to the rights of indigenous peoples proves useful 
in addressing the issues and concerns faced by the group in question. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> A second barrier involves difficulties of States in the operationalization of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights. Those difficulties relate to a lack of awareness about the 
rights and standards; difficulties in identifying practical steps for implementation; 
and conflicting interpretations of the content of rights. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> With respect to the difficulties involved in identifying practical steps for 
implementation, it is important that States, together with indigenous peoples, carry 
out strategic planning, develop monitoring mechanisms and indicators, and identify 
what has worked and try to replicate successful experiences. </b></p>


<p>64.<b> A third barrier to the full and effective realization of the rights of indigenous 
peoples is steps that have not yet been taken towards reconciliation with indigenous 
peoples and redress for past violations of their human rights.  
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>There is no one path or fast track towards reconciliation, and the history and 
context of each country will necessarily make the response vary. However, the process 
generally includes acknowledging a history of wrongdoing, taking affirmative steps to 
provide redress for and to remedy the ongoing manifestations of past harm, and 
implementing measures to ensure the non-recurrence of violations. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> Linked with reconciliation yet to be completed, a fourth barrier to the full 
enjoyment of the rights of indigenous peoples is the ongoing negative perceptions of 
indigenous peoples among the broader societies in which they live, including within 
governments.  
</b></p>
<p>67<b>. Such negative perceptions include those that are discriminatory, prejudicial or 
stereotypical towards indigenous peoples; those that render indigenous peoples 
invisible to the mainstream in the countries in which they live, making their 
contributions to the history and to the present-day social and cultural make-up of 
those countries unknown or not valued; those that demonstrate a lack of 
understanding about why and how indigenous peoples&#8217; rights should be protected; 
and those that portray indigenous peoples&#8217; interests as standing in opposition to those 
of the mainstream. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> Finally, the nearly universal disadvantageous social and economic conditions of 
indigenous peoples as compared to the economic and social conditions of the majority 
societies in which they live present a fifth barrier to the full exercise of their human 
rights. Unless indigenous peoples enjoy certain minimum conditions of well-being, 
they will be unable to truly thrive with their rights intact. 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> While the Special Rapporteur fully acknowledges the difficulties in confronting 
and overcoming the continuing problems, she hopes to be able to make headway in 
tackling some of those obstacles during the course of her mandate.  
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur intends to carry out her work within 
those areas generally targeted by special procedures mandate holders, i.e.: the 
promotion of good practices, country assessments, communications concerning alleged 
human rights violations and thematic studies. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> While there are numerous issues that merit thematic attention, the Special 
Rapporteur intends to focus her efforts over the next three years of her mandate on 
issues surrounding economic, social, cultural and environmental rights of indigenous 
peoples.
