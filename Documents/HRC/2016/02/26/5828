<p>*  Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. </p>

 <p></p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the right of States to establish laws governing the acquisition, renunciation or 
loss of nationality in accordance with international law, and noting that the issue of statelessness 
is already under consideration by the General Assembly within the broad issue of State 
succession, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the provisions of international human rights instruments and international 
instruments on statelessness and nationality prohibiting arbitrary deprivation of nationality,

States parties, the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons and the Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol thereto, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing </i>that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated 
and that the international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal 
manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolution 63/148, in which, inter alia, the Assembly urged 
the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to continue its work with 
regard to identifying stateless persons, preventing and reducing statelessness and protecting 
stateless persons, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the important work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees in seeking to address and prevent the problem of statelessness, as guided by, in 
particular, the conclusion of its Executive Committee on identification, prevention and reduction 
of statelessness and protection of stateless persons No. 106 (LVII) 2006, </p>

 <p></p>
<p><i> Mindful </i>of the endorsement by the General Assembly, in its resolution 41/70 
of 3 December 1986, of the call upon all States to promote human rights and fundamental 
freedoms and to refrain from denying those to individuals in their populations because of 
nationality, ethnicity, race, religion or language, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>General Assembly resolutions 55/153 of 12 December 2000 and 59/34 
of 2 December 2004 on the nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking note with appreciation of</i> the report of the Secretary-General submitted in 
accordance with Council resolution 7/10 (A/HRC/10/34) and the contributions made to it by 
States and other stakeholders, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the work done by the independent expert on minority issues on the subject of the 
right to nationality (A/HRC/7/23), 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern </i>at the arbitrary deprivation of persons or groups of persons of 
their nationality, especially on discriminatory grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, 
religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>that arbitrarily depriving a person of his or her nationality may lead to 
statelessness, and in this regard expressing concern at various forms of discrimination against 
stateless persons that violate the obligations of States under international human rights law, 
</p>
<p><i> Emphasizing </i>that the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons whose nationality 
may be affected by State succession must be fully respected, 
</p>
<p> 1.<i> Reaffirms </i>that the right to a nationality of every human person is a fundamental 
human right; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Recognizes </i>that arbitrary deprivation of nationality, especially on discriminatory 
grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status, is a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms;</p>

 <p></p>
<p> 3.<i> Calls upon </i>all States to refrain from taking discriminatory measures and from 
enacting or maintaining legislation that would arbitrarily deprive persons of their nationality on 
grounds of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social 
origin, property, birth or other status, especially if such measures and legislation render a person 
stateless; 
</p>
<p> 4.<i> Urges </i>all States to adopt and implement nationality legislation with a view to 
avoiding statelessness, consistent with fundamental principles of international law, in particular 
by preventing arbitrary deprivation of nationality and statelessness as a result of State 
succession; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Encourages </i>States that have not done so to consider acceding to the Convention on 
the Reduction of Statelessness and the Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Notes </i>that the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of an 
individual might be impeded as a result of arbitrary deprivation of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Expresses its concern </i>that persons arbitrarily deprived of nationality may be affected 
by poverty, social exclusion and legal incapacity; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Recognizes</i> the special needs of children for protection against arbitrary deprivation 
of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also</i> <i>recognizes </i>that arbitrary deprivation of nationality disproportionately affects 
persons belonging to minorities; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Calls upon </i>States to ensure access of persons arbitrarily deprived of their nationality 
to effective remedies, including, but not limited to, restoration of nationality; 
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Urges </i>relevant United Nations human rights mechanisms and the appropriate treaty 
bodies and encourages the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to 
continue to collect information on the issue of human rights and arbitrary deprivation of

recommendations thereon, in their reports and activities conducted within their respective 
mandates; </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 12. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to prepare a report on the right to nationality with 
</p>
<p>emphasis on the issue of arbitrary deprivation of nationality including in cases of States 
succession, taking into account the information gathered pursuant to Council resolution 7/10, 
similar studies conducted by the Subcommission for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights and other relevant sources of information, and to present it to the Council at its 
thirteenth session; 
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Decides </i>to continue its consideration of this matter at its thirteenth session under the 
same agenda item.
