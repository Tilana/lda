Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
The following Management's Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") focuses on the financial
condition and results of operations of MAG Silver Corp. ("MAG" or the "Company") for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  It is prepared as of August 15, 2016 and should
be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements of
the Company for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and the audited annual
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015,
together with the notes thereto which are available on SEDAR and EDGAR or on the Company
website at www.magsilver.com.
All dollar amounts referred to in this MD&A are expressed in thousands of United States dollars
("US$") unless otherwise stated.  The functional currency of the parent and the functional
currency of its Mexican subsidiaries and investment in associate is the US$.
The common shares of the company trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the NYSE
MKT both under the symbol MAG.  The Company is a reporting issuer in the Provinces of British
Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince
Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador and is a reporting "foreign issuer" in the United
States of America.  The Company believes it is a Passive Foreign Investment Company ("PFIC"),

Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Although the Company believes the expectations expressed in such forward-looking statements
are based on what the Company's management considers to be reasonable assumptions, based
on the information currently available to it, such statements are not guarantees of future
performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those in the forward-
looking statements.  Assumptions have been made including, but not limited to, the Company's
ability to carry on its various exploration and development activities including project
development timelines, the timely receipt of required approvals and permits, the price of the
minerals the Company produces, the costs of operating, exploration and development
expenditures, the impact on operations of the Mexican Tax Regime, and the Company's ability to
obtain adequate financing.  The Company cannot assure you that actual events, performance or
results will be consistent with these forward-looking statements, and management's assumptions
may prove to be incorrect.  The forward-looking statements in this MD&A speak only as of the
date hereof and we do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if
circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change other than as
required by applicable law.  There is no certainty that any forward-looking statement will come to
pass and investors should not place undue reliance upon forward-looking statements.  More
information about the Company including its AIF and recent financial reports is available on
SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's EDGAR
website at www.sec.gov.
Cautionary Note to Investors Concerning Estimates of Indicated and Inferred Mineral Resources
This MD&A uses the terms "Indicated Mineral Resources" and "Inferred Mineral Resources".
 MAG advises investors that although these terms are recognized and required by Canadian
regulations (under National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects), the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not recognize these terms.  Investors are
cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever
be converted into reserves. In addition, "Inferred Mineral Resources" have a great amount of
uncertainty as to their existence. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an Inferred Mineral
Resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category.  Under Canadian rules, estimates of
Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic
considerations applied to them to enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves and,
accordingly, Inferred Mineral Resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility
studies, or economic studies except for a "Preliminary Economic Assessment" as defined under
NI 43-101.  Investors are cautioned not to assume that part or all of an Inferred Resource exists,
or is economically or legally mineable.
 
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
The Company is a Vancouver-based mineral exploration and development company that is
focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of district scale projects located within
the Mexican silver belt. The Company's principal assets include the Company's 44% interest in
the Juanicipio joint venture (the "Juanicipio Property"), and its 100% owned Cinco de Mayo
property (the "Cinco de Mayo Property"), both located in Mexico. The Company also owns a
100% interest in the Guigui property, also in Mexico.

MAG SILVER CORP.
Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Juanicipio Property
The Company owns 44% of Minera Juanicipio S.A. de C.V. ("Minera Juanicipio"), a Mexican
incorporated joint venture company, which owns the high grade Juanicipio Property, located in
the Fresnillo District, Zacatecas State, Mexico.  Both exploration and development of the
Juanicipio Property are being carried out by the project operator, Fresnillo plc ("Fresnillo"), which
holds the remaining 56% interest in the joint venture.
The major asset associated with the Juanicipio Property is a high grade silver-gold-lead-zinc
epithermal vein deposit.  Exploration and development programs for the Juanicipio Property are
designed by the Minera Juanicipio Technical Committee, and approved by the Minera Juanicipio
Board of Directors.  The Company's share of costs is funded primarily through its 44% interest in
Minera Juanicipio, and to a lesser extent, incurred directly by the Company to cover expenses
related to parallel technical studies and analyses commissioned by the Company, as well as
direct project oversight.  Minera Juanicipio is governed by a shareholders agreement and
corporate by-laws, pursuant to which each shareholder is to provide funding pro rata to its
interest in Minera Juanicipio, and if either party does not fund pro rata, their ownership interest
will be diluted in accordance with the shareholders agreement.
Underground development commenced at the Juanicipio Property on October 28, 2013. The
development program is based on recommendations made to Minera Juanicipio in a 2012
Preliminary Economic Assessment carried out by AMC Mining Consultants (Canada) Ltd.
("AMC") (see Press Release dated June 14, 2012) ("2012 PEA").  The 2012 PEA was
subsequently reproduced in the same form in 2014 by Roscoe Postle Associates Inc. ("RPA") in
their amended and restated NI 43-101 Technical Report documenting a 2014 updated Mineral
Resource estimate, filed on SEDAR on July 3, 2014 (the "Juanicipio Technical Report") (see
Press Release dated May 27, 2014).
The 2012 PEA defined Juanicipio as an economically robust, high-grade underground silver
project exhibiting minimal financial or development risks that will produce an annual average of
15.1 million payable ounces of silver over the first full six years of commercial production and
10.3 million payable ounces per year over a 14.8 year total mine life.  The 2012 PEA was based
on a resource estimate and model developed by Strathcona Mineral Services ("Strathcona")
dated November 2011. The 2014 Juanicipio Technical Report included an updated Juanicipio
resource based on in-fill drill results from a 2012-2013 drill program, and manually divided the
resource into the Bonanza Grade Silver Zone ("BGS Zone") and the Deep Zone. The BGS Zone
resource veins have a similar footprint as prior resource estimates (see Press Releases dated
November 10, 2011 and December 19, 2011), with the higher drill density converting a significant
proportion of the previous Inferred Resource into the Indicated category.  With minimal change to
the BGS Zone footprint, the Juanicipio Technical Report from RPA stated that the results of the
2012 PEA remain a reasonable representation of the property's economic potential.
The economic analysis in the Juanicipio Technical Report is preliminary in nature and is based,
in part, on Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have
the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as
Mineral Reserves.  There is no certainty that a Preliminary Economic Assessment will be
realized.

MAG SILVER CORP.
Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Exploration results from drilling in the first quarter of 2015 on the Valdecañas Vein included four
new exploration step-out holes (P1-P4) targeted approximately 100 metres below the existing
Indicated and Inferred Resources reported in the Juanicipio Technical Report.  As a point of
definition, the Valdecañas Vein is an en echelon system comprised of overlapping East and
West Veins – the term "Valdecañas Vein" is used to refer to this en echelon system at times.  The
four holes were drilled on nominal 150 metre centres over a strike length of approximately 500
metres below the en echelon overlap zone between the East and West Valdecañas Veins and
include the three widest and deepest intercepts to date on the property (see Press Release dated
April 23, 2015).  This new "Deep Zone" appears to be the extension of the southwest dipping
West Valdecañas Vein and a similar deep continuation of the East Valdecañas Vein was
announced subsequent to the quarter end (see "Exploration Juanicipio Property" below). The
Deep Zone effectively remains open to depth and laterally along its entire strike length to the joint
venture boundary in both directions.
The intercepts from these four holes widen progressively from 11.69 up to 32.09 metres (true
widths) towards the east towards the overlap zone.  The intercepts also show calc-silicate (skarn)
alteration in and around the veins and the first significant copper  values (0.2-0.8% copper) for the
entire area, both of which are indicators of higher temperature mineralization conditions.  The
high silver and gold in Holes P2 and P3 coincide with zones of overprinted quartz veins that cut
across earlier base-metal rich calc-silicate vein stages, indicating superimposition of an
additional precious-metals rich vein stage.  The appearance of copper and strong skarn
alteration in this area, combined with the later cross-cutting silver-gold rich veining, suggests that
Minera Juanicipio may have hit an ore-fluid upwelling zone, which could open up new
exploration targets throughout the entire Valdecañas Vein area.
Cinco de Mayo Property
The Company owns 100% of the mineral concessions comprising the Cinco de Mayo Property.
The property is located approximately 190 kilometres northwest of the city of Chihuahua, in
northern Chihuahua State, Mexico, and covers approximately 25,113 hectares. The primary
concessions of the Cinco de Mayo Property were acquired by way of an option agreement dated
February 26, 2004, and the property remains subject to a 2.5% net smelter returns royalty.  The
project consists of four major mineralized zones: the Upper Manto silver-lead-zinc inferred
resource; the Pegaso deep discovery; the non-core Pozo Seco high grade molybdenum-gold
resource area; and the surrounding Cinco de Mayo exploration area.
No active exploration has been undertaken on the Cinco de Mayo Property since late 2012, as
the Company continues its efforts to obtain a renewed surface access agreement with the local
Ejido. Although the Company believes that the matter will ultimately be resolved, the overall
timeline to a resolution is not determinable at this time.
Guigui Property
The Guigui Property is a 100% interest in a 4,500-hectare property in the Santa Eulalia Mining
District of Chihuahua, Mexico, home to the world's largest Carbonate Replacement Deposit
("CRD") camp.  Strong aero-magnetic anomalies were identified in late 2007 but could not be
drilled because they straddled the eastern border of the original "Guigui" claim and continued
into ground covered by the Juarez Mega-Claim filed by the Mexican Geological Service in mid-
2007.  This adjoining part of the Juarez concession was liberated in July 2013 and the Company
filed for and obtained the additional 3,800 hectare "Guiguito" concession.  The combined
property now consists of roughly 8,300 hectares.  The eastern area magnetic anomalies were
drilled in 2015 and encountered pre-mineralization intrusions. Further exploration on the property
is currently being considered in the central and western areas of the concession package.

Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
2. HIGHLIGHTS
✓Deep exploration drilling at Juanicipio was ongoing throughout the quarter, and 6 drill rigs are
currently on the property drilling, 5 from surface and 1 from within the underground ramp.
2015-2016 drilling to further delineate the extent of the new Valdecañas Deep Zone was
completed, and assays released subsequent to the quarter end (see Press Release August 15,
2016).  Overall results show vein widths ranging from 5 to 22 metres with the highest zinc and
copper grades seen to date.  The new results show that mineralization in the Deep Zone
occurs in both the East and West Valdecañas Veins and extends mineralization roughly 250
✓
metres beneath the existing resource over a combined strike length of over 800 metres.  The
Deep Zone mineralization remains open to the property boundary in both directions: 450
metres to the west and over 700 metres to the east. Highlights within the results included:
VM2, a new discovery along the East Valdecañas Vein cut 29.85 metres (true thickness)
grading 235 grams per tonne ("g/t") silver, 0.50 g/t gold, and 4.76% lead, 5.79% zinc and 0.99%
copper.
P6 cut 22.9 metres (true thickness) in the West Valdecañas Vein reporting 119 g/t Ag, 1.13 g/t
gold, 4.18% lead, 11.89% zinc and 0.27%.
The drilling also resulted in the discovery of the "Anticipada Vein" a newly recognized vein of
unclear geometry lying about 100 metres into the hanging wall of the East Vein.  It has been cut
in five holes and swells from 0.8 metres (true width) in Hole VM2 to 6.68 metres (true width) in
Hole P13 where it grades 105 g/t silver, 2.69 g/t gold, 3.59% lead, 10.79% zinc and 0.23%
copper. It remains open in several directions.

✓
A supplemental $1,200 (MAG's 44% share is $528) budget for follow up drilling of the latest
exploration results at Valdecañas was approved by the Juanicipio Technical Committee in late
April 2016, and drilling is currently in process with six rigs turning on site.
✓
Advancement of the underground ramp decline at the Juanicipio Property continues to
progress at rates exceeding those envisioned in the Juanicipio Technical Report, with the
cumulative advance of the ramp now approaching 3,200 metres of the 3,500 metres needed to
reach the plane of the Valdecañas Vein.  At this rate the Valdecañas Vein plane should be
reached in late 2016 or early 2017.  The ramp will then descend into the footwall of the vein
and the initial mining access will be commenced.
✓
The Company remains well funded, with cash and term deposits totaling $140,858.  The
Company believes that it is fully funded for its 44% share of Juanicipio development costs, as
envisioned in the 2014 Juanicipio Technical Report.

3. FINANCING ACTIVITIES
Financing
On March 1, 2016, the Company closed a bought deal public offering and issued 8,905,000
common shares at $7.30 per share, for gross proceeds of $65,006.  On March 4, 2016, the
underwriters exercised in full an associated 15% over-allotment option, and the Company issued
an additional 1,335,750 common shares for additional gross proceeds of $9,751.  Total gross
proceeds were $74,757, and the Company paid commission to the underwriters of $3,497 and
legal and filing costs totaled an additional $606, resulting in net proceeds of $70,654. As outlined
in the public offering document, the Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering
primarily to fund development and exploration expenditures at the Juanicipio Property and for
working capital and general corporate purposes.
Given the Juanicipio development progress to date, and the Company's cash and term deposits
of $140,858 as at June 30, 2016, the Company believes that it has enough cash to fully fund its
44% share of development expenditures for the Juanicipio mine development, as envisioned in
the Juanicipio Technical Report (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below).
 
4. DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
Underground Development – Juanicipio Property
According to the Juanicipio Technical Report timeline, the first 33 months of development
focuses primarily on the ramp decline advancing towards the main Valdecañas Vein of the
property.  To date, the entry portal, surface explosives magazines, surface offices and associated
infrastructure have been completed, and the ramp decline is currently advancing with drilling and
blasting.  The ramp development advance rate is now at or exceeding the levels envisioned in
the Juanicipio Technical Report (115 metres per month), with the cumulative advance of the
ramp now approaching 3,200 metres of the 3,500 metres needed to reach the plane of the
Valdecañas en echelon Veins, at which time stope access and development will begin. At
current advance rates, the Company anticipates reaching the plane of the Valdecañas en
echelon Veins by late 2016 or early 2017.  As well, construction of additional ventilation raises
and surface installations continues.
Exploration – Juanicipio Property
Current Deep Drilling Program
In 2015, Fresnillo and MAG agreed to an additional 10,000 metre, 9 hole, $1,500 (MAG's 44%
share is $660) 2015 and 2016 drill program to further trace the extent of the new Valdecañas
Deep Zone and expand the mineralization hit in holes P1-P4 (see Press Release of April 23,
2015).  As well, a portion of the 2015 exploration budget for surface drill holes that was pending
permitting was reallocated to underground drilling beneath the East Valdecañas Vein to test it at
depths comparable to Holes P1-P4 drilled under the Valdecañas West Vein.  A drill station was
carved out along the decline at approximately 2,000 metres down ramp.  The surface and
underground drilling commenced in November 2015 and was completed in June, 2016. Twelve
holes, ranging in depth from 850 to over 1,200 metres were completed, and as expected with
such depth, several holes required multiple attempts to reach target depths.  Subsequent to the
quarter end, assays for these holes were received and released (see Press Release dated
August 15, 2016).
The drill results from twelve (12) step-out exploration holes confirm and extend the wide high-
grade mineralization from the Deep Zone discovery announced April 23, 2015. The holes
demonstrate continuity of high-grade, multi-stage precious and base metals mineralization now
beneath both the East and the West Vein Bonanza Zones.  Mineralization is traceable over a
strike length exceeding 800 metres and to a depth of 200 to 300 metres beneath the current
resource estimate (see Press Release dated May 27, 2014). Mineralization widths range from
approximately 5 metres to over 29 metres with the thickest intercepts occurring where the dip of
the veins steepen creating thickened "dilatant zones" that remain open to depth and laterally to
the joint venture boundaries: approximately 450 metres to the west and over 700 metres to the
east.

MAG SILVER CORP.
Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
East Vein
 
The best intercept in the discovery and extension of the Deep Zone in the East Valdecañas Vein
is in hole VM2, with 36.45 metres (29.85 metres true width) grading 235 g/t (6.87 ounces per ton
"opt") silver, 0.50 g/t gold, 4.76% lead, 5.79% zinc, 0.99% copper; including 8.80 m (true width of
7.21 metres) carrying 475 g/t (13.86 opt) silver; 0.66 g/t gold, 1.91% lead, 5.27% zinc and 2.38%
copper. Higher grade zones within the overall intercept include very high-grade lead (>40%) and
high-grade silver (1,290 g/t) associated with the highest copper values (6.79%) reported to date
on the property.
West Vein
P6 is the best new hole in the Deep Zone West cutting 29.90 metres (22.90 metres true width)
grading 119 g/t (3.47 opt) silver, 1.13 g/t gold, 4.18% lead, 11.89% zinc and 0.27% copper;
including 3.75 metres (2.87 metres true width) grading 292 g/t (8.52 opt) silver, 4.48 g/t gold,
13.24% lead, 24.92% zinc and 0.55% copper.  This hole is a 100 metre offset to Hole P3, the best
hole of the previous program.
The Drilling also resulted in the discovery of the "Anticipada Vein," a newly recognized vein of
unclear geometry lying about 100 metres into the hanging wall of the East Vein.  It has been cut
in five holes and swells from 1.15 metres (0.8 metres true width) in Hole VM2 to 10.40 metres
(6.68 metres true width) in Hole P13 where it grades 105 g/t (3.06 opt) silver, 2.69 g/t gold, 3.59%
lead, 10.79% zinc and 0.23% copper. It remains open in several directions.
Drilling results to date from the Deep Zone show the typical thickening and complementary
thinning of a classic "dilatant zone" stemming from steepening and flattening of the veins
(http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/Figures1-4MAG.pdf). This geometry creates a roughly
horizontally-elongated zone of greatly increased thickness that looks to have strong lateral
continuity (http://media3.marketwire.com/docs/Figures1-4MAG.pdf). On the West Vein the
fattened Deep Zone appears to be at least 250 metres high, 3 to 23 metres wide and 300 metres
long; remaining open 400 metres to the western property boundary.  On the East Vein the
fattened Deep Zone appears to be at least 300 metres high, 2.7 to 22 metres wide and 450
metres long; remaining completely open to depth and over 700 metres to the eastern property
boundary.
The Deep Zone displays strong base metal mineralization stages cut by later quartz veining
stages. In some holes, swarms of barren quartz veinlets extend for tens of metres around the
mineralized zones. There are significant orientation differences between the various vein stages
suggesting structural complexity not seen higher in the system. The interpretation of increased
structural complexity is reinforced by the geometry of the Anticipada Vein.  The narrowness of the
intercepts in Holes P7 and P9 appears to indicate downward flattening of the vein. Although less
well constrained, changes in vein strike may explain the widening of the vein to the east and
west of the overlap zone. Notably, the overlap zone also appears to coincide with the zone of
broadest skarn alteration, which exceeds 200 metres wide in Hole P12.  The highest copper
values appear to fall around the edges of the skarn zone. These geologic data continue to
support the concept that the overlap zone coincides with a major ore-fluid upwelling zone.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Qualified Person: Dr. Peter Megaw, Ph.D., C.P.G., has acted as the qualified person as defined
in National Instrument 43-101 for this disclosure and supervised the preparation of the technical
information in this release. Dr. Megaw has a Ph.D. in geology and more than 35 years of relevant
experience focussed on silver and gold exploration in Mexico. He is a Certified Professional
Geologist (CPG 10227) by the American Institute of Professional Geologists and an Arizona
Registered Geologist (ARG 21613). Dr. Megaw is not independent as he is Chief Exploration
Officer (CXO) and a Shareholder of MAG and is a vendor of projects, other than Juanicipio,
whereby he may receive royalties. Dr. Megaw is satisfied that the results are verified based on an
inspection of the core, a review of the sampling procedures, the credentials of the professionals
completing the work and the visual nature of the silver and base metal sulphides within a district
where he is familiar with the style and continuity of mineralization.
Quality Assurance and Control: The samples are shipped directly in security-sealed bags to
ALS-Chemex Laboratories preparation facility in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico (Certification ISO
9001). Samples shipped also include intermittent standards and blanks. Pulp samples are
subsequently shipped to ALS-Chemex Laboratories in North Vancouver, Canada for analysis.
Two extra pulp samples are also prepared and are analyzed (in progress) by SGS Laboratories
(Certification ISO 9001) and Inspectorate Laboratories (Certification ISO 9001) (or other
recognized lab). The bulk reject is subsequently sent to CIDT (Center for Investigation and
Technical Development) of Peñoles in Torreon, Mexico for metallurgical testing where a fourth
assay for each sample is analyzed and a calculated head grade is received on the basis of a
concentrate balance. The CIDT also does a full microscopic, XRF and XRD mineralogical
analysis.
In April, the Joint Venture Technical Committee approved a supplemental $1,200 budget (MAG's
44% share is $528) for additional 2016 deep and shallow in-fill drilling as well as protection and
exploration holes along and ahead of the path of the decline as it approaches the Valdecañas
Vein.  This supplemental drill program is for a combined 8,900 metres of surface and
underground drilling, and drilling is currently in process with six rigs turning on site.
 
Exploration – Cinco de Mayo
No active exploration is currently being undertaken on the Company's Cinco de Mayo Property,
as the Company continues its efforts to obtain a renewed surface agreement with the local Ejido.
"Soil Use Change Permit" and surface access
As of 2012, exploration drilling permits in Mexico require a "Soil Use Change Permit," reflecting
conversion of land from agricultural to industrial use.  In mid-2012, the Company was in the
process of negotiating ordinary course surface access permissions on a portion of the Cinco de
Mayo property with the Ejido Benito Juarez (the "EBJ") as the final component in the application
for the required Soil Use Change Permit. Both the Upper Manto and Pegaso Zone are located on
the portion of the Cinco de Mayo property where the EBJ controls the surface rights (but not the
mineral rights, which belong to the Company).  The Company had a long-standing and
productive working relationship with the EBJ and had previously purchased 41 specific rights
relating to relevant areas of the Cinco de Mayo project area for $660 from certain EJB members. 
This purchase was ratified by an official Assembly of the EBJ and registered and ratified by the
Federal Agrarian Authority. The Company was awaiting formal title transfer of the surface rights,
when certain members of the EBJ challenged the purchase, claiming the 41 rights purchased
represented a 41/421 undivided interest in the EBJ owned surface rights, rather than rights to
exclusive areas of the property. Then on November 17, 2012, at what the Company maintains
was an illegally constituted Assembly, the EBJ voted to order MAG to vacate the surface of its
Cinco de Mayo property (the mineral concession rights were and are not affected).
9
MAG SILVER CORP.
Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
As permission of the EBJ assembly is required to obtain surface access (and ultimately a Soil
Use Change Permit), MAG continues its efforts to obtain a renewed surface access agreement
with the EBJ, with the intent of arriving at a settlement agreement that would be fully supported at
a properly constituted Assembly.  Although there is no certainty that a new vote would produce a
favourable outcome for the Company, MAG believes that the opposition group and its supporters
do not represent the will of the majority of the 421 voting members of the EBJ (or of the 12,000
other citizens in the project area).
The Company remains willing to work with the EBJ and the greater community to define a
comprehensive Corporate Social Responsibility Program ("CSR") to coincide with the next
phases of exploration on the Upper Manto and Pegaso Zone.  MAG's objective is to ensure the
EBJ and the greater community benefit from the expected successes and growth at Cinco de
Mayo.
Although the Company believes that the process will be successful, the overall timeline to a
resolution is not determinable at this time. There are no contractual or statutory time limits on
obtaining surface access rights under the relevant permits required for continued exploration.
The Cinco de Mayo concession package extends beyond the Upper Manto and Pegaso Zones
into areas where the surface rights are not held by the EBJ; including areas of some prior drilling
success.  Although these areas remain of interest, the Company has no current plans to conduct
surface-based exploration in these areas.
 
5. OUTLOOK
The Company continues to explore its properties in Mexico and intends to enhance its project
portfolio through successful exploration and project development.  Although the Company's
working capital position remains strong, the Company continues to execute its business plan
prudently, with an on-going focus on high-grade, district scale potential properties.
Minera Juanicipio Outlook
The Juanicipio Technical Report provides a framework on which the Technical Committee
guides the continued advancement of the project.  Although Minera Juanicipio has not formally
made a "production decision," Fresnillo, the project operator, has publicly reported that it expects
that Juanicipio will be in production by 2018, and has recently indicated that plant construction
will commence in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Although the Company believes this timeline laid
out by the project operator is reasonable in the context of the Juanicipio Technical Report, the
actual schedule to production is still under review by Minera Juanicipio, and there are no
assurances when a formal development and construction decision will be made and that mine
development and production will be achieved in accordance with the Juanicipio Technical
Report.
The initial 2016 Minera Juanicipio development budget is $12,800 (MAG's 44% share is $5,632),
and continues to be designated primarily for continued ramp advancement and associated
underground infrastructure as outlined in the Juanicipio Technical Report, as well as ongoing
baseline environmental analysis, and some metallurgical and geotechnical studies.  It is
expected that Minera Juanicipio will make a decision to construct the surface facilities during the
year, and the 2016 development budget will likely be amended accordingly to reflect additional
capital expenditures.
10
MAG SILVER CORP.
Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
As noted below in Liquidity and Capital Resources, the Company believes that it has enough
cash to fully fund its 44% share of cash calls for the Juanicipio mine development as envisioned
in the Juanicipio Technical Report.
In addition to the $1,200 (MAG's 44% share is $528) 2016 supplemental 8,900 metre deep and
shallow infill drilling currently ongoing, there is also a 2016 Minera Juanicipio exploration budget
of approximately $3,200 (MAG's 44% share is $1,408), approved by the Minera Juanicipio
Technical Committee for testing deep targets on the Juanicipio Vein (as opposed to the
Valdecañas Vein discussed above), and for a continued search for new veins within the joint
venture property.  Currently, there are 6 drill rigs on the property, 5 drilling from surface, and 1
drilling from underground.
Cinco de Mayo Outlook
Although the Company believes that its surface access will be restored to the Cinco de Mayo
Property and that the requisite authorizations to complete its submission for the Soil Use Change
Permit will be obtained in due course, the overall timeline to successful resolution is not
determinable at this time, and will depend upon various factors including but not limited to: the
ability of the Company to arrive at an agreement that would be fully supported by the majority of
the EBJ; and, the ability of the EBJ to conduct a properly constituted Assembly meeting, with
quorum, and favourable outcome.   Although all work obligations to keep the claims in good
standing have been fulfilled by the Company, the Company sought and was granted a formal
federal exemption for 2015 exploration work commitments on the property. The Company has
applied for a similar exemption for 2016 work commitments.

Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Total Juanicipio Property expenditures incurred directly by Minera Juanicipio for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to approximately $3,450 and $6,661, respectively (June
30, 2015: $2,429 and $4,815 respectively).
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded a 44% equity loss from
its Investment in Associate of $600 and $643, respectively (June 30, 2015: $147 and $147,
respectively). The equity loss is due to the weakening of the Mexican Peso relative to the US$,
and the Company's related 44% share of a foreign exchange loss and deferred tax expense.  The
Company's 44% exchange loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to
$177 and $220 respectively (June 30, 2015: $147 and $147, respectively), and the deferred tax
expense amounts to $423 and $423 respectively (June 30, 2015 nil and nil, respectively).

Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Cinco de Mayo Property
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred exploration and
evaluation costs of $237 and $650 (June 30, 2015: $281 and $650) on the Cinco de Mayo
property.  In addition to land taxes and other government fees of $142 (June 30, 2015: $139), the
principal expenditures and main focus of work has been preparations for negotiations with the
local EBJ (see '"Soil Use Change Permit" and surface access' above) which has included
meetings with State and Federal authorities, and with several legal and Community Relations
advisors in Mexico.
Guigui Property
In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred exploration and
evaluation costs of $10 and $61 (June 30, 2015: $26 and $145 respectively) on the Guigui
property.  In addition to land taxes and other government fees of $46 (June 30, 2015: $56), the
Company is re-examining possible targets within district, in part prompted by active exploration
by another company immediately to the north of the central part of MAG's holdings.

Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 vs. Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
 
The Company's net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased slightly to $2,227
(June 30, 2015: $2,136).
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, the foreign exchange gain decreased to $23 compared
to $156 in the same period last year. The foreign exchange gain resulted primarily from holding
cash denominated in Canadian dollars ("C$"), while the US$ weakened marginally against the
C$ (from March 31, 2016 to June 30, 2016, the US$/C$ exchange rate changed from 0.7700 to
0.7742 compared to 0.7895 to 0.8006 from March 31, 2015 to June 30, 2015) resulting in an
exchange gain.
Share based payment expense incurred in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $1,193
(June 30, 2015: $1,114) and was comparable with the prior period's expense. The fair value of all
stock option share-based payment expense is estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton option
valuation model, while the fair value of restricted share units ("RSUs"), performance share units
("PSUs") and deferred share units ("DSUs") is based on the fair market value of a common share
equivalent on the date of grant.
The Company granted no stock options in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015:
203,750) and recorded $249 (June 30, 2015: $495) of share based payment expense (a non-
cash item) relating to stock options vesting to employees and consultants in the period. The
Company also granted no RSUs and PSUs in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015:
19,960 and nil respectively), and recorded a share based payment expense of $91 (June 30,
2015: $93) relating to RSUs and PSUs vesting to employees and consultants in the period.
14
MAG SILVER CORP.
Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
The Company granted 63,287 DSUs in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015: 67,365)
and granted an additional 2,151 DSUs to two directors who elected to receive their retainer and
meeting fees for the period in DSUs rather than cash (June 30, 2015: 7,332).  Included in the
current quarter's expense was $853 share based payment expense from these grants which all
vest immediately (June 30, 2015: $525).  Under the plan, the DSUs cannot be settled prior to the
eligible participant's termination date.
Other expenses incurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 included accounting and audit
of $80 (June 30, 2015: $68), amortization of $4 (June 30, 2015: $4), filing & transfer agent fees of
$7 (June 30, 2015: $8), general office expenses of $266 (June 30, 2015: $243), legal of $38
(June 30, 2015: $71), new property investigation costs of $43 (June 30, 2015: $37), management
compensation and consulting fees of $437 (June 30, 2015: $400), shareholder relations
expenses of $120 (June 30, 2015: $149) and travel of $59 (June 30, 2015: $119), and were all
either comparable with the prior period's expense or the change was not significant to the overall
operations during the period.
In other income and expenses, the Company earned interest income on its cash and term
deposits of $303 during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015: $68), and realized a
gain of $1,152 (June 30, 2015: nil) on the sale of marketable securities previously held for
strategic reasons.  The Company also recorded its 44% equity loss from Minera Juanicipio as
described above in Investment in Associate.
The Company recorded a deferred tax expense of $858 for the quarter ended June 30, 2016
(June 30, 2015: nil) related to temporary differences between the book and tax base of its
Mexican non-monetary assets. The tax base of these non-monetary assets is determined in
Mexican Pesos as opposed to the functional currency (US$), and changes in the exchange rate
can give rise to temporary differences that result in a deferred tax liability and associated
expense.  With the weakening of the Mexican Peso against the US$ from 17.25 Pesos/US$ on
March 31, 2016 to 18.55 Pesos/US$ on June 30, 2016, a deferred tax expense was recognized
in the quarter.
Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 vs. Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
The Company's net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $3,524 (June 30,
2015: $4,672).
A foreign exchange gain of $292 was recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to a $938 foreign exchange loss in the same period last year. The foreign exchange gain resulted
primarily from holding cash denominated in Canadian dollars ("C$"), while the US$ weakened
against the C$ (from December 31, 2015 to June 30, 2016, the US$/C$ exchange rate changed
from 0.7225 to 0.7742).  A portion of the Company's cash is used to fund Canadian dollar
expenditures and is held in C$ (US$ equivalent of $7,580 as at June 30, 2016).  The C$ cash is
exposed to exchange risk relative to the US$, and results in a gain or loss as the exchange rate
fluctuates.

$396 (June 30, 2015: $156) relating to RSUs and PSUs vesting to employees and consultants in
the period.  In the six months ended June 30, 2016, $899 of share based payment expense (June
30, 2015: $573) was also recorded on 63,287 DSUs (June 30, 2015: 67,365) granted under the
Company's DSU plan and an additional 5,405 DSUs (June 30, 2015: 15,280) granted to two
directors who elected to receive their retainer and meeting fees for the period in DSUs rather than
in cash.
Other expenses incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016 included accounting and

Associate.
The Company also recorded a deferred tax expense of $795 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 (June 30, 2015: nil), primarily related to the weakening of the Mexican Peso against the
US$ in the second quarter as described above in the "Three months ended June 30, 2016." This
non-cash charge will only be realized once the Company's exploration properties are developed
and in production or on disposal of the mineral properties.

Net losses by quarter are often materially affected by the timing and recognition of large non-
cash expenses (specifically share based payments, exploration and evaluation property write-
offs, and deferred tax expense) as described in "Review of Financial Results" above.

Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Operating Activities
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company used $741 and $1,756 in
cash for operations respectively, compared to $1,021 and $2,067 respectively, in the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015.  The Company's non-cash working capital in the corresponding
three and six month periods, increased by $537 and $684 respectively (June 30, 2015: increased
by $88 and decreased by $12, respectively).
Investing Activities
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company invested cash of $111,034
and $114,742 respectively, compared to $1,589 and $4,326 respectively in the comparable prior
periods ended June 30, 2015.  The primary investment of cash in the current periods was the
purchase of 6-month and 1year term deposits totaling $110,000 (June 30, 2015: nil). The
Company also used cash to fund advances to Minera Juanicipio, which combined with MAG's
Juanicipio expenditures on its own account, totaled $2,119 and $5,153 respectively, in the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015: $990 and $3,181 respectively).  The
Company makes cash advances to Minera Juanicipio as 'cash called' by operator Fresnillo,
based on approved joint venture budgets.  In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the
Company also expended $277 and $940 respectively, (June 30, 2015: $355 and $792
respectively) on its other exploration and evaluation properties.
Financing Activities
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company's net cash from financing
activities amounted to $1,124 and $72,318 respectively, compared to $359 and $1,800
respectively, in the comparable prior periods ended June 30, 2015.
As discussed in "Financing Activities" above, on March 1, 2016, the Company closed a bought
deal public offering and issued 8,905,000 common shares at $7.30 per share, for gross proceeds
of $65,006.  On March 4, 2016, the underwriters exercised in full an associated 15% over-
allotment option, and the Company issued an additional 1,335,750 common shares for additional
gross proceeds of $9,751.  Total gross proceeds were $74,757, and combined net proceeds
amounted to $70,654.
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, 176,750 stock options, were exercised for cash
proceeds of $1,169 (June 30, 2015: 75,800 stock options were exercised for cash proceeds of
$359).  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, an additional 668,334 stock options were
exercised under a less dilutive cashless exercise provision of the plan (June 30, 2015: nil),
whereby 235,395 shares were issued in settlement of the stock options (June 30, 2015: nil), and
the remaining 432,939 options were cancelled (June 30, 2015:  nil).
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, 247,750 stock options, were exercised for cash proceeds
of $1,664 (June 30, 2015: 314,900 stock options were exercised for cash proceeds of $1,800). 
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, an additional 1,103,334 stock options were
exercised under a less dilutive cashless exercise provision of the plan (June 30, 2015: 220,500),
whereby 312,924 shares were issued in settlement of the stock options (June 30, 2015: 73,440),
and the remaining 790,410 options were cancelled (June 30, 2015: 147,060).

 $ 230,967
Total current assets increased from $82,067 at June 30, 2015 to $141,630 June 30, 2016.  The
increase is primarily due to the funds raised from the bought deal financing which closed in the
first quarter (as referred to above in "Financing Activities").  Other current assets as at June 30,
2016 included marketable securities of $22 (June 30, 2015: $256), prepaid expenses of $363
(June 30, 2015: $420) and accounts receivable of $387 (June 30, 2015: $360).  The accounts
receivable is comprised primarily of Mexican value added taxes ("IVA") repayable to the
Company by the Government of Mexico, for which the Company expects a full recovery.
The increase from June 30, 2015 to June 30, 2016 in Investment in Associate from $30,645 to
$35,772, and in Exploration and Evaluation assets from $51,275 to $53,517, reflects the
Company's ongoing investment in the properties as discussed in "Investing Activities" above.
The decrease from $3,864 to Nil of the Option to acquire Mineral Interest reflects the write off of
the Salamandra option as at December 31, 2015.
Current liabilities at June 30, 2016 amounted to $339 (June 30, 2015: $387) and are attributable
to accrued exploration and administrative expenses. The deferred income tax liability increased
from $3,682 to $5,960 at June 30, 2016.  The increase is due to the weakening of the Mexican
Peso in the period and the deferred income tax liability recognized by the Company
corresponding to the deferred tax expense recognized and explained above in the three and six
months "Review of Financial Results."
The variation in total equity is due primarily to the aforementioned public offering completed
during the period ended June 30, 2016.

12. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As at June 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $141,291 (June 30, 2015: $81,681)
including cash and term deposits of $140,858 (June 30, 2015: $81,031).  The Company currently
has no debt and has sufficient working capital to maintain all of its properties and currently
planned programs for a period in excess of the next year.  Although the Company believes it is
fully funded for its share of the Juanicipio development as envisioned under the Juanicipio
Technical Report (see Funding of the Juanicipio Development below), the Company may require
additional capital in the future to meet its project related expenditures.
Funding of the Juanicipio Development
The Juanicipio Technical Report estimated total project capital costs of $302,000 inclusive of
capitalized operating costs (MAG's 44% share is $132,880) over 3.5 years from the start of
development.  As the first 33 months of development, as envisioned under the Juanicipio
Technical Report, are primarily focused on the ramp decline, the majority of the capital costs are
not expected to be incurred until the latter part of the development schedule. The larger capital
expenditures items associated with the mine development have not yet been approved by Minera
Juanicipio, and Minera Juanicipio has not yet proposed a budget for beyond 2016.
To June 30, 2016, approximately $29,055 of the Juanicipio development has been funded by the
joint venture partners (MAG's share funded to June 30, 2016 is approximately $12,784), leaving
approximately $272,945 (MAG's 44% share is approximately $120,096) of remaining mine
development expenditures to complete the Juanicipio mine according to the Juanicipio Technical
Report. Given this progress to date, and the Company's cash and term deposits on hand
($140,858 as at June 30, 2016), the Company believes that it has enough cash to fully fund its
44% share of cash calls for the Juanicipio mine development as envisioned in the Juanicipio
Technical Report.  However, should the scale and scope of the development change, or should
the capital required to complete the development exceed the amount envisioned in the
Juanicipio Technical Report, the Company's cash resources may not be sufficient to fund its 44%
share of the project development. Accordingly, the Company may need to raise significant
additional capital in the future under such circumstances, and future liquidity may therefore
depend upon the Company's ability to arrange debt or additional equity financings. The inability
of the Company to fund its 44% share of cash calls would result in dilution of the Company's
ownership interest in Minera Juanicipio, in accordance with the shareholders agreement.
The Preliminary Economic Assessment set out in the Juanicipio Technical Report is preliminary
in nature and includes Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative
geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be
categorized as Mineral Reserves and there is no certainty that the Preliminary Economic
Assessment set out in the Juanicipio Technical Report will be realized.  As a result, there are
additional risks in commencing and completing construction based upon the Juanicipio
Technical Report including additional risks as to capital and operating costs, mineral recovery
and financial viability. There is also no guarantee that the construction will be completed or, if
completed, that production will begin or that financial results will be consistent with the Juanicipio
Technical Report.

Other contractual obligations include: a 2.5% NSR royalty on the Cinco de Mayo property under
the terms of an agreement dated February 26, 2004, whereby the Company acquired a 100%
interest in the property; and a 2.5% NSR royalty on the Guigui mining concessions.
 
The Company may provide guarantees and indemnifications in conjunction with transactions in
the normal course of operations. These are recorded as liabilities when reasonable estimates of
the obligations can be made.  Indemnifications that the Company has provided include an
obligation to indemnify directors and officers of the Company for potential liability while acting as
a director or officer of the Company, together with various expenses associated with defending
and settling such suits or actions due to association with the Company.  The Company has a
comprehensive directors and officers liability insurance policy that could mitigate such costs if
incurred.
14. SHARE CAPITAL INFORMATION

this situation will include a comprehensive CSR program to coincide with the next phases of the
Company's exploration activity.
The Company is unaware of any condition of default under any debt, regulatory, exchange
related or other contractual obligation.
 
16. TREND INFORMATION
As both the price and market for silver are volatile and difficult to predict, a significant decrease in
the silver price could have an adverse material impact on the Company's operations and market
value.
22
MAG SILVER CORP.
Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
The nature of the Company's business is demanding of capital for property acquisition costs,
exploration commitments and holding costs. The Company's liquidity is affected by the results of
its own acquisition, exploration and development activities. The acquisition or discovery of an
economic mineral deposit on one of its mineral properties may have a favourable effect on the
Company's liquidity, and conversely, the failure to acquire or find one may have a negative effect.
In addition, access to capital to fund exploration and development companies remains difficult in
current public markets, which could limit the Company's ability to meet its objectives.
 
Surface rights in Mexico are often owned by local communities or "Ejidos" and there has been a
recent trend in Mexico of increasing Ejido challenges to existing surface right usage agreements.
The Company has already been impacted by this recent trend (see "Exploration - Cinco de
Mayo" above).  Any further challenge to the access to any of the properties in which the
Company has an interest may have a negative impact on the Company, as the Company may
incur delays and expenses in defending such challenge and, if the challenge is successful, the
Company's interest in a property could be materially adversely affected.  Also see "Risks and
Uncertainties" below.
Apart from these and the risks referenced below in "Risks and Uncertainties," management is not
aware of any other trends, commitments, events or uncertainties that would have a material effect
on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
17. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The Company's securities should be considered a highly speculative investment and investors
are directed to carefully consider all of the information disclosed in the Company's Canadian and
U.S. regulatory filings prior to making an investment in the Company, including the risk factors
discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Company's most recent Annual Information
Form ("AIF") dated March 28, 2016 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov.
The volatile global economic environment has created market uncertainty and volatility in recent
years. The Company remains financially strong and will monitor the risks and opportunities of the
current environment carefully.  These macro-economic events have in the past, and may again,
negatively affect the mining and minerals sectors in general.  The Company will consider its
business plans and options carefully going forward.
In the normal course of business, the Company enters into transactions for the purchase of
supplies and services denominated in Canadian dollars or Mexican Pesos. The Company also
has cash and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in Canadian dollars and
Mexican Pesos. As a result, the Company is subject to foreign exchange risk from fluctuations in
foreign exchange rates (see Note 11(c) in the unaudited condensed interim consolidated
financial statements of the Company as at June 30, 2016).
 
18. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS
The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Company does not have offices or direct personnel in Mexico, but rather is party to a Field
Services Agreement, whereby it has contracted administrative and exploration services in
Mexico with MINERA CASCABEL S.A. de C.V. ("Cascabel") and IMDEX Inc. ("IMDEX").  Dr.
Peter Megaw, the Company's Chief Exploration Officer, is a principal of both IMDEX and
Cascabel, and is remunerated by the Company through fees to IMDEX.  In addition to corporate
executive responsibilities with MAG, Dr. Megaw is responsible for the planning, execution and
assessment of the Company's exploration programs, and he and his team developed the
geologic concepts and directed the acquisition of all the Company's projects, including the
Juanicipio Project and the Cinco de Mayo Property.
 
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company incurred expenses with
Cascabel and IMDEX of $280 and $565 respectively (June 30, 2015: $333 and $692
respectively), including fees to IMDEX related to services provided by Dr. Megaw of $64 and
$134 respectively (June 30, 2015: $82 and 157 respectively).  All transactions are incurred in the
normal course of business, and are negotiated on terms between the parties which represent fair
market value for all services rendered.  A significant portion of the expenditures are incurred on
the Company's behalf, and are charged to the Company on a "cost + 10%" basis typical of
industry standards. The services provided do not include drilling and assay work which are
contracted out independently from Cascabel & IMDEX.
Included in trade and other payables at June 30, 2016 is $165 related to these services (June 30,
2015: $201).
The Company is obligated to a 2.5% NSR royalty on the Cinco de Mayo property payable to the
principals of Cascabel under the terms of an option agreement dated February 26, 2004,
whereby the Company acquired a 100% interest in the property from Cascabel, and under the
terms of assignment agreements entered into by Cascabel with its principals.  The Company is
also obligated to a 2.5% NSR royalty to Cascabel on the Guigui mining concessions.
Upon the retirement of Dan MacInnis, former President & Chief Executive Officer, on October 15,
2013, the Company had entered into a consulting contract with a private company controlled by
Mr. MacInnis who remains a director of the Company.  As the contract was not renewed in 2016,
no consulting fees were paid in the period ended June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015: C$10) and there
are no payables related to such services as at June 30, 2016 (June 30, 2015: nil).
Any amounts due to related parties arising from the above transactions are unsecured, non-
interest bearing and are due upon receipt of invoices.
The immediate parent and ultimate controlling party of the consolidated group is MAG Silver
Corp. (incorporated in British Columbia, Canada).
The details of the Company's significant subsidiaries and ownership interests are as follows:

20. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting
Standards ("IFRS") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB"), requires
Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
$ 531
    932
  $ 1,463
reported amounts of revenues and expenditures during the reporting period.  Management has
identified (i) mineral property acquisition and exploration deferred costs, (ii) provision for
reclamation and closure, (iii) deferred income tax provision and (iv) share based payments, as
the main estimates for the following discussion.  Please refer to Note 2 of the Company's
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements as at June 30, 2016 for a
description of all of the significant accounting policies.
Under IFRS, the Company defers all costs relating to the acquisition and exploration of its
mineral properties ("exploration and evaluation" assets). Any revenues received from such
properties are credited against the costs of the property. When commercial production
commences on any of the Company's properties, any previously capitalized costs would be
charged to operations using a unit-of-production method. The Company reviews when events or
changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of its properties to assess their
recoverability and when the carrying value of a property exceeds the estimated net recoverable
amount, provision is made for impairment in value.  IFRS also allows the reversal of impairments
if conditions that gave rise to those impairments no longer exist.
The existence of uncertainties during the exploration stage and the lack of definitive empirical
evidence with respect to the feasibility of successful commercial development of any exploration
property do create measurement uncertainty concerning the estimate of the amount of impairment
to the value of any mineral property. The Company relies on its own or independent estimates of
further geological prospects of a particular property and also considers the likely proceeds from a
sale or assignment of the rights before determining whether or not impairment in value has
occurred.

Management's Discussion & Analysis
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016
(expressed in thousands of US dollars except as otherwise noted)
Reclamation and closure costs have been estimated based on the Company's interpretation of
current regulatory requirements, however changes in regulatory requirements and new
information may result in revisions to estimates. The Company recognizes the fair value of
liabilities for reclamation and closure costs in the period in which they are incurred. A
corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related assets is generally recorded and
depreciated over the life of the asset.
The deferred income tax provision is based on the liability method. Deferred taxes arise from the
recognition of the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted or
substantively enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of certain assets and liabilities. The Company
records only those deferred tax assets that it believes will be probable, that sufficient future
taxable profit will be available to recover those assets.
Under IFRS 2 - Share-based Payments, stock options are accounted for by the fair value method
of accounting.  Under this method, the Company is required to recognize a charge to the
statement of loss based on an option-pricing model based on certain assumptions including
dividends to be paid, historical volatility of the Company's share price, an annual risk free interest
rate, forfeiture rates, and expected lives of the options.
 
21. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
The Company has reviewed new accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not
yet effective at June 30, 2016. These include:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments.  In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9 which
replaced IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. The new standard
replaces the current classification and measurement criteria for financial assets and liabilities
with only two classification categories: amortized cost and fair value.  The standard is effective for
annual periods beginning on or after of January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The
Company has not early adopted this standard and is currently evaluating the impact this standard
may have on its consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The final standard on revenue from contracts
with customers was issued on May 8, 2014. In July 2015, the IASB determined that the revised
effective date for IFRS 15 would be for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1,
2018, with earlier application permitted.  Entities have the full option of using either a full
retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt the guidance. The Company's only
source of revenue in the current and prior periods is interest income from high interest savings
accounts and term deposits, but the Company is currently evaluating the impact this standard
may have on its consolidated financial statements once revenue from contracts with customers is
generated.
IFRS 16 Leases. In January 2016, the IASB published a new accounting standard, IFRS 16 –
Leases (IFRS 16) which replaces IAS 17 – Leases and its associated interpretative guidance.
IFRS 16 applies a control model to the identification of leases, distinguishing between a lease
and a service contract on the basis of whether the customer controls the asset being leased. For
those assets determined to meet the definition of a lease, IFRS 16 introduces significant changes
to the accounting by lessees, introducing a single, on-balance sheet accounting model that is
similar to current finance lease accounting, with limited exceptions for short-term leases or leases
of low value assets. Lessor accounting remains similar to current accounting practice. The
standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with early
application permitted for entities that apply IFRS 15. The Company has not early adopted this
standard, and is currently evaluating the impact it is expected to have on its consolidated
financial statements.

22. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it is required to
file or submit under applicable securities laws is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
in the manner specified by such laws. The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer
have evaluated, or caused to be evaluated under their supervision, the design and effectiveness
of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016 through inquiry and
review, as well as by drawing upon their own relevant experience.  The Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures are effective as at June 30, 2016.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
The Company also maintains a system of internal controls over financial reporting, as defined by
National Instrument 52-109 - Certification of Disclosure in Issuers' Annual and Interim Filings in
order to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and financial information is
accurate and reliable and in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards.  The
Company retains a third party specialist annually to assist in the assessment of its internal control
procedures.  The Board of Directors approves the financial statements and MD&A before they
are publicly filed, and ensures that management discharges its financial responsibilities. The
unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements and MD&A for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016 were approved by the Board on August 15, 2016.  The Board's
review is accomplished principally through the Audit Committee, which is composed of
independent non-executive directors. The Audit Committee meets periodically with management
and auditors to review financial reporting and control matters. The Board of Directors has also
appointed a compensation committee composed of non-executive directors whose
recommendations are followed with regard to executive compensation. From time to time the
board may also form special sub-committees, which must investigate and report to the Board on
specific topics.
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated, or caused to be
evaluated under their supervision, the design and effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of June 30, 2016 and have concluded that the Company's internal
control over financial reporting is effective.  There have been no changes in internal controls over
financial reporting during the period ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
