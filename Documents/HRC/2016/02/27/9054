<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> The present report describes some aspects of the human rights situation in Guatemala and 
the activities of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) during 2008 in the country. Under the mandate established by the agreement 
of 10 January 2005 between OHCHR and the Government of the Republic of Guatemala, which 
was extended for three years on 19 September 2008, the OHCHR office in Guatemala continued 
to monitor the human rights situation and to provide advisory and technical assistance services to 
national institutions, geared towards the implementation of the recommendations contained in its 
previous report (A/HRC/7/38/Add.1). 
</p>
<p> The national context in which the office in Guatemala carried out its work was 
characterized by persistent and increasing violence and public insecurity. The office observed 
with particular concern the difficult situation hindering full enjoyment of the right to life, which 
requires that the State strengthen the prevention, investigation and punishment of violations of 
this right. The office followed closely the security situation and its impact on human rights, the 
challenges in the fight against impunity, strengthening the rule of law, combating discrimination 
and the situation of human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p> The office collected extensive information on the human rights situation in the country, 
and provided technical cooperation and advisory services to State institutions and organizations 
of the civil society. 
</p>
<p> The Office provided technical advice to various national institutions such as the Congress, 
the Presidential Human Rights Commission (COPREDEH), the Ministry of the Interior, the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the Presidential Commission on Discrimination and Racism 
(CODISRA), the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women (DEMI), the National 
Reparations Programme (PNR) and the Office of the Human Rights Procurator (PDH). It also 
assisted civil society with its interaction with treaty-monitoring bodies and special procedures, 
and with follow-up to the implementation of their recommendations. 
</p>
<p> This report addresses human rights issues of particular concern, such as violations of the 
right to life and security, violence against women, attacks against human rights defenders, the 
rule of law and impunity, combating racism and discrimination, transitional justice, and 
economic social and cultural rights. The report also provides an overview of the activities of the 
office in 2008 and of the follow-up to the recommendations formulated in previous reports of the 
High Commissioner on the situation of human rights in Guatemala.  
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner urges Guatemala to fully implement the recommendations put 
forward in 2007, and presents 15 recommendations relating to the legislative framework for the 
protection of human rights, the right to life and security, the rule of law and impunity, indigenous 
peoples, women&#8217;s rights, economic, social and cultural rights, as well as to technical cooperation 
and advisory services provided by the OHCHR office in Guatemala. </p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 10 January 2005, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) signed an Agreement with the Government of the Republic of Guatemala on 
the establishment of an OHCHR office in Guatemala. The agreement was approved by Congress 
on 31 May 2005, ratified by the President on 23 June 2005, and officially communicated in 
writing to the High Commissioner on 16 September 2005. The OHCHR office in Guatemala 
(OHCHR Guatemala) officially started its work on 20 September 2005. On 19 September 2008, 
its mandate was extended for a period of three years. 
</p>
<p>2. Under the agreement, and in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/141 
of 20 December 1993, the mandate of the OHCHR office in Guatemala is to monitor the 
situation of human rights in order to advise State institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>3. This report aims to provide an overview of the human rights situation in Guatemala, as 
well as of the work carried out by the OHCHR office in Guatemala in accordance with its 
mandate. It contains comments on the current human rights situation and information on the 
advisory services and technical cooperation provided to assist implementation of the 
recommendations contained in the High Commissioner&#8217;s reports for 2005, 2006 and 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  CONTEXT 
</b></p>
<p>4. Guatemala rates low on the human development scale, and has a highly unequal 
distribution of income, as indicated by the National Human Development Report 2007/2008.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>5. The indices of violence and personal insecurity continued to increase during the year. 
Drug-related violence worsened as well, and there is considerable evidence that some of the 
drug-trafficking cartels from the North of Mexico are moving operations to Guatemala. Booming 
drug-related crime presents a growing threat to Guatemalan political stability and governability. 
Within this context the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) 
formally initiated its work in January 2008. 
</p>
<p>6. On 14 January 2008, Alvaro Colom took up his functions as President of Guatemala. The 
President stated that citizens&#8217; personal and social security, guaranteed by a democratic rule of 
law, are priorities for his four-year mandate. 
</p>
<p>7. One of the first initiatives to be launched by the new Government was the Council for 
Social Cohesion, whose goal is to articulate government measures in reducing extreme poverty. 
This council has focused its initial attention on the country&#8217;s poorest municipalities via 
mechanisms such as conditional cash transfers to poor families. 
</p>
<p>8. In May 2008, Guatemala was amongst the first countries to be reviewed under the new 
mechanism of the Human Rights Council, the universal periodic review. Several 
recommendations were made in the final report of the UPR Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review which the Government of Guatemala has committed itself to implement.

</p>
<p>9. The Deputy High Commissioner, Kyung-wha Kang, visited Guatemala in September 2008, 
to renew the mandate of the OHCHR office in Guatemala. Official visits were made by the 
Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Jorge Bustamante, and the Special 
Rapporteur on the right to education, Vernor Mu&#241;oz. The Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders, Hina Jilani, carried out a follow-up 
visit. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION 
</b></p>
<p><b>A. Right to life and security 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Right to life 
</b></p>
<p>10. The National Civilian Police reports that during 2008 there were 6,244 violent deaths,<b> 
</b>compared with 5,781 recorded in 2007; 83 per cent of these deaths were caused by firearms. In 
2008, 591 violent deaths of children and adolescents were registered, compared with 274 deaths 
in 2007.<b>2</b> Guatemala has a rate of 48 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest 
among countries formally at peace.  
</p>
<p>11. Extrajudicial executions continued, with the direct and indirect participation of State 
agents, such as that of Mario Caal in Livingston, Izabal, caused by an excessive use of police 
force,<b>3</b> and the case of the family members of the Mayor of Ocos, San Marcos, in which three 
investigators of the Criminal Investigation Division (DINC) of the National Civilian Police 
(NCP) have been charged. A number of these crimes can be attributed to organized crime 
structures infiltrated into security institutions, despite efforts by the new authorities to disband 
them.  
</p>
<p>12. The number of murders in custody increased in 2008.<b>4</b> In many cases, youth gangs in 
custody were involved in the killings, at times extremely violent ones, while in some cases 
prison guards were also involved. The lack of immediate, exhaustive and impartial investigations 
has encouraged a recurrence of such acts. The State has a duty to protect detained persons with 
greater diligence and should strive to uphold its duty to prevent such arbitrary deprivation of life. 
</p>
<p>13. The discovery of bodies with signs of torture and marks of execution, together with the 
established profiles of the victims and the conditions and circumstances of the crimes, confirmed 
the persistence of the phenomenon known as &#8220;social cleansing&#8221;. There are indications that armed 
groups, such as those said to be operating in Palin, Escuintla, San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez and in the 
Terminal Market in Zone 4 in Guatemala City, are responsible for this practice and crimes. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  There were 17 violent deaths in 2008 compared to 15 in 2007. <i>Source</i>: General Directorate of 
</p>

</p>
<p>14. In 2008, mob lynchings took place in 13 departments of the country<b>5</b> and resulted in the 
deaths of 22 people. Minors were also among the victims of these acts of collective violence. It 
has to be noted that the National Civilian Police intervened in a number of such cases, possibly 
preventing some killings. However, none of those responsible were captured.  
</p>
<p>15. The failure to investigate these incidents and the lack of reliable statistics make it difficult 
to asses their true scale. The office draws attention to the fact that these acts of &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; 
and lynchings often encounter acceptance or indifference among various segments of society, 
including the authorities themselves. The rate of impunity and the consequent feelings of 
frustration among the population can be no excuse for condoning or abetting this behaviour, 
which are wholly contrary to basic human rights principles. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Security 
</b></p>
<p>16. During 2008 several incidents proved the existence of clandestine security apparatuses that 
have inserted themselves within the State institutions. Homicides such as those of the former 
anti-kidnapping chief of the Ministry of the Interior, Victor Rivera, and of 260 bus drivers,<b>6</b> 
extortions and kidnappings, and various massacres demonstrated that these groups continued to 
operate in almost total impunity.  
</p>
<p>17. The Government was compelled to make various changes as a result of the deaths of the 
Minister of the Interior, Vinicio G&#243;mez, and the Vice Minister for Security in a helicopter crash 
in June 2008. The newly-appointed Interior Minister, Francisco Jimenez, continued with the 
reorganization and internal clean-up of NCP as well as with the process of strengthening the 
General Directorate for Civilian Intelligence (DIGICI). The appointment of a new Director of the 
NCP, Marlene Blanco, supported this process, as she proceeded with the immediate dismissal of 
17 police officers who had under their charge all General Sub-Divisions. The new officials 
inherited an institution which has historically faced significant challenges and is infiltrated by 
organized crime, while having a generally unfavourable public image. These new changes may 
represent encouraging steps towards rebuilding and strengthening this institution. 
</p>
<p>18. By the end of 2008 the NCP had 19,454 staff members - one police agent for 
every 704 inhabitants, the lowest rate in Central America. The institution continued to face 
serious difficulties incorporating new members and officials. At year&#8217;s end the NCP had 
3,850 vacancies left to fill. Police numbers were manifestly insufficient to face the severe 
security situation, with less than half of the 45,000 members the authorities officially recognize 
as being needed. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>5
</b>  There were 56 lynchings in 13 departments of the country, according to the Judiciary National

</p>
<p>19. The lack of police agents and a vacancy of almost half of all higher ranks, severely 
affected the organization and its deployment. The professionalization of the police career, its 
operational aspects and improving the conditions of police stations continue to be important 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>20. The organizational restructuring, amending the Governmental Agreement 662-2005, which 
would both elevate the status of the Inspector General and create an institutional planning body, 
remained pending.  
</p>
<p>21. Criminal police investigations continued to have limited institutional support, and 
demonstrate insufficient results. In addition to reduced personnel and few assigned resources, the 
Criminal Investigation Division maintained an inadequate organizational structure and scarce 
territorial deployment. Lack of operational intelligence and criminal analysis, limited training, 
absence of manuals, procedural protocols and management indicators, coexisted with the 
historical problem of coordination with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office. Unfavourable living and 
working conditions in DINC have been cited as causes of corruption and illegal actions of the 
investigators. 
</p>
<p>22. DIGICI approved rules establishing its administrative and operative structure, increasing 
civil and police personnel, and carrying out a professional-development plan directed by experts 
provided by the international cooperation. This institution-building process has shown 
encouraging results for civil intelligence. However, the institution faces challenges in terms of 
strategic intelligence, deployment and technological resources for special intelligence operations. 
</p>
<p>23. At the same time, the General Directorate of the Prisons System (DGSP) continued to face 
numerous challenges mainly often due to the tensions among juvenile gangs, at times violent, as 
well as internal corruption and criminal acts perpetrated within prison centres. Despite efforts to 
recruit and train a greater number of officials, prison personnel remained insufficient, working 
conditions were precarious and salaries low. Prisons suffered from high levels of overcrowding, 
critical substandard detention and sanitary conditions, as well as difficulties in relation to 
accessing adequate medical care, particularly for women.  
</p>
<p>24. Regulations for the Prisons Act (2006) have yet to be passed, making its implementation 
difficult in the 19 prison centres in the country. Additionally, the 27 detention centres managed 
by PNC remain outside the control of the prisons system and the purview of this law.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Violence against women 
</b></p>
<p>25. Violent deaths of women continued to increase in 2008, totalling 722 compared 
to 590 deaths in 2007, reports the National Civilian Police. 
</p>
<p>26. The Congress approved on 9 April 2008 a new &#8220;Law against Femicide and Other Forms of 
Violence against Women&#8221; (decree 22-2008), which criminalizes gender-based physical, 
psychological, sexual and economic violence in the private and public spheres. This law filled 
various legal gaps and established a set of measures to prevent and punish these forms of 
violence against women&#8217;s rights to life and integrity. In order to provide the victims with 
adequate protection, the authorities must produce without delay the uniform, clear and 
coordinated institutional guidelines for the full implementation of the law.  </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>27. Since the entry into force of the law, complaints and requests for protection measures 
increased significantly. While some measures to address these complaints were strengthened, the 
training of justice officials on the special characteristics of investigating and punishing violence 
against women was carried out primarily in the capital, reaching only 10 per cent of personnel. 
As a result, the specialized justice system was only partially implemented and has failed to 
achieve an articulated and effective response so far. 
</p>
<p>28. In 2008, 37,358 complaints were filed as domestic violence.<b>7</b> Under the new law, 18 cases 
were filed for &#8220;femicide&#8221; and 1,853 for violence against women. The real extent of violence 
against women continues to be unknown as the figures registered by the relevant institutions 
differ and not all crimes are being reported. 
</p>
<p>29. The High Commissioner welcomes the new Law against Femicide and Other Forms of 
Violence against Women. She encourages the State to pursue its efforts to enhance the protection 
of women against violence through immediate, exhaustive and impartial investigations, trial of 
perpetrators and reparation of victims. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Situation of human rights defenders 
</b></p>
<p>30. Human rights defenders carried out their work in an environment marked by threats and 
attacks. The civil society-run Protection Unit for Human Rights Defenders registered 221 attacks 
against defenders in 2008, primarily against union leaders, environmentalists and community 
organizations. The near-fatal attack suffered by Yuri Melini, Director of the Guatemalan Centre 
for Legal, Environmental and Social Action (CALAS) in September 2008 is one recent example. 
</p>
<p>31. The investigation of complaints on attacks against human rights defenders continued to be 
ineffective. Of the 58 complaints filed with the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, the alleged 
perpetrators were identified in only three cases. 
</p>
<p>32. There were 68 violations reported of journalists being targeted,<b>8</b> doubling the figure 
registered in 2007. These include four killings, various death threats, attacks, cases of 
discrimination, limitations on free access to information and other violations to freedom of 
expression. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Crimes against Journalists Unit received 36 complaints but 
filed charges in only one case. 
</p>
<p>33. There were some positive steps, such as the drafting by the Presidential Human Rights 
Commission of a Government Agreement on a Programme of Prevention and Protection 
Measures for Human Rights Defenders and Other Vulnerable Groups. Further consensus with 
members of the civil society on this document should be reached. 
</p>

</p>
<p>34. Another encouraging development has been the creation of a &#8220;forum for the analysis of 
attacks against human rights defenders&#8221;, which aims at analysing patterns of attacks against 
defenders. This opened a worthwhile space for analysis and collaboration between government 
institutions and civil society and made some initial contributions to investigations. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Combating racism and racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>35. While the Government has reiterated its commitment to ensure the participation of 
indigenous peoples in political processes, the number and type of government positions held by 
indigenous peoples continued to be low, although a small increase among regional Governors 
was reported. Achieving greater indigenous participation and overcoming the weak 
representation of indigenous peoples at the State level remains a challenge. 
</p>
<p>36. Social conflicts related to the exploitation of natural resources in indigenous communities 
continued to be a source of concern. Lack of consulting with the affected communities and 
failure to provide them with adequate information fuelled discontent and protests which at times 
has resulted in violent incidents. For example, in several local communities of San Juan 
Sacatep&#233;quez, the construction of a cement factory caused social tensions and violent 
disturbances leading to the death of a community leader, Francisco Tepeu, in June 2008. A state 
of prevention<b>9</b> was declared as a result of this incident and 43 indigenous peoples were arrested. 
</p>
<p>37. The persistence of such conflicts reaffirms the need to reform the legal framework 
governing the exploitation of natural resources and to establish mechanisms for prior 
consultation with the affected communities regarding the impact of such exploitation in their 
communities. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Rule of law and impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  General situation 
</b></p>
<p>38. During 2008, impunity, a structural problem which has negated the dissuasive function of 
the justice system and seriously weakened its punitive function, continued to contribute to high 
levels of violence. The investigations, prosecutions, judgements and punishments which the 
State has a duty to oversee, and which are necessary to address the issue, were not systematically 
undertaken. 
</p>
<p>39. The State has the duty to take efficient measures to prevent and punish criminal acts. This 
obligation becomes more onerous when it is clear that previous measures taken were neither 
adequate nor effective. Inaction or the repetition of ineffective measures in a situation of 
generalized violence constitutes in itself a breach of the obligations of the State. 
</p>
<p>40. The weakness of the State in resolving non-criminal disputes (labour, civil, family and 
property jurisdictions) contributed to these conflicts overlapping into the criminal sphere, where 
the highest percentage of cases is concentrated. 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  A state of &#8220;prevention&#8221; is the first phase within the five modalities of the state of exception 
</p>
<p>established by Guatemalan legislation; it is applicable in less serious situations. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>41. Guatemala still faces generalized institutional weakness, reflected in the absence of legal 
norms, policies and adequate measures for a coherent vision of public service in which the 
authorities assume their responsibilities and the State fulfils its role as the duty-bearer towards 
the realization of human rights of all, without discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office 
</b></p>
<p>42. The appointment of Amilcar Vel&#225;squez as a new Public Prosecutor, in March 2008, and 
the replacement of other high-level officials within the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office have brought a 
positive message of transparency, making possible new forms of collaboration, such as the 
creation of a special unit which will work jointly with the International Commission against 
Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG). It is expected that these changes will be translated into effective 
and consistent measures against impunity. 
</p>
<p>43. The career system for prosecutors remained unstable, although some efforts were made, 
such as a preliminary revision of the performance evaluation system. This system should involve 
all technical staff and should contribute substantially to design and implement personnel 
management policies and capacity-building training sessions. The disciplinary regime is not 
based on due process, the right to defence or the rights of victims.  
</p>
<p>44. A lack of clarity persists in relation to the competencies of the various divisions within the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the distribution of matters among them, and also as regards the 
management of the cases. The Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office announced a restructuring plan for the 
divisions, which might help to overcome these problems. 
</p>
<p>45. Noteworthy are the efforts to establish an effective witness-protection mechanism, and an 
agreement between the Public Prosecutor and the Ministry of the Interior. These efforts should 
be complemented by a delineation of functions and the development and implementation of 
policies and clear directives under the permanent control of the Council for the Protection of the 
Service. 
</p>
<p>46. Advances achieved by the National Forensic Science Institute (INACIF), which include an 
increase in personnel and the development of norms and operational procedures, have not yet 
been complemented by measures which would guarantee an adequate budget allocation, and the 
strengthening of inter-institutional coordination. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Judiciary and justice sector 
</b>47. The performance of the judiciary remained at similar levels as in previous years, and 
efforts to speed up case management have shown very limited results, which reportedly are

</p>
<p>48. During the year 2008 there were no significant steps forward to strengthen the legal 
framework for judges&#8217; professional development, particularly in relation to performance 
evaluations, the disciplinary regime, transfers and the separation of jurisdictional and 
administrative functions. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>49. Attacks and threats against justice operators - which resulted in the killing of seven public 
officials - remain a cause for serious concern, particularly as there are no significant advances 
towards the investigation, trial and punishment of perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>50. The budget allocated to the National Commission on Strengthening the Justice System 
(CNSAFJ) for the drafting of a new law to reinforce the Coordinating Body of the Justice Sector 
and the initiatives to construct common evaluation indicators should contribute to a more 
effective coordination and to the establishment of holistic policies. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Deprivation of liberty 
</b></p>
<p>51. It is the State&#8217;s duty to ensure that the use of custodial measures is legal and respects the 
criteria of necessity and proportionality. 
</p>
<p>52. During 2008, over half of all persons deprived of their liberty were in preventive detention, 
and often were subjected to undue delays. The case of Luis Cruz Cho Tut, who was charged with 
murdering Congressman Mario Pivaral, and detained (despite the lack of legal basis and 
evidence), arbitrarily deprived of his liberty for more than two years and finally declared 
innocent, is an example. The application of certain rules which exclude the use of non-custodial 
measures, and Sentencing Tribunals&#8217; powers to retain in custody persons who have been 
acquitted by Court of First Instance, contribute to the problem. 
</p>
<p>53. It is of concern that detained persons are brought before judicial authorities, which decide 
on their legal situation at times over several days, without legal or linguistic assistance thus 
negatively affecting those with limited means, especially indigenous peoples. The lack of 
jurisdiction of lower courts to resolve these matters also contributes to the problem.  
</p><p>54. OHCHR observed that the custodial measures applied by the juvenile justice system are 
not always consistent with the best interests of the child, particularly in view of its nature as a 
last resort measure, and with the respect for the legal provisions about its maximum duration.  
</p>
<p><b>5.  Justice and indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>55. The justice sector as a whole continued to operate without ethnic and linguistic diversity. 
Efforts undertaken to improve indigenous people&#8217;s access to the official justice system, such as 
training, the provision of interpreters and the production of expert cultural reports, continued to 
be isolated, of little impact, lacking in understanding towards and respect for indigenous law and 
not reaching all branches of the official justice system. 
</p><p>56. Substantive improvements are needed to guarantee non-discriminatory, linguistically and 
culturally relevant access to justice that affirms the system&#8217;s effectiveness to dissuade violations 
of rights, especially those of rural women and those speaking indigenous languages. 
</p>
<p>57. The increase in complaints relating to the crime of discrimination, compared to previous 
years, was not reflected in an increase in the number of charges filed nor convictions obtained. 
The strengthening of institutional capacities to criminally prosecute this crime has been 
insufficient. It is also imperative that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Case Management System takes 
into account criteria on ethnic and cultural identity. </p>

</p>
<p><b>6.  Transitional justice 
</b>58. The sentencing of low-level perpetrators of the Rio Negro massacre to 30 years of 
imprisonment and the commencement of the trial, in Chimaltenango, of the first case of enforced 
disappearance, are positive advances. However, the overwhelming majority of human rights 
violations committed during the internal armed conflict remain unpunished. The application of 
an amnesty by the Constitutional Court in another case involving enforced disappearances 
(El Jute case), on the basis of a determination that the actions of the accused were &#8220;political 
crimes&#8221; was inconsistent with international standards. The suspension of proceedings in the case 
of the Dos Erres massacre due to the failure of national courts to resolve more than 30 <i>amparo 
</i>actions pending since 2004 resulted in the presentation of the case before the Inter-American 
Court of Human Rights by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on 30 July 2008.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>59. The filing of multiple legal actions in order to prevent prosecutors&#8217; access to military 
information relevant to genocide investigations, as well as procedural delays, demonstrated 
patterns of obstruction in those cases. 
</p>
<p>60. The President&#8217;s public announcement on 25 February 2008 of granting public access to 
military archives was challenged by the Minister of Defence based on arguments of &#8220;national 
security&#8221;. It is of concern that, in the process of drafting and approving the Access to Public 
Information Act, the Congress failed to define criteria for the classification of military 
documents on the basis of national security.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>61. The National Reparations Programme proceeded with an important amount of financial 
compensation paid to victims, and the Government carried out symbolic acts of recognition to 
help restore the dignity of victims. However, the State still needs to take measures commensurate 
with the integral and interrelated nature of its obligations for guaranteeing the rights to truth, 
justice and full reparation.<b>12</b> 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Presidential veto on 14 March 2008, to prevent Congressional Decree 6-2008 from 
becoming law, permitted the de facto moratorium on the application of the death penalty to be 
maintained. In the same spirit, the Supreme Court decided on 10 October 2008 to commute four 
death penalties into maximum prison penalties. This should pave the way to the permanent 
abolishment of the death penalty. In the meantime, the death penalty may only be applied once 
the pardon has been regulated and the criminal laws reformed, in compliance with international 
human rights law. The High Commissioner recommends observing the moratorium currently in 
force with a view to abolishing the death penalty. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>C.  Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>63. Guatemala has adopted all of the relevant international treaties on economic, social and 
cultural rights and its legislation includes strong commitments to economic and social rights. 
However, the record of implementation has shown slow progressive realization of these rights 
and reflecting weak social and economic policies. 
</p>
<p>64. A detailed analysis of the 2008 budget shows both low levels of expenditures for basic 
human rights priorities in health and education, as well as inadequate prioritization to redress 
inequality and address the needs of the poorest. It is therefore very positive that the budget 
for 2009 is increasing resources for primary education and basic health. The conditional cash 
transfers to the poorest families are also positive affirmative action to reverse historical 
exclusion. 
</p>
<p>65. If the Government is going to be able to live up to its obligations for more rapid pace of 
realization of social and economic rights through more progressive and proactive social spending 
and promotion of pro-poor growth, fiscal revenues and political support from society at large are 
needed. The Government has very limited fiscal space which will become even more of a 
challenge in 2009. Guatemala already has a very low tax base. To raise the tax base and 
undertake major fiscal reform will require a major political effort. 
</p><p>66. Legal enforcement of economic, social and cultural rights has not been assumed by the 
State as an obligation. Legal actions initiated by the Office of the Human Rights Procurator 
before the Constitutional Court, against laws limiting the right to public, free and compulsory 
education, as well as discriminatory laws relating to social security, which later were declared 
unconstitutional, were positive measures. However, the court maintained discriminatory 
dispositions regarding domestic work in private homes, making a full enjoyment of rights 
difficult for women, particularly indigenous women, who carry out most of this work. 
</p>
<p><b>IV. ACTIVITIES OF THE OFFICE OF THE HIGH COMMISSIONER  
FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN GUATEMALA 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Activities of the office in Guatemala  
</b></p>
<p>67. In the course of 2008, the OHCHR office in Guatemala carried out 50 monitoring 
missions in the 22 departments of Guatemala, accounting for a total of 97 days in the field: 
135 complaints were received, of which 47 were selected for follow-up as they referred to 
violations of human rights. In addition, the office carried out 595 meetings and interviews with 
authorities and representatives of civil society to supplement its assessment of the human rights 
situation. This enabled the office to gather the necessary information needed to analyse the 
human rights situation and adjust the office&#8217;s advisory and technical cooperation services, and to 
provide support to victims and witnesses, facilitating their cooperation with authorities. The 
office provided advice to civil society organizations and national institutions in a number of 
cases. 
</p>
<p>68. In commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, the office launched a campaign aimed at young people in order to promote knowledge of </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>human rights. This included an interactive website and material for the media. Other activities 
included a music concert, an artistic festival for human rights, and a television documentary. The 
office continued promoting awareness of human rights and providing information regarding its 
work via press conferences and press releases, interviews, publications, workshops with 
journalists, students and teachers and by way of its documentation centre. 
</p><p>69. With respect to follow up to the international commitments of Guatemala, the office 
assisted the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and the Presidential Commission on Human Rights 
(COPREDEH) with the preparation of reports for the universal periodic review. As a follow-up 
to the recommendations deriving from the review, COPREDEH and the office published a 
compilation of the 43 recommendations, which was presented at various seminars to government 
institutions and civil society. 
</p>
<p>70. In order to promote implementation of Guatemala&#8217;s obligations deriving from treaties, the 
office published the study &#8220;Recommendations of the treaty bodies to Guatemala&#8221;, which 
evaluates the recommendations and identifies an agenda of pending actions. This publication was 
presented in 22 workshops to government institutions, the Congress, the judiciary, the Human 
Rights Procurator (PDH), the United Nations Country Team and NGOs. 
</p>
<p>71. The office provided technical assistance to the Presidential Commission on Discrimination 
and Racism Against Indigenous People (CODISRA) in relation to the drafting of the twelfth and 
thirteenth periodic reports to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, using a 
national, participatory and inter-institutional methodology. The office commenced the provision 
of technical assistance to COPREDEH in relation to the third periodic report of Guatemala under 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. With a view to improving capacity 
development of COPREDEH personnel, the office conducted a series of training sessions on 
international human rights treaties, drafting of reports and individual communications to the 
Committees. 
</p>
<p>72. With regard to strengthening the international legal framework, the office promoted the 
recognition by the Congress of the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination to receive individual communications. The office organized events to promote 
the ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons against Enforced 
Disappearance. 
</p>
<p>73. With respect to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a strategy was 
implemented jointly with the National Council for the Attention to Persons with Disabilities 
(CONADI) and PDH. This strategy aimed at publicizing the Convention nationally and 
increasing awareness of its importance within the Congress. Public events were promoted and 
the office participated in round tables together with representatives of the Congress, civil society 
and the media. With a view to strengthening the capacity of the PDH, the office organized 
workshops about the Convention addressed to the directors of the institution&#8217;s units. The 
Convention was promoted in various departments in the interior of the country and was ratified 
by the Congress in September 2008. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>74. Following the ratification in 2007 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention, the office 
facilitated a range of workshops for public institutions and civil society on the standards 
applicable to establishing a national prevention mechanism and the guidelines of the 
Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture. The office provided technical assistance to 
COPREDEH, PDH and NGOs in relation to a draft law to create a national prevention 
mechanism against torture. 
</p>
<p>75. The office provided technical assistance to the Ministry of the Interior and the NCP on 
monitoring techniques. A plan was developed to contribute to strengthening the capacities of 
institutions in the security sector, and in the implementation of their human rights obligations. 
The office conducted the training of 350 NCP officials on human rights instruments relevant to 
police work, use of force and firearms, torture, police investigations, non-discrimination and 
women&#8217;s rights. The same topics were covered in training provided to instructors at the Police 
Academy. Training was also provided on women&#8217;s rights to the personnel of the NCP Gender 
Division. 
</p>
<p>76. The office carried out a training programme for the Department of Civilian Intelligence 
(DIGICI) on issues such as information-gathering and arbitrary interference with privacy, codes 
of ethics and human rights issues relevant to the carrying out of intelligence in public and private 
spheres. Jointly with CICIG, the office trained police assigned to it for the investigation of 
extrajudicial executions, the use of force and firearms, torture, as well as on police projects that 
were respectful of human rights. 
</p>
<p>77. In coordination with CICIG, the office provided technical assistance to the DIGICI 
authorities in relation to the creation of a Criminal Analysis Unit, and to the PNC authorities on a 
plan to restructure criminal investigations. The office also carried out a consultancy with the 
Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office in order to formulate recommendations for the strengthening of the 
disciplinary system, performance evaluations, as well as a programme for the protection of 
witnesses and others involved in criminal proceedings. In addition, the office assisted the 
Ministry in the drafting of a criminal prosecution policy for human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>78. The office in Guatemala remained in contact with authorities of diverse institutions with 
the aim of providing support through information sharing and technical assistance. It facilitated 
presentations to the Modernization Roundtable of the National Commission for Monitoring and 
Supporting the Strengthening of Justice (CNSAFJ) on international standards and assisted the 
training units of justice sector institutions with the adoption of a common format for training on 
human rights and carried out workshops with trainers. 
</p>
<p>79. The office convened social organizations, experts, government bodies and opinion makers, 
promoting reflection on issues such as the death penalty, the rights of indigenous peoples and 
enforced disappearance. The office facilitated dialogue between the company Cementos 
Progreso, indigenous communities from San Juan Sacatep&#233;quez and the Government, with the 
aim of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict generated by the installation of a cement 
factory. The office also facilitated dialogue between bilateral donors and United Nations 
agencies on indigenous people&#8217;s rights and transitional justice issues. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p>80. The High Commissioner presented an <i>amicus curiae</i> brief to the Constitutional Court to 
contribute to the incorporation of legal arguments deriving from international law in the first 
case of enforced disappearance to be brought before national courts. 
</p>
<p>81. The OHCHR office in Guatemala, together with UNICEF, prepared a practical guide on 
international standards applicable to criminal juvenile justice. 
</p><p>82. Follow-up was given to recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, by assisting the Congressional Committee on Women. Together 
with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United Nations Development Fund 
for Women (UNIFEM), advice was provided on the Law against Femicide and Other Forms of 
Violence against Women, which was passed in April 2008. An interpretive guide to the law is 
being produced by the office on the basis of international instruments on women&#8217;s rights. The 
office included in its trainings for police officers an explanation of the new responsibilities 
deriving from the Law against Femicide. In addition, the office provided technical assistance on 
the draft law against sexual violence, exploitation and human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>83. The office in Guatemala collaborated with the Gender Equity Division of the National 
Civilian Police in relation to the production of an institutional policy on access to and service 
with the NCP, as well as gender perspective in the prevention of crime and the evaluation of 
institutional conditions relative to female police. 
</p>
<p>84. The office provided assistance to the Forum for Analysis of Attacks against Human Rights 
Defenders, in which the Ministry of the Interior, the DIGICI, the PNC, the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office and NGOs participate. Patterns of attacks on defenders were analysed, and advice was 
provided in relation to the coordination of preventive measures. The office continued advising 
COPREDEH on prevention and protection measures for human rights defenders and on the 
drafting of the respective government directive. 
</p>
<p>85. Numerous monitoring activities relating to attacks on defenders were carried out with civil 
society organizations, the Office of the Human Rights Procurator and the institutions responsible 
for the investigation and criminal prosecution of these matters. Two public solidarity events were 
organized in support of defenders working on transitional justice and economic, social and 
cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>86. In relation to the rights of indigenous peoples, the office provided technical assistance for 
the design of the &#8220;National campaign for cultural diversity and togetherness&#8221; of CODISRA and 
participated in the design of the monitoring and evaluation system relating to the &#8220;Public policy 
on togetherness and the elimination of racism and racial discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>87. The office implemented with the Office of Defence for Indigenous Women (DEMI) and 
CODISRA the project &#8220;Contributing to the eradication of racism and discrimination on the basis 
of ethnicity and gender, particularly towards indigenous women&#8221;. </p>
<p>88. Assistance was provided to the representatives of CODISRA and DEMI who participated 
in the Regional Preparatory Conference for the Evaluation of the Durban Programme and Plan of 
Action, held in Brasilia, on the preparation of progress reports. Workshops on human rights and 
the rights of indigenous peoples were carried out nationally. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>89. In order to contribute to the legal empowerment of civil society, especially indigenous 
peoples, the office organized in April 2008, together with the Rafael Landivar University, an 
international seminar in Guatemala City on strategic litigation and legal clinics. On the basis of 
the results of the seminar, a technical training and institutional strengthening programme was 
designed for civil society. Implementation of this programme will begin in 2009. 
</p>
<p>90. To promote indigenous peoples&#8217; access to justice, the office worked with the Social 
Studies and Research Association (ASIES) on following up the implementation of the 
recommendations of the study &#8220;Human rights-based approach to indigenous people&#8217;s access to 
justice: perspectives from indigenous law and from the official justice system&#8221;. 
</p><p>91. In addition to carrying out observation of situations relevant to economic, social and 
cultural rights in order to make recommendations and provide technical assistance, the office 
began the development of indicators for measuring compliance with the right to food, with the 
support of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, PDH, COPREDEH, the 
Ministry of Health and Centre for Human Rights Research (CIIDH). 
</p>
<p>92. The office participated actively in the new analysis and programming cycle for the 
Common Country Assessment/United Nations Development Assistance Framework 
(CCA/UNDAF), ensuring the incorporation of the human rights-based approach. 
</p>
<p><b>B. Follow-up to recommendations made in previous reports of the 
High Commissioner on the human rights situation in Guatemala 
</b></p>
<p>93. In her report to the seventh session of the Council (A/HRC/7/38/Add.1) the 
High Commissioner formulated 12 recommendations directed to the Government, the Congress, 
the judiciary, as well as to civil society organizations, on the following issues: the legal 
framework for human rights protection, life and security, rule of law and impunity, indigenous 
peoples, women&#8217;s rights, economic, social and cultural rights and advisory and technical 
cooperation services of the OHCHR office in Guatemala, which has supported and monitored 
implementation of these recommendations. 
</p>
<p>94. The High Commissioner welcomes the approval by Congress of the International 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and encourages its ratification and prompt 
implementation. The High Commissioner also welcomes the adoption of the Access to 
Information Law, the Law against Femicide and Other Forms of Violence against Women, on 
which the office presented harmonization reports.  
</p>
<p>95. The High Commissioner notes that approval by Congress is still pending on the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, the Rome Statute of 
the International Criminal Court and the acceptance of the competence of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination in accordance with article 14 of the relevant Convention. 
</p>
<p>96. The High Commissioner recognizes that the National Council on Adoptions, established by 
the new Adoptions Law, represents an important advance for the protection of the rights of the 
child. </p>

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>97. The High Commissioner draws attention to the failure, so far, of Congress to pass a range 
of laws on security and justice issues, in particular the laws governing private security 
companies, on arms and ammunition, as well as reforms to the <i>amparo</i>, habeas corpus and 
constitutionality law, the law on the National Reparations Programme, the law to establish a 
National Search Commission for the Disappeared, as well as the reforms to the public order 
laws. The High Commissioner notes that approval of a law to regulate consultations in 
accordance with ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) is also pending, 
a reform to the laws on migration, in accordance with the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, and legal 
reforms to combat discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>98. The High Commissioner recognizes the efforts made to restructure the National Civilian 
Police, the continuing process of vetting and the permanent strengthening of the General Civil 
Intelligence Directorate.  
</p>
<p>99. The High Commissioner notes with concern that the implementation of an integrated 
process of functional and operational management for criminal investigations and prosecutions, 
which includes an inter-institutional analysis of criminal trends, as well as effective coordination 
mechanisms to produce results in combating impunity, remains pending on behalf of the Public 
Prosecutor&#8217;s Office and the National Civilian Police. 
</p>
<p>100. The High Commissioner welcomes the initial efforts undertaken by the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office in order to develop a performance evaluation system which may strengthen the 
professional development of prosecutors. However, she encourages the adoption of measures, 
both applicable to support staff and top-level officials that ensure the effective application of 
internal control systems and a disciplinary regime by the justice institutions as a whole, including 
strengthening of the respective legal framework. 
</p>
<p>101. The High Commissioner calls on the judiciary and other judicial institutions to prioritize 
and coordinate efforts for the development and implementation, in consultation with indigenous 
peoples, of a sector policy for access to justice which incorporates linguistic, geographic and 
cultural considerations and which responds to the need to incorporate juridical pluralism.  
</p><p>102. The High Commissioner notes that a strengthening of statistical analysis from a human 
rights perspective is pending as is the construction and use of adequate indicators in order to 
advance implementation of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.  
</p>
<p>103. The High Commissioner notes that the judicial institutions are yet to recognize the 
continuous nature of the crime of enforced disappearance, and to this effect presented an 
<i>amicus</i> <i>curiae</i> brief to the Constitutional Court which underlines this characteristic as established 
by international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>104. The High Commissioner welcomes the commencement of the &#8220;National campaign for 
cultural diversity and togetherness&#8221; of CODISRA and the evaluation of the &#8220;Public policy on 
togetherness and the elimination of racism and racial discrimination&#8221;. </p>

<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The High Commissioner urges the State to take coordinated, coherent and 
effective action to implement all the recommendations contained in the OHCHR reports 
for 2005, 2006 and 2007: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Legislative framework. The High Commissioner urges the Congress and the 
Government to continue to refine the legislative framework for the protection of human 
rights, through the ratification of the Second Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aimed at abolishing the death penalty, the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court; and to recognize the 
competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Right to life and security. The High Commissioner urges the Government to 
undertake sustained efforts to improve criminal investigations carried out by the National 
Civilian Police, on the basis of an appropriate organizational structure, trained personnel, 
an adequate territorial deployment, and the availability of technical and scientific 
resources. She calls on the Government to utilize operational intelligence and criminal 
analysis, and to develop manuals, procedural protocols and management indicators. She 
also recommends strengthening internal and external accountability mechanisms;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The High Commissioner also urges the General Directorate of the Prisons 
System (DGSP) and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to undertake immediate, 
exhaustive and impartial investigations into the deaths of persons deprived of 
their liberty. She calls on the Ministry of the Interior and the DGSP to adopt 
urgent measures to prevent the recurrence of violent incidents within detention 
centres, and to protect the life and integrity of all persons. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The High Commissioner calls on the authorities to adopt regulations which 
effectively implement the Prisons Act and which guarantee the application of 
this law to all detention centres within the country, including those centres 
under the authority of the National Civilian Police. She urges the Government 
and the Congress to establish a national mechanism for the prevention of 
torture, within the time frame and conditions mandated by the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Rule of law and impunity. The High Commissioner urges the State to take 
action to strengthen areas of civil jurisdiction, in order to prevent civil conflicts becoming 
criminal matters, and she encourages the State to take measures to ensure indigenous 
peoples&#8217; access to these jurisdictions in a way which is culturally and linguistically 
relevant;  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The High Commissioner urges the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to strengthen 
prosecutors&#8217; professional development via the implementation of a disciplinary 
regime which respects due process and an evaluation system based on the 
development of management policies and training of all technical personnel. </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/10/31/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The High Commissioner recommends that the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office give 
special attention both to cases of human rights violations committed during the 
internal armed conflict and to those committed after the termination of this 
conflict, with the aim of understanding the nature of and the particular logic 
required to investigate these cases, and to improve its effectiveness in the 
criminal prosecution of perpetrators.  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The High Commissioner urges the judiciary to implement management 
monitoring systems in all areas of its jurisdiction with a view to identifying 
strategies for speeding up processes and applying legal and technical reasoning 
in judicial decisions. These systems should include mechanisms which guarantee 
the full participation of the civil society. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The High Commissioner calls on the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s 
Office to undertake efforts to rationalize the use of the deprivation of liberty 
and broaden the application of non-custodial measures, particularly in cases of 
minor offences, and criminal offences committed by adolescents, in accordance 
with international human rights law including the United Nations Standard 
Minimum Rules for Non-custodial Measures and the United Nations Standard 
Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Indigenous peoples. The High Commissioner urges the State to adopt special 
measures to combat discrimination in all areas, and in particular to overcome the 
conditions of inequality which impede indigenous peoples&#8217; access to economic, social and 
cultural rights; to generate greater opportunities for the inclusion and participation of 
indigenous peoples in management and decision-making positions; and also to guarantee 
their access to management of mass media. She calls on the Congress to pass legislation to 
provide for the consultation of indigenous peoples in accordance with the ILO Indigenous 
and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No. 169) and the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples;  
</b></p>
