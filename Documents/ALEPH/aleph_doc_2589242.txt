mining  tenements  acquired,  exercised  or  lapsed  during  the  reporting  period.    If  the 
entity  is  involved  in  a  joint  venture  agreement  and  there  are  conditions  precedent

change  of  percentage  interest  and  conditions  precedent  in  the  list  required  for  items 
6.1 and 6.2.
