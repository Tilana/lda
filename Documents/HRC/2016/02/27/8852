<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the context of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food receives a large 
number of communications alleging violations of the right to food and related rights worldwide. 
Such communications are received from national, regional and international non-governmental 
organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations and other United Nations procedures 
concerned with the protection of human rights. This addendum to the report of the Special 
Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-country basis, summaries of communications, including 
urgent appeals, allegation letters and follow-up relating to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate for 
the period 5 December 2008 to 5 December 2009 and the responses received until 6 February 
</p><p>2010. The Special Rapporteur urges all Governments and other actors who have not yet done so 
to respond promptly to his communications and, in appropriate cases, to investigate allegations 
of the violation of the right to food and related rights and to take all steps necessary to redress the 
situation.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur has sought to condense details of communications sent and received. 
To the extent that his resources permit, the Special Rapporteur continues to follow up on 
communications sent and monitors the situation where no reply has been received or where 
questions remain unanswered.  
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 18 communications 
concerning the right to food to 16 Member States as well as 13 communications to other actors 
including corporations. Where appropriate, the Special Rapporteur has sent joint urgent appeals 
or letters with one or more special procedures of the Human Rights Council where the 
allegations raised relate to the right to food as well as to rights addressed under other mandates.  
</p>
<p>4. Since the establishment of his mandate in 2000, the Special Rapporteur has worked 
continuously, together with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights, to better publicize his mandate and raise awareness among civil society. It should be 
emphasized that the communications presented in this document in no way reflect the full extent 
of the serious obstacles that still remain in the realization of the right to food of all around the 
world.  
</p>
<p>5. Out of the 18 communications sent to Member States, 7 replies were received and out of 
the 14 communications sent to other actors, 7 replies were received. During the period covered 
by this report the Special Rapporteur also received 5 replies concerning communications which 
had been included in Report A/HRC/10/5/Add.1 (17 February 2009) or in Report A/HRC/ 
7/5/Add.1 (29 February 2008). The Special Rapporteur welcomes the replies received as he 
considers them a useful way to engage in constructive dialogues in relation to specific cases, 
issues or situations. The Special Rapporteur, however, regrets that an important number of the 
Governments he corresponded with have failed to respond at all. The Special Rapporteur 
considers these communications as still outstanding, and encourages Governments to respond to 
them and to address all concerns raised.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur included a heading called follow-up for cases in which either he or 
Governments provided further substantive comments in relation to the correspondence on a 
specific case and/or issue.  </p>

<p><b>II. SUMMARY OF COMMUNICATIONS SENT TO GOVERNMENTS  
AND REPLIES RECEIVED 
</b></p>
<p><b>Angola 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up communication 
</b></p>
<p>7. On 22 January 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent the Government of Angola a letter in 
which he thanked the Government for his reply of 4 November 2008 to a letter sent on 
17 October 2008. The Special Rapporteur reminded the Government of Angola to send any 
additional information that the Government may receive from the Attorney General&#8217;s office on 
the reported confiscation of farmland by Sociedade Mineira do Cuango in order to carry out 
diamond mining activities in Cafunfo village in Cuango municipality of Lunda Norte province. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to his communication. 
</p>
<p><b>Bangladesh 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>9. On 18 September 2009, the Government of Bangladesh sent a reply regarding a 
communication on the alleged illegal seizure of the traditional lands of Jumma indigenous 
communities in Barbadan, Khagrachari and Merung districts and in the Chittagong Hill, sent on 
3 April 2008 by the Special Rapporteur jointly with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing 
as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to 
non-discrimination in this context and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. Bangladesh concerning The Government of 
Bangladesh disagreed with the allegations contained in the communication submitted by the 
Special Rapporteurs. The Government stated that Article 26(1) of the 1997 Chittagong Hill 
Tracks (CHT) Accord had not been violated as the CHT Land Dispute Resolution Commission 
and the Court of District Judges, which work on the issue and resolve land disputes, had been 
established. It also informed the Special Rapporteurs that a thorough enquiry had been conducted 
in order to investigate the alleged illegal seizure of traditional lands of Jumma communities 
mentioned in the communication. The Government further indicated that in Khagrachari Hill 
District indigenous and other local people had been living together for long time and despite the 
existence of some disputes between them neither the army nor the local administration were 
biased towards the latter. The Government also stated that in Bandarban Hill District the only 
case of land acquisition to have taken place was that of 7550 acres of land in the Ruma Upazila 
which were deemed necessary for the planned construction of six army garrisons. However, as 
the Government has observed, in the course of several meetings between the local army 
commander and inhabitants, an amicable solution had been reached and the latter had agreed to 
leave their lands if due compensation and residential accommodation were provided by the 
Government. Finally, the Government indicated that in the communities concerned as well as in 
the other regions of the country, different disputes relating to land occurred however solutions 
were found. </p>

<p><b>Comunicaci&#243;n enviada  
</b></p>
<p>12. El 14 de agosto de 2009, el Relator Especial junto con la Relatora Especial sobre una 
vivienda adecuada como elemento integrante del derecho a un nivel de vida adecuado y sobre el 
derecho de no discriminaci&#243;n a este respecto, enviaron una carta de alegaci&#243;n al Gobierno de 
Colombia en relaci&#243;n con el supuesto desalojo forzoso del que fueron objeto 120 familias 
residentes en la Hacienda las Pavas en el municipio del Pe&#241;&#243;n, sur de Bol&#237;var. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida: el 14 de julio de 2009, miembros de la Polic&#237;a Nacional y del Escuadr&#243;n 
M&#243;vil Antidisturbios habr&#237;an desalojado 120 familias, incluyendo varios ni&#241;os, ni&#241;as y mujeres 
embarazadas, de sus casas ubicadas en la Hacienda las Pavas. Los miembros de la Polic&#237;a 
habr&#237;an saqueado las viviendas desalojadas. El desalojo forzoso se habr&#237;a realizado a pesar de 
que representantes del Ministerio P&#250;blico presentes en el momento del desalojo se opusieron al 
mismo y solicitaron la suspensi&#243;n de la operaci&#243;n. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, solo 3 familias 
permanec&#237;an en el predio de la hacienda las Pavas, gracias a una decisi&#243;n judicial obtenida v&#237;a 
tutela, la cual les reconoci&#243; su derecho de posesi&#243;n. Las restantes 120 familias, supuestamente 
desalojadas forzosamente, tambi&#233;n ser&#237;an poseedoras de buena fe de las tierras de la hacienda las 
Pavas en las que estaban ubicadas sus viviendas. Su propietario, Sr. Jes&#250;s Emilio Escobar 
Fern&#225;ndez, habr&#237;a abandonado el predio en 1997, momento a partir del cual las 123 familias 
vecinas de la vereda de Buenos Aires habr&#237;an iniciado actos dominativos de posesi&#243;n, 
incluyendo la explotaci&#243;n econ&#243;mica del predio y mejoras para optimizar su rendimiento 
agr&#237;cola. Posteriormente, las 123 familias se habr&#237;an constituido como Asociaci&#243;n, la cual se 
denomina ASOCAB. En el a&#241;o 2003, grupos paramilitares habr&#237;an llegado a la regi&#243;n y habr&#237;an 
iniciado actos violentos de hostigamiento, los cuales habr&#237;an obligado a las 123 familias a 
abandonar el predio. Entre los a&#241;os 2003 y 2006, las 123 familias habr&#237;an comenzado a retornar 
al predio, de manera paulatina. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el retorno de las familias vino 
acompa&#241;ado de la explotaci&#243;n econ&#243;mica dirigida a satisfacer sus necesidades alimentarias, 
incluyendo el mantenimiento de sus cultivos agr&#237;colas, la construcci&#243;n y mantenimiento de 
criaderos de peces que conten&#237;an varias especies, as&#237; como algunas reces. Posteriormente se </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
inici&#243; un procedimiento de extinci&#243;n de dominio de tierras incultas, con base en el art&#237;culo 52 de 
la ley 160 de 1994, el cual establece la extinci&#243;n del derecho de dominio o propiedad sobre los 
predios rurales en los cuales se dejare de ejercer posesi&#243;n en la forma establecida por la ley, por 
m&#225;s de 3 a&#241;os continuos. En el a&#241;o 2008, se habr&#237;a dictado una resoluci&#243;n por parte de la Unidad 
Nacional de Tierras (Resoluci&#243;n 1473 de 11 de Noviembre de 2008), en la que se habr&#237;a 
dispuesto iniciar las diligencias administrativas para declarar extinguido el dominio sobre varios 
predios rurales, incluyendo las Pavas. Dicho procedimiento se encontrar&#237;a a&#250;n en curso. Sin 
embargo, las sociedades Aportes San Isidro S.A. y C.I. Tequendama, quienes figurar&#237;an como 
adquirientes parciales de mejoras y dominio del predio desde el a&#241;o 2007, habr&#237;an iniciado una 
acci&#243;n policiva, la cual es el origen del desalojo forzoso del 14 de julio de 2009. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, la decisi&#243;n de desalojo desconocer&#237;a la normatividad vigente en la materia, 
en particular, en lo referente al procedimiento de extinci&#243;n de dominio que est&#225; en curso. Incluso 
la autoridad estatal encargada del tema, el INCODER, se habr&#237;a pronunciado sobre la 
irregularidad de un posible desalojo forzoso. ASOCAB habr&#237;a interpuesto un recurso de amparo 
en contra la decisi&#243;n de desalojo, la cual habr&#237;a sido admitida en primera instancia. Sin embargo, 
en segunda instancia habr&#237;a sido rechazada. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, las 123 familias han 
visto gravemente afectado su derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n desde el desalojo, puesto que han visto 
interrumpido su acceso a los medios productivos que pose&#237;an, los cuales estaban en el predio de 
las Pavas. Asimismo, las 3 familias que permanecen en el predio estar&#237;an siendo el objeto de 
presiones por parte del apoderado de Aportes San Isidro S.A. y C.I. Tequendama. &#201;ste estar&#237;a 
impidiendo que contin&#250;en con la explotaci&#243;n agr&#237;cola del predio y con el cuidado de los 
animales, y les estar&#237;a obligando a que permanezcan la mayor&#237;a del tiempo en la casa principal 
de la finca donde cohabitan con los miembros del Escuadr&#243;n M&#243;vil de Carabineros ECNAD. 
Adem&#225;s de los comentarios sobre la veracidad y exactitud de las alegaciones presentadas, los 
Relatores Especiales solicitaron mayor informaci&#243;n sobre base legal en que se habr&#237;a 
fundamentado el supuesto desalojo forzado; si se dio un plazo suficiente y razonable de 
notificaci&#243;n a las familias afectadas por el desalojo y un plazo suficiente para que las 
comunidades afectadas pudieran sacar sus bienes antes del desalojo; sobre las acciones tomadas 
para investigar el supuesto saqueo de las viviendas desalojadas por parte de miembros de la 
fuerza p&#250;blica; si se ofreci&#243; una compensaci&#243;n adecuada a los afectados por la perdida de sus 
viviendas y bienes; sobre las medidas tomadas para garantizar el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las

<p><b>Comunicaci&#243;n recibida  
</b></p>
<p>14. Mediante comunicaci&#243;n de fecha 11 de enero de 2010, el Gobierno contest&#243; a la 
comunicaci&#243;n de los Relatores datada 14 de agosto de 2009. Respecto a la situaci&#243;n de la 
Hacienda &#8220;Las Pavas&#8221; el Gobierno inform&#243; que las sociedades comerciales &#8220;Aportes San Isidro&#8221; 
y &#8220;Tequendama C.I.&#8221; solicitaron a trav&#233;s de una acci&#243;n policiva el amparo a la posesi&#243;n 
detentada desde el a&#241;o 2007, en calidad de adquirentes parciales de mejoras y dominio del predio 
en cuesti&#243;n. En este sentido, el Gobierno precis&#243; que los hechos ocurridos el d&#237;a 14 de julio de 
2009 no se encuentran dentro de una diligencia de desalojo propiamente dicha (en raz&#243;n de que 
&#233;sta ocurre cuando el lugar ocupado es un espacio publico) sino dentro de una diligencia de 
lanzamiento por ocupaci&#243;n de hecho, a saber, un proceso a trav&#233;s del cual se pone fin a la 
ocupaci&#243;n arbitraria de un inmueble y se restituye su tenencia a favor del tenedor legitimo. El 
Gobierno inform&#243; que esta diligencia de lanzamiento tuvo como fundamento una sentencia 
proferida por el Juzgado Primero Promiscuo del municipio de Mompox. El gobierno tambi&#233;n 
inform&#243; que la Fiscal&#237;a 1&#176; de la Estructura de Apoyo (EDA) de la Unidad de Asuntos 
Humanitarios-Seccional Cartagena se encuentra adelantando la correspondiente investigaci&#243;n 
penal por el presunto delito de desplazamiento forzado del que dicen haber sido victimas ciento 
veinte familias y que la presente investigaci&#243;n se encuentra en etapa de indagaci&#243;n en 
averiguaci&#243;n de responsables. El gobierno tambi&#233;n se&#241;al&#243; que las familias presuntamente 
v&#237;ctimas de desalojo no habr&#237;as sido desprovistas de su vivienda puesto que su residencia no era 
la Hacienda &#8220;Las Pavas&#8221; sino que esta se encuentra ubicada en la cabecera del corregimiento 
Buenos Aires, ubicado a treinta minutos de camino de la Hacienda &#8220;Las Pavas&#8221;. El Gobierno 
finalmente precis&#243; que una vez recabe mayor informaci&#243;n sobre este caso, la remitir&#225; a los 
Relatores Especiales. En relaci&#243;n con las medidas tomadas para garantizar el derecho a la 
alimentaci&#243;n de las familias desalojadas, el Gobierno inform&#243; que el Gobierno est&#225; adelantando 
las gestiones pertinentes con la Entidad competente a fin de brindar informaci&#243;n completa sobre 
el particular. En este sentido, el Gobierno solicit&#243; una prorroga de treinta d&#237;as para contestar a 
esta pregunta.

tomadas para garantizar el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las familias desalojadas.

obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation sent a joint allegation letter to 
the Government of Ghana regarding information received on the potential impacts that the 
establishment of an open pit gold mine in Akyem within the Ajenua-Bepo Forest Reserve in the 
Birim North District of Ghana's Eastern Region may have on the enjoyment of economic, social 
and cultural rights of the affected communities. Reportedly, permits for such mine had already 
been issued to Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (NGGL), a branch of the US-based Newmont 
Mining Corporation, one of the biggest gold mining companies worldwide. In 2006, Newmont 
Mining Corporation&#8217;s application to exploit the Akyem site had reportedly been turned down by 
the Environmental Protection Agency, which had expressed concern about the serious impact 
that mine's rock dump waste could have on the biodiversity of the forest. Despite this, in early 
2009 the Ministry of Mines, Land and Forestry's reportedly granted a permit to the NGGL. 
According to information received, NGGL was planning to start operating soon. There had been 
a claim that, in addition to considerable environmental damage within the forest reserve and 
impact on the rich and rare biodiversity in the forest, the project could have severe impacts on 
the livelihood of an estimated 7,900 to 10,000 people. Firstly, up to 1,500 persons, most of them 
small-scale farmers may be evicted, and despite provisions for relocation and compensation 
existing in the Mineral and Mining Law and in the Constitution of Ghana, reportedly no plans 
had been developed either by the company or the authorities to do so in a fair and equitable 
manner. Reportedly, persons who had been evicted when NGGL carried out exploration and 
preliminary work in 2006 had not been relocated or compensated, as it had also allegedly 
happened at the other mining site exploited by NGGL, the Afaho mine.  
</p>
<p>17. According to information received, small scale farmers who would lose their land would 
not be provided with alternative land on which to resume their agricultural activities. It was also 
reported that NGGL's offer to farmers for their land would not compensate for the amount of 
money they were earning at the time from harvesting one acre of cocoa trees for one year. This 
would affect their ability to sustain themselves and their families would they lose their land. 
Moreover, by losing access to the forest reserve for hunting and fruit picking, the local 
communities would lose a significant part of their food supplies. There were also reports 
indicating that dust generated by the exploitation of the mine may affect the production of crops 
in the fringes of the reserve.  
</p>
<p>18. It was also alleged that the digging of pits and dams and their subsequent exploitation were 
expected to have severe impact on the access of the local population to water from rivers and 
streams which they use for drinking, domestic use, fishing and irrigation. It was reported that the 
exploration that had taken place in 2005 and 2006 had already led to significant modifications of 
the forest cover, leading to some streams drying up and others becoming inadequate for 
consumption by the population. Moreover, once the mine would start operating, risks of 
contaminating water and streams would be high. Reportedly, the risks of leakage of cyanide and 
other pollutants of the ore processing into the rivers posed health and safety concerns for the 
local population and could render rivers and streams as well as soils completely unusable.  
</p>
<p>19. Finally, it was alleged that the environmental impact assessment had not been carried out 
in conformity with international standards, and that local communities had not been adequately 
involved in the decision-making process affecting them. There were allegations that during 2008 
NGGL may have fraudulently enticed local village elders into acquiescing to the projects by 
paying them large amounts of money in the form of 'administrative costs'. This raised concerns </p>

over fairness and transparency of the negotiations that NGGL may have held with the concerned 
communities.  
</p>
<p>20. Apart from international standards the Special Rapporteurs also referred to the Law on 
Minerals and Mining whose section 74.1 (b) and (c) contains specific provisions on 
compensation for the loss of earnings or sustenance suffered by the owner or lawful occupier and 
for the loss income expected from the crops. Section 74.2 points out that the compensation 
should be prompt, fair and adequate.  
</p>
<p>The Special procedures also informed the Government that the alleged information contained 
within this allegation letter will also be communicated to the NGGL. The letter to NGGL is 
included in this report in the &#8220;Other Actors&#8221; section. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>21. On 14 August 2009, the Government of Ghana sent a reply regarding the above-mentioned 
letter. The Government noted that the Environmental Protection Agency had requested NGGL to 
modify the size of the proposed pit and its attendant waste rock dumps in view of environmental 
and public safety concerns. It considered that the Environmental Impact Assessment submitted 
by NGGL had complied with requirements concerning the scoping process, the holding 
consultations with the affected population, the data analysis, the identification of mitigation 
actions, the preparation of a Land Rehabilitation Plan, and evaluation the harmlessness to water 
quality. In response to the question of what measures had been taken to ensure that the open 
mine project did not have disproportionate negative impacts on the environment and on the 
livelihoods of neighbouring communities, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that 
NGGL had been required to submit an Environmental Impact Statement and that this document 
was evaluated by Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the Environmental Guidelines 
for Mining in Production Forest Reserves. Under recommendations from the Environmental 
Protection Agency, NGGL had agreed to make certain modifications on its planned facilities. In 
addition, NGGL had committed itself towards the people affected by the project who were 
promised additional land but for those who wished to pursue alternative livelihoods, it had 
undertaken to fund training opportunities and business inputs, and to provide necessary benefits 
to women for the loss of agricultural land. The Government also indicated which measures had 
been taken in order to ensure that water resources would be protected from risks of leakages and 
that mining wastes would be disposed appropriately. It also explained how the concerned 
communities had had opportunity to participate in the planning to open the mine through mining 
community engagements. For instance at least three public forums were organized during which, 
inter alia, Environmental Impact Statement was evaluated.  
</p>
<p>22. In response to the question the procedure for compensation for the lost lands, the 
Government stated that affected persons/households/communities had been considered eligible 
for resettlement assistance if they had immovable assets in the proposed mining area. NGGL had 
proposed a broad range of appropriate and fair compensation and assistance for eligible 
recipients. The compensation terms and conditions had been negotiated with and agreed to by the 
Compensation Negotiation Committee which comprises of company, government and 
community representatives.  </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1

</p><p> 
23. NGGL was required to prepare and submit Resettlement Action Plan for approval. This 
plan would contain the specific commitments, procedures and actions which would be taken to 
resettle and compensate people, households and communities impacted by the project in 
compliance with Ghanaian law.  
</p>
<p>24. An estimated 242 households and 25 businesses within the proposed mining area would be 
physically displaced by the project. All people affected by the project would be eligible for 
compensation for the loss of crops, buildings and income. NGGL had undertaken to ensure that 
activities related to resettlement and compensation would be executed in accordance with the 
Minerals and Mining Law. The company had also undertaken to take measures with respect to 
the right to health.

<p>25. El 22 de enero de 2009, el Relator Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre las 
ejecuciones extrajudiciales, sumarias o arbitrarias envi&#243; una acci&#243;n urgente en relaci&#243;n con la 
muerte del Sr. Guillermo Norales Herrera en hechos ocurridos en frente al &#225;rea protegida de 
Vida Silvestre, Cuero y Salado, en Cayos Cochinos. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida: el 24 de 
septiembre de 2008, aproximadamente a las 9h30 de la noche, un grupo de 8 pescadores de la 
comunidad Gar&#237;funa de Triunfo de la Cruz fueron requeridos por miembros de la Fuerza Naval 
de Honduras, a cargo de la vigilancia del refugio de Vida Silvestre Cuero y Salado, mientras 
estaban faenando frente al &#225;rea protegida. Los militares se acercaron a la lancha de los 
pescadores, que ten&#237;a el motor apagado, controlaron su equipaje e interrogaron a los pescadores 
antes de ordenarles que les siguieran. Cuando uno de los pescadores, el Sr. Guillermo Norales 
Herrera, se dispuso a encender el motor de la lancha, los militares empezaron a disparar. Seg&#250;n 
los testimonios de los pescadores, hubo entre 20 y 25 disparos, uno de los cuales alcanz&#243; al Sr. 
Norales Herrera, quien falleci&#243; de manera inmediata. Los pescadores les pidieron ayuda pero los 
militares se retiraron, sin ofrecerles asistencia. El grupo de pescadores se qued&#243; a la deriva, 
puesto que uno de los proyectiles hab&#237;a alcanzado el motor y lo hab&#237;a estropeado. A pesar de que 
llamaron desde alta mar por celular a la polic&#237;a, no recibieron asistencia. Llegaron remando hasta 
la orilla de las playas de Triunfo de la Cruz, donde fueron remolcados por miembros de su 
comunidad. Los Relatores Especiales expresaron preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que la muerte del 
Sr. Norales Herrera pueda ser el resultado de un uso excesivo de la fuerza militar. Seg&#250;n la 
informaci&#243;n recibida, la muerte del Sr. Herrera y otros hechos violentos ocurridos en Cayos 
Cochinos podr&#237;an formar parte de una din&#225;mica m&#225;s amplia que habr&#237;a surgido como 
consecuencia de la aplicaci&#243;n de los planes de manejo para esta zona y que habr&#237;a contribuido a 
generar inseguridad f&#237;sica y alimentaria. Aunque la creaci&#243;n de &#225;reas protegidas en la zona de 
Cayos Cochinos responda a necesidades medio ambientales importantes, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n 
recibida esto habr&#237;a contribuido a generar tensiones sobre el manejo de los recursos naturales que 
son vitales para el acceso a una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada y suficiente de las comunidades locales. 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, el plan de manejo del &#225;rea marina protegida de Cayos Cochinos 
comprende una serie de regulaciones que disciplinan la extracci&#243;n de recursos naturales y que 
limitan la pesca, aunque sea para el sustento de la familia. Estas limitaciones habr&#237;an afectado en 
particular a dos comunidades Garifunas de la isla de Chachahuate y de la isla Oriental. La zona 
de Cayos Cochinos, como toda la costa norte del pa&#237;s, habr&#237;a adem&#225;s padecido a manos de la 
flota pesquera industrial un saqueo sistem&#225;tico de los recursos ictiol&#243;gicos, afectando el acceso </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 12 
 
de los pescadores artesanales, en su mayor&#237;a garifunas, a una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada y suficiente, 
basada principalmente en los frutos de la pesca. Estos pescadores habr&#237;an visto diminuir sus 
capturas teniendo que viajar a mayores distancias de sus comunidades para lograr el sustento de 
sus familias. Adem&#225;s el acceso a los recursos naturales de estas comunidades est&#225; vinculado con 
el r&#233;gimen que disciplina el acceso a la tierra. A este respecto, parece que estas comunidades 
Garifunas no poseen todav&#237;a t&#237;tulos de propiedad de la tierra y que estos asentamientos contin&#250;an 
siendo considerados temporales. Este problema convierte a las comunidades en vulnerables ante 
las demandas de tierra que vienen de empresarios o consorcios de empresarios que se apropian 
de esta tierra con fines lucrativos. La falta de t&#237;tulos de propiedad de la tierra es un elemento que, 
parece, ha caracterizado una discriminaci&#243;n contra las comunidades Garifunas en todo el pa&#237;s. 
Por ejemplo, las comunidades se establecieron en Chachahuate y en la isla oriental porque, tras 
haber perdido su tierra, no habr&#237;a podido encontrar otro trabajo en la parte continental del pa&#237;s. 
Cayos Cochinos habr&#237;a adem&#225;s experimentado un aumento importante del turismo y en 
particular del turismo cient&#237;fico y aunque las comunidades Garifunas parecen ser favorables a la 
diversificaci&#243;n de las fuentes de sustento y de ingresos, seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida ellos no 
har&#237;an gozado todav&#237;a de los beneficios que esta actividad deber&#237;a aportar, como por ejemplo la 
creaci&#243;n de nuevos puestos de trabajo y nuevas fuentes de sustento.  
</p>
<p>26. El 16 de octubre de 2009, el Relator Especial sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n envi&#243; una 
acci&#243;n urgente en relaci&#243;n con el supuesto desalojo y detenci&#243;n de integrantes de organizaciones 
campesinas que hab&#237;an estado ocupando las instalaciones del Instituto Nacional Agrario. Seg&#250;n 
la informaci&#243;n recibida, el 30 de septiembre de 2009, alrededor de las 6:00 de la ma&#241;ana, 
miembros de la polic&#237;a y del ej&#233;rcito habr&#237;an ocupado las instalaciones del Instituto Nacional 
Agrario (INA) en Tegucigalpa. Como resultado del operativo de desalojo, supuestamente 
ejecutado en funci&#243;n del Decreto Ejecutivo PCM-M-016-2009 del 26 de septiembre de 2006, 55 
personas habr&#237;an sido detenidas y puestas a disposici&#243;n de la Polic&#237;a Nacional. Durante el 
desalojo, los efectivos militares habr&#237;an agredido f&#237;sicamente a algunos de los detenidos. El 5 de 
octubre de 2009, tras una audiencia inicial frente a la juez de los Tribunales Unificados de 
Francisco Moraz&#225;n, Laura Casco, 38 campesinos fueron remitidos a la Penitenciar&#237;a Nacional, 
mientras que a otros 11 se les habr&#237;an dictado medidas cautelares; al resto se les habr&#237;a liberado 
por falta de elementos. El 7 de octubre de 2009, autoridades del Juzgado Unificado de lo Penal 
habr&#237;an otorgado libertad provisional bajo medidas sustitutivas a los 49 campesinos, aunque los 
autos de procesamiento en su contra aparentemente continuaban abiertos por el delito de 
sedici&#243;n. La defensa de los detenidos supuestamente sostendr&#237;a que los acusados no podr&#237;an ser 
susceptibles de pena por el delito de sedici&#243;n por no haber opuesto resistencia a las acciones de 
la autoridad, en funci&#243;n del Art&#237;culo 399 del C&#243;digo Penal de Honduras. Se alega que las 
personas procesadas son integrantes de organizaciones campesinas que hab&#237;an ocupado las 
instalaciones del INA durante 90 d&#237;as con el objetivo de resguardar la documentaci&#243;n archivada 
en la instituci&#243;n. En particular, las organizaciones campesinas habr&#237;an expresado su 
preocupaci&#243;n por los expedientes pendientes de resoluci&#243;n final bajo lo establecido por el 
Decreto No. 18-2008. El Decreto 18-2008 sobre la &#8220;mora agraria&#8221; fue emitido por el Congreso 
Nacional, a solicitud del Gobierno de la Rep&#250;blica, con el objetivo de solucionar la situaci&#243;n 
legal de la propiedad de tierras ocupadas por campesinos durante d&#233;cadas, y formar&#237;a parte de 
una reforma agraria m&#225;s amplia contemplada por la Constituci&#243;n de la Rep&#250;blica en su T&#237;tulo 
VI, Cap&#237;tulo III. En sus considerandos, el Decreto en cuesti&#243;n invoca la intenci&#243;n de garantizar 
la seguridad y soberan&#237;a alimentaria. En su Art&#237;culo 1, el Decreto 18-2008 estipula que el 
inventario oficial de los expedientes elegibles ser&#237;a elaborado por una Comisi&#243;n Especial </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
  page 13 
 
presidida por el INA con la participaci&#243;n, entre otras, de organizaciones y centrales campesinas. 
El art&#237;culo 3 establece que las tierras en manos de campesinos y contenidas en expedientes sin 
resoluci&#243;n definitiva ser&#225;n afectadas para fines de reforma agraria, como un mecanismo para 
eliminar la mora agraria. Asimismo, el Art&#237;culo 4 declara dichas tierras expropiadas o 
recuperadas de pleno derecho, por causa de inter&#233;s social, previo pago de una indemnizaci&#243;n 
justipreciada mediante bonos de la deuda agraria. Por su parte, el Art&#237;culo 17 establece que todas 
las tierras en manos de campesinos, donde han vivido y trabajado ininterrumpidamente por m&#225;s 
de 10 a&#241;os y no tienen expediente en el Instituto Nacional Agrario (INA), deber&#225;n ser tituladas 
previa investigaci&#243;n del INA. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, la implementaci&#243;n del decreto 
habr&#237;a sido suspendida el 28 de junio de 2009. Se alega que tras el desalojo del INA, efectivos 
del ej&#233;rcito habr&#237;an sustra&#237;do documentos de la instituci&#243;n, llev&#225;ndoselos en autos particulares 
sin placas a un sitio desconocido. Entre los documentos m&#225;s sensibles del INA se encontraban 
cientos de expedientes de la mora agraria que est&#225;n en v&#237;a de resoluci&#243;n final. En tal sentido, se 
teme que la ocupaci&#243;n militar del INA y la sustracci&#243;n de los documentos obstaculicen la labor 
del INA por la resoluci&#243;n de los conflictos agrarios.  
</p>
<p><b>Observaciones 
</b></p>
<p>27. El Relator Especial lamenta que en el momento de realizarse este informe no haya recibido 
ninguna respuesta del Gobierno a sus comunicaciones de fecha 22 de enero de 2009 y 16 de 
octubre de 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>India 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>28. On 16 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
of India concerning allegations of failure by authorities to implement the Integrated Child 
Development Scheme (ICDS) and other social services such as the Below Poverty Line (BPL) 
and Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) food distribution systems, especially in relation to cases of 
severe malnutrition of children in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. According to 
the information received, 46 per cent of children under the age of three in India are 
undernourished, yet efforts made to reduce malnutrition and its consequences have had limited 
results. Although ICDS is a long standing programme, it appears from the information gathered 
that it faces a number of serious challenges that prevent it from reaching the most vulnerable 
children.  
</p>
<p>29. Firstly, it has been reported that the system of angawandi centres (AWC), which are in 
charge of implementing the ICDS, often functions poorly. The absence of such centres in rural 
areas as well as in some poor urban communities is said to lead to very low coverage of children. 
Estimates that only about 30 per cent of children are registered in the ICDS are particularly 
worrying in a context where the Supreme Court of India ordered, in its ruling on ICDS of 2006 &#8211; 
in addition to the previous ruling of 2001 and 2004 - that the scheme be universalized and that 
priority should be given to opening AWCs or mini-AWCs in remote areas. There were reports 
that AWCs are often poorly equipped, not sufficiently staffed, and that there are substantial </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 14 
 
shortcomings in their functioning. For example, it was alleged that in AWCs in Madhya Pradesh 
no records of children's registration, weight and health conditions are kept, which prevents 
adequate follow up of their condition. Also in the State of Madhya Pradesh, AWCs reportedly 
function with only one staff member and thus cannot deal with both health checks and food 
distribution.  
</p>
<p>30. There were also reports indicating that the registration of pregnant and lactating mothers 
and adolescent girls in AWCs is subjected to quotas in some areas, whereas the Supreme Court 
also ruled for their universal access to feeding programmes delivered in the centres. Failing to 
ensure that pregnant girls and lactating women have access to food in adequate quantity and 
quality risks undermining efforts to combat malnutrition amongst children because the health 
and development of unborn babies and children under two years old depend on their mother's 
nutritional status.  
</p>
<p>31. It was also alleged that children of scheduled castes and tribes often receive less nutrition 
supplements and immunization than children from other parts of society visiting AWCs. 
Reportedly, such children are sometimes excluded from the ICDS programme as well as from 
other child development services, which suggests discriminatory practices by staff of AWCs and 
other health and nutrition centres.  
</p>
<p>32. Secondly, there were allegations that public food distribution systems are dysfunctional. 
This concerns particularly the availability of food for families registered for the Below Poverty 
Line (BPL) and Antodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) ration cards. For example, it was reported that 
families are not able to receive their monthly allowance of 35kg in full, due to severe shortages 
in accredited shops. It also appears that these shops are often closed, sometimes to the point of 
opening only one day a month, which severely hinders families' access to food.   
</p>
<p>33. In addition to referring to relevant international standards the Special Rapporteur noted the 
possible adoption of National Food Security Act which was discussed in India at the moment of 
submission of the allegation letter. The adoption of such an Act can contribute greatly to the 
national implementation of the right to food, if it duly specifies the legal and institutional 
framework, identifies rights and obligations as well as spells out the roles of institutions in the 
realization of the right to food. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
identified the adoption of framework legislation as an element of implementation of the right to 
food. 
</p>
<p><b>Communications received 
</b></p>
<p>34. On 29 July 2009, the Government of India replied by two letters to a communication 
transmitted by the Special Rapporteur on 23 May 2007 and concerning the situation related to 
the proposed construction of the Tipaimukh Dam in Manipur State, as well as reports that the 
Dalits who were evicted in 1993 from the Ambedkar Nagar village, (district of Kashipur, 
Uttarkhand) despite reportedly being recognized as rightful owners of the land by the ruling of 
the Supreme Court, face difficulties to repossess their land.  
</p>
<p>35. In the first letter the Government of India indicated that it had examined the 
communication and found the concerns pertaining to Tipaimukh Dam to be an incomplete and 
misleading picture of the actual project. The letter explained that the construction of the dam </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
would lead to submerge 12 villages in Manipur (affecting 313 households with 2027 people) 
only. No village in Mizoram would be fully submerged. There are 4,716 owners (4,376 in 
Manipur and 340 in Mizoram) whose landed properties alone would be affected. The 
Government also informed that the project has been planned after required consultations with 
affected people and with appropriate compensation, physical rehabilitation and economic 
rehabilitation schemes, keeping in mind the socio-cultural practices of the affected people. 
Aimed at generation of hydel power and food relief that would help, and are crucial to, local 
development, the project has been undertaken only after extensive surveys and investigations, 
including environmental impact assessment, and is reviewed regularly for any improvisations 
that may be necessary.  
</p>
<p>36. In its second letter, the Government of India informed the Special Rapporteur that it had 
examined the content of the allegations about forced evictions in Ambedkar Nagar village 
Kashipur, Uttarakhand and that it found them inaccurate. The Government denied the existence 
of the order by the High Court or Supreme Court mentioned in the communication. Accordingly, 
the families were served a legal notice for attempting to occupy the land illegally. 
</p>
<p>37. On 26 June 2009, the Government of India sent a reply to a communication sent jointly by 
the Special Rapporteur on 19 July 2007 with the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living and the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people concerning the alleged 
threat of eviction of Adivasi families in the state of Chhattisgarh. The Government stated that the 
allegations on the right to food presented by the Special Rapporteur were inaccurate. The 
Government and Tata Steel had signed a Memorandum of Understanding for setting up a steel 
plant in Chhattisgarh, the Chhattisgarh State Industrial and Development Corporation was to 
acquire only 3.588 acres of private land in Lohandiguda block, as against the claim of 53.000 
acres stated in the communication submitted by the Special Rapporteurs. Less than 26 per cent of 
private land was to be acquired, causing minimal displacement of only 101 houses. The 
Government further stated that before initiating land acquisition proceedings, the state authorities 
had held several rounds of consultations with the affected villagers, as required by law and that 
the villagers&#8217; suggestions concerning the compensations were taken into account. The 
Government further stated that since there were no share-croppers in the area where the steel 
plant had been proposed to be set up, it had not been necessary to make any provision for 
compensation to share-croppers. Finally, the Government informed the Special Rapporteurs that 
the land acquisition notification of 23 February 2007 was in accordance with the 1984 Land 
Acquisition Act, which does not have any provision for giving 30 days prior notice.  
</p>
<p>38. On 11 December 2009, the Government of India sent a reply to a communication sent by 
the Special Rapporteur on 3 December 2008 concerning the allegations received on the 
challenges and obstacles that the internally displaced communities from Dantewada and Bijapur 
districts in Southern Chattisgarh have faced in the exercise of their right to food. The 
Government noted that in Dantewada and Bijapur districts in Southern Chattisgarh, about 50.929 
people were living in 23 camps as of September 2009 (35.668 people in nine camps in 
Dantewada and 15-261 in 14 camps in Bijapur). In the camps of Dantewada 34.733 inhabitants 
were being provided free ration and the remaining 935 were being provided subsidised rations 
under the government public distribution system. Furthermore, according to the Government, no 
family was being asked to produce proof of identification and ration cards had been distributed 
to 3.713 families of the total of 7.167 families residing in the nine camps. Similarly in Bijapur, </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 16 
 
3.966 families had been provided a below-poverty-line card under which they could buy rice at 
the price of Rs 2 per kg while another 2.104 families had been issued antyodaya card under 
which they could buy rice at a price of Rs 1 per kg. With regards to employment, the 
Government noted, 5.857 families had been registered and issued job cards under NREGA in 
Dantewada camps. A total of 12.137 labourers were engaged in various works executed under 
NREGA in the nine camps. In addition, the Government was providing support in the form of 
free cultivable land on community holding basis, tractors, trolleys, and distribution of 
agricultural implements, hybrid seeds and quality fertilizers. Vocational training such as bamboo 
crafts, handloom weaving, bell-metal craft and terracotta works was also being given. The local 
government was also in the process of finalizing the distribution of lease of forest plots in 
conformity with the Forest Dwellers Rights to Land Act. Similarly, in Bijapur, all families living 
in the camps had been offered employment under NREGA and 5.369 people provided job cards. 
In addition, the government was facilitating recruitment and skills training like carpentry, 
masonry and electrical works repair in 19 training centres. In both Dantewada and Bijapur, the 
government had also provided for adequate security, apart from water supply, sanitation, 
electricity, play schools and health care.  
</p>
<p><b>Observations 
</b></p>
<p>39. The Special Rapporteur regrets that at the time of the finalization of this report, the 
Government had not transmitted any reply to his communication dated 16 November 2009. 
</p>
<p><b>Indonesia  
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>40. On 14 August 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right 
to non-discrimination in this context, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Independent 
Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and 
sanitation and the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment on human rights sent a join allegation 
letter to the Government of Indonesia regarding the potential impacts that gold and copper 
mining activities in Lembata, East Nusa Tenggara, Indonesia, may have on the enjoyment of the 
right human rights of Lembata communities.  
</p>
<p>41. According to the information received, in 2005 the Indonesian mining company PT 
Merukh Lembata Copper has been permitted by the local government to carry out exploration 
activities for gold and copper on Lembata. The company reportedly holds exploration rights for 
at least two thirds of the island, and three companies &#8211; identified as KPG Kupferprodukte 
GmbH, Norddeutsche Affinerie AG and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG &#8211; are said to be 
involved in financing the project. It was also reported that the Chinese Yunnan copper Group 
Limited entered in the joint venture partnership with PT Merukh Lembata Copper. Following the 
results of the above-mentioned explorations, the exploitation stage is reportedly scheduled to 
start in 2011.  </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
  page 17 
</p><p> 
42. Allegedly, this planned mining project would concern 7 of the 8 sub-regencies in Lembata, 
possibly as much as 75 per cent of the entire island, and would result in the forced eviction of at 
least 60,000 local people. Most of them are members of Lamaholot and Kedang communities 
and would be forced to relocate on other islands in order to give way for the mining. Apart from 
a proposal submitted by the mining company to move the affected communities to other 
locations, the local government reportedly has not shared any information concerning a possible 
relocation plan. It is further reported that considering that those communities&#8217; livelihood rely on 
agriculture, animal husbandry and fishing, their eviction and their relocation on other people&#8217;s 
land would cause conflicts among communities and increase impoverishment and 
unemployment. This situation would severely threaten people&#8217;s food security, in a region that is 
reported to be already food scarce as a result of the dry climate and very poor infrastructures that 
lead people to rely mostly on subsistence farming and fishing. There are therefore risks that the 
population may not be in a position to have access to or produce sufficient food to ensure an 
adequate standard of living; for example, it is feared that existing cashew nut plantations would 
be destroyed and those living from their yield would lose their means of subsistence. 
</p>
<p>43. It was also reported that the agreement between the local Regent and PT Merukh Lembata 
Copper was signed without any discussion or consultation with the concerned communities. The 
same information states that when local people found out about the mining agreement, they 
reacted with strong protests but that the local government has been refusing to hear their 
complaints. In order to gain people&#8217;s agreement after contract signing, the Regent of Lambata 
reportedly resorted to ambiguous means, including attempts to bribe influential local leaders, 
manipulation of opinion by grossly exaggerating the actual richness of the island's soil and the 
potential yield of the mine, and intimidation and threats against people, including traditional 
leaders, who expressed their opposition to the project.  
</p>
<p>44. According to information received, previous mining exploration activities linked to other 
mining projects have already had negative impact on the enjoyment of Lembata local people's 
human rights. For example, it has been stated that mining companies employed local farmers and 
fishermen as manual labourers, with no contract and very low wages. It has also been reported 
that occupational health and safety standards were neglected, as for instance the explosive used 
created excessive dust levels that resulted in breathing problems of labourers. In addition to that, 
the information received mentions that tailings and waste from the mining activities were 
released in water sources, thereby increasing sulfur rates to harmful levels. After cessation of 
activities, most of the mine holes were reportedly left uncovered, without any rehabilitation 
programs, which may lead to negative impacts on local people&#8217;s water and food resources. Such 
elements seem to set a very worrying precedent that justifies concern about the ongoing activities 
and the foreseen exploitation project.

international standards, and that local communities have not been adequately involved in the

in conformity with national regulations. It is also reported that that geological properties of the

</b></p>
<p>47. On 17 July 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on the issue 
of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, following-up 
on a previous communication of 6 March 2008 which has remained unanswered, sent a joint 
allegation letter to the Government of Iraq regarding the alleged blockages of food destined to 
the inhabitants of Camp Ashraf. According to the information received, over the previous two 
weeks, Iraqi army personnel had prohibited the entry into the camp of at least 13 trucks carrying 
food items such as flour, dried fruits and cereals. It was also reported that two trucks carrying 
fuel had not been allowed to enter the camp during the same period, as it has reportedly 
happened for truckloads of seeds over the past six months. It was alleged that the reason given 
each time was that drivers lacked proper documentation, while at the same time it was reported 
that these persons had been allowed in the camp with their loads on previous occasions. It was 
alleged that food stocks had decreased to alarming levels and that camp&#8217;s inhabitants risk facing 
food shortages. The Iraqi army and police personnel reportedly have prevented inhabitants of 
Ashraf and Iraqi water technicians from accessing the pump that supplies water to the camp. 
Residents of Ashraf were allegedly able to use the water pumping station, located 30 km away, 
which was damaged during the explosion in May 2008, until recently. The station appears to 
have completely stopped operating and it was alleged that residents have been prevented from 
accessing the station in order to replace the transformer. It was also alleged that the Iraqi army 
did not authorize the transport of spare parts for water and electricity systems, despite the fact 
that the directors of the Diyala water and electricity authority had allegedly agreed that 
representatives of this authority would assess and authorize Ashraf&#8217;s needs for water and 
electricity items. According to the information received Iraqi army commanders had lately 
prevented this work from being completed and obstructed the entry of items previously 
authorized to the camp. This had allegedly hampered the proper functioning of the pump and low 
quantities of water have reached the camp. If not repaired shortly the pump, access to water for 
the residents would be seriously jeopardized. The restrictions imposed on the entry of parts that 
have been used to make trailers in workshops inside the camp had reportedly affected the ability 
of the residents to earn a living that enabled Ashraf residents to buy food on the market. In 
addition it was reported that visits of family members living outside the camp had been reduced 
thereby cutting off the residents from a significant portion of remittances allowing them to 
purchase food in the market.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>49. On 24 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories 
occupied since 1967, sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of Israel regarding the 
closure of all commercial crossing points between the Gaza Strip and Israel and the obstacles to 
the delivery of humanitarian assistance in the territory since 5 November 2008. These measures 
had allegedly resulted in shortages of food, medicines and fuel and they threatened to have 
serious effects on the food security situation of the 1.4 million Palestinians who live in the Gaza 
Strip. According to the information received by the Special Rapporteurs, on 17 November 2008, 
the Erez border crossing had briefly reopened to allow a convoy of 33 truckloads carrying 
humanitarian aid and medical supplies to enter the Gaza Strip. However, this had been the first 
time for the passage to be authorized in two weeks. Reportedly, on 26 November and 4 
December 2008 crossings had reopened again to allow in a limited amount of food assistance 
and fuel supplies. However, it had appeared that these supplies, which had been brought in 
during these re-openings, had not been sufficient to alleviate the shortages of basic essential 
items such as fuel, fresh food, meat and fruits, and that they were insufficient to build reserves 
for meeting daily the basic food needs of the 1.4 million Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip. 
Despite these re-openings, it had been estimated that the level of imports had remained well 
below the level of last year. The unpredictability of humanitarian assistance and delivery has also 
affected the organization and conduct of assistance programmes, thus contributing to undermine 
the food security situation of beneficiaries. It was alleged that eighty per cent of the Palestians in 
the Gaza Strip are living under the official poverty line and depend on humanitarian assistance, 
including food aid. Restrictions of the entry of supplies which were essential for the production 
of food, such as fuel, fertilizers, plastics and seeds, had been alleged to have undermined the 
ability of the population to produce part of its own food. The Special Rapporteurs had also 
informed that food prices had continued to increase due to limited stocks, so levels were beyond 
the purchasing power of the large part of the population that did not have the ability to generate 
income allegedly as a result of the restrictions imposed since 2006. It was also reported that the 
global rises in food prices over the previous 12 months and reduced domestic agricultural 
production due to adverse weather conditions that had exacerbated the already precarious food 
security situation of this population. It was deemed useful to recall that these territories were 
highly dependent on imports and that only 4 percent of dry staple food - including cereals and 
pulses - consumed there was produced locally. It was estimated that rates of food insecurity had 
risen from 34 percent in 2006 to 38 percent in 2008. This had particularly severe impacts on 
children, who were the first victims of malnutrition, and whose physical and mental development 
was severely affected by such shortages. According to the information received, the ongoing 
blockade had had the effect of decreasing the humanitarian assistance provided by the UN Relief 
and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) to the 830,000 refugees 
in the Gaza Strip. It was also alleged that food reserves in UNRWA distribution centres in Gaza 
had been gradually depleting and were in need of essential supplies such as wheat, powdered 
milk and oil, in order to guarantee the food security of its beneficiaries. Reportedly, on both 17 
and 24 November 2008, the UNRWA were also allowed to bring into Gaza eight trucks of 
humanitarian aid each day, after having been unable to do so since 5 November 2008. It 
appeared that the agency needed a minimum of 15 trucks per day to sustain normal humanitarian </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 20 
 
operations in the territory. Reportedly, on 18 December 2008, UNRWA had suspended its 
emergency and regular food distribution programmes in the Gaza Strip until further notice. 
According to reports, the suspension had been due to the depletion of the agency&#8217;s stocks of 
wheat flours which was a result of the ongoing crisis and limited border crossing access for 
humanitarian assistance. Furthermore, the reports received also indicated that the supply of 
industrial fuel, which had been donated by the European Union and was needed to power Gaza's 
power plant, had been blocked. Reports indicated that the Nahal Oz fuel pipeline, which was the 
only line to import fuel into the Gaza Strip, had remained closed since 5 November 2008 except 
on two days, 11 and 12 November 2008, in which it had been partially reopened in order to 
allow the inflow of approximately less than 230,000 litres to the Gaza power plant's industrial 
gas. Reports also indicated that on 24 November 2008, 440,000 litres of industrial gas had been 
pumped through to Gaza&#8217;s power plant. According to these reports, between 1 and 17 November 
2008, the Gaza power plant had received a total of 1,345,430 litres or (24 percent) of the 
5,700,000 litres it should have received under normal circumstances over a period of 16 days. It 
was alleged that due to lack of fuel, Gaza's power plant had been forced to shut down completely 
on 9 and 10 November and since 13 November it had required rolling blackouts of up to eight 
hours per day in most areas of Gaza. The information received indicated that the Gaza Electricity 
Distribution Company had set a daily power cut schedule whereby each household in Gaza City 
and in the middle area of the Gaza Strip had no power for 16 hours per day, 8-12 hours/day in 
northern Gaza, 4-8 hours/day in Khan Younis and 2-4 hours/day in Rafah. In particular the 
blockade on fuel deliveries and the reduction of electricity supply had disrupted water and 
sewage services which were dependant on electricity to operate. The information received 
alleged that 15 percent of Gaza&#8217;s population, around 225,000 people, had not been receiving an 
adequate amount of drinking water due to lack of fuel. There had also been a severe shortage of 
cooking gas in the Gaza Strip and more than 30 pita-bread bakeries out of the existing 47 were 
no longer operational. As a result, the bread rationing scheme remained allegedly in effect. It 
was also reported that the closure of bakeries had affected UNRWA&#8217;s school feeding 
programmes that had been targeting around 200,000 school children. In addition it appeared that 
chicken farms had been particularly affected by the shortage of cooking oil which together with 
the lack of animal feed had led hatchery owners to destroy their animals, thus losing sources of 
livelihood to feed themselves and their families. Finally, it was also reported that access to 
quality health care was deteriorating due to closure of hospitals and lack of medicine supply. In 
addition, shortage of fuel and electricity materials reportedly had affected essential maintenance 
and rehabilitation of health infrastructure, and particularly hit maternal and neo natal units. It 
was also reported that even though the number of patients referred to treatments outside Gaza 
had increased, access to such care remains constrained. It was estimated that only 66 per cent of 
requests for medical permits had been approved from January-August 2008, compared with 80 
per cent during the corresponding period in 2007.

<p><b>Follow-up communication  
</b></p>
<p>52. On 30 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar sent a joint allegation letter to the Government of 
Myanmar following-up on the previous communications dated 17 July 2006 and 28 February 
2008 and seeking to bring to the Government&#8217;s attention the precarious food security situations 
in North Rakhine State, particularly among the Muslim communities. The Special Rapporteurs 
continued to receive information concerning violations of the right to food of people living in the 
two Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships &#8211; approximately 760,000 people in total &#8211; as a result 
of a number of factors. According to this information, the living conditions and humanitarian 
situation of the Muslim population of North Rakhine had been severely affected by constant 
restrictions and discrimination. For example, travel restrictions applying to them as a result of 
citizenship denial prevented individuals from trading and finding work in neighbouring villages 
or regions. Arbitrary and unpredictable taxes were also reported to make it impossible for many 
households to build food stocks, thus exacerbating food insecurity. According to the reports 
received, the economic system that prevailed in North Rakhine relies on the allocation of 
exclusive licenses to economic actors to whom any individuals wishing to carry out an activity in 
the concerned sector should first pay a tax. This appeared to operate as a disincentive for new 
opportunities for creating livelihoods and increasing access and availability of food. The reports 
received indicated that 68 per cent of the Muslim population of North Rakhine had no access to 
land while the national average for people without land is 40 per cent. This had allegedly 
resulted from a governmental decree adopted in April 1997 to prohibit Buddhist Rakhine owners 
from renting their land to the Muslim population. This landless population was particularly 
vulnerable to food insecurity as its sources of income were precarious and depend on 
individuals&#8217; abilities to find daily labouring jobs. According to the information received, land 
confiscation was a routine matter in North Rakhine, Muslim households being dispossessed to 
settle non-Muslim ones from other regions in the area. Information received also mentioned that 
the construction or extension of military camps had led to land confiscation. This reportedly 
happened without prior notice or compensation. Furthermore, the army appeared to be using land 
as a source of profit, re-letting confiscated lands and imposing rents and taxes on its produce. 
The information received further mentioned that forced labour continued to be imposed on the 
Muslim communities of North Rakhine, thus preventing individuals from accessing employment 
opportunities. The Special Rapporteurs also reminded the Government of elements contained in 
the last communications from the former Special Rapporteur on the right to food and on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar. These included information referring to villagers being 
requisitioned with no prior warning to accomplish physically demanding and unpaid work such 
as rubber plantation, paddy cultivation in the military and NaSaKa (the security forces along the 
border with Bangladesh) fields, brick baking, construction of roads, bridges, model villages and </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1

military facilities, the transportation of compulsory crop procurement beside sentry duty, daily 
camp maintenance and portering. Reports mentioned children as young as 12 years old being 
recruited and refusal to take part resulting in either a financial penalty, or in kind, including 
imprisonment. Reportedly, villagers who had the means to do so are given the opportunity to pay 
to be exempted. That resulted in those who could not afford to pay the required sum of money 
being requisitioned more often. Besides, the sums required for being exempted were reportedly 
equivalent to what a daily labourer earned in one day, thus perpetuating families&#8217; 
impoverishment while the poorest families were hit hardest. There had been reports indicating 
that forced labour had increased since November 2008, as villagers complained that they wee 
recruited for forced labour 2 days and 1 night per week as opposed to 1 day and 1 night during 
the previous dry season. According to the information received, forced labour increased again in 
March 2009 in relation with Government&#8217;s decision to launch a construction project aimed at 
erecting a fence along the border with Bangladesh, i.e. along the Naf River. In addition to new 
exactions of compulsory labour, this project reportedly involved the confiscation of boats from 
Muslim fishermen as well as the destruction of many shrimp farms along the river. According to 
the information received, the factors described above all contributed to a situation of chronic 
food insecurity for the Muslim population of North Rakhine. Reports received mentioned that 
only 13 per cent of households were able to meet their food needs for the entire year, while the 
levels of chronic and acute malnutrition remain high throughout the year, and not only during 
traditional food shortage periods. The level of acute malnutrition reportedly reached 26 per cent 
in spite of humanitarian assistance provided by various actors such as NGOs and international 
organizations.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>53. On 21 August 2009, the Government of Myanmar sent a reply regarding the above 
mentioned communication. The Government stated that the information brought to its attention 
was misleading the internal political affairs of Myanmar by disseminating unfounded and 
unsubstantiated allegations on the discrimination of religions in the country since religious 
intolerance or discrimination on grounds of religion was non-existent in the Union of Myanmar. 
The Government also stated that in Myanmar, there was no restriction against or discrimination 
with regard to food, trading and seeking jobs based on religion, race or gender. Neither travel 
restriction nor arbitrary taxation applied to the Muslim population of Northern Rakhine State 
based on races or religious grounds. The Government further informed the Special Rapporteurs 
that child labour did not exist in Myanmar. In this regard the Government drew to the attention 
of the Special Rapporteurs the agreement for a Supplementary Understanding reached between 
Myanmar and the International Labour Organization (ILO). This Agreement would allow any 
citizen to file complaints to the ILO Liaison Officer. These complaints would then be forwarded 
to the Working Group for Prevention against Forced Labour under the Ministry of Labour. The 
Government stated that no complaint had yet been received by this Working Group. The 
Government also stated that Rakhine State produced sufficient quantity of rice and food and that 
there was therefore no need for the authorities concerned to carry out specific programme aimed 
to assure food availability and accessibility for the population. Finally, the Government informed 
the Special Rapporteurs that there was no law enacted in 1997 prohibiting the lease of land 
owned by the Buddhist Rakhine to the Muslim population, that there was no land confiscation in 
Northern Rakhine State and that the allegations on food insecurity were not true. </p>

</b></p>
<p>56. On 4 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental 
health, the Independent Expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation, and the Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the 
movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment on human 
rights sent a join allegation letter to the Government of Nigeria regarding the possible negative 
impacts that the petroleum industry in the Niger Delta may have had and would likely continue 
to have on the full enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights by the affected 
communities. It was alleged that both governmental and private sector activities of the petroleum 
industry in the Niger Delta had had widespread negative impacts on the environment. Over 60 
percent of the region&#8217;s population were said to depend on their natural surroundings for their 
livelihood and many viewed their cultural identity as being closely related to the ecosystem of 
the delta. Hence, the affected communities were particularly vulnerable to potential 
environmental pollution that the petroleum industry can engender. Pollution attributed both 
directly and indirectly to the petroleum industry included damage to fisheries, farmlands and 
crops, pollution of water bodies and the release of gas, oil and other pollutants into the air. This 
pollution was allegedly the result of oil spills, waste dumping, dredging and other 
environmentally harmful activities by the petroleum industry. For example, information received 
suggested that an oil spill occurred at Bodo Creek on 28 August 2008 following a failure by the 
responsible multinational company to repair or replace an evidently aged and ruptured pipeline. 
The consequent release of crude oil into Bodo Creek, over many weeks, had allegedly resulted in 
irreparable damage to food species and significantly weakened the mangroves in the region. 
More specifically, according to information received, the people of the Niger Delta suffered from 
a range of preventable health problems. Many people continued to rely on natural waterways for </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 24 
 
drinking water and also used these rivers and creeks for bathing and other domestic purposes. 
Community consultation reflected widespread concern about the health implications of 
contaminated waterways, yet systematic monitoring of water quality did not appear to take place. 
Companies supplied emergency water supplies to communities in the immediate aftermath of an 
oil spill. However, this supply were often delayed and only temporary, and reportedly did not 
reach affected communities beyond the immediate spill vicinity. Furthermore, according to 
information received, efforts by those actors at the source of the problem to clean up and 
remediate the land after an oil spill were often inadequate or even non-existent. Health problems 
reportedly experienced in relation to oil spills included skin rashes, breathing problems, nausea 
and headaches. Yet, corresponding medical data had hitherto not been collected. An additional 
health concern was posed by gas flares. These were said to create noise pollution, expose local 
communities to permanent light, produce black oil dust that settled on clothes, homes and food, 
and possibly result in acid rain. There were also concerns relating to the food safety and security 
of the population of the Niger Delta. Both soil and groundwater resources allegedly presented 
contents of heavy metals, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, manganese and nickel that are above 
the normal level. Heavy metals build up inside living organisms, and exposure to large amounts 
of these metals may lead to severe long-term effects, including cancer and damage to the 
nervous, digestive, reproductive, and respiratory systems. Therefore, they posed a significant 
health risk. Despite complaints by local residents of unpleasant odours and taste in fish, 
indicating contamination of this food source, no action appeared to have been taken by the oil 
industry to address the matter. Allegations of ecosystem changes following oil spills, such as a 
reported reduction in the shellfish population of the region, also did not appear to have been 
followed up on. The long term effects of a petroleum polluted environment included a reduction 
in the agricultural potential of farmland and fisheries. This was of particular concern in the Niger 
Delta as the population of this region is highly dependent upon the environment as a source of 
food and income. In addition, according to the information received, the current planning and 
operating methods of actors involved in the Niger Delta oil industry were of concern as they 
failed to sufficiently take into consideration the needs and desires of local communities. 
Petroleum-related infrastructure included the laying of pipes, construction of roads and the 
carrying out of seismic surveys. Current governmental licences and leases allegedly permited 
companies to complete such projects without consulting affected communities and without 
conducting extensive environmental impact assessments. Road construction without adequate 
bridges and drains, as had allegedly been the case for the Gbarain link built for SPDC in 1990, 
had reportedly resulted in deforestation. Where the natural flow of water was altered, damage to 
local fisheries was often also reported. In this process, communities were apparently not 
consulted. Furthermore, in most cases, the compensation to which they were entitled under both 
Nigerian and international law was said to either not be paid or to be insufficient. For instance, 
an oil spill in the village of Kira Tai in Ogoniland on 12 May 2007 had been attributed to a 
corroded section of pipeline and destroyed both crops and fish. A year after the incident, the 
affected community was reportedly still waiting for compensation, as well as adequate clean up 
measures. 
</p>
<p>57. After recalling international human rights law pertaining to the right to food, the Special 
Rapporteur quoted the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, according to which  
&quot;while only States are parties to the Covenant and are thus ultimately accountable for compliance 
with it, all members of society - individuals, families, local communities, non-governmental 
organizations, civil society organizations, as well as the private business sector - have </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
  page 25 
 
responsibilities in the realization of the right to adequate food. The State should provide an 
environment that facilitates implementation of these responsibilities. The private business sector 
&#8211; national and transnational - should pursue its activities within the framework of a code of 
conduct conducive to respect of the right to adequate food, agreed upon jointly with the 
Government and civil society.&#8221; In this respect the Special Rapporteur added that he will 
communicate this information to major multinational oil companies active in the Niger Delta. 
The abovementioned communication is included in this report in the &#8220;Other Actors&#8221; section.

<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>59. On 17 June 2009, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government of 
Philippines concerning information received about threats to the right to food of the communities 
living along the Ta&#241;on Strait in Central Philippines, due to off-shore oil and gas exploration 
activities in the area. Ta&#241;on Strait was a declared protected seascape by virtue of the 1998 
Presidential Proclamation No. 1234, for its rich diversity of cetaceans and other marine species. 
Reportedly, it had very rich fishing grounds and fishing is the primary source of livelihood of its 
inhabitants. According to the information received, there were a total of 26,850 fishermen 
operating in the area. A large number of coastal communities in the provinces of Cebu, Negros 
Occidental and Negros Oriental reportedly depended on fishing for access to food or means of its 
procurement. The Department of Energy had reportedly been contracting various foreign oil and 
gas exploration companies over the past few years, including the Japan Petroleum Exploration 
Co. Ltd. (JAPEX), the Australia-based NorAsia Energy Ltd, and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum 
Exploration Co. The Department of Energy had awarded a seven-year exploration contract to the 
JAPEX to explore for oil in the country. As a seismic study conducted in May 2005 had revealed 
that large amounts of oil &#8211; up to 1 billion barrels &#8211; and natural gas might lie beneath the seabed 
of the Ta&#241;on Strait, JAPEX had started to conduct drilling operations in the area in November 
</p><p>2007. The allegations received claimed that in October 2007, an international fact-finding 
mission composed of representatives from civil society had come to the conclusion that offshore 
oil and gas exploration and production were not compatible with the present uses, especially 
fishing, of the directly affected coastal area. According to these allegations local communities 
had not been consulted prior to exploration drilling. Fishermen had reportedly been banned from 
fishing in the 2.73 square zones while exploration activities were ongoing ignoring their right to 
access municipal waters. This had reportedly happened without receiving any prior information. 
According to the reports received, JAPEX and the Department of Energy had only recently 
started to conduct &#8220;information drives&#8221; in affected cities and municipalities, but these meetings 
seemed to have been attended by very few people as a result of lack of sufficient information 
provided and dialogue between the relevant authorities and local communities. In addition, the 
information received stated that seismic surveys as well as drilling had resulted in a reduction in 
fishing yields, due both to fish being killed as well as fish fleeing traditional fishing areas, due to 
activities that involved the firing of explosive charges in the sea. As a result, fish catch had 
reportedly declined by 50 to 70 percent; fishermen were able to catch only two to three kilos a </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 26 
 
day whereas they had used to produce between 10 and 15 kilos a day before the oil exploration 
started. The drastic reduction of fishing yields was attributed to the destruction of artificial reefs 
(called &#8220;payao&#8221;) which had bben built and used by local fishermen to increase fish catch. 136 
payao were reported to have been destroyed by the exploration vessel during the seismic survey, 
thus affecting local communities&#8217; livelihood. Reportedly, some of the payao owners had been 
paid compensation &#8211; P4,000 to P5,000 per destroyed payao &#8211; but some others had not. 
Furthermore, it appeared that fisherfolk had not received any compensation for being prohibited 
from fishing during the seismic survey. The information received indicates that some of the 
affected people had shifted to other activities, working as cab drivers or construction workers, 
while the majority of fishermen had reportedly opted to move to other fishing grounds. This 
entailed either additional expenses to reach distant areas or smaller fishing yields in coastal 
zones where resource-use competition had reportedly been increasing. In both cases, this may 
lead to a loss of economic opportunities and food resources for the fisher folk and their families. 
Local communities reportedly suffered from the lack of sufficient and adequate food in all 
affected provinces, as fishing is the main food resource for these populations. In addition, some 
children had reportedly stopped schooling and women had been forced to search for domestic 
work in order to offset economic loss. According to information received, fishermen 
organizations as well as environmentalist groups and lawyers had seized the Philippines&#8217; 
Supreme Court against JAPEX, the Department of Energy and other governmental agencies and 
called for immediate cessation of offshore activities and cancellation of the concerned service 
contracts. At the time of submission of this communication the case was still pending before the 
Supreme Court. It was reported that despite this social mobilization the authorities and JAPEX 
had proceeded in executing their contract, while the police and the army had allegedly intervened 
in some instances to prevent local leaders from demonstrating against oil exploring activities. 
Hence for example, it was reported that in November 2008 local fisherfolk organizations from 
the municipality of Argao and Sibonga had heard that President Gloria Arroyo would visit the 
area. In an attempt to manifest their opinion on the exploration activities, they had reportedly 
deployed banners where the President would pass by. The police had allegedly confiscated these 
banners and several local residents &#8211; who were called &#8220;subversive&#8221; &#8211; were allegedly subjected to 
interrogation by the army. The information received also indicated that soldiers from the 78th 
Infantry Battalion had used different techniques to threaten fisherfolk leaders, such as visiting 
their houses and compelling some of them to sign up for military-type training called Barangay 
Defense System, as a way to prevent them from campaigning against oil and gas exploration 
projects.

<p>61. On 31 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to the Government 
of Sri Lanka regarding the restrictions that had been imposed on humanitarian aid, including 
food aid, in the Vanni region. According to this information, such restrictions had contributed to 
worsen the food security situation of those people displaced since April 2006, as well as of the </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
population residing in the area prior to that date. On 16 September 2008, international 
non-governmental organizations (INGOs) including UN agencies had been ordered to leave the 
Vanni region following a directive requiring staff to be relocated outside the LTTE-controlled 
areas due to security concerns. According to the information received this directive had had the 
effect of decreasing the humanitarian assistance provided to the region. As a result, the food 
security situation of the affected population had worsened. According to the reports received, 
since the UN agencies had been forced to withdraw temporarily from the Vanni region, seven 
UN convoys of humanitarian assistance including foodstuff had been dispatched to this region. 
Reportedly, food shortages continued to affect the displaced as well as the local population. In 
particular it appeared that the approval and transportation of food to the Vanni region through the 
Omanthai checkpoint, the crossing point between government-controlled territory and that held 
by the LTTE, continued to be problematic as, for example, convoys were systematically 
controlled at the check point causing delays in distribution. In addition, it was alleged that there 
were instances where the size of those convoys crossing the Omanthai checkpoint had been 
reduced. The Special Rapporteur had also been informed that at the time of submission of this 
communication there had not been a comprehensive needs assessment in the region which 
rendered it difficult improving the quality of the assistance provided. The reports received also 
indicated that the prolonged displacement resulted in farmers having to abandon their crops. 
Reportedly, 60 percent of agricultural production had been affected in the Vanni area. This was 
likely to affect the next harvest and the quantities of food available in the region next year thus 
depriving those families whose livelihoods depend on small-scale agriculture of their usual 
means of procuring food. It was further alleged that continued fighting affected infrastructure, 
such as bridges and roads, which is essential for the prompt and safe passage and delivery of 
humanitarian assistance. The Government had taken measures to repair some of this 
infrastructure. Yet, this destruction of infrastructure, coupled with the heavy rains of the 
monsoon period, had resulted in humanitarian agencies finding it increasingly difficult to move 
material, including food.  
</p>
<p>62. In addition to relevant provisions of international human rights law, the Special Rapporteur 
referred to international humanitarian law. Pursuant to the rules of customary law applicable in 
both international and non-international armed conflict identified by the International Committee 
of the Red Cross. Rules 54, 55 and 56, which are a corollary to the prohibition of starvation of 
civilians as a method of warfare, state that attacking, destroying, removing objects indispensable 
to the survival of the civilian population (Rule 54) and denying access of humanitarian aid 
intended for civilians in need, including deliberately impeding humanitarian aid (Rule 55) or 
restricting the freedom of movement of humanitarian relief personnel (Rule 56) may constitute 
violations of the prohibition of starvation.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication received  
</b></p>
<p>63. On 6 January 2009, the Government of Sri Lanka sent a reply regarding the 
above-mentioned communication. The Government denied the allegations of food shortages in 
the Vanni region. The letter mentioned that the Government of Sri Lanka, as well as the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), had sent many convoys of humanitarian 
assistance to the affected region. In addition, the Commissioner General of Essential Services 
almost on a daily basis ensured the provision of supplies for sale through the Cooperative System 
and therefore food supplies were available and affordable in the Vanni region. The Government 
acknowledged that the movements through the checkpoints were problematic but maintained that </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 28 
 
such measures were necessary as the primary responsibility of the Government was to provide 
physical security to the people. The Government also undertook to ensure that the displaced 
persons would return rapidly and that the disruption of their livelihoods would not lead to 
deprivation. The Government also informed the Special Rapporteur that despite the fact that 
fighting affected infrastructure such as bridges and roads the Government had succeeded in 
fulfilling basic needs of the populations in the Vanni region. Finally, the Government highlighted 
its achievements with regard to economic, social and cultural rights, and denied any violations of 
international humanitarian law with regards to the prohibition of starvation.  
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up communication 
</b></p>
<p>64. On 29 April 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Independent Expert on the 
issue of human rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation and the 
Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard 
of physical and mental health sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Sri Lanka. The 
Special Rapporteur thanked the Government for the response letter of 6 January 2009 and 
expressed his interest in receiving responses to the detailed questions contained in his 
communication of 31 December 2008. The Special Procedures brought to the attention of the 
Government information which they had continued to receive concerning the persisting serious 
humanitarian situation, including access to food, water and health care of internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) in the Vanni region. According to the information received IDPs in Vavuniya had 
been unable to have regular access to sufficient and adequate food as the food distribution 
system had been subject to delays and unclear procedures. It had been reported that IDPs may 
receive food ration cards but only after having registered. The registration process had reportedly 
been very long. In some places it appeared that there were no registration mechanisms in place 
yet. Reportedly, there had been instances of people fighting over access to food which, in one 
case, had resulted in the death of a 7 year old. It had also been reported that paramilitary and 
other groups had been providing for unorganized and ad-hoc distributions of small amounts of 
food which, since they could not satisfy needs, had contributed to fuel a tense and frustrating 
situation within IDP camps and sites. Reports indicated that in at some of the sites, including the 
screening site of Omanthai, IDPs had not received any food for three consecutive days. It 
appeared that due to the critical situation in the food sector, the Government had committed to 
resume providing cooked food for the first three days of new arrivals at the camps. At the time of 
the preparation of this communication it remained to be seen whether the Government had the 
capacity to implement this measure. It was also reported that the health situation in the Vanni 
region had further deteriorated. Due to malnutrition and dehydration, the population was 
becoming weaker and more vulnerable to infectious diseases. Chicken pox and watery diarrhoea 
epidemics has already been reported as well as a case of typhoid fever. Treatments for diabetes, 
hypertension, cancer, different psychiatric conditions and other chronic diseases were still 
unavailable. It had also been alleged that even though some transit sites got ambulances to visit 
every day, the majority was without a full time doctor and some reported no doctors visit at all 
for a few days. It was also reported that there was no data concerning the number of deaths, but it 
appeared that the majority was that of infants below the age of two and the elderly. In addition, 
referrals to hospitals remained problematic since the Ministry of Health had not developed a 
contingency plan. Consequently, the likelihood of preventable deaths during new arrival influxes 
was very high. The situation in hospitals receiving IDPs was reported to be increasingly difficult, 
as they were extremely under-staffed and severely overcrowded. In Vavuniya there was an 
estimated 1500 to1800 patients with a bed capacity of 600. A similar situation was reported in </p>

<p>   A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
  page 29 
 
Chettikulum hospital which was currently treating more than 520 patients with a bed capacity of 
</p><p>140. IDPs who had received life saving surgery were reportedly dying due to a lack of 
post-operative capacity to care for the patients. It was alleged that there was an urgent need for 
professional mental health support as significant numbers of IDPs were reportedly suffering 
from mental trauma as a result of their experience during the conflict. In addition, it was alleged 
that since 1 April hardly any shipment of food, medical supplies or non-food relief items had 
been delivered to the no fire zone. It was further alleged that for the previous 6 months, shipment 
of essential medicine and medical supplies for the people in the no fire zone had consistently met 
with delays in clearance from the Ministry of Defence which was consequently hindering access 
to life-saving supplies. Chronic water shortages as well as limited access to scant water supplies 
had been reported at Omanthai as well as in most of the transit sites. It was also alleged that the 
quality of drinking water was not satisfactory and that chlorine tablets to treat water supplies in 
the no fire zone had consistently not been cleared by the Ministry of Defence. In the transit sites 
and IDP camps, there were reports of insufficient toilet facilities and inadequate drainage system 
in place to manage the situation, particularly with heavy rains. It was also reported that sanitation 
facilities and water supplies were located far away from the blocks at Menik Farm zone 3 
creating access problems particularly for the elderly and the disabled, and security concerns for 
women and children. Furthermore, the lack of adequate access to sanitation was reportedly 
leading to increased open defecation, which could cause serious health problems for the entire 
IDP population.  
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 11 May 2009, the Government of Sri Lanka sent a reply regarding the Follow Up 
communication mentioned above. Concerning the availability of food the Government informed 
the Special Rapporteur that despite the temporal problems during the sudden influx of people 
fleeing from the LTTE-controlled areas, food availability wasn&#8217;t a problem any more. The 
Government also regretted the bad quality of rice provided by the World Food Program. The 
Government also informed the Special Rapporteur that it has started communal cooking in most 
centers. The Government also stated that the people fleeing from the LTTE-controlled areas have 
suffered from malnutrition there. The Government explained that despite it was sending food to 
the LTTE-controlled areas on regular basis it rarely reached the populations. The Government 
further denied the allegation that in one of the IDPs camps a child would have been killed by 
another child while fighting over the food. According to the Government, the child died because 
of stampede. The Government also denied the allegations that in the IDPs&#8217; camps the 
populations would suffer from epidemics, although it admitted that the health situation is 
problematic due to a big number of people living in the camps. Additionally the Government 
included some statistics indicating the amount of supplies provided for the people from the 
LTTE-controlled zones. Finally the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that it 
requested more detailed information to a number of Ministries in Sri Lanka.

Rapporteur on the right to education, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights 
defenders, the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest 
attainable standard of physical and mental health and the Special Rapporteur on violence against 
women, its causes and consequences sent a joint urgent appeal to the Government of Soudan 
regarding the revocation of licenses of 16 non-governmental organisations working in the region 
of Darfur, in Northern Sudan and in the Transitional Areas as such a decision would have 
devastating consequences on the human rights of approximately 4.7 million people affected by 
the conflict, particularly in the sectors of food, health, water, sanitation, adequate housing and 
education. Of this population approximately 2.7 million were internally displaced persons living 
in camps across the country. According to the information received on 5 March 2009, following 
the issuance of an arrest warrant against President Omar al-Bashir by the International Criminal 
Court, it had been announced that the operations relating to humanitarian assistance and human 
rights work of these organisations were suspended. These organisations included 13 international 
non-governmental organisations, namely Action contre la Faim, Solidarit&#233;s, Save the Children 
UK and Save the Children US, M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res Holland and M&#233;decins sans Fronti&#232;res 
France, Care International, Oxfam GB, Mercy Corps, International Rescue Committee (IRC), 
Norwegian Refugee Council, Cooperative Housing Foundation and PADCO. In addition, the 
activities of three national organisations were also terminated, namely the Sudan Social 
Development Organization (SUDO), the Amel Centre for Treatment and Rehabilitation of 
Victims of Violence, and the Khartoum Centre for Human Rights. These 16 organisations had 
been employing nearly 6,500 national and international personnel, this constituting close to half 
of the workforce in Darfur. Eviction orders had reportedly been appealed (according to Sudanese 
law) by relief and humanitarian NGOs, while the closing down of local NGOs could not be 
appealed according to the Humanitarian Act of 2006. Incidents of threats against NGO personnel 
had been reported as well as systematic confiscation and seizure of property, including passports, 
computers, cars and confidential items, reportedly on the basis of an agreement signed by NGO 
personnel with the Humanitarian Aid Commission (HAC) stipulating that they had to hand their 
assets over to the State if they leave. The impact would not only be limited to Darfur, but also the 
Three Transitional Areas and Eastern Sudan. According to estimates, 1.5 million beneficiaries no 
longer had access to health and nutrition services. Host and IDP populations were particularly 
affected. Water supply, sanitation and hygiene services provided by these NGOs to 1.16 million 
people had been interrupted (Blue Nile &#8211; 102,000; Eastern States &#8211; 50,000; and Darfur &#8211; 
1,007,000). Some 1.1 million people had stopped receiving general food distribution and the 
treatment of some 4,000 children for severe and moderate malnutrition over the next three 
months could be interrupted. In the Non-Food Item (NFI) and Emergency Shelter (ES) sector, 
670,000 individuals were to be affected. Distributions of Non-Food Relief Items (which include 
cooking equipment and other basic household goods) and emergency shelter had ceased in 19 
camps and locations in Darfur. The longer term humanitarian consequences, such as depletion 
and shortages of food stocks and other assets and the upcoming rainy season, would reportedly 
have a serious impact on the ability of the communities concerned to have access to sufficient 
and adequate food. On 8 March 2009, the decision to terminate the activities of the 
abovementioned organisations had started to show its effects. In some IDP camps in the Zalingei 
area, for example, the fuel for operation of the water pumps had begun to run low without an 
alternative option in place for its re-supply. Garbage had also started piling up inside these 
camps. Absence of water and a waste disposal system would have serious consequences on </p>

people&#8217;s health and nutrition. Disturbing reports of censorship, temporary newspaper 
suspensions, threats and arbitrary arrests and detentions to prevent human rights defenders, 
journalists and members of opposition parties from freely expressing their opinions, had been 
reported. Privately-owned print media reportedly continued to be subjected to daily censorship 
by officials of the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) who could order the 
removal of any article from the following day&#8217;s paper. In response to the censorship there had 
been a number of protests by journalists.

<p>68. On 11 May 2009, the Special Rapporteur together with the Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, the Special Rapporteur 
on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the 
right to non-discrimination in this context and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people sent a joint allegations letter to the 
Government of Uganda regarding the received information on the living conditions of the Benet 
community living in the Kapchorwa District of Eastern Uganda, on the edges of the Mount 
Elgon National Park. The Benet community, who had been living in the area that has been now 
formally referred to as the Mount Elgon National Park since the mid-1800s, traditionally sustain 
themselves through pastoral and agricultural activities, hunting, bee-keeping, and making 
handicrafts. Throughout the 1900s, the colonial government and later the government of Uganda 
had declared the area inhabited by the Benet people as a forest reserve, though the Benet had 
continued to remain in those lands. In the 1980s, the Benet community had been resettled to an 
area just outside the formal forest reserve. The Benet people were supposed to be resettled in an 
area of 6000 hectares; however, it had been reported that the Government had not surveyed the 
land at that time, and the Benet in fact received 7500 hectares, referred to as the Benet 
Resettlement Area. According to the information received, the Government had surveyed the 
Benet Resettlement Area in 1993. Following this, it had declared the extra 1500 acres as part of 
the Mount Elgon National Park. Six thousand people who had been living on the additional 1500 
hectares were declared &#8220;encroachers&#8221; and were evicted with no alternate land allocation. They 
were not consulted about their sudden loss of rights to their farms and homes and they received 
no compensation. For years, Government authorities had reportedly carried out measures to 
attempt to evict families of the Benet community living in the area. On 27 October 2005, in a 
Consent Judgment and Decree before the High Court of Uganda at Mbale, the Uganda Land 
Alliance, representing the Benet community (applicants), and the Uganda Wildlife Authority 
(UWA) and the Attorney General (respondents) had agreed that the &#8220;members of the Benet 
community residing in the Benet Subcounty, including those residing in the Yatui Parish and the 
Kabsekek Village of Keen County and in Kwoti Parish of Tingey County&#8221; (communities within 
the 1500 acre area), were &#8220;indigenous inhabitants of the said areas which were declared a 
Wildlife Protected area or National Park&#8221;. It had also been agreed that the areas mentioned be 
de-gazetted as a National Park, following inspection of the boundary with the Benet community, </p>

<p>A/HRC/13/33/Add.1 
page 32 
 
and that special measures be taken to provide education, infrastructure, health and social services 
to the communities in lieu of general damages. Finally, the Consent Judgment had held that the 
Benet community was entitled to stay within the area undisturbed and carry out agricultural 
activities. Despite this judgment, since 2005, Kapchorwa District authorities and the UWA had 
allegedly continued to attempt to remove the Benet communities from their lands. According to 
the information received, in response, the Uganda Human Rights Commission had appealed to 
the Attorney General on 25 April 2009 to implement the Consent Judgment. In February 2008, 
the UWA reportedly forcefully evicted 1,400 Benet from their lands within the area formally 
declared a National Park, but which the Consent Judgment had ordered to be de-gazetted, 
leaving them seeking shelter in caves and trees. In April 2008, the Minister for Tourism 
intervened and ordered the resettlement of those evicted in two temporary settlements. It was 
alleged that the temporary resettlement areas were wholly inadequate for the Benet to sustain 
traditional agricultural practices and to maintain their traditional livelihoods. In the Kisito 
settlement, the Benet were residing on land allocated on the basis of family size, with the largest 
households receiving about four acres and the smallest receiving about two acres. In the 
Cheberen settlement, the private landowner did not allow the Benet to cultivate any crops on the 
land. Further, the displaced communities were prohibited, by both the UWA and the private land 
owner, from setting up permanent housing units in the areas. Moreover, the allegations claimed 
that the UWA had been seeking payments amounting to as much as 600,000 Uganda shillings in 
exchange for permanent resettlement outside the Mount Elgon National Park, contrary to the 
judgement mentioned above, which affirmed the right of the Benet to live just outside of the 
National Park in their traditional lands, undisturbed. There were also reports that Benet 
individuals were regularly threatened by UWA and sometimes evicted from their temporary 
dwellings. Reportedly, this constant insecurity had resulted in the Benet community being unable 
to conduct any agricultural or pastoral activity and therefore to have access to sufficient and 
adequate food. The reported case where two children in Kabsekek village (Bukwo district) died 
of hunger and ill health in March 2009 allegedly demonstrated the Benet community's 
constraints in accessing food and health care services. Finally, it was alleged that the UWA and 
the Ugandan Police frequently arrested community members, especially those actively involved 
in advocacy against forceful evictions and displacement. There were also allegations that 
community members have been subjected to beatings by UWA officials whilst in search of food 
or firewood in territory considered part of the National Park.

of public hospitals and medical schools despite the spread of a cholera epidemic throughout the 
country, the right to food and nutrition, as well as violations of the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly. It was alleged that the cholera epidemic had spreading throughout the state resulting in 
a daily increase in death tolls. The spread of cholera had been exacerbated by the breakdown of 
water and sanitation systems. The reports indicated that there had been a lack of access to clean 
water and that fresh water was no longer being pumped into urban areas. It was also alleged that 
sewage systems had been blocked or pipes had burst, and uncollected garbage had been 
overflowing into the streets. Furthermore, it was reported that essential medicines were 
unavailable to treat the acute epidemics. Anti-retroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS patients and TB 
treatment for chronically ill patients had also reportedly been severely disrupted. According to 
the information received, due to a lack of medicine, equipment, services, and health staff, public 
hospitals and clinics had been closed, resulting in the preventable deaths of individuals. It was 
alleged that the only maternity hospital in the capital had been closed and patients with fractures, 
meningitis and other acute and dangerous conditions had been sent home. This reported decrease 
in access to basic health care has meant that, despite the spread of the cholera epidemic, many 
individuals could not afford health care because of the high cost of private clinics. It was further 
alleged that there had been a violent police crack-down on peaceful demonstrations relating to 
the right to health and that medical schools had been closed. Reportedly, riot police had 
forcefully dispersed hundreds of doctors, nurses and other health workers who had gathered 
peacefully at Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare, to protest working conditions. It had been also 
alleged that more than five million people were in need of food aid and that 45 per cent of the 
population was malnourished. Children had been particularly affected by increasing levels of 
malnourishment. Hungry people had also allegedly resorted to eating animals and vegetables that 
were unsuitable for human consumption and that were risky for their health. In addition, it had 
been reported that drinking unsafe water had rendered already malnourished people more 
vulnerable to diseases.  
</p>

<p>71. On 13 March 2009, the Government of Zimbabwe sent a reply concerning the above

Parirenyatwa Hospital had sought to demonstrate or hold a public procession in contravention of 
section 25 of the Public Order and Security Act Chap11:17 which prescribed the manner in 
which a public demonstration could be conducted. The Government pointed out that the poor 
conditions at hospitals and non-availability of medicines, against which the demonstration in 
question had been held, were result of economic sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe. The 
Government informed the Special Procedures that the police had engaged the demonstrators&#8217; 
leadership and had advised them that they were breaching the law. The police had advised the 
demonstrators to select two representatives who could take their petition of grievances to the 
Minister of Health. The demonstrators had refused the proposal, started chanting and proceeded 
to cut the security fence to create an exit route where the police had stopped them. The 
demonstrators had eventually dispersed on their own accord. No person had been reported 
injured during or after the demonstration. The police did not arrest anyone.  </p>

<p>72. On 17 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation letter to ITM Angola, 
regarding the information received about the activities of ITM-Mining in the Republic of Angola 
which reportedly involved the confiscation of farmland by Sociedade Mineira do Cuango (in 
which ITM owns half the shares) in order to carry out diamond mining activities in Cafunfo

explaining that it took note of the allegations made but that the company was not a principal 
shareholder of the Sociedade Mineira do Cuango, in contrary to what the allegations letter 
indicated. As all other shareholder, ITM was not in charge of the governing of the mining

<p>76. On 8 September 2009, the Special Rapporteur received a reply from Newmont Mining 
Corporation (NMC). The company stressed its commitment to implement the best possible 
practices in the areas of social and environmental management and impact mitigation at the 
Akyem project. Accordingly, Newmont&#8217;s Akyem project had been studied extensively by 
international and national environmental experts, members of the communities living in the area, 
and by agencies and departments of Ghana government, as well as the International Finance 
Corporation. In addition, Newmont project leaders had engaged with numerous community 
representatives, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations and international 
organizations on many occasions. NMC indicated that at three public hearings conducted by 
Ghana&#8217;s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Akyem communities had demonstrated 
overwhelming support for the project. More than 150 Ghanaian community leaders had since 
issued their own statements in support of the Akyem project. Moreover, the results of the 
discussions with the local communities had been presented in an environmental impact study that 
recently reviewed by the Environmental Protection Agency. The latter had granted Newmont an 
environmental permit to operate at Akyem. Finally, the letter informed that additional enquiry 
had been made with the Senior Regional Vice President fir Africa at the NMC.

The Special Rapporteurs shared the concerns that they had had raised with the Government of 
Nigeria, which is included in the &#8220;Governments&#8221; section of this report, and drew the company's 
attention to the relevant provisions of international human rights law. They mentioned in 
particular Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which recognizes that 
&#8220;everyone has the right of living adequate for the health and the well-being of himself and of his 
family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services&#8221;. The 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that every organ of society shall strive to 
promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to secure their universal and 
effective recognition and observance. Moreover, in resolution 8/7 (2008), the Human Rights 
Council affirmed that &#8220;transnational corporations and other business enterprises have a 
responsibility to respect human rights and assist in channelling the benefits of business towards 
contributing the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221;. The Human Rights 
Council has also welcomed the policy framework for managing corporate related human rights 
issues presented by the Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations on 
human rights and transnational corporate bodies and other business enterprises. The framework 
identifies differentiated, but complimentary responsibilities of governments and companies with 
regard to human rights. The framework confirms the State duty to protect against 
corporate-related human rights abuses but also confirms that the &#8220;baseline responsibility is to 
respect human rights&#8221;. This responsibility, which applies to all internationally recognized human 
rights, exists independently of State duties and requires companies to exercise due diligence to 
become aware, prevent, address and mitigate negative human rights impacts. The due diligence 
required from the companies entails a responsibility to undertake human rights impact 
assessment, either in conjunction with or separately, based on recognized international human 
rights law.

<p><b>Chevron Nigeria Limited 
</b></p>
<p>78. On 4 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur received a reply from Chevron Nigeria 
Limited (CNL) in which the company acknowledged that the companies can play a positive role 
in contributing to the protection and promotion of human rights. To this end CNL worked 
actively to conduct its operations in a manner consistent with human rights principles applicable 
to business. This included recognizing and respecting the relevant ideals expressed in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In addition, CNL condemned human rights abuses. In 
the meantime CNL pointed out that it was not in a position to comment on the incident 
concerning release of the crude oil into Bodo creek, as well as in the village of Kira Tai IN 
Ogoniland, as these incidents had not occured in the CNL&#8217;s area of operations and were not 
directly linked to company&#8217;s production activities. CNL further informed the Special 
Rapporteurs on the actions which the company was taking when oil spills occured, as well as on 
the relevant regulations contained within Nigerian law. CNL described the process for 
Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessments which it observed in its daily practices. 
The objective of this process was to identify, assess and mitigate potential operational impacts on 
the environment and local communities in a formal and structured manner. In addition, CNL 
commented on its community engagement programs which are an integral part of company&#8217;s 
commitment to human rights and which focus on improving access to basic needs supporting 
education and health care and promoting infrastructure developments and economic livelihoods. 
As an example of such community engagement it mentioned a community hospital that CNL had </p>

built in the Escravos area in order to provide comprehensive health care to the area. Finally, 
CNL indicated that since 2005 its approach towards community engagement has been based on 
the Global Memorandum of Understanding signed with communities and governments in 5 
states where the company was operating in the Niger Delta.

<p><b>Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited 
</b></p>
<p>79. On 30 November 2009, the Special Rapporteur received a reply from the Nigerian Agip 
Oil Company Limited. The company informed the Special Rapporteur that the contents of the 
allegation letter were currently being reviewed and provided him with its assurances to submit a 
detailed response soon.  
</p>
<p><b>Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited 
</b></p>
<p>80. On 6 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur received a reply letter from Shell Petroleum 
Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC) in which the company recognized its 
commitment to the principle of sustainable development and determination to always look to 
improve SPDC&#8217;s performance in order to reduce environmental impact and footprint as far as 
possible and to maximize its social contribution. SPDC&#8217;s operations in Niger Delta were heavily 
dependent on maintaining good relations with communities. The company found inaccurate the 
allegation that the petroleum industry, in particular SPDC was responsible for most oil spills, 
arguing that 85 per cent were the result of criminal activities. It said that SPDC was providing 
relief materials and carrying out clean up operations whenever spills occurred, and that both 
government and community representatives monitored these operations. As regards health 
concerns, SPDC then referred to a 1995 World Bank report that considered oil related pollution a 
low priority concern, and to an undated WHO report which considered poverty as the main cause 
of poor health. Waste disposal was said to be carried out by licensed service providers in 
accordance with regulatory guidelines. As for water discharges, SPDC was committed to gear its 
operations towards complying to the limits set by the Directorate of Petroleum Resources. As for 
heavy metals in soils and groundwater, SPDC carried out environmental evaluation reviews for 
its facilities in old &quot;brown&quot; fields. About impact assessment and community consultations, SPDC 
replied that for all new projects it conducted environmental social and health impact assessment 
in line with guidelines of the department of petroleum resources and the federal ministry of 
environmental. The impact assessment documents were public documents available to all 
stakeholders in the process, and they were available at local and federal government offices for 
consultation. SPDC felt that the impact assessment process ensured fair community participation 
and fair compensation &#8211; SPDC compensation rates were negotiated with communities. After oil 
spills, SPDC complied with all measures required by law, including compensation, relief and 
clean up operations. Studies on long term impact had been carried out by UNICAL Consult, 
World Bank and WHO. For its part, SPDC strongly supported a study undertaken by the World 
Bank in collaboration with the government on gas flaring, as well as a UNEP-led environmental 
study on spills in Ogoniland. Finally, SPDC indicated its support to the voluntary guidelines on 
security and human rights, and to the principle of development, which extended in its case to 
health, education and microcredit, conflict resolution, and to infrastructure development such as 
water provision and electrification. SPEC worked alongside with NGOs, UNDP and the World 
Bank. It also contributed to development commitments through the taxes paid to the federal 
government.   </p>

<p><b>Total E&amp;P Nigeria Limited  
</b></p>
<p>81. On 9 December 2009, the Special Rapporteur received a reply from Total E&amp;P Nigeria 
Limited (TEPNG) in which the company acknowledged that it was not in a position to provide a 
response or to comment on the specific allegations contained within the communication received 
from the Special Rapporteur since the alleged incidents are not related to the TOTAL Group 
operated activities in Nigeria, but that it wished to clarify its position with regards to the 
allegations of a general nature. Total and its subsidiaries in Nigeria were responsible operators 
with stringent environmental and community social responsibility guidelines which place highest 
importance on the respect for the environment, as well as social and economical development of 
the local communities. Moreover, spills of a technical nature only amounted to 16% of the 
incidents, while all others were the result of acts of sabotage. TEPNG's refuted the allegation that 
operations induced water discharges, it also denied that its operation may induce the presence of 
heavy metal in soils and groundwater. With regard to emergency water supplies in case of oil 
spills, this was not a case it had encountered as none of the spills it had suffered reached the 
extent to which it would be needed. In case of oil spills, TEPNG followed federal guidelines, by 
informing the department of petroleum resources, negotiating access to affected areas with 
communities, organising joint inspection visits , negotiating compensations except in cases of 
sabotage, carrying out repair works, and doing final inspections after the works were completed. 
Total was also fully committed to the economic development of communities, and it entered in 
consultation with them for its operation, notable by signing memorandums of understandings. 
For all its new projects, it carried out environmental impact assessment as required by the 
regulations of the oil and gas industry. Total was committed to follow the requirements of these 
impact assessment processes, including regarding community participation. Finally, TEPNG 
noted that Total was conscious of its obligations as a good corporate citizen to its environment, 
its host communities and its host countries, It was also committed to carrying out sustainable 
development projects in such areas as health, infrastructure, education and capacity building of 
members and community groups. As it was committed to improving its actions, Total had made 
efforts to get an independent third party review on the way it implemented corporate social 
responsibility programmes, of the types of relationships maintained with communities and of 
necessary improvements.
