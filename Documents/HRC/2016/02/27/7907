<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the fifteenth session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, 
held on 21 January 2013, Lord Vaea, Minister for Internal Affairs, introduced Tonga&#8217;s 
second national report after extending warm greetings and best wishes for the New Year 
2013 on behalf of His Majesty King Tupou VI of Tonga, Lord Tu&#8217;ivakano, Prime Minister 
of Tonga, and the people of Tonga He congratulated the Council and the Working Group 
for the work achieved in 2012 and for commencing the second cycle of the UPR process. 
He thanked the troika, consisting of Angola, Costa Rica and Pakistan, for assisting with 
Tonga&#8217;s review and for the advance questions from the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland, Norway, Slovenia, Mexico and Spain. 
</p>
<p>6. Lord Vaea referred to the adoption of Tonga&#8217;s first universal period review in June 
2008 as a milestone for Tonga. It provided the opportunity to showcase the fundamental 
human rights enshrined in the 1875 Tongan Constitution granted by King Siaosi Tupou I,  
which Tonga had devotedly protected for 137 years. Lord Vaea also stated that the first 
review was an opportunity to highlight Tonga&#8217;s aspirations to ratify new human rights 
</p>
<p>conventions.  
</p>
<p>7. However, he stated that the introduction of new human rights would involve a 
delicate balancing exercise of important factors, including limited resources, core Tongan 
cultural values, fundamental Christian beliefs and liberal ideologies. These unique 
circumstances should be recognized as the reason why Tonga has been slow to ratify the </p>


<p>core human rights conventions. Tonga, however, continued to be active in supporting and 
developing human rights aspirations through legislation, policies, training, awareness 
programmes, and supporting national, regional and international activities and initiatives. 
</p>
<p>8. In relation to democratization and law reform, Lord Vaea reported that the 
democratization of the Tongan political system had been completed. He reported that the 
process was led by the late king, His Majesty King George Tupou V, and that it was his 
legacy to Tonga, the Pacific region and the world. Lord Vaea then outlined the significant 
occurrences since 2008 in implementing democratization, and described the new political 
system. 
</p>
<p>9. Lord Vaea reported that the new revamped constitutional and political framework 
provides fundamental features of a free and democratic society to all Tongan citizens. The 
new constitutional and political system has demonstrated that it is robust and can resist 
challenges against unstable and ineffective Government. Lord Vaea however stated that the 
new system may not be perfect, but it was a significant achievement in making these 
profound changes, in a peaceful and orderly manner, within a period of four years. Lord 
Vaea acknowledged with appreciation the technical assistance offered during the 
constitutional and political reform process by donor States and international organizations, 
including the Governments of New Zealand and Australia, the European Union and UNDP. 
</p>
<p>10. Regarding ratification of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), Lord Vaea referred to a question from 
Norway, and explained that Tonga had not ratified the Convention because torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment were already prohibited under 
Tonga&#8217;s criminal law, and addressed in legislation regarding evidence, extradition and 
</p>
<p>mutual assistance in criminal matters. Further, the authorities responsible for investigation 
and prosecution of torture are responsive and effective, and the judiciary imposed criminal 
sanctions that are a deterrent to potential offenders. Lord Vaea also highlighted that the 
occurrence of torture was not systematic in Tonga; in fact it was very rare. Lord Vaea 
confirmed Tonga&#8217;s commitment to ratifying CAT. 
</p>
<p>11. In relation to establishing safeguards against harsh treatment by police and security 
forces, Lord Vaea referred to a question from Norway as to what steps Tonga had taken to 
address the involvement of police officers in the maltreatment and death of civilians. Lord 
Vaea reported that police and security officers are prosecuted without exception, and 
offenders are disciplined and dismissed. The use of police intimidation tactics is a regular 
occurrence, but police violence against suspects is rare. In the last 50 years, there have been 
only two deaths at the hands of police officers. Lord Vaea also added that Tonga Police 
planned to install a closed circuit television camera system and conduct training on the new 
Tonga Police Act 2010, which sets out modern police standards that respect human rights. 
Lord Vaea also reported that a new Police Commissioner had been appointed, with the 
assistance of the Government of New Zealand, whose main task is to modernize the Tonga 
Police. The Police Commissioner is supported by a significant tri-partite development 
assistance programme between the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and Tonga. 
</p>
<p>12. Lord Vaea referred to a question from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland as to what Tonga was doing to address the issue of police violence and 
education programmes for police officers. Lord Vaea stated that education programmes on 
the use of force were being provided together with training from police officers with 
overseas experience. He said that the Tonga Police was establishing a community-level 
presence and hoped to regain public confidence, and reported that Tonga Police had 
relinquished non-policing roles, such as immigration and traffic registration and licensing, 
in order to concentrate on its core police roles. He added that with regard to promoting 
human rights education programmes for police, security and penal personnel, Tonga Police, </p>


<p>the Prisons Department and Tonga Defence Services were using their development 
programmes to educate their personnel on respect and protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>13. In relation to protection of freedom of expression, information and the press, Lord 
Vaea stated that this fundamental human right was enshrined in clause 7 of the Tongan 
Constitution and that the media enjoyed relative freedom, subject to the laws of defamation, 
sedition and contempt of court. He reported that a Tonga Media Council had been 
established by the Tongan media to regulate their own activities; however, it was still in its 
infancy stages of development. He also reported that Tonga had adopted a freedom of 
information policy, which was being introduced incrementally by all Government 
ministries and agencies. It is envisaged that the policy will be a basis to enact freedom of 
information legislation. 
</p>
<p>14. In relation to increasing awareness for persons with disabilities, Lord Vaea referred 
to a question from Slovenia as to how Tonga guarantees the rights of persons with 
disabilities and what improvements have been made in recent years. He said that Tongan 
legislation offered the same protection of rights to disabled and non-disabled persons and 
that there was no discrimination in the law or in practice against disabled persons. The only 
gaps were the special rights for disabled, such as communication for persons who are 
hearing or sight impaired. Lord Vaea stated that Tonga has a policy on inclusive education 
for disabled persons, that legislation requires access facilities for disabled persons to be 
built in public buildings and that Tonga was supportive of regional efforts, such as the 
Biwaka Millennium Framework for Action, the Pacific Disability Forum and the Australia-
Pacific Islands Disability Support. Tonga acknowledged the assistance provided by the 
Government of Australia in this area. Lord Vaea also stated that there are two disabled 
persons organizations active in pursuing the rights of disabled persons, and an organization 
that provides rehabilitation services for disabled persons. He reported that social clubs 
provide support for persons with disabilities on a regular basis. 
</p>
<p>15. Lord Vaea referred to a question from Slovenia about steps to include the provisions 
of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) into domestic 
legislation and the time frame for ratifying the Convention. Lord Vaea said that disabled 
persons have rights under Tongan law at a general level. Tonga could not provide a time 
frame for the ratification of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>16. Lord Vaea then referred to a question from Spain about plans to improve the living 
conditions of persons with disabilities and to eradicate discrimination against them. Lord 
Vaea stated that Tonga was encouraging commitment to improve the lives of persons with 
disabilities by way of support for disabled persons organizations and also regional plans of 
action. Furthermore, Tongan legislation does not discriminate against disabled persons. He 
stated that Tonga was committed to ratifying the Convention; however, no time frame was 
available. 
</p>
<p>17. In relation to anti-corruption, Lord Vaea stated that the Tongan Government was 
establishing fully independent Attorney General and Auditor General offices, as well as 
enacting new legislation to create effective and efficient offices for the Anti-Corruption 
Commissioner and Ombudsman. Tonga was committed to establishing and strengthening 
these anti-corruption mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>18. With regard to establishing a human rights institution, Lord Vaea referred to a 
question from the United Kingdom about plans to establish a human rights institution. Lord 
Vaea said that Tonga was still not able to establish a national human rights institution, due 
to lack of resources. Government ministries and agencies respect and protect human rights 
collectively; however, Tonga recognizes the importance of establishing a human rights 
focal point within the Government, and hoped that donor partners would consider providing 
assistance for this initiative. </p>


<p>19. Concerning gender equality, Lord Vaea referred to a question from Norway as to 
steps taken to improve gender equality and empower women and to increase the number of 
women in decision-making positions. Lord Vaea stated that Tonga has made a significant 
commitment at the national, regional and international levels to promote gender equality, 
and has also carried out activities to maintain gender equality. He reported on the number 
of women that are in decision-making positions in Government, public enterprises, 
statutory boards, private businesses and churches. 
</p>
<p>20. Lord Vaea referred to a question from Slovenia as to whether a gender perspective 
had been integrated into Tongan policies. He stated that one of the objectives of the Tonga 
Strategic Development Framework, adopted in 2012, was to create strong inclusive 
communities by way of improving gender equality by implementing the Tongan 
Government&#8217;s gender development policy. He said that prosecution of domestic violence 
was carried out without exception and that the Tongan Government was processing a 
Family Protection Bill. A national study on domestic violence against women was carried 
out in March 2012. He said that the Public Service Commission had increased the maternity 
leave period and created paternity leave. He also reported that the Tonga Defence Services 
now retains soldiers who marry and have children, and that there were women 
commissioned officers in the Tonga Defence Services and the Tonga Police. 
</p>
<p>21. Lord Vaea referred to a question from the United Kingdom as to why Tonga had not 
ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
(CEDAW) and about plans to become a party to the Convention. Lord Vaea said that in 
December 2011, Tonga had decided to ratify the Convention with reservations, following a 
nationwide consultation to reach a consensus on the reservations and the way forward for 
ratification. He then explained the privileges that women enjoyed as part of Tongan social 
life and said that any change would have to be managed carefully so as not to change 
Tongan culture drastically and to avoid disharmony. He stated that it was hoped that the 
consultation would be completed together with the enactment of the Family Protection Bill. 
</p>
<p>22. Referring to a question from Spain as to what issues the reservations to the 
Convention would cover, Lord Vaea said that they would likely cover succession rights, 
abortion, land ownership and same sex marriage. He highlighted that these were all 
sensitive issues in Tonga which needed to be fully canvassed by all stakeholders before the 
Convention can be ratified. 
</p>
<p>23. Referring to a question from Norway as to measures taken by Tonga to ensure 
equality between men and women in relation to ownership of land and property, Lord Vaea 
stated that the right of women to land was still an issue under consideration, given Tongan 
culture and the current land tenure system. However, he stated that a Royal Commission of 
Inquiry had made recommendations to amend the land laws to allow women more access to 
land. 
</p>
<p>24. Regarding the promotion and protection of human rights, education and public 
awareness, Lord Vaea reported that Tonga had undertaken numerous training programmes, 
with the assistance of specialized regional organizations and donor agencies. Tonga was 
also taking new initiatives to improve human rights for its citizens, such as the adoption of 
a freedom of information policy; proposed access to free legal representation and  
maintaining a high ranking in the UNDP human development index. Lord Vaea also 
reported that Tonga had benefited from human rights education and public awareness 
programmes offered by the Pacific Regional Rights Resource Team of the South Pacific 
Community, the Governments of New Zealand and Australia and UNDP. 
</p>
<p>25. Regarding ratification of the core international human rights treaties and optional 
protocols, Lord Vaea stated that Tonga had not ratified the core human rights treaties and 
referred to the explanation given at the start of the presentation. He requested the Member </p>


<p>States to understand Tonga&#8217;s circumstances and to continue to assist Tonga in pursuing 
ratification of the treaties through the provision of technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>26. Concerning other questions that Tonga had received in advance, but which were not 
directly covered in the second national report, Lord Vaea referred to a question from 
Mexico as to what obstacles Tonga faced in effectively implementing previous UPR 
recommendations. He highlighted as main obstacles the lack of resources and the delicate 
balancing exercise of significant factors unique to Tonga. 
</p>
<p>27. Lord Vaea then referred to another question from Mexico regarding plans to prevent 
statelessness. He stated that Tonga had widened the scope of its nationality laws in 2007, 
and that more persons were now able to become Tongan citizens. He added that there has 
not been any cases of statelessness in Tonga. He said that naturalization is possible after 
five years of residence and knowledge of the Tongan language; however, the King has 
absolute discretion to grant Tongan nationality to any person at any time. 
</p>
<p>28. Lord Vaea referred to a question from Spain about Tonga&#8217;s opinion on the human 
right to drinking water. He said that Tonga had not voted in support of the resolutions on 
the human right to drinking water because it was not present during the voting, due to 
limited resources. He added that like many other small-island developing states, Tonga has 
limited and scarce natural resources, including water. Nevertheless, Tonga continues to 
make its own national efforts to deliver this crucial resource to its citizens as best as it can. 
Tonga is currently processing a Water Resources Bill in order to monitor and regulate water 
use. Any meaningful discussion on the right of access to clean water and adequate 
sanitation, including the scope of obligations, remain a matter of great importance to 
Tonga. Further, Tonga would be supportive of any efforts that involve calling on States, 
particularly developing countries, and international organizations to provide financial 
resources, build capacity and transfer technology to scale up efforts to provide safe, clean, 
accessible and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all.  
</p>
<p>29. Lord Vaea concluded the opening statement by stating that Tonga remained 
committed to improving the level of its human rights obligations, and requested States to 
understand and appreciate the unique circumstances Tonga faces in advancing human rights 
protection. He also requested States to assist and support Tonga in advancing human rights, 
in particular with regard to gender equality, persons with disabilities and any other human 
rights that States were willing to assist Tonga with. Lord Vaea expressed his appreciation to 
the Working Group for its attention and wished it well for the work to be accomplished 
over the next few weeks and the rest of 2013.

<p>30. During the interactive dialogue, 40 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>31. Indonesia was encouraged by Tonga&#8217;s constitutional and political reforms to 
strengthen democracy. It commended Tonga&#8217;s willingness to obtain international assistance

recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. Italy commended Tonga for the de facto moratorium on executions since 1982 and

to numerous core international human rights instruments and encouraged the country to 
urgently remove all obstacles preventing its ratification of the International Covenant on </p>


<p>Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights (ICESCR). Italy made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Japan welcomed the enactment of constitutional and electoral reform legislation and 
the freedom of information policy. It welcomed the campaign to combat domestic violence

</p>
<p>34. Latvia thanked Tonga for its comprehensive report and welcomed the positive steps 
taken to demonstrate its commitment to human rights. It referred to the issue of standing 
invitations to the special procedures of the Human Rights Council, which it had addressed 
during Tonga&#8217;s last review. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Malaysia was encouraged by Tonga&#8217;s efforts to balance respect for civil and 
political rights with that of social and cultural rights. It commended Tonga&#8217;s achievements 
</p>
<p>in education. It considered that the Government&#8217;s determination to improve protection and

<p>promotion of human rights in the country should be acknowledged and called on the 
international community to support the Government&#8217;s request for technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>36. Maldives commended Tonga for its constitutional and political reforms. It welcomed 
Tonga&#8217;s efforts to accede to CEDAW and the appointment of women to high-level 
positions. It noted with satisfaction the implementation of recommendations regarding 
gender violence. Lack of funding is a major challenge for Tonga; Maldives therefore called 
on the international community to extend its support to the country. 
</p>
<p>37. Mexico welcomed Tonga&#8217;s efforts to strengthen the democratic process and trusted 
that those actions would result in increased protection and promotion of human rights.  
Mexico noted measures taken to implement previous recommendations, including the 
introduction of legislation to combat corruption. It encouraged Tonga to intensify efforts to 
ratify the human rights instruments it has not yet ratified and to bring its legislation into line 
with them. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Morocco commended Tonga on the progress achieved towards creating a human 
rights infrastructure and supported efforts made by the complaints commissioner. It 
congratulated Tonga on the report on land issues and asked whether women&#8217;s access to 
</p>

national consultations to incorporate human rights at different levels of public education. 
</p>
<p>39. New Zealand noted that, despite Government efforts, there was not equal 
participation between men and women in various areas of contemporary life. It welcomed 
measures taken and progress made in drafting legislation to protect women from violence 
and remained committed to supporting Tonga in that area. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Norway noted that Tonga&#8217;s commitments to ratifying important human rights 
conventions had not been implemented. It expressed concern about reports of high levels of 
domestic violence and the fact that marital rape was not criminalized. It was also concerned 
that Tonga&#8217;s legislation discriminated against women in the field of inheritance. Norway 
noted that Tonga had not used capital punishment since 1982. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. The Philippines noted that Tonga has yet to accede to certain international 
conventions. It trusted that Tonga would attend to the need to protect vulnerable groups. It 
noted, despite the lack of adequate legislation in the area, the progress made to combat 
domestic violence, and encouraged Tonga to intensify efforts to protect the rights of women 
and children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Singapore commended Tonga&#8217;s commitment to promoting and protecting human

<p>study on domestic violence and cooperation with regional and relevant United Nations 
organizations. It also noted Tonga&#8217;s achievements in improving access of the population to 
</p>
<p>education and the fact that Tonga was on track to meet Millennium Development Goal 2. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Slovakia welcomed the implementation of legislative reforms and the establishment 
of a new parliamentary system. It appreciated Tonga&#8217;s efforts to tackle discrimination and 
</p>
<p>violence against women. It noted Tonga&#8217;s recognition of an absolute prohibition of torture 
</p>
<p>since 2007 and acknowledged the establishment of a standards unit to address police 
conduct. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Slovenia, with regard to the integration of a gender perspective in Tongan policies, 
noted positive developments in the protection of women&#8217;s rights, such as the establishment 
of the National Domestic Violence Unit. It observed that Tonga was unlikely to achieve 
Millennium Development Goal 3 in a timely manner. Slovenia noted that the age of 
criminal responsibility in Tonga was 8 years, which was below the international standard. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Spain highlighted the significant improvement of political rights in Tonga since the 
2009 constitutional reform and applauded Tonga&#8217;s openness to technical cooperation. The 
</p>
<p>identification of an agency or executive ministry to guarantee coordination with 
international human rights organizations would be instrumental in improving the human 
rights situation in the country. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Switzerland noted with satisfaction that Tonga had accepted its recommendations 
regarding ratification of international human rights treaties, but four years following the 
agreement to ratify those treaties, little progress has been made in that regard. It noted with 
interest the discussion on ratification of CEDAW but believed that all countries should 
ratify the core treaties. It made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>47. Thailand congratulated Tonga for the progress achieved in human rights through 
significant political reforms. It welcomed Tonga&#8217;s consideration of the establishment of a 
national human rights institution and ratification of various treaties and urged the country to 
accede to CEDAW and other human rights instruments. It commended the Government&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to empower and eliminate violence against women. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Timor-Leste commended Tonga for strengthening democratic institutions and 
improving access to education. It noted, however, that the age of majority differed among

carried out to accede to CEDAW with a reservation and hoped that Tonga would soon 
accede to the Convention and withdraw its reservation. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Trinidad and Tobago congratulated Tonga on the constitutional and political reforms 
made and encouraged Tonga to build on those foundations. It noted with satisfaction the

</p>
<p>strengthening human rights education. It applauded Tonga for actively engaging in climate 
change issues at the regional and international levels. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Turkey commended Tonga&#8217;s efforts to accede to core international treaties and 
encouraged Tonga to continue in that vein. It welcomed dialogue aimed at establishing a 
human rights mechanism at the national level. Turkey welcomed also the decision to review 
legislation on violence against women and children and hoped that new legislation 
addressing all forms of domestic violence would be enacted. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>51. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland encouraged Tonga to 
establish a human rights institution in compliance with the Paris Principles. It called on 
Tonga to take steps to advance the legal position of women and asked how Tonga planned 
to address discriminatory rules against women. While taking note of Police Act 2010, it </p>

conduct. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. The United States of America was concerned about Tonga&#8217;s failure to adequately 
combat domestic violence and discrimination against women. It commended the Police 
Force and the Ministry of Justice for adopting a &#8220;no drop&#8221; policy. Conversely, it was 
concerned that children born in wedlock cannot be legally and fully adopted and that 
consensual sex between same sex adults is criminalized. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Uruguay acknowledged Tonga&#8217;s accession to ICCPR and ICESCR. It was 
concerned that Tonga was not a party to CEDAW and considered that Tonga&#8217;s accession to 
this convention would be an important step in adjusting national standards to universal 
standards. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Viet Nam noted the efforts and seriousness of Tonga in protecting and promoting 
human rights and in implementing the recommendations of the UPR first cycle. It 
commended Tonga, a developing country, on achievements in constitution building, 
legislative reform and implementation of the Millennium Development Goals. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Algeria noted Tonga&#8217;s legislative reforms and the establishment of a new 
parliamentary system. However, it also noted that, while Tongan Courts already apply some 
core human rights conventions, ratification would be useful to their further advancement. It 
appreciated Tonga&#8217;s positive steps in promoting women&#8217;s participation in public life. 
However, no women have yet been elected to Parliament and their economic empowerment 
faces persistent challenges in relation to low employment levels and wage gaps. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Angola acknowledged legislation adopted regarding the rights of persons with 
disabilities and the right to education, and welcomed the efforts made by Tonga in 
promoting and protecting the rights of women, including those pertaining to employment, 
and especially the new policy of the civil service commission, which includes increased 
maternity leave for civil servants. It also welcomed Tonga&#8217;s Strategic Development 
Framework 2011-2014, including greater autonomy for women. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>57. Argentina congratulated Tonga on the establishment of the Food, Women and 
Community Youth Development Division and commended the implementation of the 
Young Emerging Leaders Programme aimed at preparing young people to be human rights 
defenders. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>58. Australia commended Tonga&#8217;s reforms since 2010. It considered that Tonga needs 
to extend its efforts to fully achieve Millennium Development Goal 3, despite its progress 
to meet gender equality in education. Australia commended Tonga&#8217;s efforts to promote 
gender equality and for progressing work on a Family Protection Bill, nevertheless, rates of 
domestic violence remain high. Australia noted that the death penalty remains applicable; 
however, it recognized that Tonga is abolitionist in practice. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Bhutan applauded Tonga&#8217;s strides in meeting the challenges and constraints it faced 
by promoting the political, economic and social rights of its population and protecting 
women, children and persons with disabilities, including the reforms of 2010. It noted 
Tonga&#8217;s efforts to advance the position of women and combat gender-based violence and 
discrimination. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Brazil appreciated the reforms initiated in Tonga, including the information policy 
of 2012. It welcomed Tonga&#8217;s submission to public consultation of a bill to address 
violence against women; adoption of this bill would be an important step towards further 
protection of human rights. It also welcomed Tonga&#8217;s efforts to accede to CEDAW. It </p>


<p>asked Tonga to consider reviewing the legal age of majority to ensure social equity in this 
respect. Brazil made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>61. Burundi strongly encouraged Tonga to pursue its policy to combat violence against 
women and corporal punishment inflicted on children. It welcomed Tonga&#8217;s efforts in 
fighting discrimination based on social class, religion and race. Furthermore, it encouraged 
Tonga to ensure that its labour code is actually enacted. Burundi made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Canada noted Tonga&#8217;s progress in combating corruption. It asked what specific steps 
has been taken to improve governance, and what further steps are planned in this respect as 
well as to eventually eliminate graft in the public sector. It welcomed the reforms 
introduced in 2010, which should be consolidated to eventually lead Tonga to become a 
fully representative democracy. Canada remained concerned that freedom of speech and the 
press are not always protected in practice. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Chile stated that Tonga&#8217;s extremely vulnerable status with regard to climate and sea 
level variations imposes on its authorities a duty to confront such challenges, with the 
technical assistance of the international community. Chile appreciated the legislative 
reforms on violence against women and children, and the process initiated to discuss and 
adopted a comprehensive legislation to combat domestic violence. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. China appreciated Tonga&#8217;s efforts to promote and protect human rights, including 
gender equality, elimination of violence against women and human rights education for the 
police. It noted that Tonga has signed CRPD and is considering accession to CEDAW.

community should provide Tonga with necessary financial and technical assistance in 
support of its social and economic development. It made a recommendation. 
</p>

Tonga to gradually promote equity. It also highlighted Tonga&#8217;s human rights training for 
police, security and penitentiary personnel. It was concerned at Tonga&#8217;s poor ratification 
record of international human rights instruments and weak legal framework to protect 
human beings. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Cuba recognized Tonga&#8217;s progress in seeking better protection and promotion of 
human rights for all its citizens and specifically stressed progress in the area of human 
development indicators, the fight against poverty and health system improvement, despite 
financial limitations. Cuba welcomed the high level of literacy and advancement in higher 
education in Tonga. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>67. Estonia recognized the importance of the human rights agenda in Tonga. It invited 
Tonga to show strong commitment to justice and the rule of law, to ratify the Rome Statute 
of the International Criminal Court and fully align its legislation therewith, to accede to the 
Agreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the Court and to protect women&#8217;s rights. It 
commended Tonga on its freedom of information policy, while encouraging it to take 
further steps with regard to freedom of expression and information. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. France noted that Tonga has ratified only very few international human rights 
instruments and that no progress has been made in that area since Tonga&#8217;s UPR in 2008. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. Guatemala highlighted Tonga&#8217;s progress to combat domestic violence, despite the 
lack of national legislation on domestic violence or the criminalization of marital rape. It 
encouraged Tonga to continue presenting information on the achievements of its National 
Domestic Violence Unit. The Tongan Supreme Court has upheld absolute prohibition of </p>


<p>torture, despite Tonga&#8217;s non-ratification of the international convention against torture and 
its lack of legal provisions thereon. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>70. Hungary noted with satisfaction the progressive developments in Tonga, including 
democratic elections in 2010, women&#8217;s increased participation and incorporation of 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards into police training curricula. It welcomed the steps 
taken to ensure equality in education, health care and employment for women and persons 
with disabilities, although gender discrimination persists with regard to land ownership and 
inheritance. Hungary noted that Tonga has not yet ratified CAT. It made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>71. Lord Vaea of the Tonga delegation thanked States for the warm reception of 
Tonga&#8217;s second national report and the efforts to provide useful and valuable 
</p>
<p>recommendations. He added that the immediate response by the delegates would encourage 
Tonga to continue its commitment to human rights. He stated that the recommendations 
offered were consistent with Tonga&#8217;s objectives and indicated that most of the 
recommendations would be considered favourably. 
</p>
<p>72. Lord Vaea stated that Tonga would definitely take the recommendations to heart and 
would work to prioritize what it can achieve in the near future, leaving other 
recommendations as a goal for achievement further down the track. 
</p>
<p>73. Tonga, however, wished to provide the following brief comments about some of the 
interventions. 
</p>
<p>74. Regarding rape within a marriage, the Criminal Offences Act was amended in 1999 
and criminalizes rape in marriage. 
</p>
<p>75. Regarding ratification of the Rome Statute, Tonga is in the process of obtaining a 
policy decision to sign the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>76. Concerning Brazil&#8217;s enquiry regarding reviewing the legal provisions for the age of 
maturity, Tonga stated that there is a general provision relating to the age of maturity for 
the nobility in the Constitution and there are other provisions in the criminal, land and other 
contexts that provide for maturity for all. So far this has not being a legal issue in Tonga, 
but it will review the situation and consider whether to have one general provision for age 
of maturity and realign the other legal provisions. 
</p>
<p>77. Concerning the question from Canada regarding corruption, Tonga is continuing to 
strengthen anti-corruption measures by proposing an overarching Good Governance 
Commission to support the Anti-Corruption Commissioner and the new Ombudsman in 
their activities, while at the same time maintaining their independence. Within the public 
service, the Audit Office regularly audits Government ministries and agencies. The Public 
Service Commission is also effective in combating corruption within the public service. 
</p>
<p>78. In closing, Lord Vaea thanked the Secretariat and translation staff for their 
assistance.
