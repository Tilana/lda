<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 8/1 of 18 June 2008, requested the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the Conference 
Services Division (now the Division of Conference Management) at the United Nations Office at 
Geneva to assess the situation concerning delays in submission of documents to the Council, 
including those relating to the universal periodic review, and in particular the delays in the 
translation of documents into the six official languages of the United Nations, and to report back 
to the Council at its ninth session with proposals for adequate measures to address these 
problems. The Office of the High Commissioner and the Division of Conference Management 
have jointly reviewed the situation and the factors contributing to the issue. The first chapter of 
the present report reflects the conclusions regarding requirements to adequately support the 
meetings and mechanisms of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>2. In the same resolution, the Council requested the Department of Public Information 
to make an assessment of the situation pursuant to the Council&#8217;s affirmation that it would 
consider favourably the adoption of a decision on the webcasting of all public proceedings of its 
various working groups, taking into account the principles of transparency, equal treatment and 
non-selectivity and to report back to the Council at its ninth session with proposals for adequate 
measures, including the necessary resources to establish a permanent capacity for webcasting. 
Chapter II of this report presents the assessment of the Department of Public Information on the 
overall requirements for its services in respect of the Council and its machinery, including press 
and all media coverage. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  CONFERENCE SERVICING 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Background 
</b></p>
<p>3. With the establishment of the Human Rights Council, the pattern of conferences at the 
United Nations Office at Geneva became extremely dynamic and demanding in terms of 
services. The many activities of the Council and its mechanisms make advance planning of 
meetings difficult and they severely complicate the even distribution over the year of the overall 
conference workload. Furthermore, several new human rights mandates have been approved by 
the General Assembly, generating an additional workload for both meetings servicing and 
document processing. A summary of the new activities of the Human Rights Council machinery 
is included in annex I. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Human Rights Council activities 
</b></p>
<p>4. In addition to the 10 weeks of meetings that the Human Rights Council held pursuant to 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, the Council can hold, as summarized in 
the non-paper of the Facilitator on the Council&#8217;s methods of work and rules of procedure 
(A/HRC/4/122), the following activities: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Open-ended organizational meetings at the beginning of each Council year to consider 
the agenda, set the annual programme of work and other procedural issues </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/18 
page 4 
 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Organizational meetings before and, if necessary, during each Council session to 
discuss organizational and procedural issues particular to that session (convened by the 
President of the Council) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Informative consultations/meetings on prospective resolutions or decisions (organized 
by the President of the Council or convened by main sponsors) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Interactive dialogues, panel debates, seminars and round tables 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Consultations before the holding of special sessions; and 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Special and ad hoc sessions 
</p>
<p>5. Since the establishment of the Human Rights Council, the Division of Conference 
Management has provided the following documentation services for the Council: a total of 
3,469 original pages processed in 2006;<b>1</b> 7,921 pages processed in 2007; and 5,<footnote name="1">6. As shown in detail in annex I, several new human rights bodies and activities have been 
established since 2006, all of which produce large additional volumes of documentation 
(including summary records, in some cases) to be processed, for which commensurate resources 
have not been allocated. As from early 2009, two new treaty bodies, namely the Committee on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Committee on Enforced Disappearances will also 
require full conference services. </footnote>40 pages 
processed (through 30 June) in 2008. Summary records for all plenary and organizational 
meetings of the Council were provided in 2006 and 2007. In order to release some capacity to 
compensate the lack of funding provided for the universal periodic review documents, it was 
informally agreed that summary record coverage for meetings of the Council and its subsidiary 
bodies not be provided in 2008. For 12 weeks of meetings, this measure saved the equivalent of 
2,700 pages and 180 days of translator time. The meetings were recorded and, if resources 
become available, these summary records will be produced retroactively, though with a 
considerable delay. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Universal periodic review activities 
</b></p>
<p>6. At the first session, the Human Rights Council determined, in its decision 1/103, to 
establish an intersessional open-ended intergovernmental working group to develop the 
modalities of the universal periodic review mechanism, and that the working group shall have at 
its disposal 10 days (or 20 3-hour meetings) of fully serviced meetings. This working group met, 
as envisioned, in 2007. Pursuant to resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007 on institution-building of the 
Human Rights Council, the entitlement of the working group was extended from two weeks to 
three sessions of two weeks each. The same resolution made provision for the documentation 
related to the universal periodic review. These entitlements were approved by General Assembly 
resolution 62/219 of 22 December 2007. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Assessment of documentation 
</b></p>
<p>7. The universal periodic review working group has held two sessions in 2008, from 7 
to 18 April and from 5 to 16 May. As outlined in Council resolution 5/1, for each State under 
review three pre-session documents (limited to a combined total of 40 pages) and a report on the 
</p>

<p>outcome of the review were to be submitted. (Resolution 5/1 did not provide details regarding 
the report of the outcome of the review. In April 2008, the President of the Council provided 
additional details about these reports, but did not define their length.) Sixteen State party reports 
were examined at each of the first two sessions, and reports on each State were presented to the 
Council at its eighth session.

<p>A detailed explanation of the documents submission for the two universal periodic review 
sessions is submitted in annex IV.  
</p>
<p>8. Documentation to be submitted for the third session (to be held in December 2008) of the 
universal periodic review is forecast to comprise 1,038 standard pages (48 documents) for the 
pre-session, 467 pages (16 documents) for the session itself, and 285 pages (17 documents) for 
the post-session, making a total of 1,790 pages and 81 documents. It is anticipated that future 
sessions will follow this documentation pattern. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Costs of the documentation 
</b></p>
<p>9. The pre- and post-session universal periodic review documents for the first two sessions of 
the working group in 2008, together with the pre-session documents submitted to the Council 
(1,001 estimated standard pages), comprise a total of 186 documents, amounting to 
4,<footnote name="2">6. As was the case with additional information costs, a more stable situation had been 
expected for 2008-2009. Proposals for financing webcasting in Geneva were submitted in the 
overall report (A/62/125) to the General Assembly on Human Rights Council financing. 
A phased approach was suggested, involving the provision of resources for temporary staff and 
equipment through the end of 2009 and a technical study during that period resulting in the 
establishment of a permanent Webcast Section with the staff posts, permanent equipment and the 
operating budget needed to service the Human Rights Council and other entities in Geneva. 
However, the General Assembly allocated no additional funds. </footnote>86 estimated standard pages of text. Based on the actual number of estimated standard pages 
submitted for translation into the six official languages, as well as reproduction and distribution 
during the first two sessions of the working group (i.e., excluding the 1,001 pages of universal

<p>periodic review-related reports produced for the Council), estimated costs to date amount to 
US$ 3,857,<footnote name="2">5. A particular difficulty is presented when the Council decides to convene special sessions to 
address emergency human rights situations, one of the new prerogatives of that reformed body of 
which it has already made extensive use; it has held seven special sessions to date. In the absence 
of permanent staff and webcasting facilities in Geneva, it is often difficult and extremely 
expensive to provide staff and equipment on short notice for the webcasting of the special 
sessions. Moreover, the Council&#8217;s first two years have been characterized by frequent scheduling 
changes. This has created difficulties relating to recruitment and procurement procedures, travel 
arrangements and staff assignments in New York, commitments vis-&#224;-vis temporary staff and 
credibility with local suppliers. It has also added to the cost of the service itself. 
</footnote>49.<b>4</b> The estimated costs for the third annual session of the working group will add 
another US$ 2,481,827. 
</p>
<p>10. The statement of financial implications concerning resolution 5/1, dated 15 June 2007, 
estimated that universal periodic review conference-servicing costs under section 2, 
General Assembly Affairs and Conference Services, would total US$ 3,847,<footnote name="3">2 meetings 1,700 pages US$4,052,760 No funds/resources 
received by DCM. </footnote>00 per year. This 
was to have covered the three annual sessions of the universal periodic review, a total of 
60 meetings with interpretation services in six languages, as well as a total of 1,<footnote name="1">5. The Human Rights Council has been generating new mandates since its inception. In 
nearly all cases, the General Assembly has requested the Secretary-General to accommodate 
these new activities from within existing resources. This was the case of the working group on 
the review of mandates (which was allotted 20 working days of meetings), and the working 
group on the agenda (which was allotted 10 working days of meetings), as well as the high-level 
task force on the implementation of the right to development (to which Council resolution 4/4 
assigned two additional working days of meetings). The same applies to the Committee on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. The 
General Assembly, in its resolution 62/156, adopted on 18 December 2007, requests the 
Secretary-General to provide the resources necessary, from within existing resources of the 
United Nations, for the Committee to meet for two separate sessions in 2008, the first session to 
be of two consecutive weeks&#8217; duration and the second session to be of one week&#8217;s duration. 
</footnote>20 estimated 
standard pages of documents to be translated into six official languages. It was subsequently 
recognized that these documentation requirements were incorrectly stated; the figures included in 
the statement of financial implications were for one session only. Thus, the actual forecast 
should have been three times higher: a total of 3,<footnote name="3">2. Since its inception, the proceedings of the Council have been filmed with television 
broadcast quality cameras, and the coverage has been used for news production, occasional live 
broadcasts and webcasting. Although this quality of coverage is expensive and higher than the 
requirements specifically for webcasting, the use of a single system for both broadcast and 
webcast purposes is in line with practice at United Nations Headquarters where the proceedings 
of major organs are filmed in their entirety with broadcast-quality cameras. Unlike at 
United Nations Headquarters, however, conference rooms in Geneva are not equipped with fixed 
television cameras. For this reason, it has been necessary to rent the equipment needed for 
Council for broadcast and webcast coverage and to hire temporary staff. </footnote>60 estimated standard pages for three sessions. 
(It should also be noted that this estimate has proven to be low, given that nearly that amount has 
already been submitted for the first two sessions.) These revised documentation forecasts would 
result in substantially higher estimated costs under section 2. Unfortunately, it was too late to 
insert the changes in the report to the General Assembly, and thus the amount of US$ 3,847,300 
was presented as the requirements. The final General Assembly budget review allocated only 
US$ 874,000 for the full servicing of three 2008 sessions of the universal periodic review 
working group, a reduction of 77 per cent from the initial figure and only 11 per cent of the 
amount actually required for 2008. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Additional considerations 
</b></p>
<p>11. The back-to-back scheduling of the first two sessions of the universal periodic review 
working group exacerbated the difficulties that the Division of Conference Management 
experienced in processing the voluminous documentation. Similar difficulties were created for 
the timely submission of those documents for processing. None of the deadlines were met, which 
increased the pressure on its already overstretched resources of the Division. Furthermore, 
differing interpretations regarding the approved document lengths resulted in a much larger 
volume of documentation than planned (resolution 5/1 provided for 40 pages of pre-session 
documentation for each State under review, whereas actual submissions averaged 75 estimated 
standard pages for each State). The same situation applied to post-session documentation. 
Outcome reports of the universal periodic review working group for the States under review 
were not expected to exceed 10 pages each, whereas the actual outcome reports averaged 
27 pages in length. In total, therefore, while the Division had planned to process 1,600 estimated 
standard pages for the two universal periodic review sessions, more than twice that volume was 
submitted. 
</p>
<p>12. Meeting deadlines for the issuance of documentation is challenging even in ordinary 
circumstances when meetings overlap, or when reports arising out of one meeting are used as 
input for another. The outcome of both universal periodic review working group sessions was 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  This amount covers the translation in six languages of 3,<footnote name="2">4. Since webcasting was an innovation in Geneva and no provision had been made in the 
programme budget 2006-2007, the costs of webcasting the Council&#8217;s sessions were originally 
met through a combination of the existing resources of the Department of Public Information, 
OHCHR, the Division of Administration of the United Nations Office at Geneva and a voluntary 
contribution from the Host Government. Providing this service involved the recruitment of 
temporary staff and rental of equipment in Geneva, as well as the travel of United Nations 
webcast staff of the Department of Public Information from New York. This arrangement 
created a number of challenges. 
</footnote>85 original estimated pages 
</p>
<p>submitted for the first two sessions of the universal periodic review, as well as their reproduction 
and distribution workload. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/9/18

</p>
<p>scheduled for discussion at the eighth session of the Human Rights Council in June 2008, yet the 
opening of the Council session came only six weeks after the end of the first working group 
session and two weeks from the end of the second. Therefore, these documents could not 
ipso facto meet the 10-week deadline. 
</p>
<p>13. Temporary staff is recruited to assist with translation of documentation for anticipated 
periods of peak workload as forecast from the 10-week submission deadline. However, those 
temporary resources are contracted for a specific period. As a result, when documentation is 
submitted late, these additional resources are not fully in phase with the excess workload. Such 
was the case for the universal periodic review working group documentation. In this context, it 
should be noted that there is a limited supply of experienced translators, editors and interpreters 
in Geneva due to the heavy competition with the International Labour Organization, the 
World Health Organization and other Geneva-based organizations, not to mention the European 
institutions, which reserve conference-servicing staff two to three years in advance. This depletes 
the local and European freelance markets during certain periods of the year. The usual lead time 
for recruiting freelance translation staff is several months, thus making it very difficult to 
accommodate changing schedules and the late submission of documents with temporary staffing. 
</p>
<p>14. Finally, it should be noted that the backlog of summary records to be translated for 
official meetings has grown each year from 1998 to the present. The backlog includes drafting 
records for 97 meetings (not including the 2008 Human Rights Council meetings) and more 
than 87,000 pages (including only summary records pending from 1998-2007) remain to be 
translated - the equivalent of having 131 translators and revisers work for one full year. The 
continuing growth in this backlog reflects the inadequacy of the existing capacity in the 
Languages Service to meet the ever-increasing workload. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Additional human rights conference activities 
</b></p>
<p>A/HRC/9/18 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>17. The Durban review process, which includes sessions of the Preparatory Committee, an 
open-ended intergovernmental working group and five regional conferences, is scheduled to take 
place in 2008 and 2009. Although mandated by the General Assembly in its resolution 62/220, 
there has been no budgetary provision approved for the required conference services. The report 
of the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly (see A/C.5/62/21, para. 15) suggests that the 
additional requirements represent a charge against the contingency fund and, as such, would 
require additional appropriations under the proposed programme budget to be still approved by 
the General Assembly. Although this process can be considered a one-time ad hoc requirement, 
the resource implications are enormous, and it can be anticipated that similar such ad hoc events 
will continue to be added to the United Nations Office at Geneva calendar in the future. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  INFORMATION SERVICES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Press, radio and television requirements 
</b></p>
<p>18. The United Nations Information Service provides press, radio, television and photo 
coverage of United Nations issues and events in Geneva. This involves preparing press releases 
in English and French of all public meetings of the Human Rights Council, including those of its 
major subsidiary bodies, producing television news reports and features for distribution to 
national and international broadcasters and television news agencies, producing radio news 
reports and programmes for dissemination through United Nations Radio New York, and 
providing photos for United Nations and media publication. 
</p>
<p>19. To carry out these duties throughout the year, the Service&#8217;s staff is augmented by 
temporary collaborators and its permanent production capacity is increased through the rental 
of additional equipment as required. Traditionally, sufficient funding was allocated under 
relevant budgetary lines to cover human rights meetings, including the six-week session of the 
then-Commission on Human Rights. 
</p>
<p>20. With the advent of the Human Rights Council, there was a major increase in the number of 
regularly scheduled meetings requiring coverage. Existing resources are thus insufficient to 
recruit temporary English- and French-language press officers; English-, French- and 
Spanish-language radio producers; English-language television producers; as well as 
cameramen, radio engineers and photographers to service the additional meetings. 
</p>
<p>21. In keeping with the Organization&#8217;s zero-growth budget policy for the 2008-2009 biennium, 
the Information Service in Geneva was instructed, along with the Department of Public 
Information as a whole, to limit its resource request to the same level as in previous bienniums. 
The additional funding required for the various information coverage aspects of the Human 
Rights Council, as requested by the Council in its decision 3/104, was included in a separate, 
comprehensive report to the General Assembly (A/62/125). However, the General Assembly 
approved no additional budgetary allocation to the Department for this purpose. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/9/18 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Webcasting requirements 
</b></p>
<p>22. To highlight the newly created Human Rights Council during its inaugural high-level 
segment, the webcasting of Council proceedings, including live broadcasts as well as archived 
video by date and speaker, was initiated in consultation with OHCHR and the Host Government. 
It quickly became apparent that this service met a crucial need for a higher level of transparency 
and openness in the Council&#8217;s work. 
</p>
<p>23. Provision of webcasting service to the Human Rights Council comprises the following 
elements: 
</p>
<p> (a) Filming of individual speakers and television coverage of that work;  
</p>
<p> (b) Encoding and live transmission coverage via the Internet; 
</p>
<p> (c) Logging and timing of the individual speakers and archiving of that information;  
</p>
<p> (d) Online publishing of webcast video and development and maintenance of the 
Human Rights Council Webcast website. 
</p>
<p>A/HRC/9/18 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>27. Because of the difficulties faced by the Department of Public Information in absorbing 
these costs, and given the balance of the voluntary contribution earmarked to support webcasting 
of Human Rights Council proceedings, a temporary division of financial responsibilities for 
webcasting was agreed until the establishment of a permanent capacity. This involved having the 
Department cover costs of the television coverage component and the actual webcast 
transmission of regular Council sessions on the Internet, with OHCHR financing the recruitment 
of webcast assistants to prepare speaker-by-speaker archives of the sessions and the travel and 
replacement costs for a New York-based webcast producer. OHCHR also continues to cover 
from voluntary contributions all the costs associated with special sessions of the Council.  
</p>
<p>28. As the Human Rights Council&#8217;s working methods have developed, there have been an 
increasing number of ad hoc requests for webcasting of other meetings. In the first half of 2008, 
this became a critical issue in relation to the new centerpiece of the Council&#8217;s work, the universal 
periodic review, as well as for the Durban Review Conference&#8217;s preparatory committee process. 
The Department of Public Information was asked to webcast the universal periodic review 
meetings, creating a precedent given that working group meetings do not usually receive such 
coverage at Headquarters. A statement from the President of the Council indicated that the 
Council would &#8220;consider favourably the adoption of a decision on the webcasting of all public 
proceedings of its various working groups&#8221;, and this was echoed by the Council in its 
resolution 8/1. The financing for these sessions has also been covered entirely from voluntary 
contributions. 
</p>
<p>29. The number of meetings requiring webcasting, the sporadic addition of requests, the 
frequent schedule changes and the uncertain funding have had an adverse effect on the 
production work of the Radio and Television Section. While the limited staff and facilities are 
fully involved with webcasting, there is little capacity for news and feature production. Services 
to broadcasters have been reduced as well. 
</p>
<p>30. Webcasting of the Human Rights Council alone is expected to involve 26 weeks of 
meetings a year. The OHCHR secretariat has been asked to explore the feasibility of webcasting 
the proceedings of all the treaty bodies as well, a request indicative of a growing demand for 
webcasting of other major activities at the United Nations Office at Geneva. For the moment, 
except in rare cases in which special financing is available, these services cannot be provided. 
</p>
<p>31. It is thus apparent that a permanent webcast capacity for the United Nations Office at 
Geneva is urgently needed. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  The television coverage component 
</b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/9/18 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>33. A remote camera system is being installed in Conference Room XX of the Palais des 
Nations, which is presently under renovation. This has been designated as the standing location 
for Human Rights Council meetings, and the suitability of that system for webcast purposes is 
being explored. The viability of the system will be tested later this year. 
</p>
<p>34. However, to ensure a year-round ability to provide high-quality broadcast and webcast 
coverage, a major investment in cameras and production equipment and facilities will be 
required. The purchase of fixed camera coverage equipment would coincide with major 
technological changes in the television industry. Standard definition facilities are giving way to 
the sharper quality &#8220;high-definition&#8221;, or HD, equipment. The new fixed-camera coverage 
installation will necessitate a change in the whole television production line from 
standard-definition to high-definition equipment. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  The webcast component 
</b></p>
<p>35. Whatever option is selected for filming, a permanent webcasting capacity will require the 
creation of a well-staffed and equipped webcast section to handle the transmission and archiving 
of the meetings. For the Human Rights Council alone, this is expected to involve 26 weeks of 
meetings a year. As noted above, there is a growing demand for the webcasting of other major 
activities at UNOG as well, including possibly human rights treaty bodies. For the moment, 
except in rare cases in which special financing is available, these services cannot be provided. 
</p>
<p>36. In order to meet these requirements, the creation of a permanent webcast structure is 
envisaged to enable the simultaneous coverage of two events: e.g. the Human Rights Council 
and press conferences or briefings in English, French and the original language of the speaker. 
Coverage of any other meetings, bodies or events would only be possible when the Council is 
not in session. It should also be noted that webcasting of treaty body meetings would require 
additional infrastructure at the Palais Wilson, where most of those meetings are held, as well as 
more staff and equipment at the Palais des Nations. 
</p>
<p>37. The proposed study on a permanent webcasting capacity at the United Nations Office at 
Geneva, referred to in the report of the Secretary-General on budgetary matters (A/62/125) 
submitted to the General Assembly in 2007, remains the best way to accurately determine the 
actual needs for the establishment of such a capacity. In the absence of the Assembly&#8217;s approval 
of the funding for the Human Rights Council webcast requirements, DPI identified with some 
difficulty other resources to conduct that essential study, which is now being initiated. This will 
entail a detailed examination of the facilities and equipment that are already available, including 
the proposed facilities in Conference Room XX at the Palais des Nations as well as a 
determination of additional equipment and staffing needs. After a thorough analysis of these 
elements a final proposal, including the resources required, will be presented for consideration 
by the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>38. <b>It is an unassailable fact that the demand for conference services for the 
Human Rights Council and its machinery is growing. In recognition of the increase of 
some 508 meetings per year, permanent posts for one full extra team of interpreters 
(20 posts) at the United Nations Office at Geneva were authorized by the General Assembly </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/9/18 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p><b>in December 2007 for the 2008-2009 biennium (see A/62/125 and A/62/563/Add.1). At the 
same time, resources for contractual translation were doubled - offset by a cut in 
temporary assistance for meetings - and five senior reviser posts were authorized to 
provide quality control for outsourced translations. However no similar provisions were 
approved by the General Assembly to address the concomitant increase in requirements 
for referencing, editing, translating and typing of over 10,000 additional pages5 of related 
reports mentioned in annex I, in addition to estimated 3,079 standard pages by which the 
universal periodic review mechanism in 2008 is expected to exceed the estimates prepared 
for its sessions. Similarly, no provision has been made for additional drafting and in-house 
translation of summary records. 
</b></p>
<p>39. <b>Experience has shown that current Division of Conference Management 
document-processing capacity cannot meet the documentation requirements of the 
Human Rights Council and its subsidiary machinery. The lack of sufficient permanent 
conference capacity does not allow for the required flexibility and timeliness in 
accommodating urgent and unforeseen requests for meetings and processing of 
documentation. Additional staff resources, provisionally estimated at approximately 
US$ 7,500,000 per year, are accordingly urgently required to enable the Division to ensure 
the appropriate level of support required by the Human Rights Council. 
</b></p>
<p>40. <b>At the same time, there are inadequate resources for the necessary editing of 
documents prior to submission, which is a critical element of the timely documentation 
chain. The establishment of editor posts in OHCHR is accordingly required to address this 
aspect of the process. 
</b></p>
<p>41. <b>The Human Rights Council also requires significantly more media services than its 
predecessor body. To increase public awareness and understanding of its work, the 
provision of an adequate level of resources for information work is indispensable. 
Webcasting has been identified by the Council as a vital component in communication 
about its role and functioning. Effective and continuous delivery of webcasting and all 
media services require stable, permanent personnel and facilities. In order to provide these 
services, the Department of Public Information will require additional infrastructure of 
approximately US$ 2,500,000, supplemented by related staff and other recurring costs of 
approximately US$ 1,700,000. 
</b></p>
<p>42. <b>A report detailing these resource requirements will be prepared for submission to the 
General Assembly during its sixty-third session.

</b>  This paper emphasizes the different kinds of documentation (pre-, in- and post-session) 
</p>
<p>because different deadlines apply to them. Repeated General Assembly resolutions stipulate that, 
except in special cases, pre-session documents should be submitted for processing and 
translation no later than ten weeks before the beginning of the session at which they are to be 
discussed, and made available to delegations in all relevant languages six weeks before the 
opening of the session. In-session documentation is supposed to be translated within 48 hours of 
submission (24 hours at Headquarters, which operates night and weekend shifts for the purpose). 
Post-session documentation is not normally subject to such rigorous time limits except where the 
outcome of one meeting (generally of a subsidiary body) is treated as input for another; in that 
case, the 10/6-week rule applies. </p>
