<P align=justify>On September 13, 2013, we entered into a securities purchase
agreement with JDF Capital Inc., pursuant to which JDF Capital has agreed to
provide our company with an aggregate investment of $500,000 in consideration of
our issuance of convertible promissory notes and common share purchase
warrants.</P>
<P align=justify>On September 16, 2013 JDF Capital funded a first installment of
$250,000 in consideration of a secured convertible promissory note in the amount
of $306,250, being $250,000 and 18 months prepaid interest at 15%. The note has
a maturity date of 18 months from September 16, 2013. As additional
consideration, we have also issued to JDF Capital 3.125.500 warrants with each
warrant exercisable for the purchase of 1 common share for a period of five
years. The exercise price will be $0.07 per share, subject to anti-dilution
adjustment. JDF Capital may, in the alternative, exercise the warrants on a
cashless basis in the event the shares underlying the warrants are not
registered in a registration statement within 6 months of the securities
purchase agreement. The cashless exercise price will be the quotient obtained by
dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:</P>

<P align=justify>The second $250,000 installment of the financing is payable by
October 15, 2013, whereupon we will issue a second convertible promissory note
upon the same terms. Additional warrants with an aggregate exercise price of
$250,000 will also be issued with the number of underlying shares to be based on
the lowest closing price of our common shares in the 20 trading days preceding
the October 15, 2013 closing.</P>
<P align=justify>Once issued, each convertible promissory note will be
convertible in whole or in part at JDF Capital&#146;s option before or after 
maturity
into shares of our common stock at a conversion price equal to a 50% discount to
the lowest closing price of our common shares in the 20 trading days preceding
(i) the date of the purchase agreement; or (ii) the conversion date.
Notwithstanding the conversion right, JDF will not be entitled to hold in excess
of 9.99 percent of our issued and outstanding common shares at any time.</P>
<P align=justify>JDF Capital will have the option during the 18 month period
following September 13, 2013 to purchase additional convertible notes upon the

materials relating to the business, finances and operations of the Company and
materials relating to the offer and sale of the Securities which have been
requested by the Purchaser, including those set forth on in any annex attached

opportunity to ask questions of the Company and its management and have received
complete and satisfactory answers
to any such inquiries. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Purchaser has also had the opportunity to obtain and to review the Company's
filings on EDGAR (collectively, the &#147;Company's SEC Documents&#148;).</P>

transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly and validly authorized,
executed and delivered on behalf of the Purchaser and are valid and binding
agreements of the Purchaser enforceable in accordance with their respective

ETC.</B> The Company represents and warrants to the Purchaser as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>a. Rights of Others Affecting
the Transactions. </B>There are no preemptive rights of any shareholder of the
Company, as such, to acquire the Note, or any shares of the Company&#146;s 
common
stock that may be issued to the Purchaser in connection with any other
agreements between the parties, in the event such shares are issued. No party
other than a Purchaser has a currently exercisable right of first refusal which
would be applicable to any or all of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>b. Status.</B> The Company is
a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the State of Incorporation and has the requisite corporate power to own
its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted. The Company
is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the nature of the business conducted or
property owned by it makes such qualification necessary, other than those
jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify would not have or result in a
Material Adverse Effect. The Company has registered its stock and is obligated
to file reports pursuant to Section 12 or Section 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;1934 Act&#148;). The Common Stock 
is, or
immediately following the Closing Date will be, quoted on the Principal Trading
Market. The Company has received no notice, either oral or written, with respect
to the continued eligibility of the Common Stock for such quotation on the
Principal Trading Market, and the Company has maintained all requirements on its
part for the continuation of such quotation. </P>

execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the other Transaction
Documents by the Company, the issuance of the Securities, and the consummation
by the Company of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of
the Notes and the other Transaction Documents do not and will not conflict with

Company&#146;s SEC Documents contained, at the time they were filed, any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>h. Absence of Certain
Changes.</B> Since the Last Audited Date, there has been no material adverse
change and no Material Adverse Effect, except as disclosed in the Company&#146;s
SEC
Documents. Since the Last Audited Date, except as provided in the Company&#146;s
SEC
Documents, the Company has not (i) incurred or become subject to any material
liabilities (absolute or contingent) except liabilities incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices; (ii) discharged or satisfied
any material lien or encumbrance or paid any material obligation or liability
(absolute or contingent), other than current liabilities paid in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practices; (iii) declared or made any

labor or management in connection with the terms and conditions of their
employment.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>i. Full Disclosure. </B>To the
best of the Company&#146;s knowledge, there is no fact known to the Company 
(other
than general economic conditions known to the public generally or as disclosed
in the Company&#146;s SEC Documents) that has not been disclosed in writing to 
the
Purchaser that would reasonably be expected to have or result in a Material
Adverse Effect.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>j. Absence of Litigation.
</B>There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by
any court, public board or body pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened against or affecting the Company before or by any governmental
authority or nongovernmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or
instrumentality or any other person, wherein an unfavorable decision, ruling or
finding would have a Material Adverse Effect or which would adversely affect the
validity or enforceability of, or the authority or ability of the Company to
perform its obligations under, any of the Transaction Documents. The Company is
not aware of any valid basis for any such claim that (either individually or in
the aggregate with all other such events and circumstances) could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding or
unsatisfied judgments, orders, decrees, writs, injunctions or stipulations to
which the Company is a party or by which it or any of its properties is bound,
that involve the transaction contemplated herein or that, alone or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expect to have a Material Adverse Effect.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>k. Absence of Events of
Default. </B>Except as set forth in Section 3(e) and 3(g) hereof, (i) neither
the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is in default in the performance or
observance of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition
contained in any material indenture, mortgage, deed of trust or other material
agreement to which it is a party or by which its property is bound, and (ii) no
Event of Default (or its equivalent term), as defined in the respective
agreement to which the Company or its subsidiary is a party, and no event which,
with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, would become an Event
of Default (or its equivalent term) (as so defined in such agreement), has
occurred and is continuing, which would have a Material Adverse Effect.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>l. No Undisclosed Liabilities
or Events.</B> To the best of the Company&#146;s knowledge, the Company has no
liabilities or obligations other than those disclosed in the Transaction
Documents or the Company's SEC Documents or those incurred in the ordinary
course of the Company's business since the Last Audited Date, or which
individually or in the aggregate, do not or would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. No event or circumstances has occurred or exists with respect to the
Company or its properties, business, operations, condition (financial or
otherwise), or results of operations, which, under applicable law, rule or
regulation, requires public disclosure or announcement prior to the date hereof
by the Company but which has not been so publicly announced or disclosed. There
are no proposals currently under consideration or currently anticipated to be
under consideration by the Board of Directors or the executive officers of the
Company which proposal would (x) change the articles or certificate of
incorporation or other charter document or by-laws of the Company, each as
currently in effect, with or without shareholder approval, which change would
reduce or otherwise adversely affect the rights and powers of the shareholders
of the Common Stock or (y) materially or substantially change the business,
assets or capital of the Company, including its interests in subsidiaries.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>m. No Integrated Offering.
</B>Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates nor any Person acting on its
or their behalf has, directly or indirectly, at any time since December 31,
2007, made any offer or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any
security under circumstances that would eliminate the availability of the
exemption from registration under Regulation D in connection with the offer and
sale of the Securities as contemplated hereby.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>n. Dilution.</B> Any shares of
the Company&#146;s common stock issued to the Purchaser in connection with any
agreements between the parties hereto, in the event such shares are issued may
have a dilutive effect on the ownership interests of the other shareholders (and
Persons having the right to become shareholders) of the Company. The Company's
executive officers and directors have studied and fully understand the nature of
the Securities being sold hereby and recognize that they have such a potential
dilutive effect. The board of directors of the Company has concluded, in its
good faith business judgment, that such issuance is in the best interests of the
Company.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>o. Confirmation.</B> The
Company confirms that all statements of the Company contained herein shall
survive acceptance of this Agreement by the Purchaser. The Company agrees that,
if any events occur or circumstances exist prior to the Closing Date or the
release of the Purchase Amount to the Company which would make any of the
Company&#146;s representations, warranties, agreements or other information set 
forth
herein materially untrue or materially inaccurate as of such date, the Company
shall immediately notify the Purchaser (directly or through its counsel, if any)
in writing prior to such date of such fact, specifying which representation,
warranty or covenant is affected and the reasons therefor.</P>

</B>The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into
and to consummate the transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction
Documents and otherwise to carry out its obligations thereunder. The execution
and delivery of each of the Transaction Documents by the Company and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Company and no further
action is required by the Company in connection therewith. Each Transaction
Agreement has been (or upon delivery will have been) duly executed by the
Company and, when delivered in accordance with the terms hereof, will constitute
the valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms except (i) as limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws of general application
affecting enforcement of creditors&#146; rights generally and (ii) as limited by
laws
relating to the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>q. SEC Reports; Financial
Statements. </B>Other than as previously disclosed to the Purchaser, the Company
has filed all reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act,
including pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) thereof, for the two years
preceding the date hereof (or such shorter period as the Company was required by
law to file such material) (the foregoing materials, including the exhibits
thereto, being collectively referred to herein as the &#147;<U>SEC 
Reports</U>&#148;) on a
timely basis or has received a valid extension of such time of filing and has
filed any such SEC Reports prior to the expiration of any such extension. As of
their respective dates, the SEC Reports complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission promulgated thereunder, and none of the SEC Reports, when filed,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The financial statements of the Company comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and regulations
of the Commission with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing. Such
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (&#147;<U>GAAP</U>&#148;), except as may be otherwise 
specified in
such financial statements or the notes thereto and except that unaudited
financial statements may not contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly
present in all material respects the financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and the results of
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit adjustments.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>r. Sarbanes-Oxley; Internal
Accounting Controls.</B> The Company is in material compliance with all
provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 which are applicable to it as of
the Closing Date. The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i)
transactions are executed in accordance with management's general or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management's general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The
Company has established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in 
Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the
Company and designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that
material information relating to the Company, including its Subsidiaries, is
made known to the certifying officers by others within those entities,
particularly during the period in which the Company's most recently filed
periodic report under the Exchange Act, as the case may be, is being prepared.
The Company's certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's controls and procedures as of the date prior to the filing date of the
most recently filed periodic report under the Exchange Act (such date, the
&#147;<U>Evaluation Date</U>&#148;). The Company presented in its most recently 
filed
periodic report under the Exchange Act the conclusions of the certifying
officers about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based
on their evaluations as of the Evaluation Date. Since the Evaluation Date, there
have been no significant changes in the Company's internal controls (as such
term is defined in Item 307(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act) or, to
the Company's knowledge, in other factors that could significantly affect the
Company's internal controls.</P>

matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have or reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, the Company and each Subsidiary
has filed all necessary federal, state and foreign income and franchise tax
returns and has paid or accrued all taxes shown as due thereon, and the Company
has no knowledge of a tax deficiency which has been asserted or threatened
against the Company or any Subsidiary.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>t. No Disagreements with
Accountants and Lawyers.</B> There are no disagreements of any kind presently
existing, or reasonably anticipated by the Company to arise, between the
accountants and lawyers formerly or presently employed by the Company and the
Company is current with respect to any fees owed to its accountants and lawyers.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.</STRONG></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>a. Transfer Restrictions.</B>
The Purchaser acknowledges that (1) the Securities have not been and are not
being registered under the provisions of the 1933 Act and, the Shares have not
been and are not being registered under the 1933 Act, and may not be transferred
unless (A) subsequently registered thereunder or (B) the Purchaser shall have
delivered to the Company an opinion of counsel, reasonably satisfactory in form,
scope and substance to the Company, to the effect that the Securities to be sold
or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such
registration; (2) any sale of the Securities made in reliance on Rule 144
promulgated under the 1933 Act (&#147;Rule 144") may be made only in accordance 
with
the terms of said Rule and further, if said Rule is not applicable, any resale
of such Securities under circumstances in which the seller, or the Person
through whom the sale is made, may be deemed to be an underwriter, as that term
is used in the 1933 Act, may require compliance with some other exemption under
the 1933 Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder; and (3) neither
the Company nor any other Person is under any obligation to register the
Securities (other than pursuant to the Registration Rights Provisions) under the
1933 Act or to comply with the terms and conditions of any exemption
thereunder.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>b. Restrictive Legend.</B> The
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that the certificates and other instruments
representing any of the Securities shall bear a restrictive legend in
substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed
against transfer of any such Securities):</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-right: 5%" align=justify>&#147;THESE 
SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR THE SECURITIES LAWS
OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OFFERED FOR SALE IN THE ABSENCE OF AN
EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OR
OTHER EVIDENCE ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT
REQUIRED.&#148;</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>c. Filings</B>. The Company
undertakes and agrees to make all necessary filings in connection with the sale
of the Securities to the Purchaser under any United States laws and regulations
applicable to the Company, or by any domestic securities exchange or trading
market, and to provide a copy thereof to the Purchaser promptly after such
filing.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>d. Reporting Status</B>. So
long as the Purchaser beneficially owns any of the Securities, the Company shall
file all reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or
15(d) of the 1934 Act, shall take all reasonable action under its control to
ensure that adequate current public information with respect to the Company, as
required in accordance with Rule 144(c)(2) of the 1933 Act, is publicly
available, and shall not terminate its status as an issuer required to file
reports under the 1934 Act even if the 1934 Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder would permit such termination. The Company will take all reasonable
action under its control to maintain the continued listing and quotation and
trading of its Common Stock on the Principal Trading Market or a listing on the
NASDAQ/Small Cap or National Markets and, to the extent applicable to it, will
comply in all material respects with the Company&#146;s reporting, filing and 
other
obligations under the by-laws or rules of the Principal Trading Market and/or
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., as the case may be,
applicable to it for so long as the Purchaser beneficially owns any of the
Securities.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>e. Use of Proceeds</B>. The
Company will use the proceeds received hereunder (excluding amounts paid by the
Company for legal fees in connection with the sale of the Securities) for
working capital.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>f. Warrant. </B>The Company
agrees to issue the Warrants to the Purchaser on the applicable Closing Dates.
The form of Warrant is provided in <B>Annex II </B>annexed hereto, the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>g. Publicity, Filings,
Releases, Etc. </B>Each of the parties agrees that it will not disseminate any
information relating to the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby, including issuing any press releases, holding any press
conferences or other forums, or filing any reports (collectively, 
&#147;Publicity&#148;),
without giving the other party reasonable advance notice and an opportunity to
comment on the contents thereof. Neither party will include in any such
Publicity any statement or statements or other material to which the other party
reasonably objects, unless in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the party
proposing such statement, such statement is legally required to be
included. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company will provide to the
Purchaser drafts of the applicable text of the first filing of a Current Report
on Form 8-K or a Quarterly or Annual Report on Form 10-Q or 10-K intended to be
made with the SEC which refers to the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated thereby as soon as practicable (but at least two (2) Trading Days
before such filing will be made) will not include in such filing any statement
or statements or other material to which the other party reasonably objects,
unless in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the party proposing such
statement, such statement is legally required to be included. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each of the parties hereby consents to the inclusion of the text
of the Transaction Documents in filings made with the SEC as well as any
descriptive text accompanying or part of such filing which is accurate and
reasonably determined by the Company&#146;s counsel to be legally required.
Notwithstanding, but subject to, the foregoing provisions of this Section 4(i),
the Company will, after the Closing Date, promptly file a Current Report on Form
8-K or, if appropriate, a quarterly or annual report on the appropriate form,
referring to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>a. </B>The Company warrants
that, with respect to the Securities, other than the stop transfer instructions
to give effect to Section 4(a) hereof, it will give its transfer agent no
instructions inconsistent with instructions to issue Common Stock to the Holder
as contemplated in the Transaction Documents. Nothing in this Section shall
affect in any way the Purchaser's obligations and agreement to comply with all
applicable securities laws upon resale of the Securities. If the Purchaser
provides the Company with an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Company that registration of a resale by the Purchaser of any of the Securities
in accordance with clause (1)(B) of Section 4(a) of this Agreement is not
required under the 1933 Act, the Company shall (except as provided in clause (2)
of Section 4(a) of this Agreement) permit the transfer or reissue of the Shares
represented by one or more certificates for Common Stock without legend (or
where applicable, by electronic registration) in such name and in such
denominations as specified by the Purchaser.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>b. </B>The Company will
authorize the Transfer Agent to give information relating to the Company

the status of shares of Common Stock issued or claimed to be issued to the
Holder in connection with a Notice of Exercise or transfer of Pledged Shares to
the Holder, or (ii) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
of all shareholders (as a group, and not individually) as of a current or other
specified date. At the request of the Holder, the Company will provide the
Holder with a copy of the authorization so given to the Transfer Agent.</P>

authorized agents, and any such Purchaser Control Person becomes subject to,
resulting from, arising out of or relating to any misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or agreement on
the part of Company contained in this Agreement, as such Damages are incurred,
except to the extent such Damages result primarily from Purchaser's failure to
perform any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or the Purchaser's
or its officer&#146;s, director&#146;s, employee&#146;s, agent&#146;s or 
Purchaser Control Person&#146;s

<P

The Company hereby agrees that, if the Purchaser, other than by reason of its

non-appealable judgment to such effect), (x) becomes involved in any capacity in
any action, proceeding or investigation brought by any shareholder of the
Company, in connection with or as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents,

or investigation brought by the SEC, any self-regulatory organization or other
body having jurisdiction, against or involving the Company or in connection with

respect of all losses, claims, liabilities, damages or expenses resulting from,
imposed upon or incurred by the Purchaser, directly or indirectly, and reimburse
such Purchaser for its reasonable legal and other expenses (including the cost
of any investigation and preparation) incurred in connection therewith, as such
expenses are incurred. The indemnification and reimbursement obligations of the
Company under this paragraph shall be in addition to any liability which the
Company may otherwise have, shall extend upon the same terms and conditions to
any Affiliates of the Purchaser who are actually named in such action,
proceeding or investigation, and partners, directors, agents, employees and
Purchaser Control Persons (if any), as the case may be, of the Purchaser and any
such Affiliate, and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of any
successors, assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the Company, the
Purchaser, any such Affiliate and any such Person. The Company also agrees that
neither the Purchaser nor any such Affiliate, partner, director, agent, employee
or Purchaser Control Person shall have any liability to the Company or any

In the event any claim or demand in respect of which any Person claiming
indemnification under any provision of this Section (an &#147;Indemnified 
Party&#148;)
might seek indemnity under paragraph (a) of this Section is asserted against or
sought to be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a
party hereto or an Affiliate thereof (a &#147;Third Party Claim&#148;), the 
Indemnified
Party shall deliver a written notification, enclosing a copy of all papers
served, if any, and specifying the nature of and basis for such Third Party
Claim and for the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification that is being
asserted under any provision of this Section against any Person (the
&#147;Indemnifying Party&#148;), together with the amount or, if not then 
reasonably
ascertainable, the estimated amount, determined in good faith, of such Third
Party Claim (a &#147;Claim Notice&#148;) with reasonable promptness to the 
Indemnifying
Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim Notice with
reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice of such Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party's ability to defend has been prejudiced by such failure of
the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party
as soon as practicable within the period ending thirty (30) calendar days
following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of either a Claim Notice or an
Indemnity Notice (as defined below) (the &#147;Dispute Period&#148;) whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability or the amount of its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this Section and whether the Indemnifying Party desires,
at its sole cost and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third
Party Claim. The following provisions shall also apply.</P>

Party Claim pursuant to this paragraph (b) of this Section, then the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, such Third Party Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which
proceedings shall be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the Indemnifying
Party to a final conclusion or will be settled at the discretion of the
Indemnifying Party (but only with the consent of the Indemnified Party in the
case of any settlement that provides for any relief other than the payment of
monetary damages or that provides for the payment of monetary damages as to
which the Indemnified Party shall not be indemnified in full pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section). The Indemnifying Party shall have full control
of such defense and proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof;
provided, however, that the Indemnified Party may, at the sole cost and expense
of the Indemnified Party, at any time prior to the Indemnifying Party's delivery
of the notice referred to in the first sentence of this subparagraph (x), file
any motion, answer or other pleadings or take any other action that the
Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be necessary or appropriate protect its
interests; and provided further, that if requested by the Indemnifying Party,
the Indemnified Party will, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, provide reasonable cooperation to the Indemnifying Party in contesting
any Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party elects to contest. The
Indemnified Party may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement
of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
subparagraph (x), and except as provided in the preceding sentence, the
Indemnified Party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party may take
over the control of the defense or settlement of a Third Party Claim at any time
if it irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under paragraph (a) of this
Section with respect to such Third Party Claim. </P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%; MARGIN-RIGHT: 5%" align=justify>(y) If the
Indemnifying Party fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the Third Party Claim
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section, or if the Indemnifying Party gives
such notice but fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle the Third
Party Claim, or if the Indemnifying Party fails to give any notice whatsoever
within the Dispute Period, then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
defend, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Third Party
Claim by all appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted by
the Indemnified Party in a reasonable manner and in good faith or will be
settled at the discretion of the Indemnified Party (with the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld). The
Indemnified Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof; provided, however, that if
requested by the Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, provide reasonable cooperation to
the Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim which
the Indemnified Party is contesting. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this subparagraph (y), if the Indemnifying
Party has notified the Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability or the amount of its liability
hereunder to the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim and if
such dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner
provided in subparagraph(z) below, the Indemnifying Party will not be required
to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense pursuant to
this subparagraph (y) or of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein at
the Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party shall reimburse the
Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnifying Party in connection with such litigation. The Indemnifying Party
may participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by the
Indemnified Party pursuant to this subparagraph (y), and the Indemnifying Party
shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to such participation. </P>

Claim Notice shall be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party

Party has timely disputed its liability or the amount of its liability with
respect to such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute; provided,

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 2.2 <U>Remedies Upon An
Event of Default</U>. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be
continuing, the Holder of this Note may at any time at its option, (a) declare
the entire unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with all interest
accrued hereon, due and payable, and thereupon, the same shall be accelerated
and so due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest, or notice, all of
which are hereby expressly unconditionally and irrevocably waived by the
Company; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
described in (i) Sections 2.1 (k) or (l), the outstanding principal balance and
interest hereunder shall be automatically due and payable and (ii) Sections 2.1
(a)-(j) and 2.1(m) -(n), demand the prepayment of this Note pursuant to Section

of this Note then outstanding shall be converted into shares of Common Stock at
a Conversion Price (as defined in Section 3.2(a) hereof) per share calculated
pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof assuming that the date that the Event of Default
occurs is the Conversion Date and demand that all accrued and unpaid interest
under this Note shall be converted into shares of Common Stock in accordance
with Section 1.2 hereof, or (c) exercise or otherwise enforce any one or more of
the Holder&#146;s rights, powers, privileges, remedies and interests under this 
Note,
the Purchase Agreement, other Transaction Document or applicable law. No course
of delay on the part of the Holder shall operate as a waiver thereof or
otherwise prejudice the right of the Holder. No remedy conferred hereby shall be
exclusive of any other remedy referred to herein or now or hereafter available
at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.</P>

<P align=center>CONVERSION; ANTIDILUTION; PREPAYMENT</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.1 <U>Conversion
Option</U>.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) At any time on or after the
Issuance Date, this Note shall be convertible (in whole or in part), at the
option of the Holder (the &#147;<U>Conversion Option</U>&#148;), into such 
number of fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (the &#147;<U>Conversion 
Rate</U>&#148;) as
is determined by dividing that portion of the outstanding principal balance
under this Note as of such date that the Holder elects to convert by the
Conversion Price (as defined in Section 3.2(a) hereof) then in effect on the
date on which the Holder faxes a notice of conversion (the &#147;<U>Conversion
Notice</U>&#148;), duly executed, to the Company (the &#147;<U>Voluntary</U> 
<U>Conversion
Date</U>&#148;), provided, however, that the Conversion Price shall be subject 
to
adjustment as described in Section 3.5 below. The Holder shall deliver this Note
to the Company at the address designated in the Purchase Agreement at such time
that this Note is fully converted. With respect to partial conversions of this
Note, the Company shall keep written records of the amount of this Note
converted as of each Conversion Date. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) On any Voluntary Conversion
Date, the Holder may cause the any outstanding Principal Amount of this Note
plus all accrued and unpaid interest to convert into a number of fully paid and
nonassessable shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of the elected
outstanding principal amount of this Note plus all accrued interest on the
elected outstanding on the Voluntary Conversion Date (as described in this
Section below) divided by the Conversion Price as described in Section 3.2(a)
below.</P>
<P align=justify>Furthermore, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as
defined in Section 2.1 hereof), then to the extent permitted by law, the Company
will pay interest to the Holder, payable on demand, on the outstanding principal
balance of the Note from the date of the Event of Default until such Event of
Default is cured at the rate of the lesser of fifteen percent (15%) and the
maximum applicable legal rate per annum.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Conversion
Limitations</U>; <U>Holder&#146;s Restriction on Conversion</U>. The Company 
shall
not effect any conversion of this Note, and the Holder shall not have the right
to convert any portion of this Note, to the extent that after giving effect to 
such
conversion, the Holder (together with the Holder&#146;s affiliates), as set 
forth on
the applicable Conversion Notice, would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of
the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall
include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this
Note with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but
shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon
(A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted portion of this Note beneficially
owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates and (B) exercise or conversion of
the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company
(including, without limitation, any other Notes or the Warrants) subject to a
limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set
forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section, beneficial
ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act. To the extent that the limitation contained in this section applies, the
determination of whether this Note is convertible (in relation to other
securities owned by the Holder) and of which a portion of this Note is
convertible shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder. To ensure compliance
with this restriction, the Holder will be deemed to represent to the Company
each time it delivers a Conversion Notice that such Conversion Notice has not
violated the restrictions set forth in this paragraph and the Company shall have
no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. For
purposes of this Section, in determining the number of outstanding shares of
Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock as reflected in (x) the Company&#146;s most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K 
(or
such related form), as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by
the Company or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Company&#146;s 
Transfer
Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the
written or oral request of the Holder, the Company shall within two Trading Days
confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock
then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of
securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its affiliates
since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was
reported. The provisions of this Section may be waived by the Holder upon, at
the election of the Holder, not less than 61 days&#146; prior notice to the 
Company,
and the provisions of this Section shall continue to apply until such 61st day
(or such later date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such
notice of waiver).</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.2 <U>Conversion
Price</U>.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The term &#147;<U>Conversion
Price</U>&#148; shall mean a 50% discount of the lowest closing price of the 
common
stock for the 20 trading days immediately prior to (i) the date of the Purchase
Agreement, or (ii) the Voluntary Conversion Date.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.3 <U>Mechanics of
Conversion</U>.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Not later than three (3)
Trading Days after any Conversion Date, the Company or its designated transfer
agent, as applicable, shall issue and deliver to the Depository Trust Company
(&#147;<U>DTC</U>&#148;) account on the Holder&#146;s behalf via the Deposit 
Withdrawal Agent
Commission System (&#147;<U>DWAC</U>&#148;) as specified in the Conversion 
Notice,
registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares
of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled. In the alternative, not
later than three (3) Trading Days after any Conversion Date, the Company shall
deliver to the applicable Holder by express courier a certificate or
certificates which shall be free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions
(other than those required by Section 5.1 of the Purchase Agreement)
representing the number of shares of Common Stock being acquired upon the
conversion of this Note (the &#147;<U>Delivery Date</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding 
the
foregoing to the contrary, the Company or its transfer agent shall only be
obligated to issue and deliver the shares to the DTC on the Holder&#146;s
behalf via DWAC (or certificates free of restrictive legends) if such conversion
is in connection with a sale and the Holder has complied with the applicable
prospectus delivery requirements. If in the case of any Conversion Notice such
certificate or certificates are not delivered to or as directed by the
applicable Holder by the Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled by written
notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate
or certificates thereafter, to rescind such conversion, in which event the
Company shall immediately return this Note if tendered for conversion, whereupon
the Company and the Holder shall each be restored to their respective positions
immediately prior to the delivery of such notice of revocation, except that any
amounts described in Sections 3.3(b) and (c) shall be payable through the date
notice of rescission is given to the Company. </P>

<HR style="PAGE-BREAK-AFTER: always" align=center width="100%" color=black
noShade SIZE=5>
<A name=page_6></A>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) The Company understands that
a delay in the delivery of the shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this
Note beyond the Delivery Date could result in economic loss to the Holder. If
the Company fails to deliver to the Holder such shares via DWAC or a certificate
or certificates pursuant to this Section hereunder by the Delivery Date, the
Company shall pay to such Holder, in cash, an amount per Trading Day for each
Trading Day until such shares are delivered via DWAC or certificates are
delivered, together with interest on such amount at a rate of 10% per annum,
accruing until such amount and any accrued interest thereon is paid in full,
equal to the greater of (A) (i) 1% of the aggregate principal amount of the Note
requested to be converted for the first five (5) Trading Days after the Delivery
Date and (ii) 2% of the aggregate principal amount of the Note requested to be
converted for each Trading Day thereafter and (B) $2,000 per day (which amount
shall be paid as liquidated damages and not as a penalty). Nothing herein shall
limit a Holder&#146;s right to pursue actual damages for the Company&#146;s 
failure to
deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion within
the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all
remedies available to it at law or in equity (including, without limitation, a
decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, the Holder shall be entitled to
withdraw a Conversion Notice, and upon such withdrawal the Company shall only be
obligated to pay the liquidated damages accrued in accordance with this Section
3.3(b) through the date the Conversion Notice is withdrawn.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) In addition to any other
rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause its transfer agent
to transmit to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing the shares
of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note on or before the Delivery
Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase
(in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver
in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of this Note which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such
exercise (a &#147;<U>Buy-In&#148;</U>), then the Company shall (1) pay in cash 
to the
Holder the amount by which (x) the Holder&#146;s total purchase price (including
brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased
exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note that the Company was required
to deliver to the Holder in connection with the conversion at issue times (B)
the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was
executed, and (2) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of
the Note and equivalent number of shares of Common Stock for which such
conversion was not honored or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with
its conversion and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a
Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Common Stock with an
aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under
clause (1) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In, together
with applicable confirmations and other evidence reasonably requested by the
Company. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder&#146;s right to pursue any other 
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity
including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
injunctive relief with respect to the Company&#146;s failure to timely deliver
certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Note as
required pursuant to the terms hereof.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.4 <U>Ownership Cap and
Certain Conversion Restrictions</U>.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in Section 3 of this Note, at no time may the Holder convert
all or a portion of this Note if the number of shares of Common Stock to be
issued pursuant to such conversion would exceed, when aggregated with all other
shares of Common Stock owned by the Holder at such time, the number of shares of
Common Stock which would result in the Holder beneficially owning (as determined
in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder)
more than 9.9% of all of the Common Stock outstanding at such time; provided,
however, that upon the Holder providing the Company with sixty-one (61) days
notice (pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof) (the &#147;Waiver Notice&#148;) that the
Holder
would like to waive this Section 3.4 with regard to any or all shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, this Section 3.4 will be of no
force or effect with regard to all or a portion of the Note referenced in the
Waiver Notice; provided, further, that this provision shall be of no further
force or effect during the sixty-one (61) days immediately preceding the
Maturity Date.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.5 <U>Adjustment of

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)
<U>Adjustments for Stock Splits and Combinations</U>. If the Company shall at
any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date, effect a stock split of
the outstanding Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to the stock split shall be proportionately decreased. If the
Company shall at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date, combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the applicable Conversion Price in
effect immediately prior to the combination shall be proportionately increased.
Any adjustments under this Section 3.5(a)(i) shall be effective at the close of
business on the date the stock split or combination occurs.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)
<U>Adjustments for Certain Dividends and Distributions</U>. If the Company shall
at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date, make or issue or set a
record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive
a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, then, and in
each event, the applicable Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
event shall be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event such
record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record
date, by multiplying, the applicable Conversion Price then in effect by a
fraction:</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock

close of business on such record date; and</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
the denominator of which shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of such issuance or the
close of business on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)
<U>Adjustment for Other Dividends and Distributions</U>. If the Company shall
at any time or from time to time after the Issuance Date, make
or issue or set a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock
entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in other than
shares of Common Stock, then, and in each event, an appropriate revision to the
applicable Conversion Price shall be made and provision shall be made (by
adjustments of the Conversion Price or otherwise) so that the holders of this
Note shall receive upon conversions thereof, in addition to the number of shares
of Common Stock receivable thereon, the number of securities of the Company
which they would have received had this Note been converted into Common Stock on
the date of such event and had thereafter, during the period from the date of
such event to and including the Conversion Date, retained such securities
(together with any distributions payable thereon during such period), giving
application to all adjustments called for during such period under this Section
3.5(a)(iii) with respect to the rights of the holders of this Note;
<U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that if such record date shall have been fixed
and such dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on
the date fixed therefor, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this
paragraph as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or
distributions.</P>

<U>Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange or Substitution</U>. If the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note at any time or from time to time
after the Issuance Date shall be changed to the same or different number of
shares of any class or classes of stock, whether by reclassification, exchange,
substitution or otherwise (other than by way of a stock split or combination of
shares or stock dividends provided for in Sections 3.5(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), or
a reorganization, merger, consolidation, or sale of assets provided for in
Section 3.5(a)(v)), then, and in each event, an appropriate revision to the
Conversion Price shall be made and provisions shall be made (by adjustments of
the Conversion Price or otherwise) so that the Holder shall have the right
thereafter to convert this Note into the kind and amount of shares of stock and
other securities receivable upon reclassification, exchange, substitution or
other change, by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such
Note might have been converted immediately prior to such reclassification,

capital reorganization of the Company (other than by way of a stock split or
combination of shares or stock dividends or distributions provided for in
Section 3.5(a)(i), (ii) and (iii), or a reclassification, exchange or
substitution of shares provided for in Section 3.5(a)(iv)), or a merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into another corporation where the holders
of outstanding voting securities prior to such merger or consolidation do not
own over fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting securities of the merged
or consolidated entity, immediately after such merger or consolidation, or the
sale of all or substantially all of the Company&#146;s properties or assets to 
any
other person (an &#147;<U>Organic Change</U>&#148;), then as a part of such 
Organic Change
an appropriate revision to the Conversion Price shall be made and provision
shall be made (by adjustments of the Conversion Price or otherwise) so that the
Holder shall have the right thereafter to convert such Note into the kind and
amount of shares of stock and other securities or property of the Company or any
successor corporation resulting from Organic Change. In any such case,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of
this Section 3.5(a)(v) with respect to the rights of the Holder after the
Organic Change to the end that the provisions of this Section 3.5(a)(v)
(including any adjustment in the applicable Conversion Price then in effect and
the number of shares of stock or other securities deliverable upon conversion of
this Note) shall be applied after that event in as nearly an equivalent manner
as may be practicable.</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vi)
<U>Issuance of Common Stock Equivalents</U>. If the Company, at any time after
the Issuance Date, shall issue any securities convertible into or exchangeable
for, directly or indirectly, Common Stock (&#147;<U>Convertible 
Securities</U>&#148;),
other than the Note, or any rights or warrants or options to purchase any such
Common Stock or Convertible Securities, shall be issued or sold (collectively, 
the &#147;<U>Common Stock Equivalents</U>&#148;) and the
aggregate of the price per share for which Additional Shares of Common Stock may
be issuable thereafter pursuant to such Common Stock Equivalent, plus the
consideration received by the Company for issuance of such Common Stock
Equivalent divided by the number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to
such Common Stock Equivalent (the &#147;<U>Aggregate Per Common Share 
Price</U>&#148;)
shall be less than the applicable Conversion Price then in effect, or if, after
any such issuance of Common Stock Equivalents, the price per share for which
Additional Shares of Common Stock may be issuable thereafter is amended or
adjusted, and such price as so amended shall make the Aggregate Per Share Common
Price be less than the applicable Conversion Price in effect at the time of such
amendment or adjustment, then the applicable Conversion Price upon each such
issuance or amendment shall be adjusted as provided in the first sentence of
subsection (vi) of this Section 3.5(a) on the basis that (1) the maximum number
of Additional Shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to all such Common Stock
Equivalents shall be deemed to have been issued (whether or not such Common
Stock Equivalents are actually then exercisable, convertible or exchangeable in
whole or in part) as of the earlier of (A) the date on which the Company shall
enter into a firm contract for the issuance of such Common Stock Equivalent, or
(B) the date of actual issuance of such Common Stock Equivalent. No adjustment
of the applicable Conversion Price shall be made under this subsection (vii)
upon the issuance of any Convertible Security which is issued pursuant to the
exercise of any warrants or other subscription or purchase rights therefor, if
any adjustment shall previously have been made to the exercise price of such
warrants then in effect upon the issuance of such warrants or other rights
pursuant to this subsection (vii). No adjustment shall be made to the Conversion
Price upon the issuance of Common Stock pursuant to the exercise, conversion or
exchange of any Convertible Security or Common Stock Equivalent where an
adjustment to the Conversion Price was made as a result of the issuance or
purchase of any Convertible Security or Common Stock Equivalent.</P>

Stock Equivalents shall be issued or sold:</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
in connection with any merger or consolidation in which the Company is the
surviving corporation (other than any consolidation or merger in which the
previously outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company shall be changed to
or exchanged for the stock or other securities of another corporation), the
amount of consideration therefor shall be, deemed to be the fair value, as
determined reasonably and in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
Company, of such portion of the assets and business of the nonsurviving
corporation as such Board may determine to be attributable to such shares of
Common Stock, Convertible Securities, rights or warrants or options, as the case
may be; or</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
in the event of any consolidation or merger of the Company in which the Company
is not the surviving corporation or in which the previously outstanding shares
of Common Stock of the Company shall be changed into or exchanged for the stock
or other securities of another corporation, or in the event of any sale of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company for stock or other securities
of any corporation, the Company shall be deemed to have issued a number of
shares of its Common Stock for stock or securities or other property of the
other corporation computed on the basis of the actual exchange ratio on which
the transaction was predicated, and for a consideration equal to the fair market
value on the date of such transaction of all such stock or securities or other
property of the other corporation. If any such calculation results in adjustment
of the applicable Conversion Price, or the number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of the Note, the determination of the applicable
Conversion Price or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of the Note immediately prior to such merger, consolidation or sale,
shall be made after giving effect to such adjustment of the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Note. In the event Common Stock is
issued with other shares or securities or other assets of the Company for
consideration which covers both, the consideration computed as provided in this
Section 3.5(viii) shall be allocated among such securities and assets
as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.</P>

the Company shall take record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose
of entitling them to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock or Convertible
Securities, then the date of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock
shall be deemed to be such record date.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Certain Issues
Excepted</U>. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall
not be required to make any adjustment to the Conversion Price in connection
with (i) securities issued (other than for cash) in connection with a merger,
acquisition, or consolidation, (ii) securities issued pursuant to a bona fide
firm underwritten public offering of the Company&#146;s securities, (iii)

pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, (iv) the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise of Warrants, (v) securities issued in connection with
strategic license agreements or other partnering arrangements so long as such
issuances are not for the purpose of raising capital, (vi) Common Stock issued
or options to purchase Common Stock granted or issued pursuant to the

the payment of any accrued interest in shares of Common Stock pursuant to this

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>No Impairment</U>. The
Company shall not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation or through
any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution,
issue or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or
performed hereunder by the Company, but will at all times in good faith, assist
in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Section 3.5 and in the taking
of all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the
Conversion Rights of the Holder against impairment. In the event a Holder shall
elect to convert any Note as provided herein, the Company cannot refuse
conversion based on any claim that such Holder or any one associated or
affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, violation
of an agreement to which such Holder is a party or for any reason whatsoever,
unless, an injunction from a court, or notice, restraining and or adjoining
conversion of all or of said Note shall have issued and the Company posts a
surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in an amount equal to one hundred
thirty percent (130%) of the amount of the Note the Holder has elected to
convert, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of
arbitration/litigation of the dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable
to such Holder in the event it obtains judgment.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <U>Certificates as to
Adjustments</U>. Upon occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price or number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
this Note pursuant to this Section 3.5, the Company at its expense shall
promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms
hereof and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment and
readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or
readjustment is based. The Company shall, upon written request of the Holder, at
any time, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Holder a like certificate
setting forth such adjustments and readjustments, the applicable Conversion
Price in effect at the time, and the number of shares of Common Stock and the
amount, if any, of other securities or property which at the time would be
received upon the conversion of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be obligated to deliver a certificate unless such certificate
would reflect an increase or decrease of at least one percent (1%) of such
adjusted amount.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>Issue Taxes</U>. The
Company shall pay any and all issue and other taxes, excluding federal, state or
local income taxes, that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of
shares of Common Stock on conversion of this Note pursuant thereto;
  <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the Company shall not be obligated to 
pay
any transfer taxes resulting from any transfer requested by the Holder in
connection with any such conversion.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <U>Fractional Shares</U>. No
fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of this Note.
In lieu of any fractional shares to which the Holder would otherwise be
entitled, the Company shall pay cash equal to the product of such fraction
multiplied by the average of the Closing Bid Prices of the Common Stock for the
five (5) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the Conversion Date.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) <U>Reservation of Common
Stock</U>. The Company shall at all times when this Note shall be outstanding,
reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, such
number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of this Note and all interest accrued thereon; <U>provided
</U>that the number of shares of Common Stock so reserved shall at no time be
less than one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the number of shares of Common
Stock for which this Note and all interest accrued thereon are at any time
convertible. The Company shall, from time to time in accordance with Nevada
corporate law, increase the authorized number of shares of Common Stock if at
any time the unissued number of authorized shares shall not be sufficient to
satisfy the Company&#146;s obligations under this Section 3.5(h).</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Regulatory Compliance</U>.
If any shares of Common Stock to be reserved for the purpose of conversion of
this Note or any interest accrued thereon require registration or listing with
or approval of any governmental authority, stock exchange or other regulatory
body under any federal or state law or regulation or otherwise before such
shares may be validly issued or delivered upon conversion, the Company shall, at
its sole cost and expense, in good faith and as expeditiously as possible,
endeavor to secure such registration, listing or approval, as the case may
be.</P>

portion
of this Note in cash at a price equal to the sum of (i) the greater of (A) one
hundred twenty percent (120%) of the aggregate principal amount of this Note

conversion of this Note and resale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion hereof in accordance with the terms of this Note and the other 
Transaction Documents, the aggregate principal amount of this
Note plus all accrued but unpaid interest hereon, divided by the Conversion
Price on (x) the date the Prepayment Price (as defined below) is demanded or
otherwise due or (y) the date the Prepayment Price is paid in full, whichever is

Event, any holder of this Note may require the Company to prepay all of the
Notes on a pro rata basis by delivering written notice thereof via facsimile and

Event or Notice(s) of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon Major Transaction and

Prepayment Price, in the case of a prepayment pursuant to Section 3.6(i), to
such holder within five (5) business days after the Company&#146;s receipt of a
Notice of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon Triggering Event and, in the case
of a prepayment pursuant to Section 3.(f), the Company shall deliver the
applicable Major Transaction Prepayment Price immediately prior to the
consummation of the Major Transaction; provided that a holder&#146;s original 
Note
shall have been so delivered to the Company; provided further that if the
Company is unable to prepay all of the Notes to be prepaid, the Company shall
prepay an amount from each holder of the Notes being prepaid equal to such
holder&#146;s pro-rata amount (based on the number of Notes held by such holder
relative to the number of Notes outstanding) of all Notes being prepaid. If the
Company shall fail to prepay all of the Notes submitted for prepayment (other
than pursuant to a dispute as to the arithmetic calculation of the Prepayment
Price), in addition to any remedy such holder of the Notes may have under this
Note and the Purchase Agreement, the applicable Prepayment Price payable in
respect of such Notes not prepaid shall bear interest at the rate of two percent
(2%) per month (prorated for partial months) until paid in full. Until the
Company pays such unpaid applicable Prepayment Price in full to a holder of the
Notes submitted for prepayment, such holder shall have the option (the 
&#147;Void
Optional Prepayment Option&#148;) to, in lieu of prepayment, require the Company
to
promptly return to such holder(s) all of the Notes that were submitted for
prepayment by such holder(s) under this Section 3.6 and for which the applicable
Prepayment Price has not been paid, by sending written notice
thereof to the Company via facsimile (the &#147;Void Optional Prepayment 
Notice&#148;).
Upon the Company&#146;s receipt of such Void Optional Prepayment Notice(s) and 
prior
to payment of the full applicable Prepayment Price to such holder, (i) the
Notice(s) of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon Triggering Event or the
Notice(s) of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon Major Transaction, as the case
may be, shall be null and void with respect to those Notes submitted for
prepayment and for which the applicable Prepayment Price has not been paid, (ii)
the Company shall immediately return any Notes submitted to the Company by each
holder for prepayment under this Section 3.6(h) and for which the applicable
Prepayment Price has not been paid and (iii) the Conversion Price of such
returned Notes shall be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the Conversion Price as in
effect on the date on which the Void Optional Prepayment Notice(s) is delivered
to the Company and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price during the period beginning
on the date on which the Notice(s) of Prepayment of Option of Holder Upon Major
Transaction or the Notice(s) of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon Triggering
Event, as the case may be, is delivered to the Company and ending on the date on
which the Void Optional Prepayment Notice(s) is delivered to the Company;
provided that no adjustment shall be made if such adjustment would result in an
increase of the Conversion Price then in effect. A holder&#146;s delivery of a 
Void
Optional Prepayment Notice and exercise of its rights following such notice
shall not effect the Company&#146;s obligations to make any payments which have
accrued prior to the date of such notice. Payments provided for in this Section
3.6 shall have priority to payments to other stockholders in connection with a
Major Transaction.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) <U>Company Prepayment Option
upon Major Transaction</U>. Upon the consummation of a Major Transaction, the
Company may prepay in cash all or any portion of the outstanding principal
amount of this Note together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon upon
at least thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Holder (the 
&#147;<U>Company&#146;s
Prepayment Notice</U>&#148;) at a price equal to one hundred twenty percent 
(120%) of
the aggregate principal amount of this Note plus any accrued but unpaid interest
(the &#147;<U>Company&#146;s Prepayment Price</U>&#148;); provided, however, 
that if a holder
has delivered a Conversion Notice to the Company or delivers a Conversion Notice
within such thirty (30) day period following delivery of the Company&#146;s
Prepayment Notice, the principal amount of the Notes plus any accrued but unpaid
interest designated to be converted may not be prepaid by the Company and shall
be converted in accordance with Section 3.3 hereof; provided further that if
during the period between delivery of the Company&#146;s Prepayment Notice and 
the
Company&#146;s Prepayment Date (as defined below), a holder shall become 
entitled and
elects to deliver a Notice of Prepayment at Option of Holder Upon Major
Transaction or Notice of Prepayment at Option of Holder upon Triggering Event,
then such rights of the holders shall take precedence over the previously
delivered Company Prepayment Notice if the holder so elects. The Company&#146;s
Prepayment Notice shall state the date of prepayment which date shall be the
date of the consummation of the Major Transaction (the &#147;Company&#146;s 
Prepayment
Date&#148;), the Company&#146;s Prepayment Price and the principal amount of 
Notes plus
any accrued but unpaid interest to be prepaid by the Company. The Company shall
deliver the Company&#146;s Prepayment Price on the Company&#146;s Prepayment 
Date,
provided, that if the holder(s) delivers a Conversion Notice before the
Company&#146;s Prepayment Date, then the portion of the Company&#146;s 
Prepayment Price
which would be paid to prepay the Notes covered by such Conversion Notice shall
be returned to the Company upon delivery of the Common Stock issuable in
connection with such Conversion Notice to the holder(s). On the Company&#146;s
Prepayment Date, the Company shall pay the Company&#146;s Prepayment Price, 
subject
to any adjustment pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, to the
holder(s) on a pro rata basis. If the Company fails to pay the Company&#146;s
Prepayment Price by the third (3rd) business day after the Company&#146;s 
Prepayment
Date, the prepayment will be declared null and void and the Company shall lose
its right to serve a Company&#146;s Prepayment Notice pursuant to this Section 
3.6(i)
in the future. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, the Company may
effect a prepayment pursuant to this Section 3.6(i) only if trading in the
Common Stock shall not have been suspended by the Securities and Exchange
Commission or the Nasdaq SmallCap Market (or other exchange or market on which
the Common Stock is trading), and and the Company is in material compliance with
the terms and conditions of this Note and the other Transaction Documents. </P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.7 <U>Inability to Fully
Convert</U>.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) <U>Holder&#146;s Option if 
Company
Cannot Fully Convert</U>. If, upon the Company&#146;s receipt of a Conversion 
Notice,
the Company cannot issue shares of Common Stock for any reason, including,
without limitation, because the Company (w) does not have a sufficient number of
shares of Common Stock authorized and available, or (x) is otherwise prohibited
by applicable law or by the rules or regulations of any stock exchange,
interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its securities from issuing all of the
Common Stock which is to be issued to the Holder pursuant to a Conversion
Notice, then the Company shall issue as many shares of Common Stock as it is
able to issue in accordance with the Holder&#146;s Conversion Notice and, with
respect to the unconverted portion of this Note, the Holder, solely at 
Holder&#146;s
option, can elect to:</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)
require the Company to prepay that portion of this Note for which the Company is
unable to issue Common Stock in accordance with the Holder&#146;s Conversion 
Notice
(the &#147;<U>Mandatory Prepayment</U>&#148;) at a price per share equal to the 
Triggering
Event Prepayment Price as of such Conversion Date (the &#147;<U>Mandatory 
Prepayment
Price</U>&#148;);</P>
<P
align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)
void its Conversion Notice and retain or have returned, as the case may be, this
Note that was to be converted pursuant to the Conversion Notice (provided that
the Holder&#146;s voiding its Conversion Notice shall not effect the 
Company&#146;s
obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior to the date of such
notice).</P>
<P align=justify>In the event a Holder shall elect to convert any portion of its
Notes as provided herein, the Company cannot refuse conversion based on any
claim that such Holder or any one associated or affiliated with such Holder has
been engaged in any violation of law, violation of an agreement to which such
Holder is a party or for any reason whatsoever, unless, an injunction from a
court, on notice, restraining and or adjoining conversion of all or of said
Notes shall have been issued and the Company posts a surety bond for the benefit
of such Holder in an amount equal to 130% of the principal amount of the Notes
the Holder has elected to convert, which bond shall remain in effect until the
completion of arbitration/litigation of the dispute and the proceeds of which
shall be payable to such Holder in the event it obtains judgment. </P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Mechanics of Fulfilling
Holder&#146;s Election</U>. The Company shall immediately send via facsimile to 
the
Holder, upon receipt of a facsimile copy of a Conversion Notice from the Holder
which cannot be fully satisfied as described in Section 3.7(a) above, a notice
of the Company&#146;s inability to fully satisfy the Conversion Notice (the
&#147;<U>Inability to Fully Convert Notice</U>&#148;). Such Inability to Fully 
Convert
Notice shall indicate (i) the reason why the Company is unable to fully satisfy
such holder&#146;s Conversion Notice, (ii) the amount of this Note which cannot 
be
converted and (iii) the applicable Mandatory Prepayment Price. The Holder shall
notify the Company of its election pursuant to Section 3.7(a) above by
delivering written notice via facsimile to the Company (&#147;<U>Notice in 
Response
to Inability</U> <U>to Convert</U>&#148;).</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>Payment of Prepayment
Price</U>. If the Holder shall elect to have its Notes prepaid pursuant to
Section 3.7(a)(i) above, the Company shall pay the Mandatory Prepayment Price to
the Holder within thirty (30) days of the Company&#146;s receipt of the 
Holder&#146;s
Notice in Response to Inability to Convert, <U>provided </U>that prior to the
Company&#146;s receipt of the Holder&#146;s Notice in Response to Inability to 
Convert the
Company has not delivered a notice to the Holder stating, to the satisfaction of
the Holder, that the event or condition resulting in the Mandatory Prepayment
has been cured and all Conversion Shares issuable to the Holder can and will be
delivered to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Note. If the 
Company shall fail to pay the applicable Mandatory
Prepayment Price to the Holder on a timely basis as described in this Section
3.7(c) (other than pursuant to a dispute as to the determination of the
arithmetic calculation of the Prepayment Price), in addition to any remedy the
Holder may have under this Note and the Purchase Agreement, such unpaid amount
shall bear interest at the rate of two percent (2%) per month (prorated for
partial months) until paid in full. Until the full Mandatory Prepayment Price is
paid in full to the Holder, the Holder may (i) void the Mandatory Prepayment
with respect to that portion of the Note for which the full Mandatory Prepayment
Price has not been paid, (ii) receive back such Note, and (iii) require that the
Conversion Price of such returned Note be adjusted to the lesser of (A) the
Conversion Price as in effect on the date on which the Holder voided the
Mandatory Prepayment and (B) the lowest Closing Bid Price during the period
beginning on the Conversion Date and ending on the date the Holder voided the
Mandatory Prepayment.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Pro-rata Conversion and
Prepayment</U>. In the event the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more
than one holder of the Notes on the same day and the Company can convert and
prepay some, but not all, of the Notes pursuant to this Section 3.7, the Company
shall convert and prepay from each holder of the Notes electing to have its
Notes converted and prepaid at such time an amount equal to such holder&#146;s
pro-rata amount (based on the principal amount of the Notes held by such holder
relative to the principal amount of the Notes outstanding) of all the Notes
being converted and prepaid at such time.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 3.8 <U>No Rights as
Shareholder</U>. Nothing contained in this Note shall be construed as conferring
upon the Holder, prior to the conversion of this Note, the right to vote or to
receive dividends or to consent or to receive notice as a shareholder in respect
of any meeting of shareholders for the election of directors of the Company or
of any other matter, or any other rights as a shareholder of the Company.</P>
<P align=center><B>ARTICLE IV</B></P>
<P align=center>MISCELLANEOUS</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4.1 <U>Notices</U>. Any
notice, demand, request, waiver or other communication required or permitted to
be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be effective (a) upon hand
delivery by telex (with correct answer back received), telecopy or facsimile at
the address or number designated in the Purchase Agreement (if delivered on a
business day during normal business hours where such notice is to be received),
or the first business day following such delivery (if delivered other than on a
business day during normal business hours where such notice is to be received)
or (b) on the second business day following the date of mailing by express
courier service, fully prepaid, addressed to such address, or upon actual
receipt of such mailing, whichever shall first occur. The Company will give
written notice to the Holder at least ten (10) days prior to the date on which
the Company takes a record (x) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon
the Common Stock, (y) with respect to any pro rata subscription offer to holders
of Common Stock or (z) for determining rights to vote with respect to any
Organic Change, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up and in no event shall
such notice be provided to such holder prior to such information being made
known to the public. The Company will also give written notice to the Holder at
least ten (10) days prior to the date on which any Organic Change, dissolution,
liquidation or winding-up will take place and in no event shall such notice be
provided to the Holder prior to such information being made known to the public.

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4.4 <U>Remedies,

The remedies provided in this Note shall be cumulative and in addition to all
other remedies available under this Note, at law or in equity (including,

relief), no remedy contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of compliance with
the provisions giving rise to such remedy and nothing herein shall limit a
holder&#146;s right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the Company to 
comply
with the terms of this Note. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with
respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall
be the amounts to be received by the holder thereof and shall not, except as
expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or
the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its
obligations hereunder will cause irreparable and material harm to the Holder and

Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available rights and
remedies, at law or in equity, to seek and obtain such equitable relief,
including but not limited to an injunction restraining any such breach or
threatened breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without
any bond or other security being required.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4.5 <U>Enforcement

WARRANT (the &#147;<U>Warrant</U>&#148;) certifies that, for value received, JDF
Capital
Inc., or its assigns (the &#147;<U>Holder</U>&#148;) is entitled, upon the terms
and
subject to the limitations on exercise and the conditions hereinafter set forth,
at any time on or after the date hereof (the &#147;<U>Initial Exercise

<P align=justify><B>ARTICLE 1 EXERCISE RIGHTS</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Holder will have the right to
exercise this Warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock as set forth below.
Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings
set forth in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement Document dated September
____, 2013 between the Company and the Holder (the 
&#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;).</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <U>Exercise of Warrant</U>.
Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in
whole or in part, from and after the Initial Exercise Date, and then at any
time, by delivery to the Company (or such other office or agency of the Company
as it may designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address
of the Holder appearing on the books of the Company) of a duly executed
facsimile or emailed copy of the Notice of Exercise form annexed hereto. Within
three (3) business days following the date of exercise as aforesaid, the Holder
shall deliver the aggregate Exercise Price for the shares specified in the
applicable Notice of Exercise by wire transfer or check drawn on a United States
bank unless the cashless exercise procedure specified in Section 1.3 below is
specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise. Partial exercises of this
Warrant resulting in purchases of a portion of the total number of Warrant
Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding
number of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the
applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and the Company shall
maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of
such purchases. The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of
Exercise form within 24 hours of receipt of such notice. The Holder and any
assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason
of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase of a portion of the
Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase
hereunder at any given time may be less than the amount stated on the face
hereof.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.2 <U>Exercise Price</U>. The
exercise price per share of Common Stock under this Warrant shall be $_____ per
share, subject to adjustment hereunder (the &#147;<U>Exercise Price</U>&#148;). 
The
aggregate exercise price is $250,000.</P>

at any time after the earlier of (i) the six (6) month anniversary of the date
of the Agreement and (ii) the completion of the then-applicable holding period
required by Rule 144, or any successor provision then in effect, there is no
effective Registration Statement registering, or no current prospectus available
for, the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder, then this Warrant may also
be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a &#147;cashless 
exercise&#148; in which the Holder
shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.4 <U>Delivery of Warrant
Shares</U>. Warrant Shares purchased hereunder will be delivered to Holder by
2:30 pm EST within two (2) business days of Notice of Exercise by 
&#147;DWAC/FAST&#148;
electronic transfer (such date, the &#147;<U>Warrant Share Delivery 
Date</U>&#148;). For
example, if Holder delivers a Notice of Exercise to the Company at 5:15 pm
eastern time on Monday January 1<SUP>st</SUP>, the Company&#146;s transfer agent
must
deliver shares to Holder&#146;s broker via &#147;DWAC/FAST&#148; electronic 
transfer by no
later than 2:30 pm eastern time on Wednesday January 3<SUP>rd</SUP>. The Warrant
Shares shall be deemed to have been issued, and Holder or any other person so
designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder of record
of such shares for all purposes, as of the date of delivery of the Notice of
Exercise. Holder may assess penalties or liquidated damages (both referred to
herein as &#147;penalties&#148;) as follows. For each exercise, in the event 
that shares
are not delivered by the third business day (inclusive of the day of exercise),
the Company shall pay the Holder in cash a penalty of $2,000 per day for each
day after the third business day (inclusive of the day of exercise) until share
delivery is made. The Company will not be subject to any penalties once its
transfer agent correctly processes the shares to the DWAC system. <I>The Company
will make its best efforts to deliver the Warrant Shares to the Holder the same
day or next day.</I></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.5 <U>Delivery of Warrant</U>.
The Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Warrant to the
Company. If the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available
hereunder and the Warrant has been exercised in full, this Warrant shall
automatically be cancelled without the need to surrender the Warrant to the
Company for cancellation. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the
Company shall, at the request of Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant, at
the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant
evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares
called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be
identical with this Warrant and, for purposes of Rule 144, shall tack back to
the original date of this Warrant.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.6 <U>Warrant Exercise
Rescission Rights</U>. For any reason in Holder&#146;s sole discretion, 
including if
the Warrant Shares are not delivered by DWAC/FAST electronic transfer or in
accordance with the timeframe stated in Section 1.4, or for any other reason,
Holder may, at any time prior to selling those Warrant Shares rescind such
exercise, in whole or in part, in which case the Company must, within three (3)
days of receipt of notice from the Holder, repay to the Holder the portion of
the exercise price so rescinded and reinstate the portion of the Warrant and
equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which the exercise was rescinded and,
for purposes of Rule 144, such reinstated portion of the Warrant and the Warrant
Shares shall tack back to the original date of this Warrant. If Warrant Shares
were issued to Holder prior to Holder&#146;s rescission notice, upon return of
payment from the Company, Holder will, within three (3) days of receipt of
payment, commence procedures to return the Warrant Shares to the Company.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.7 <U>Compensation for Buy-In on
Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Exercise</U>. In addition to any
other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause its transfer
agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares on or before the Warrant
Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker
to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder&#146;s
brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in
satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder
anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a &#147;<U>Buy-In</U>&#148;), then the
Company
shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the
Holder&#146;s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other 
fees,
if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the amount
obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was
required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times
(2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such
purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either
(x) reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares
for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be
deemed rescinded), (y) deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its
exercise and delivery obligations hereunder, or (z) pay in cash to the Holder
the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the
Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at
issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase
obligation was executed. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon
request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.8 <U>Make-Whole for Market Loss
after Exercise</U>. At the Holder&#146;s election, if the Company fails for any
reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares by DWAC/FAST electronic
transfer (such as by delivering a physical certificate) and if the Holder incurs
a Market Price Loss, then at any time subsequent to incurring the loss the
Holder may provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to
the Holder in respect of the Market Price Loss and the Company must make the
Holder whole as follows:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" align=justify>Market Price Loss = [(High trade price
on the day of exercise) x (Number of Warrant Shares)] &#150;[(Sales price 
realized by
Holder) x (Number of Warrant Shares)]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" align=justify>The Company must pay the Market Price
Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third
business day from the time of the Holder&#146;s written notice to the 
Company.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.9 <U>Make-Whole for Failure to
Deliver Loss</U>. At the Holder&#146;s election, if the Company fails for any 
reason
to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Shares by the Warrant Share Delivery Date
and if the Holder incurs a Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder
may provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the
Holder in respect of the Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the
Holder whole as follows:</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" align=justify>Failure to Deliver Loss = [(High trade
price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Number of Warrant
Shares)]</P>
<P style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5%" align=justify>The Company must pay the Failure to
Deliver Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the
third business day from the time of the Holder&#146;s written notice to the
Company.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.10 <U>Choice of Remedies</U>.
Nothing herein, including, but not limited to, Holder&#146;s electing to pursue 
its
rights under Sections 1.8 or 1.9 of this Warrant, shall limit a Holder&#146;s 
right
to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity
including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
injunctive relief with respect to the Company&#146;s failure to timely deliver 
shares
of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms
hereof.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.11 <U>Charges, Taxes and
Expenses</U>. Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the
Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of
the issuance of such shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by
the Company, and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder
or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder. The Company shall pay
all transfer agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of
Exercise.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.12 <U>Holder&#146;s Exercise
Limitations</U>. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by both the Company and the
Holder, at no time will the Holder exercise any amount of this Warrant to
purchase Common Stock that would result in the Holder owning more than 4.99% of
the Common Stock outstanding of the Company (the &#147;<U>Beneficial</U> 
<U>Ownership
Limitation</U>&#148;). Upon the written or oral request of Holder, the Company 
shall
within twenty-four (24) hours confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the
number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding.</P>

<P align=justify><B>ARTICLE 2 ADJUSTMENTS</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.1 <U>Stock Dividends and
Splits</U>. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i)
pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on
shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity equivalent securities
payable in shares of Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not
include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon exercise of this
Warrant), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger
number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split)
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv)
issues by reclassification of shares of the Common Stock any shares of capital
stock of the Company, then in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common
Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such
event and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the
aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment
made pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall become effective immediately after the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the
effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or
re-classification.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.2 <U>Subsequent Equity
Sales</U>. If the Company or any Subsidiary thereof, as applicable, at any time
while this Warrant is outstanding, shall sell or grant any option to purchase,
or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or
announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition)
any Common Stock or any security entitling the holder thereof (including sales
or grants to the Holder) to acquire Common Stock, including, without limitation,
any debt, preferred stock, right, option, warrant or other instrument that is
convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for, or otherwise entitles the
holder thereof to receive, Common Stock (a &#147;<U>Common Stock 
Equivalent</U>&#148;), at
an effective price per share less than the Exercise Price then in effect (such
lower price, the &#147;<U>Base Share Price</U>&#148; and such issuances 
collectively, a
&#147;<U>Dilutive Issuance</U>&#148;) (it being understood and agreed that if 
the holder
of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time,
whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating
conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants,
options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance,
be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share
that is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have
occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance
at such effective price regardless of whether such holder has received or ever
receives shares at such effective price), then simultaneously with the
consummation of each Dilutive Issuance the Exercise Price shall be reduced and
only reduced to equal the Base Share Price and consequently the number of
Warrant Shares issuable hereunder shall be increased such that the Aggregate
Exercise Amount hereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the
Exercise Price, shall be equal to the Aggregate Exercise Amount prior to such
adjustment. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents are issued. The Company shall notify the Holder, in writing,
no later than the business day following the issuance or deemed issuance of any
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section 2.2, indicating
therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange
price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the
&#147;<U>Dilutive</U> <U>Issuance Notice</U>&#148;). In addition, the Company 
shall
provide the Holder, whenever the Holder requests at any time while this Warrant
is outstanding, a schedule of all issuances of Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents since the date of the Agreement, including the applicable issuance
price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price, exercise
price and other pricing terms. The term issuances shall also include all
agreements to issue, or prospectively issue Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents, regardless of whether the issuance contemplated by such agreement
is consummated. The Company shall notify the Holder in writing of any issuances
within twenty-four (24) hours of such issuance. For purposes of clarification,
whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this
Section 2.2, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, the Holder is
entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares based upon the Base Share Price
regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in
the Notice of Exercise. If the Company enters into a Variable Rate Transaction,
the Company shall be deemed to have issued Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents at the lowest possible conversion or exercise price at which such
securities may be converted or exercised. &#147;<U>Variable Rate</U>
<U>Transaction</U>&#148; means a transaction in which the Company (i) issues or 
sells
any debt or equity securities that are convertible into, exchangeable or
exercisable for, or include the right to receive, additional shares of Common
Stock either (A) at a conversion price, exercise price or exchange rate or other
price that is based upon, and/or varies with, the trading prices of or
quotations for the shares of Common Stock at any time after the initial issuance
of such debt or equity securities or (B) with a conversion, exercise or
exchange price that is subject to being reset at some future date after the
initial issuance of such debt or equity security or upon the occurrence of
specified or contingent events directly or indirectly related to the business of
the Company or the market for the Common Stock or (ii) enters into any
agreement, including, but not limited to, an equity line of credit, whereby the
Company may sell securities at a future determined price.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.3 <U>Pro Rata
Distributions</U>. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock (and not to the
Holder) evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash and cash
dividends) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any security other
than the Common Stock, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be
adjusted by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the
record date fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the VWAP determined
as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such
VWAP on such record date less the then per share fair market value at such
record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness or rights
or warrants so distributed applicable to one outstanding share of the Common
Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. In either case the
adjustments shall be described in a statement provided to the Holder of the
portion of assets or evidences of indebtedness so distributed or such
subscription rights applicable to one share of Common Stock. Such adjustment
shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective
immediately after the record date mentioned above.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.4 <U>Notice to Holder</U>.
Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this
Article 2, the Company shall promptly notify the Holder (by written notice)
setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting
adjustment to the number of Warrant Shares and setting forth a brief statement
of the facts requiring such adjustment.</P>
<P align=justify><B>ARTICLE 3 COMPANY COVENANTS</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.1 <U>Reservation of Shares</U>.
As of the issuance date of this Warrant and for the remaining period during
which the Warrant is exercisable, the Company will reserve from its authorized
and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the
issuance of Warrant Shares upon the full exercise of this Warrant. The Company
represents that upon issuance, such Warrant Shares will be duly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The Company agrees that its issuance of
this Warrant constitutes full authority to its officers, agents and transfer
agents who are charged with the duty of executing and issuing shares to execute
and issue the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant. No
further approval or authority of the stockholders of the Board of Directors of
the Company is required for the issuance of the Warrant Shares.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.2 <U>No Adverse Actions</U>.
Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company
shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its certificate
of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of
the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the
carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this
Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the
amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to such increase in
par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order
that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable
Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents
from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be,
necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this
Warrant.</P>
<P align=justify><B>ARTICLE 4 MISCELLANEOUS</B></P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.1 <U>Representation by the
Holder</U>. The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants that
it is acquiring this Warrant and, upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the
Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its own account and not with a
view to or for distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof
in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law,
except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.</P>

<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.2 <U>Transferability</U>.
Subject to compliance with any applicable securities laws, this Warrant and all
rights hereunder (including, without limitation, any registration rights) are
transferable, in whole or in part, by a written assignment of this Warrant duly
executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney. If necessary to obtain a new
warrant for any assignee, the Company, upon surrender of this Warrant, shall
execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or
assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations specified in
such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant
evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so assigned, and such new Warrants,
for purposes of Rule 144, shall tack back to the original date of this Warrant.
The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may be exercised by a
new holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant
issued.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.3 <U>Assignability</U>. The
Company may not assign this Warrant. This Warrant will be binding upon the
Company and its successors, and will inure to the benefit of the Holder and its
successors and assigns, and may be assigned by the Holder to anyone of its
choosing without the Company&#146;s approval.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.4 <U>Notices</U>. Any notice
required or permitted hereunder must be in writing and either personally served,
sent by facsimile or email transmission, or sent by overnight courier. Notices
will be deemed effectively delivered at the time of transmission if by facsimile
or email, and if by overnight courier the business day after such notice is
deposited with the courier service for delivery.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.5 <U>Governing Law</U>. This
Warrant will be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Arizona, without regard to the conflict of laws principles
thereof. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the
transactions contemplated by this Warrant shall be brought only in the state
courts of Arizona or in the federal courts located in the State of Arizona. Both
parties and the individuals signing this Agreement agree to submit to the
jurisdiction of such courts.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.6 <U>Delivery of Process by
Holder to the Company</U>. In the event of any action or proceeding by Holder
against the Company, and only by Holder against the Company, service of copies
of summons and/or complaint and/or any other process which may be served in any
such action or proceeding may be made by Holder via U.S. Mail, overnight
delivery service such as FedEx or UPS, email, fax, or process server, or by
mailing or otherwise delivering a copy of such process to the Company at its
last known address or to its last known attorney set forth in its most recent
SEC filing.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.7 <U>No Rights as Stockholder
Until Exercise</U>. This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting
rights, dividends or other rights as a stockholder of the Company prior to the
exercise hereof as set forth in Section 1.1. So long as this Warrant is
unexercised, this Warrant carries no voting rights and does not convey to the
Holder any &#147;control&#148; over the Company, as such term may be interpreted
by the
SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, regardless of whether the
price of the Company&#146;s Common Stock exceeds the Exercise Price.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.8 <U>Limitation of
Liability</U>. No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by
the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase Warrant Shares, and no
enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to
any liability of the Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a
stockholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company or
by creditors of the Company.</P>
<P align=justify>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.9 <U>Attorney Fees</U>. In the
