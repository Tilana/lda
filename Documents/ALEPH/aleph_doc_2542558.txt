ANNUAL REPORT 2005
EnerNorth Industries Inc.
Message to Shareholders:
Fiscal  2005  proved  to  be  a  time  of  transition  for  the  Company.  During  the  year  the  Company
sought  and  obtained  shareholder  approval  to  divest  its  Industrial  &  Offshore  Division  for  cash
proceeds  of  CDN  $7.3  million.    The  transaction  was  a  sale  of  100%  equity  shares  of  M&M
Engineering  Limited  ("M&M")  held  by  the  Company.  Prior  to  closing,  the  Company  retracted
preferred shares of M&M for CDN $1.0 million cash resulting in proceeds of CDN $8.3 million to
the  Company  from  the  sale.  We  thank  the  people  at  M&M  and  its  customers  for  the  years  of
loyalty to M&M and wish them all well in their ongoing endeavors.
While the injection of capital dramatically increased our cash reserves, the divesture eliminated
ongoing revenues from this division. In the prior fiscal year, M&M contributed CDN $33.4 million
of revenue to the Company.
We intend to focus our efforts on growing our oil and gas operations in the Western Sedimentary
Basin of Canada. To this end, we have entered into a 50:50 Joint Exploration Agreement with an
industry participant for the Sibbald area of Alberta and we have expanded into the Buick Creek
area of north east British Columbia.
In the Sibbald area we have a working interest in 5,760 gross acres located in Townships 28 and
29. For the fiscal year 2005, Sibbald wells accounted for approximately 24% of the Company's
overall  production.  The  Joint  Exploration  Agreement  includes  an  area  of  mutual  interest
encompassing nine townships around the Sibbald area but excludes our working interest lands.
We anticipate that by teaming up with our joint exploration partner and increasing our drilling and
exploration activities in this area, Sibbald will develop into a core production property for us.
In May 2005 we entered into a Farmout and Participation Agreement to acquire a working interest
in a license covering approximately 4,895 gross acres in the Buick Creek area (the "Licence").
 Subsequent to year end, the Company drilled two wells prospective for natural gas and paid 75%
of  the  costs  to  earn  a  75%  working  interest  in  the  wells  and  ensuing  spacing  units.    We  also
participated  for  a  25%  working  interest  in  two  additional  exploratory  gas  wells  drilled  on  the
Licence and earned a 25% working interest in the wells and the resulting spacing units.  All four
wells have been drilled and cased and are pending completion, production testing and potential
tie in. These multi formation lands are prospective for natural gas in the Notikewan, Bluesky and
Gething formations and for oil in the Halfway formation. Pending results from the first four wells,
we anticipate further exploration and development on these lands in the coming year and look
forward to this area becoming another core production property.
Management has also allocated a portion of the proceeds from the sale of M&M to the purchase
of  negotiable  securities  of  other  oil  and  gas  companies.  This  provides  a  means  of  further
participation in the energy sector while offering liquidity during our ongoing litigation.
The  litigations  with  Oakwell  Engineering  Limited,  ("Oakwell")  a  Singapore  company  and  VBC
Ferro Alloy Limited, ("VBC") an India company, is ongoing and continues to be a detriment to our
operations.  In June 2004, Oakwell filed an Application with the Superior Court of Justice for the
Province of Ontario ("the Superior Court") seeking to enforce a Singapore judgment against the
Company in Ontario. The Company defended that Application and filed its own Application for a
declaration  that  the  Singapore  judgment  not  be  enforceable  in  the  Province  of  Ontario.    The
Superior Court ruled in favour of Oakwell.
In July 2005, the Company filed a Notice of Appeal of the Superior Court decision in the Court of
Appeal for the Province of Ontario.  The Company anticipates that the appeal will be heard in
early 2006.  The Company believes that the appeal has considerable merit.
If the Judgment is ultimately enforced in Canada, the Company's financial condition would be
materially  and  adversely  affected  and  our  shareholders  need  to  be  aware  that  in  an  effort  to
satisfy the Judgment we will be required to sell assets of the Company. A provision of CDN $7.9
million at June 30, 2005 has been made to the Company's financial statements in relation to the
judgment.
The  Company  owns  11.8  million  common  shares,  par  value  10  Indian  Rupees  (the  "KEOPL
Shares"), in Konaseema EPS Oakwell Power Limited ("KEOPL") an India company developing a
445 mega watt power project in Andhra Pradesh, India. We have an Arbitration Award passed by
Hon'ble  Arbitral  Tribunal,  India  requiring  VBC  to  purchase  our  shares  of  KEOPL  at  par  value,
which is approximately CDN $3.3 million. VBC is avoiding the obligation and the Company is
pursuing legal remedies in India with some success.  At present the Division Bench of the High
Court of Andhra Pradesh has ordered VBC to post one third of the amount of the award with the
court while VBC appeals a lower court decision ordering them to pay the award or be wound up.
In closing, while drilling for oil and gas may be a capital intensive and risky venture the industry is
currently enjoying record prices for its commodity which, upon exploration success, mitigates risk.
The  Company  is  presently  focused  on  increasing  our  land  position  to  secure  opportunities  for
future development and obtaining seismic and other exploratory data to identify potential targets.
Participation  in  drilling  prospects  with  other  oil  and  gas  companies  reduces  our  capital
requirements in such wells. This enables us to allocate funds to defend the Company through
what  is  expected  to  be  a  long  and  expensive  process  through  the  various  levels  of  the  court
system and at the same time allows us to grow our business and add shareholder value. We
believe  that  the  expansion  of  our  Sibbald  property  and  the  introduction  of  the  Buick  Creek
property will help us achieve this goal.
You are encouraged to read the Company's audited financial statement and annual 20-F filing for
more detail of the subjects discussed briefly above.
Yours truly,
EnerNorth Industries Inc.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION & ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS
The  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  EnerNorth  Industries  Inc.  ("EnerNorth"  or  the
"Company") should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial
Statements  for  the  fiscal  years  ended  June  30,  2005,  2004  and  2003  and  notes  thereto.  This
Management  Discussion  and  Analysis  is  dated  September  23,  2005.    Unless  otherwise
indicated, the following discussion is based on Canadian dollars and presented in accordance
with Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP").
Certain measures in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis do not have any standardized
meaning as prescribed by Canadian generally accepted accounting principles such as netback
and other production figures and therefore are considered non-GAAP measures. Therefore these
measures  may  not  be  comparable  to  similar  measures  presented  by  other  issuers.  These
measures have been described and presented in this management discussion and analysis in
order  to  provide  shareholders  an  potential  investors  with  additional  information  regarding  the
Company’s liquidity an its ability to generate funds to finance its operations.
Certain statements contained herein constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning
of  the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995  (the  “Reform  Act”),  which  reflect  the
Company’s  current  expectations  regarding  the  future  results  of  operations,  performance  and
achievements  of  the  Company.    The  Company  has  tried,  wherever  possible,  to  identify  these
forward-looking statements by, among other things, using words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,”  “expect”  and  similar  expressions.    These  statements  reflect  the  current  beliefs  of
management  of  the  Company,  and  are  based  on  current  available  information.    Accordingly,
these statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which
could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to differ materially
from  those  expressed  in,  or  implied  by,  these  statements.    (See  the  Company’s  Annual

OVERVIEW
The Company is a corporation amalgamated under the laws of the Province of Ontario and is
provincially  registered  in  the  Provinces  of  Alberta,  British  Columbia  and  Newfoundland.  The
Company’s primary activities are investment in, exploration and development and production of
oil and gas.
Effective  February  1,  2005  the  Company  divested  of  its  interest  in  M&M  Engineering  Limited
(“M&M”) for cash proceeds of $7,361,999. The transaction was a sale of 100% of the common
shares  and  100%  of  the  preferred  shares  of  M&M  held  by  the  Company.  Prior  to  closing,  the
Company retracted preferred shares of M&M for Cdn $1,000,000 cash and M&M assigned to the
Company  100%  of  10915  Newfoundland  Limited,  a  Newfoundland  and  Labrador  company
(“10915  Newfoundland”),  and  100%  of  11123  Newfoundland  Limited,  a  Newfoundland  and
Labrador  company  (“11123  Newfoundland”).  Each  of  10915  Newfoundland  and  11123
Newfoundland owned a portion of the facilities located in Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and
Labrador.  The  facilities  consisted  of  two  parcels  of  land.    The  larger  of  the  two  parcels  has  a
fabrication  building  with  a  52  foot  high  and  104  foot  high  steel  frame  building,  containing
44,000  square  feet,  designed  for  utilization  as  a  fabrication  and  assembly  shop.  The  second
parcel of land has a transfer shed containing a total of 96,000 square feet including an attached
two-story  office  section  (with  full  basement)  and  a  one-story  office  section.  The  Company
received shareholder approval for the transaction at a special meeting of shareholders held on
January  26,  2005.  For  the  purpose  of  financial  presentation,  the  operations  of  M&M  and  its
subsidiaries have been accounted for as discontinued operations.
Effective June 29, 2005 the Company sold its 100% interest in 10915 Newfoundland and 11123
Newfoundland for cash proceeds of $175,000.
The audited consolidated financial results for the twelve month periods ending June 30, 2005,
2004 and 2003 include the accounts of the Company as well as an investment in Konasseema
EPS  Oakwell  Power  Limited  (“KEOPL”)  a  company  incorporated  in  India  that  is  developing  a
power project in Andhra Pradesh, India, and investments in marketable securities. The Company
through its wholly-owned subsidiary EPS Karnataka Power Corp. (“EPS Karnataka”) an Ontario
corporation,  holds  97%  of  Euro  India  Power  Canara  Private  Limited  (“EIPCL”)  an  Indian
corporation that is carried at Nil on the balance sheet and consolidated statement of operations of
the  Company.  Management  has  evaluated  the  effect  that  EIPCL  accounts  would  have  on  the
audited consolidated financial statements of the Company at June 30, 2005 and June 30, 2004
and concluded that such amounts would be insignificant under GAAP.
The  Company’s  oil  and  gas  operations  are  located  in  Alberta,  British  Columbia  and  Ontario,
Canada.    The  Company’s  financial  results  are  influenced  by  its  business  environment.  Risks
include, but are not limited to: crude oil and natural gas prices; cost to find, develop, produce and
deliver  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  demand  for  and  ability  to  deliver  natural  gas;  government
regulations and cost of capital.
The  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  the  basis  of  a  going  concern,
which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in
the normal course of business.
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the enforceability of the
Oakwell Claim (See Note 21 of the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements). If
the application of the Judgment becomes enforceable in Canada then there would be a material
and adverse impact on the Company’s financial condition. The Company’s consolidated financial
statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  to  the  amounts  and  classification  of  assets  and
liabilities  that  might  be  necessary  should  the  Company  not  be  able  to  continue  in  the  normal
course of operations. If the “going concern” assumption is not appropriate for these consolidated
financial  statements  then  adjustments  may  be  necessary  to  the  carrying  value  of  assets  and
liabilities, the reported revenues and expenses, and the balance sheet classifications used.
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The  Company’s  producing  wells  are  subject  to  normal  levels  of  decline  and  unavoidable
changes in operating conditions in facilities operated by third parties. The Company’s production
revenue  is  subject  to  commodity  price  fluctuations  over  which  the  Company  has  no  control.
 Some of the business risks could include:
volatility in market prices for oil and natural gas;
reliance on third party operators;
ability to find or produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas;
liabilities inherent in oil and natural gas operations;
dilution of interests in oil and natural gas properties;
uncertainties associated with estimating oil and natural gas reserves;
new prospects and exploration activities may have inherent risks;
competition  for,  among  other  things,  financings,  acquisitions  of  reserves,  undeveloped  lands  and  skilled
personnel; and
governmental regulation and environmental legislation.
OVERALL PERFORMANCE
The  Company’s  overall  performance  for  the  twelve  months  ended  June  30,  2005  can  be
highlighted by an increase of 25% in total average production volume to 60 boe/d compared to 48
boe/d  for  the  twelve  month  period  in  2004.    As  a  result,  gross  revenues  increased  by  24%  to
$946,655  for  the  twelve  month  period  ending  June  30,  2005  versus  $765,941  for  the  twelve
month period ending June 30, 2004.
Effective  February  1,  2005  the  Company  divested  of  its  interest  in  M&M.  For  the  purpose  of
financial presentation, the operations of M&M and its subsidiaries have been accounted for as
discontinued operations. As a result the Company incurred a gain on disposition of the operating
segment  of  $1,717,646.  During  the  year  ended  June  30,  2005  the  Company  had  earnings
associated  with  the  operating  segment  of  $317,351  versus  $1,627,664  for  the  previous  twelve
month period.
Net loss from continuing operations decreased 43% to $2,197,746 for the twelve month period
ending June 30, 2005 versus a net loss from continuing operations of $3,845,606 for the twelve
month period ending June 30, 2004. Earnings were hindered by litigation expense and accruals
related to the Oakwell Claim over the past three fiscal years. During the current fiscal year, the
Company  incurred  $982,912  in  litigation  expenses  while  the  Company  also  accrued  712,349
related to the Oakwell Claim. During the previous fiscal year, the Company incurred $889,614 of
litigations  expenses  and  accrued  $2,015,681  related  to  the  Oakwell  Claim.  (See  “Critical
Accounting Estimates – Oakwell Claim” below).

During  fiscal  2005  the  Company  sold  its  interests  in  M&M  Engineering  Limited  (“M&M”).  As  a
result  the  Industrial  &  Offshore  Division  has  been  treated  as  discontinued  operations  for
accounting purposes, and prior years' statements of operations have been restated.
OPERATING RESULTS
Fiscal 2005 versus Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2004 versus Fiscal 2003
Production  Volumes. For the twelve month period ending June 30, 2005 average production
volumes increased 25% to 60 boe/d compared to 48 boe/d for the same twelve month period in
2004.    Overall  increases  were  due  to  new  production  sources  from  the  Company’s  Farrow,
Sibbald and Olds-Davey properties located in Alberta Canada.
For the twelve month period ending June 30, 2005 average gas production increased 12% to 239
mcf/d  compared  to  214  mcf/d  for  the  same  twelve  month  period  in  2004.    Increased  gas
production was due to additions from the Company’s Sibbald and Olds-Davey properties, Alberta.
For  the  twelve  month  period  ending  June  30,  2005  average  natural  gas  liquids  production
increased 43% to 10 bbls/d compared to 7 bbls/d for the same twelve month period in 2004.
For the twelve month period ending June 30, 2005 average oil production increased 120% to 11
bbls/d compared to 5 bbls/d for the same twelve month period in 2004. Increased oil production
was due to additions from the Company’s Farrow and Sibbald properties, Alberta.
For the twelve months ending June 30, 2004 average production volumes increased 2% to 48
boe/d compared to 47 boe/d for the same twelve month period in 2003.  Overall production of gas
and natural gas liquids were up during fiscal 2004 due to new production from the Cherhill and
Caroline  properties.  The  Company  had  production  decreases  in  oil  production  in  fiscal  2004
resulting from the temporary shut in of a well in the Farrow area and the abandonment of an oil
well in Ontario.
For the twelve month period ending June 30, 2004 average gas production increased 5% to 214
mcf/d  compared  to  203  mcf/d  for  the  same  twelve  month  period  in  2003.    Increased  gas
production  was  primarily  due  to  additions  from  the  Company’s  Olds-Davey  and  Sibbald
properties, Alberta.
For  the  twelve  month  period  ending  June  30,  2004  average  natural  gas  liquids  production
increased 40% to 7 bbls/d compared to 5 bbls/d for the same twelve month period in 2003.
For the twelve month period ending June 30, 2004 average oil production decreased 29% to 5
bbls/d compared to 7 bbls/d for the same twelve month period in 2003. Decreased oil production
was primarily due to natural declines.
Commodity  Prices. During the twelve month period  ending  June  30,  2005,  commodity  prices
increased by 14% to an average of $43.37 per boe compared to $38.16 per boe for the twelve
month period in 2004. These price increases reflect the general price increase in the respective
commodities in the market.
Average gas prices per mcf increased by  3%  to  $6.86  during  the  twelve  month  period  ending
June 30, 2005 compared to $6.65 per mcf for the twelve month period ending June 30, 2004.
Average natural gas liquids prices per barrel increased by 35% to $39.34 during the twelve month
period ending June 30, 2005 compared to $29.16 per barrel for the twelve month period ending
June 30, 2004.
Average oil prices per barrel increased by 47% to $55.46 during the twelve month period ending
June 30, 2005 compared to $37.61 per barrel for the twelve month period ending June 30, 2004.
During the twelve month period ending June 30, 2004, commodity prices decreased by 3% to an
average  of  $38.16  per  boe  compared  to  $39.43  per  boe  for  the  twelve  month  period  in  2003.
These  price  decreases  reflect  the  general  price  increase  in  the  respective  commodities  in  the
market.
Average gas prices per mcf increased by  8%  to  $6.65  during  the  twelve  month  period  ending
June 30, 2004 compared to $6.15 per mcf for the twelve month period ending June 30, 2003.
Average prices for natural gas liquids per barrel decreased by 14% to $29.16 during the twelve
month period ending June 30, 2004 compared to $34.03 per barrel for the twelve month period
ending June 30, 2003.
Average oil prices per barrel decreased by 6% to $37.61 during the twelve month period ending
June 30, 2004 compared to $40.17 per barrel for the twelve month period ending June 30, 2003.
Gross  oil  and  gas  revenue.  The  Company's  gross  oil  and  gas  revenue  of  $946,655  for  the
twelve month period ending June 30, 2005 increased by 24% from $765,941 for the comparative
twelve  month  period  ending  June  30,  2004.  Revenue  growth  was  driven  by  both  production
increases and increases in commodity prices. Production increases stemmed primarily from re-
completed wells in the Sibbald area, commencement of production from previously drilled gas
wells in the Olds-Davey area and the remedial work completed on an oil well in the Farrow area.
The Company's gross oil and gas revenue of $765,941 for the twelve month period ending June
30, 2004 increased by 14% from $673,573 for the comparative twelve month period ending June
30, 2003. Revenue growth was primarily driven by production increases realized primarily from
the  Company’s  Olds-Davey  and  Cherhill  properties.  These  increases  were  partially  offset  by
decreased oil production from the Company’s Farrow property.
Royalties. Royalties increased by 89% to $201,172 for the twelve month period ending June 30,
2005  compared  to  $106,485  for  the  twelve  month  period  ended  June  30,  2004.  Increased
royalties  were  a  result  of  increased  production  volumes  primarily  from  the  Company’s  Farrow,
Olds-Davey and Sibbald properties along with increased commodity prices. Royalties increased
by 51% to $9.22 per boe compared to $6.09 per boe in 2004.

month  period  ending  June  30,  2005,  37%  higher  than  operating  and  transportation  costs  of
$292,275 during the comparable twelve month period in 2004. Higher production expenses were
a result of increased production volumes and increased operations primarily on the Company’s
Sibbald,  Olds/Davey  and  Farrow,  Alberta  properties.  During  the  year  production  cost  per  boe
increased by 10% to $18.32 per boe compared to $16.72 per boe during 2004.

2004,  5%  higher  than  operating  and  transportation  costs  of  $279,189  during  the  comparable
twelve month period in 2003. Higher production expenses were a result of increased production
volumes  and  increased  production  costs  per  boe.  During  the  year  production  cost  per  boe
increased by 2% to $16.72 per boe from $16.34 per boe during 2003.

accretion expense was $691,539, 51% higher compared to $458,230 for the twelve month period
in 2004.  The increased depletion and accretion was a result of higher production volumes and a
higher value of properties in the depletion pool.
For  the  twelve  month  period  ending  June  30,  2004,  depletion  and  accretion  expense  was
$458,230, 10% higher compared to $416,937 for the twelve month period in 2003.  The increased

ending June 30, 2005 were 16% higher than administrative expenses of $1,921,385 the previous
year. The primary component of administrative expenses for the twelve month period ending June
30,  2005  was  related  to  litigation  expenses  of  $982,912  versus  $889,614  for  the  previous  12

exchange was $539,836 compared to a foreign exchange loss of $24,070 for the twelve month
period  in  2004.  The  foreign  exchange  gain  during  fiscal  2005  related  to  appreciation  in  the
Canadian  dollar  relating  to  the  Oakwell  Claim.  This  gain  was  partially  offset  by  a  foreign
exchange loss relating to Company’s investment in KEOPL.
For the twelve month period ending June 30, 2004 the loss on foreign exchange was $24,070
compared  to  a  foreign  exchange  loss  of  $122,440  for  the  twelve  month  period  in  2003.  The
foreign exchange loss during fiscal 2004 related to depreciation in the Canadian dollar relating to
the Company’s investment in KEOPL. This loss was partially offset by foreign exchange gains
from  the  Oakwell  Claim.    During  fiscal  2003  the  foreign  exchange  loss  related  primarily  to
depreciation in the balance of funds held in cash (See Critical Accounting Estimates – Oakwell
Claim and Valuation of the Company's Investment in KEOPL, below).
Interest income. For the twelve months ending June 30, 2005 interest income was $305,836,
63%  higher  compared  to  $187,440  for  the  comparable  twelve  month  period  in  2004.    The
increase in interest income was related to interest payments received on the Company’s KEOPL
investment as well as interest on cash held in short maturity investments.

Net revenues from the Company’s oil and gas operations have generally increased over the past
eight quarters due to general increases in production rates and commodity prices (See “Trend
Information” below). Earnings have tended to recede during the winter months of both fiscal 2005
and  2004  and  during  the  first  and  second  quarter  of  fiscal  2005  due  to  increased  litigation
expenditures related to the Oakwell Claim and the accrual of the Singapore Judgments.  These
expenditures  and  accruals  were  tied  to  the  timing  of  court  hearings  and  decisions  and  do  not
represent a normal business trend.
FOURTH QUARTER FISCAL 2005
During the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2005 the Company’s net revenue was $149,274 versus
$294,439 recorded in the fourth quarter ending June 30, 2004.
During the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2005 the Company disposed of its interests in 10915
Newfoundland Limited and 11123 Newfoundland Limited for cash proceeds of $175,000. Both of
10915  Newfoundland  Limited  and  11123  Newfoundland  Limited  were  inactive  and  their  only
assets were holdings in two properties located in Newfoundland and Labrador.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2005 was $5,286,315 compared to $600,313 at June
30, 2004. During the twelve month period ending June 30, 2005 the Company’s cash flows used
from  operating  activities  from  continuing  operations  was  $1,342,888  versus  funds  used  from
operating activities of $1,871,961 during the previous year.
Many  of  the  changes  in  balance  sheet  accounts  are  represented  by  the  disposal  of  the
Company’s Industrial & Offshore Division. These items have been reclassified as cash provided
by discontinued operations. During the twelve month period ending June 30, 2005 the Company
had net cash provided by discontinued operations of $5,968,814 versus cash used of $1,181,034
by the discontinued operations during the previous fiscal year. During the twelve month period
ending  June  30,  2005  the  Company  had  proceeds  of  $8,111,989  on  the  disposal  of  M&M
Engineering and used $2,375,728 from investing activities of discontinued operations. During the
previous year the Company used $592,727 on discontinued operations. During the twelve month
period  ending  June  30,  2005  the  Company  used  $2,981,618  on  financing  activities  of
discontinued operations versus $54,910 for the previous year.
The Company also expended $1,001,743 on development of oil and gas properties during the
twelve month period ended June 30, 2005 versus $1,740,154 during the previous twelve month
period ending June 30, 2004. As exhibited in select financial information above production has
increased to 60 boe/d for the 12 month period ending June 30, 2005 as a result of the capital
expenditures  from  48  boe/d  for  the  same  period  in  fiscal  2004.  The  Company  also  invested
$1,863,324 in marketable securities during the twelve month period ending June 30, 2005 versus
$327,765 in the previous period.
The  Company  has  the  resources  to  meet  its  present  working  capital  requirements  with  the
exception of the Oakwell Claim.
The  Company's  primary  sources  of  liquidity  and  capital  resources  historically  have  been  cash
flows from the operations of oil and gas operations, the issuance of share capital, advances from
shareholders  and  cash  flows  from  discontinued  operations.  During  fiscal  2000  and  2001  the
Company  recovered  part  of  its  investment  in  KEOPL.    During  fiscal  2005,  it  is  expected  that
primary sources of liquidity and capital resources will be derived from the oil and gas operations
and a further recovery in connection with an arbitration award (See “Critical Accounting Estimates
– Valuation of the Company’s Investment in KEOPL” below).
With respect to specific estimates that could have a material affect on future operations and cash
flows  (See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Oakwell Claim and the Valuation of the Company's
Investment in KEOPL” below).
Outlook and Prospective Capital Requirements.
Effective  February  1,  2005  the  Company  divested  of  its  interest  in  M&M  for  cash  proceeds  of
$7,361,999.  The Company retracted preferred shares of M&M for Cdn $1,000,000 cash.  The
Company also sold its interest in 10915 Newfoundland Limited and 11123 Newfoundland Limited
for cash proceeds of $175,000.
The Company’s oil and gas operations have steadily increased since its inception in 2001. At
present,  the  Company  intends  to  apply  significant  cash  to  further  develop  its  oil  and  gas
properties.  As  part  of  the  Company's  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  development  program,
management of the Company anticipates further expenditures to expand its existing portfolio of
proved and probable oil and gas reserves. Amounts expended on future oil and gas exploration
and development is dependent on the nature of future opportunities evaluated by the Company.
These expenditures could be funded through cash held by the Company or through cash flow
from operations. Any expenditure which exceeds available cash will be required to be funded by
additional share capital or debt issued by the Company, or by other means. With respect to other
potential  expenditures  of  the  Company  see  “Critical  Accounting  Estimates  -  Oakwell  Claim”
below.
The Company's long-term profitability will depend upon its ability to successfully implement its
business  plan.  Also,  if  the  Company  is  not  successful  in  defending  the  enforceability  of  the
Oakwell  Claim  in  Canada,  there  will  be  a  material  and  adverse  impact  on  the  Company’s
financial position and operations may be curtailed.
The Company expects to apply cash of approximately $600,000 on the completion of 4 wells in
the Buick Area of British Columbia and anticipates future additional capital expenditures to tie
these wells on to production.
TREND INFORMATION
Seasonality.  The  Company's  Oil  &  Gas  Division  is  not  a  seasonal  business,  but  increased
consumer demand or changes in supply in certain months of the year can influence the price of
produced  hydrocarbons,  depending  on  the  circumstances.  Production  from  the  Company's  oil
and gas properties is the primary determinant for the volume of sales during the year.
There are a number of trends that have been developing in the oil and gas industry during the
past several years that appear to be shaping the near future of the business. The first trend is the
volatility  of  commodity  prices.  Natural  gas  is  a  commodity  influenced  by  factors  within  North
America.  The  continued  tight  supply  demand  balance  for  natural  gas  is  causing  significant
elasticity in pricing. Despite record drilling activity, a strong economy, weather, fuel switching and
demand for electrical generation there still exists a tight supply causing prices to remain high.
Crude  oil  is  influenced  by  the  world  economy  and  OPEC's  ability  to  adjust  supply  to  world
demand. Recently crude oil prices have been kept high by political events causing disruptions in
the supply of oil, and concern over potential supply disruptions triggered by unrest in the Middle
East.
Political events trigger large fluctuations in price levels. The impact on the oil and gas industry
from commodity price volatility is significant. During periods of high prices, producers generate
sufficient cash flows to conduct active exploration programs without external capital. Increased
commodity  prices  frequently  translate  into  very  busy  periods  for  service  suppliers  triggering
premium costs for their services. Purchasing land and properties similarly increase in price during
these  periods.  During  low  commodity  price  periods,  acquisition  costs  drop,  as  do  internally
generated funds to spend on exploration and development activities. With decreased demand,
the prices charged by the various service suppliers also decline.
A second trend within the Canadian oil and gas industry is recent growth in the number of private
and  small  junior  oil  and  gas  companies  starting  up  business.  These  companies  often  have
experienced management teams from previous industry organizations that have disappeared as
a  part  of  the  ongoing  industry  consolidation.  Many  are  able  to  raise  capital  and  recruit  well
qualified personnel.
A third trend currently affecting the oil and gas industry is the impact on capital markets caused by
investor uncertainty in the North American economy. The capital market volatility in Canada has
also been affected by uncertainties surrounding the economic impact that the Kyoto Protocol will
have  on  the  sector.  Generally  during  the  past  year,  the  economic  recovery  combined  with
increased commodity prices has caused an increase in new equity financings in the oil and gas
industry.  The  Company  must  compete  with  the  numerous  new  companies  and  their  new
management teams and development plans in its access to capital. The competitive nature of the
oil  and  gas  industry  will  cause  opportunities  for  equity  financings  to  be  selective.  Some
companies  will  have  to  rely  on  internally  generated  funds  to  conduct  their  exploration  and
developmental programs.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES AND NEWLY ADOPTED
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company's significant accounting policies, estimates and changes to accounting policies are
also described in the Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 2005, 2004, 2003. It is increasingly important to understand that the application of
generally accepted accounting principles involves certain assumptions, judgments and estimates
that  affect  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities,  revenues  and  expenses.  The  application  of
principles can cause varying results from company to company.
The  most  significant  accounting  policies  that  impact  the  Company  relate  to  oil  and  gas
accounting  and  reserve  estimates,  future  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities,  and  stock  based
compensation.
The most significant accounting estimates that impact the Company and its subsidiaries relate to
the Oakwell Claim and the valuation of the Company's investment in KEOPL.
During  fiscal  2005  the  Company  adopted the  recommendations  of  the  new  CICA  Handbook
Section  3870,  stock-based  compensation  and  other  stock-based  payments.  The  only  new
accounting  policy  that  was  adopted  by  the  Company  during  the  2004  fiscal  year  was  a  new
accounting policy guideline for oil and gas accounting according to the new Canadian Institute of
Chartered Accountants (“CICA”) Handbook guideline ACG-16.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Oil and gas accounting and reserve estimates. The Company follows the full cost method of
accounting for oil and gas operations under which all costs of exploring for and developing oil
and gas reserves are initially capitalized. Such costs include land acquisition costs, geological
and geophysical expenses, carrying charges on non-producing properties, costs of drilling and
overhead charges directly related to acquisition and exploration activities.
Under the full cost method all of the costs noted above are capitalized, together with the costs of
production equipment, and are depleted on the unit-of-production method based on the estimated
gross  proved  reserves.  Petroleum  products  and  reserves  are  converted  to  equivalent  units  of
natural gas at 6,000 cubic feet to 1 barrel of oil.
Under  the  full  cost  method  costs  of  acquiring  and  evaluating  unproved  properties  are  initially
excluded from depletion calculations. These unevaluated properties are assessed periodically to
ascertain whether impairment in value has occurred. When reserves are identified as “proven” by
independent engineers, or the property is considered to be impaired, then the cost of the property
or the amount of the impairment is added to costs subject to depletion calculations.
Proceeds  from  a  sale  of  petroleum  and  natural  gas  properties  are  applied  against  capitalized
costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless such a sale would significantly alter the rate of
depletion.  Alberta Royalty Tax Credits are included in oil and gas sales.
In  applying  the  full  cost  method,  under  Canadian  GAAP,  the  Company  performs  a  ceiling  test
which restricts the capitalized costs less accumulated depletion and amortization from exceeding
an amount equal to the estimated fair market value undiscounted value of future net revenues
from proved and probable oil and gas reserves, as determined by independent engineers, based
on sales prices achievable under forecast prices existing contracts and posted average reference
prices in effect at the end of the year and forecast current costs, and after deducting estimated
future general and administrative expenses, production related expenses, financing costs, future
site restoration costs and income taxes. For calculating the fair value the company utilizes a 5%
discount factor.
In comparison, in applying the full cost method under US GAAP, the Company performs a ceiling
test based on the same calculations used for Canadian GAAP except the Company is required to
discount future net revenues at 10% as opposed to utilizing the fair market value. Also, probable
reserves are excluded.
Future Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. The Company uses the asset and liability method of
accounting  for  income  taxes.  Under  this  method,  future  income  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are
determined  based  on  differences  between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  and  their
respective  income  tax  bases  (temporary  differences).  Management  regularly  reviews  its  tax
assets  for  recoverability  and  establishes  a  valuation  allowance  based  on  (i)  historical  taxable
income; (ii) projected future taxable income; and (iii) the accounting treatment reflected in Note 11
of the Company’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. As of June 30, 2005 the Company
had  $6,944,172  of  non-capital  losses,  Cumulative  Canadian  oil  and  gas  property  expenses  of
$7,778,236 and capital losses of $10,449,015.
Stock based compensation. The Company has established a stock option plan (the "Plan") for
directors,  officers,  employees,  consultants  and  service providers  During  2005,  the  Company
adopted  the  recommendations  of  the  new  CICA  Handbook  Section  3870,  stock-based
compensation  and  other  stock-based  payments.    The  primary  difference  between  this  new
accounting  policy  and  the  former  policy  is  that  the  company  calculates  the  fair  value  of  stock
options  issued  to  directors  and  employees.  The  Company  has  chosen  to  adopt  the
recommendation prospectively.
As a result of adopting the new accounting policy the Company records compensation expense
on all stock options granted. The fair value is recorded at their fair value at date of issuance and
the amount is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.   During fiscal 2005 the
Company recorded $149,109 of compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
Oakwell  Claim.  
In  March  1997,  Oakwell  Engineering  Limited  (“Oakwell”)  and  the  Andhra
Pradesh State Electricity Board (“APSEB”) executed two identical Power Purchase Agreements
(“PPA”),  providing  for  Oakwell  and/or  its  sponsors  to  build,  own  and  operate  two  identical
100 MW net capacity diesel generator Barge Mounted Power Plants (“BMPP”), fueled by furnace
oil (total 200 MW net capacity) and sell electricity to APSEB on a take-or-pay basis for 15 years.
 In June 1997, the Company and Oakwell formed an 87.5%/12.5% joint venture and incorporated
an Indian company, EPS Oakwell Power Limited (“EOPL”) (now known as KEOPL), to implement
the provisions of the PPA’s.  Disputes rose between the Company and Oakwell and a Settlement
Agreement  was  reached  in  December  1998  under  which  Oakwell  sold  the  Company  all  of
Oakwell's interest in the PPA’s and in EOPL.
In July 2002, Oakwell claimed the Company was in breach of the Settlement Agreement and in
August  2002,  the  Company  was  named  as  a  defendant  in  the  High  Court  of  the  Republic  of
Singapore, in the matter of Oakwell vs. the Company.  On October 16, 2003 the High Court of
Singapore ordered the Company to pay Oakwell US $5,657,000 (approximately CDN $6,933,219
at June 30, 2005) plus costs (the “Judgment”). On November 13, 2003 the Company appealed the
Judgment to the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Singapore. That Court, which is the final Court
of Appeal for Singapore, dismissed the appeal on April 27, 2004.
On June 21, 2004, Oakwell filed an Application with the Superior Court of Justice for the Province
of Ontario (“Superior Court”) seeking to enforce the Judgment in Ontario. On August 30, 2004, the
Company filed an Application with the Superior Court for a declaration that the Judgment is not
enforceable in the Province of Ontario. The hearing of the Applications was held December 6-9,
2004. On June 27, 2005 the Superior Court judge rendered his decision that the Judgment was
enforceable in Ontario with costs and on August 2, 2005 the Superior Court issued the formal
Order.
On  July  13,  2005,  the  Company  filed  a  Notice  of  Appeal  of  the  August  2,  2005  Order  of  the
Superior Court with the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario.  The Company anticipates the
hearing  of  the  Appeal  to  be  held  in  early  2006  and  the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  be
rendered by the end of 2006.
On January 12, 2005, Oakwell filed an Execution Petition before the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi,
India against the Company for enforcement of the Judgment and an application for interim relief
seeking attachment of the Company’s 11,848,200 KEOPL Shares, 100% of the shares of EPS
Karnataka  which  owns  97%  of  EIPCL.    EIPCL  has  a  PPA  secured  by  a  cash  deposit  in  the
amount of INR 10,000,000 (approximately CDN $281,700 at June 30, 2005) with the Karnataka
State Electricity Board.
On  September  9,  2005  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  of  Delhi,  India  adjourned  Oakwell’s  Execution
Petition to attach the Company’s KEOPL Shares, EPS Karnataka shares and EIPCL but ordered
that  if  the  Company  receives  any  payments  from  the  sale  of  it’s  KEOPL  Shares,  then  the
proceeds shall be deposited in the Company’s account held in a Public Sector Bank in India or
invested only in Government of India securities until the disposal of Oakwell’s Execution Petition.
The Execution Petition is ongoing and the hearing has been adjourned to February 3, 2006.
In the event that Oakwell is successful in India in attaching the Company’s KEOPL Shares, EPS
Karnataka shares and EIPCL, the Company may not enjoy any potential future gains resulting
from its investment in EIPCL, which has been accounted for as discontinued operations.
A  provision  of  CDN  $7,956,346  at  June  30,  2005  has  been  made  to  the  Company’s  financial
statements in relation to the Judgment.
If the Judgment is ultimately enforced in Canada, the Company’s financial condition would be
materially and adversely affected.
The following sensitivity analysis measures the affect on future cash flows and profitability given
a 10% increase or decrease in exchange rates. The sensitivity also measures the affect on future
cash flows and profitability given future court rulings result in full settlement, a 50% settlement
and an outright declaration that the Singapore judgment is unenforceable in Canada.

Assuming  the  full  amount  is  payable  and  foreign  currency  rates  remain  stable  then  future  net
income would not be affected whereas future net cash of $7,956,349 would be paid. Assuming a
10% appreciation in the Canadian currency then future net income would increase by $795,635
and the future cash outlay would be $7,160,714. Assuming 10% depreciation in the Canadian
currency then future net income would decrease by $795,635 and the future cash outlay would be
$8,751,984. Assuming the Company is able to settle with Oakwell for 50% of the amount accrued
at the year ending June 30, 2005 then future net income would increase by $3,978,175 and the
future cash outlay would be $3,978,175 and finally assuming the Oakwell Claim is unenforceable
in Canada then the affect on future net income would be an increase of $7,956,349 and there will
be no future outlay of cash resources.
HB Capital contingent liability.  A statement of claim has been filed in the Supreme Court of
Newfoundland and Labrador, Trial Division, Suit # 1998 St. J. No. 3233 against the Company by
a  former  financial  adviser  alleging  breach  of  contract.  The  plaintiff  has  claimed  for  special
damages in the amount of approximately $230,000 (US $184,197) and a success fee equal to 1%
of the gross debt/equity financing of the Andhra Pradesh project less up to 20% of any corporate
contributions to the project by the Company or its affiliates. Management believes that the claim is
without merit and has filed a counter claim. No correspondence or activity has occurred since
2000 and management believes that the plaintiff has abandoned the litigation. No provision has
been made in the Company’s audited Consolidated Financial Statements for this claim.
The Company estimates the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and
range  of  loss  can  be  estimated.  Where  there  is  a  range  of  loss,  the  Company  records  the
minimum estimated liability related to those claims. As additional information becomes available,
we  assess  the  potential  liability  related  to  our  pending  litigation  and  revise  our  estimates
accordingly. Revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results
of future operations. If the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differ adversely from
those currently expected, it would result in a charge to earnings when determined.
Valuation of the Company's Investment in KEOPL. As of June 30, 2005 the Company owns
11,848,200  KEOPL  Shares  formerly  known  as  EOPL.    Pursuant  to  an  Arbitration  Agreement
between the Company and VBC Ferro Alloys Ltd. (“VBC”), the parent company of KEOPL, an
Arbitration  Award  was  passed  on  October  11,  2003  by  Hon’ble  Arbitral  Tribunal,  India  (the
“Award or Decree”) requiring as follows (i) VBC transfer an additional 500,000 equity shares in
KEOPL to the Company, and (ii) VBC to buy the original KEOPL Shares for INR 113,482,000
(approximately CDN $3.2 million at June 30, 2005) on or before the earlier of: (a) 60 days after the
first disbursal of funds on financial closure for the KEOPL Project, and, (b) in any event no later
than March 31, 2004.  Further, the Company may, upon written notice to VBC, require that VBC
purchase, and VBC is then required to buy, an additional 500,000 equity shares of KEOPL at a
par value of INR 5,000,000 (approximately CDN $140,850 at June 30, 2005) on or before the
same dates.  If VBC does not buy the 11,348,200 KEOPL Shares before March 31, 2004 then
VBC is liable to pay the Company interest at 12% per annum on the value of the unredeemed
shares from March 31, 2004 to the date of actual payment thereof.
On February 28, 2004 the Company provided written notice to effect the purchase by VBC of the
11,348,200 KEOPL Shares held by the Company.
VBC  raised  a  dispute  regarding  the  purchase  of  the  KEOPL  Shares  and  on  June  24,  2004  the  Company  filed  an
Execution Petition against VBC in the Court of the Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, India (“City Civil Court”) to
enforce the Award. The Execution Petition is ongoing and the hearing has been adjourned until October 21, 2005.
On November 30, 2004 the Company also  filed  a  Company  Petition  against  VBC  in  the  High
Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh, India (the “High Court”) to pass an order for the winding
up of VBC under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 (India). On April 29, 2005 the High
Court  passed  an  Order  for  the  winding  up  of  VBC  and  awarded  the  Company  costs  of  the
Petition.
VBC appealed before the Division Bench in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, India to set aside
the Order of the High Court dated April 29, 2005. On June 8, 2005 the Division Bench of the High
Court of Andhra Pradesh, India passed an Order granting VBC an interim stay of publication of
the winding up of VBC only subject to the condition of VBC depositing one-third (1/3rd) amount of
the  Decree  passed  in  pursuance  of  the  Award  along  with  the  interest  earned  on  the  principal
amount to the credit of Execution Petition on the file of Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad,
India on or before July 30, 2005. On September 6, 2005 the High Court passed a further Order
extending the date for deposit of one-third (1/3rd) amount of the Decree to September 30, 2005.
On August 1, 2005, the Company filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court of India
seeking  special  leave  to  appeal  the  Order  of  the  Division  Bench  in  the  High  Court  of  Andhra
Pradesh, India dated June 8, 2005.  The hearing has been set for October 3, 2005.
On September 20, 2004 and November 17, 2004 the Company received interest payments from
VBC  net  of  India  tax  for  the  period  March  31,  2004  to  June  30,  2004  and  July  1,  2004  to
September  30,  2004  in  the  amount  of  CDN  $84,142  (US  $62,800)  and  CDN  $76,366  (US
$63,990) respectively.
The investment in KEOPL is recorded at expected net recoverable amount of CDN $3,281,950 at
June 30, 2005. Management of the Company assessed the amount recoverable based on (i) the
par value of the shares, (ii) an assessment of VBC's ability to pay, (iii) financial closure of the
KEOPL project, (iv) the provisions of the Arbitration Award, (v) the pending legal proceedings,
and (vi) the likelihood and timing of payment. The actual recoverable amount is dependent upon
future events including foreign exchange fluctuations and could differ materially from the amount
estimated by management.
KEOPL Sensitivity Analysis: The following sensitivity measures the affect on future cash flows
and  profitability  given  a  10%  increase  or  decrease  in  exchange  rates.  The  sensitivity  also
measures the affect on future cash flows and profitability given that the future amount recovered
from VBC results in a full recovery, a 50% settlement, and no recovery on the investment (Please
note that if there is no recovery on the investment then the Company will continue to hold the
underlying  shares in  KEOPL  which  represent  an  approximate  3%  interest  in  a  459  mega  watt
power project).

The underlying valuation will revert to a new base of measurement determined by the underlying

Assuming the full amount is recoverable and foreign currency rates remain stable then future net
income will not be affected whereas future net cash of $3,281,950 would be received. Assuming
a 10% appreciation in the Canadian currency then future net income will decrease by $247,737
and the future cash received would be $3,034,213. Assuming 10% depreciation in the Canadian
currency,  the  future  net  income  would  be  nil  however  the  future  cash  received  would  be
$3,708,482. The affect on net income would be delayed until the gain was actually realized (on
receipt of funds). On receipt of funds a gain of $426,532 would be realized.
Assuming VBC is able to settle with EnerNorth for 50% of the amount agreed in the Arbitration
Award  as  valued  at  the  year  ending  June  30,  2005  then  future  net  income  will  decrease  by
$1,668,817 and the future cash received will be $1,668,817. Finally assuming the VBC does not
honour the Arbitration Award then we are unable to measure the affect on net income and future
cash  flow  as  an  alternative  measurement  basis  should  be  applied.  Such  a  basis  may  include
valuing the underlying shares of KEOPL.
NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Stock Based Compensation: During 2005, the Company adopted the recommendations of the
new CICA Handbook Section 3870, stock-based compensation and other stock-based payments.
  The  primary  difference  between  this  new  accounting  policy  and  the  former  policy  is  that  the
Company  calculates  the  fair  value  of  stock  options  issued  to  directors  and  employees.  The
Company has chosen to adopt the recommendation prospectively.
As a result of adopting the new accounting policy the Company records compensation expense
on all stock options granted. The fair value is recorded at their fair value at date of issuance and
the amount is estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.
Oil and gas accounting: During 2004, the Company adopted the recommendations of the new
CICA  Handbook  guideline  AcG-16.    The  primary  difference  related  to  this  new  accounting
standard  relates  to  the  application  of  the  ceiling  test.  Under  the  new  standard  the  capitalized
costs less accumulated depletion and amortization are restricted to the fair value of proved and
probable reserves as opposed to the undiscounted value of proved reserves less general and
administrative  expenses,  tax  and  financing  costs.  As  a  result  of  applying  the  new  standards,
management determined that a transitional impairment loss of $1,945,786 be recorded as at July
1, 2003.
RECENTLY ISSUED UNITED STATES ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In  December  2004,  the  FASB  Issued  SFAS  No.  123R,  “Share  Based  Payments”,  which
addresses  the  issue  of  measuring  compensation  cost  associated  with  Share  Based  Payment
plans. This statement requires that all such plans, for public entities, be measured at fair value
using an option, pricing model whereas previously certain plans could be measured using either
a  fair  value  method  or  an  intrinsic  value  method.    The  revision  is  intended  to  increase  the
consistency  and  comparability  of  financial  results  by  only  allowing  one  method  of  application.
 This revised standard is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June
15, 2005 for awards granted on or after the effective date. The adoption of this statement did not
have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations.
In  June  2004,  FASB  issued  an  exposure  draft  of  a  proposed  Statement,  “Fair  Value
Measurements”  to  provide  guidance  on  how  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  financial  and  non-
financial assets and liabilities when required by other authoritative accounting pronouncements.
The  proposed  statement  attempts  to  address  concerns  about  the  ability  to  develop  reliable
estimates of fair value and inconsistencies in fair value guidance provided by current U.S. GAAP,
by  creating  a  framework  that  clarifies  the  fair  value  objective  and  its  application  in  GAAP.  In
addition,  the  proposal  expands  disclosures  required  about  the  use  of  fair  value  to  re-measure
assets and liabilities. The standard would be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005.  The Company is evaluating the effect of this standard on its
consolidated financial statements.

Auditors' Report
To the Shareholders of
EnerNorth Industries Inc.
We  have  audited  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  EnerNorth  Industries  Inc.  as  at  June  30,
2005 and 2004 and the consolidated statements of operations and deficit and cash flows for the
years ended June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003.  These financial statements are the responsibility of
the  Company's  management.    Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards
and the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those
standards require that we plan and perform an audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit
also  includes  assessing  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Company as at June 30, 2005 and 2004 and the results of its operations
and  its  cash  flows  for  the  years  ended  June  30,  2005,  2004  and  2003  in  accordance  with
Canadian generally accepted accounting principles.

Comments by Auditor for U.S. Readers
on Canada-U.S. Reporting Difference
In  the  United  States,  reporting  standards  for  auditors  require  the  addition  of  an  explanatory
paragraph (following the opinion paragraph) when there is a change in accounting principles that
has  a  material  effect  on  the  comparability  of  the  Company's  financial  statements,  such  as  the
changes described in Note 23 to the financial statements.  Our report to the shareholders dated
September 8, 2005 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting standards which do not
require a reference to such changes in accounting principles in the Auditors' Report when the
changes are properly accounted for and adequately disclosed in the financial statements.
In  the  United  States,  reporting  standards  for  auditors  require  the  addition  of  an  explanatory
paragraph  (following  the  opinion  paragraph)  when  the  financial  statements  are  affected  by
conditions and events that cast substantial doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going
concern, such as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. Our report to
the shareholders dated September 8, 2005 is expressed in accordance with Canadian reporting
standards which do not require a reference to such events and conditions in the auditors' report
when these are adequately disclosed in the financial statements.

EnerNorth Industries Inc.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)
June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003
Nature of Operations
EnerNorth Industries Inc. (the "Company") is a corporation amalgamated under the laws of the
Province of Ontario.  The Company's business is its exploration and development and production
of  oil  and  gas.  Through  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary  EPS  Karnataka  Power  Corp.  ("EPS
Karnataka") a company incorporated in Ontario the Company owns a 97% interest in Euro India
Power Canara Limited ("EIPCL") a company incorporated in India both carried on the balance
sheet as Nil.
During  fiscal  2005  the  Company  disposed  of  its  interest  in  its  wholly-owned  subsidiary  M&M
Engineering Limited ("M&M") and its wholly-owned subsidiary M&M Offshore Limited ("MMO"), its
partnership Liannu LLP ("Liannu") and the proportionate share of its interests in joint ventures
whose  business  focus  is  construction  mechanical  contracting  and  steel  fabrication  in
Newfoundland. These operations have been treated as discontinued operations for accounting
purposes (See Note 12). As such the operations of M&M, MMO, and Liannu have been excluded
from the consolidated statement of loss and deficit from continuing operations in current and prior
periods.
During  the  year  the  Company  disposed  of  its  interests  in  10915  Newfoundland  Limited  and
11123 Newfoundland Limited both of which were inactive and their only assets were holdings in
two properties located in Newfoundland and Labrador.
Going Concern
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern,
which contemplates that the Company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in
the normal course of business.
The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the enforceability of the
Oakwell Claim (see Note 21).  If the application of the Judgment becomes enforceable in Canada
then there would be a material and adverse impact on the Company's financial condition.
These  consolidated  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  to  the  amounts  and
classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should the Company not be able to
continue in the normal course of operations.  If the "going concern" assumption is not appropriate
for these consolidated financial statements then adjustments may be necessary to the carrying
value  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  reported  revenues  and  expenses,  and  the  balance  sheet
classifications used.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in Canada.
Oil and Gas Properties
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations whereby all
costs of exploring for and developing oil and gas reserves are initially capitalized.  Such costs
include land acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenses, carrying charges on non-
producing properties, costs of drilling and overhead charges directly related to acquisition and
exploration activities.

EnerNorth Industries Inc.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)
June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003
Oil and Gas
Properties - (Continued)
Costs capitalized, together with the costs of production equipment, are depleted on the unit-of-
production method based on the estimated proved reserves.  Petroleum products and reserves
are converted to equivalent units of natural gas at approximately 6,000 cubic feet to 1 barrel of oil.
Costs  of  acquiring  and  evaluating  unproved  properties  are  initially  excluded  from  depletion
calculations.    These  unevaluated  properties  are  assessed  periodically  to  ascertain  whether
impairment has occurred.  When proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be
impaired, the cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to costs subject to
depletion calculations.
Proceeds from a sale of oil and natural gas properties are applied against capitalized costs, with
no  gain  or  loss  recognized,  unless  such  a  sale  would  significantly  alter  the  rate  of  depletion.
 Alberta Royalty Tax Credits are included in oil and gas sales.
In applying the full cost method, the Company performs an annual impairment test ("ceiling test")
which restricts the capitalized costs less accumulated depletion and amortization from exceeding
an  amount  equal  to  the  estimated  fair  market  value  of  future  net  revenues  from  proved  and
probable oil and gas reserves, as determined by independent engineers, based on sales prices
achievable under forecast prices and posted average reference prices in effect at the end of the
year and forecast costs, and after deducting estimated future production related expenses, future
site restoration costs and income taxes.
Royalties
As  is  normal  to  the  industry,  the  Company's  production  is  subject  to  crown,  freehold  and
overriding royalties, and mineral or production taxes.  These amounts are reported net of related
tax credits and other incentives available.
Environmental and 
   Site Restoration
Costs
A provision for environmental and site restoration costs is made when restoration requirements
are established and costs can be reasonably estimated.  The accrual is based on management's
best estimate of the present value of the expected cash flows.  Site restoration costs increase the
carrying  amount  of  the  oil  and  gas  properties  and  are  amortized  on  the  same  basis  as  the
properties.
Accounting Estimates
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with Canadian generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  disclosures  of  contingent  assets  and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues
and  expenses  during  the  reporting  period.    By  their  nature,  these  estimates  are  subject  to
measurement uncertainty and the effect on the consolidated financial statements of changes in
such estimates in future periods could be material.

EnerNorth Industries Inc.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(Expressed in Canadian Dollars)
June 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003
Revenue Recognition
Revenues  associated  with  the  sale  of  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  are  recorded  when  the  title
passes to the customer. Revenues from crude oil and natural gas production from properties in
which  the  Company  has  an  interest  with  other  producers  are  recognized  on  the  basis  of  the
Company's net working interest.
Measurement Uncertainty
The amounts recorded for depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties, the provision for
asset retirement obligation and stock based compensation are based on estimates. The ceiling
test is based on estimates of proved reserves, production rates, oil and gas prices, future costs
and  other  relevant  assumptions.  By  their  nature,  these  estimates  are  subject  to  measurement
uncertainty and the effect on the financial statements of changes and estimates in future periods
could be significant.
The Company is subject to various regulatory and statutory requirements relating to the protection
of the environment. These requirements, in addition to contractual agreements and management
decisions, result in the accrual of estimated asset retirement obligation costs. These costs are
accrued  on  the  unit  of  production  basis.  Any  changes  in  these  estimates  will  affect  future
earnings.
Costs  attributable  to  commitment  and  contingencies  are  expected  to  be  incurred  over  an
extended  period  of  time  and  are  to  be  funded  mainly  from  the  Company's  cash  provided  by
operating  activities.  Although  the  ultimate  impact  of  these  matters  on  net  earnings  cannot  be
determined at this time, it could be material for any one-quarter or year.
The  Company's  investment  in  Konaseema  EPS  Oakwell  Power  Ltd.  ("KEOPL"),  a  company
incorporated in India that is developing a power project in Andhra Pradesh, India is subject to
several  risk  factors.  The  actual  recoverable  amount  is  dependent  upon  future  events,  foreign
exchange  fluctuations  and  subject  to  certain  sovereign  risks  such  as  stable  political  and
economic  conditions.  The  amount  actually  recovered  could  differ  materially  from  the  amount
estimated by management.
The  Company's  investment  in  Marketable  Securities  is  carried  at  the  lower  of  book  value  or
market  value.  The  actual  market  value  is  determined  by  external  factors  that  are  beyond  the
control of management and may fluctuate materially.
Stock Based Compensation
The Company has established a stock option plan (the "Plan") for directors, officers, employees,
consultants  and  service  providers.  Effective  July  1,  2004,  the  Company  adopted  the
recommendations of the CICA Handbook Section 3870 "Stock Based Compensation and Other
Stock-Based Payments". This section was amended to require the expensing of all stock based
compensation awards for fiscal years beginning after January 1, 2003. The Company has chosen
to adopt the recommendation prospectively thereby recording the fair value of the stock options
issued since July 1, 2004 in the income statement using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Cash and Cash 
   Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments in money market
instruments with original maturities of three months or less.
Marketable
Securities
Marketable securities are valued at the lower of cost or market on a portfolio basis.
Capital Assets
Capital Assets
Capital  assets  were  disposed  of  during  the  year  (See  note  12).  They  consist  primarily  of
fabrication buildings, office equipment, manufacturing equipment and vehicles. These assets are
recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and write down for impairment.
Capital assets are amortized on the declining balance basis over their estimated useful lives at
the following rates:
Buildings
3%
Manufacturing equipment
20%
Tools and equipment
20%
Office equipment
20%
Vehicles
30%
Paving
7%
Equipment under capital leases
20%
Foreign Currency  
   Translation
Foreign currency accounts are translated to Canadian dollars as follows:
At  the  transaction  date,  each  asset,  liability,  revenue  or  expense  is  translated  into  Canadian
dollars by the use of the exchange rate in effect at that date.  At the year end date, monetary
assets and liabilities are translated into Canadian dollars by using the exchange rate in effect at
that  date  and  the  resulting  foreign  exchange  gains  and  losses  are  included  in  Consolidated
Statement of Operations and Deficit in the current period.
Income Taxes
The  Company  accounts  for  income  taxes  under  the  asset  and  liability  method.    Under  this
method, future income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and
available loss carry forwards.  A valuation allowance is established to reduce tax assets if it is
more likely than not that all or some portions of such tax assets will not be realized.

11, 2003 by Hon'ble Arbitral Tribunal, India (the "Award or Decree") requiring as follows (i) VBC
transfer an additional 500,000 equity shares in KEOPL to the Company, and (ii) VBC to buy the
original KEOPL Shares for INR 113,482,000 (approximately CDN $3.2 million at June 30, 2005)
on or before the earlier of: (a) 60 days after the first disbursal of funds on financial closure for the
KEOPL Project, and, (b) in any event no later than March 31, 2004.  Further, the Company may,
upon  written  notice  to  VBC,  require  that  VBC  purchase,  and  VBC  is  then  required  to  buy,  an
additional 500,000 equity shares of KEOPL at a par value of INR 5,000,000 (approximately CDN
$140,850 at June 30, 2005) on or before the same dates.  If VBC does not buy the 11,348,200
KEOPL Shares before March 31, 2004 then VBC is liable to pay the Company interest at 12% per
annum on the value of the unredeemed shares from March 31, 2004 to the date of actual payment
thereof.
On February 28, 2004 the Company provided written notice to effect the purchase by VBC of the
11,348,200 KEOPL Shares held by the Company.

Investment (Continued)
All requirements of the Award had been met as KEOPL reached financial closure in February
2004  and  in  any  event,  the  deadline  of  March  31,  2004  passed.  Accordingly,  the  Company
classified the investment as current. VBC raised a dispute regarding the purchase of the KEOPL
Shares and on June 24, 2004 the Company filed an Execution Petition against VBC in the Court
of the Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, India ("City Civil Court") to enforce the Award.
The Execution Petition is ongoing and the hearing has been adjourned until October 21, 2005.
On November 30, 2004 the Company also  filed  a  Company  Petition  against  VBC  in  the  High
Court of Judicature of Andhra Pradesh, India (the "High Court") to pass an order for the winding
up of VBC under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 (India). On April 29, 2005 the High
Court  passed  an  Order  for  the  winding  up  of  VBC  and  awarded  the  Company  costs  of  the
Petition.
VBC appealed before the Division Bench in the High Court of Andhra Pradesh, India to set aside
the Order of the High Court passed and dated April 29, 2005. On June 8, 2005 the Division Bench
of  the  High  Court  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  India  passed  an  Order  granting  VBC  an  interim  stay  of
publication of the winding up of VBC only subject to the condition of VBC depositing one-third of
the amount of the Decree passed in pursuance of the Award along with the interest earned on the
principal amount to the credit of Execution Petition on the file of Chief Judge, City Civil Court,
Hyderabad, India on or before July 30, 2005. On September 6, 2005 the High Court passed a
further Order extending the date for deposit of one-third of the amount of the Decree to September
30, 2005.
On August 1, 2005, the Company filed a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court of India
seeking  special  leave  to  appeal  the  Order  of  the  Division  Bench  in  the  High  Court  of  Andhra
Pradesh, India dated June 8, 2005.  The hearing has been set for October 3, 2005.
On September 20, 2004 and November 17, 2004 the Company received interest payments from
VBC  net  of  India  tax  for  the  period  March  31,  2004  to  June  30,  2004  and  July  1,  2004  to
September  30,  2004  in  the  amount  of  CDN  $84,142  (US  $62,800)  and  CDN  $76,366  (US
$63,990) respectively.
The  Arbitration  Award  is  enforceable  in  the  courts  of  India  however  delays  in  payment  have
occurred  as  the  Execution  Petition,  the  Company  Petition  and  the  Special  Leave  Petition  are
ongoing. The Company anticipates that the courts will enforce the Award and that VBC will be
required to purchase the shares in KEOPL. The timing of the purchase of the shares by VBC is
dependant on the eventual rulings on the above Petitions. As a result the investment in KEOPL
has been classified as long term.
The  Company  estimates  that  the  carrying  amounts  of  the  investment  in  KEOPL  will  be  fully
recovered.  The  actual  recoverable  amount  is  dependent  upon  future  events  including  foreign
exchange  fluctuations  The  amount  actually  recovered  could  differ  materially  from  the  amount
estimated by management.

value of its oil and gas properties. The oil and gas future prices are based on the commodity price
forecast of the Company's independent reserve evaluators. These prices have been adjusted for
heating  content,  quality  and  transportation  parameters  specific  to  the  Company.  The  following

Reconciliation to Accounting Principles
Generally Accepted in the United States
The Company's accounting policies do not differ materially from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States ("US GAAP") except for the following:
(a)
Stock Options
Under US GAAP (FAS 123), stock options granted to consultants are recognized as an expense
based  on  their  fair  value  at  the  date  of  grant.    Prior  to  the  adoption  of  the  Canadian  Institute
Chartered  Accountants  ("CICA")  section  3870,  under  Canadian  GAAP  the  options  were
disclosed and no compensation expense was recorded.
(b)
Joint Venture
Under  US  GAAP,  the  Company  would  use  the  equity  method  of  accounting  for  joint  ventures
rather  than  the  proportionate  consolidation  method  of  accounting.    For  further  information  see
Note 6.
(c)
Comprehensive Income
Under US GAAP, comprehensive income must be reported which is defined as all changes in
equity other than those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.
Other comprehensive income includes the unrealized holding gains and losses on the available-
for-sale securities see Note 17(e).
(d)
Marketable Securities
Under  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  Canada,  gains  (losses)  in  shares  of  public
companies  are  not  recognized  until  investments  are  sold  unless  there  is  deemed  to  be  an
impairment  in  value  which  is  other  than  temporary.  Under  US  GAAP,  such  investments  are
recorded at market value and the unrealized gains and losses are recognized as a separate item
in the shareholder's equity section of the balance sheet unless impairments are considered other
than temporary.

Generally Accepted in the United States - (Continued)
(e)
Oil and Gas Properties
Under US GAAP, the Company is required to discount future net revenues at 10% for purposes of
calculating any required ceiling test write-down.  In comparison, in applying the full cost method
under US GAAP, the Company performs a ceiling test based on the same calculations used for
Canadian  GAAP  except  the  Company  is  required  to  discount  future  net  revenues  at  10%  as
opposed  to  utilizing  the  fair  market  value  and  probable  reserves  are  excluded.  A  transitional
impairment  loss  was  recorded  for  Canadian  GAAP  purposes  due  to  a  change  in  accounting
policy, whereas for US GAAP purposes a further write-down was recorded.
(f)
Recently Issued United States Accounting Standards
In  December  2004,  the  FASB  Issued  SFAS  No.  123R,  "Share  Based  Payments",  which
addresses  the  issue  of  measuring  compensation  cost  associated  with  Share  Based  Payment
plans. This statement requires that all such plans, for public entities, be measured at fair value
using an option pricing model whereas previously certain plans could be measured using either a
fair  value  method  or  an  intrinsic  value  method.    The  revision  is  intended  to  increase  the
consistency  and  comparability  of  financial  results  by  only  allowing  one  method  of  application.
 This revised standard is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning on or after June
15, 2005 for awards granted on or after the effective date. The adoption of this statement did not
have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations.
In  June  2004,  FASB  issued  an  exposure  draft  of  a  proposed  Statement,  "Fair  Value
Measurements"  to  provide  guidance  on  how  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  financial  and  non-
financial assets and liabilities when required by other authoritative accounting pronouncements.
The  proposed  statement  attempts  to  address  concerns  about  the  ability  to  develop  reliable
estimates of fair value and inconsistencies in fair value guidance provided by current U.S. GAAP,
by  creating  a  framework  that  clarifies  the  fair  value  objective  and  its  application  in  GAAP.  In
addition,  the  proposal  expands  disclosures  required  about  the  use  of  fair  value  to  re-measure
assets and liabilities. The standard would be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after June 15, 2005.  The Company is evaluating the effect of this standard on its
consolidated financial statements.

Segmented Information
The  Company's  operations  only  segment  is  oil  and  gas  exploration  and  production.    All
reportable segments are located in Canada. Previously the Company operated an Industrial and
Offshore Division. This segment was disposed of during the year (See Note 12 - Discontinued
Operations).
20.
Contingent Liability
In 1998 a statement of claim was filed against the Company by a former financial adviser alleging
breach of contract.  The plaintiff has claimed for special damages in the amount of approximately
$230,000 (US $184,197) and entitlement to a success fee of 1% of the gross debt/equity financing
of the Andhra Pradesh project less up to 20% of any corporate contributions by the Company or
its affiliates.  Management believes that the claim is without merit and has filed a counter claim.
  No  correspondence  or  activity  has  transpired  since  2000  and  management  believes  that  the
plaintiff has abandoned the litigation.  No provision has been made in these financial statements
for this claim.
21.  Oakwell Claim Payable
In  March  1997,  Oakwell  Engineering  Limited,  a  Singapore  corporation  ("Oakwell"),  and  the
Andhra  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board  of  the  state  of  Andhra  Pradesh,  India  (the  "APSEB")
executed two identical Power Purchase Agreements ("PPA's"), providing for Oakwell and/or its
sponsors  to  build,  own  and  operate  two  identical  100  mega  watt  ("MW")  net  capacity  diesel
generator  barge  mounted  power  plants  ("BMPPs"),  fueled  by  furnace  oil  (total  200  MW  net
capacity) and sell electricity to APSEB on a take-or-pay basis for 15 years.  In June 1997, the
Company  and  Oakwell  formed  an  87.5%/12.5%  joint  venture  and  incorporated  an  Indian
company,  EPS  Oakwell  Power  Limited  ("EOPL")  (now  known  as  KEOPL),  to  implement  the
provisions of the PPA's.  Disputes rose between the Company and Oakwell and a Settlement
Agreement  was  reached  in  December  1998  under  which  Oakwell  sold  the  Company  all  of
Oakwell's interest in the PPA's and in EOPL.
In July 2002, Oakwell claimed the Company was in breach of the Settlement Agreement and in
August 2002, the Company was named as a defendant in the High Court of Singapore, in the
matter  of  Oakwell  vs.  the  Company.    On  October  16,  2003  the  High  Court  of  the  Republic  of
Singapore ordered the Company to pay Oakwell US $5,657,000 (approximately CDN $6,933,219
at June 30, 2005) plus costs (the "Judgment"). On November 13, 2003 the Company appealed
the Judgment to the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Singapore. That Court, which is the final
Court of Appeal for Singapore, dismissed the appeal on April 27, 2004.

Oakwell Claim Payable (Continued)
On June 21, 2004, Oakwell filed an Application with the Superior Court of Justice for the Province
of Ontario, Canada (the "Superior Court") seeking to enforce the Judgment in Ontario. On August
30,  2004,  the  Company  filed  an  Application  with  the  Superior  Court  for  a  declaration  that  the
Judgment is not enforceable in the Province of Ontario. The hearing of the Applications was held
December 6-9, 2004. On June 27, 2005 the Superior Court judge rendered his decision that the
Judgment was enforceable in Ontario with costs and on August 2, 2005 the Superior Court issued
the formal Order.
On  July  13,  2005,  the  Company  filed  a  Notice  of  Appeal  of  the  August  2,  2005  Order  of  the
Superior Court with the Court of Appeal for the Province of Ontario.  The Company anticipates the
hearing  of  the  Appeal  to  be  held  in  early  2006  and  the  decision  of  the  Court  of  Appeal  to  be
rendered by the end of 2006.
A  provision  of  CDN  $7,956,346  at  June  30,  2005  has  been  made  to  the  Company's  financial
statements in relation to the Judgment.
On January 12, 2005, Oakwell filed an Execution Petition before the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi,
India against the Company for enforcement of the Judgment and an application for interim relief
seeking attachment of the Company's 11,848,200 KEOPL Shares, 100% of the shares of the EPS
Karnataka, which owns 97% of EIPCL.
On  September  9,  2005  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  of  Delhi,  India  adjourned  Oakwell's  Execution
Petition to attach the Company's holdings of KEOPL Shares, EPS Karnataka shares and EIPCL
but ordered that if the Company receives any payments from the sale of it's KEOPL Shares, then
the proceeds shall be deposited in the Company's account held in a Public Sector Bank in India
or  invested  only  in  Government  of  India  securities  until  the  disposal  of  Oakwell's  Execution
Petition. The Execution Petition is ongoing and the hearing has been adjourned to February 3,
2006.
In  the  event  Oakwell  be  successful  in  India  in  attaching  the  Company's  KEOPL  Shares,  EPS
Karnataka Shares and EIPCL, the Company may not enjoy any potential future gains on a sale of
its investment in EIPCL, which has been accounted for as discontinued operations and carried on
the Company's balance sheet as nil.

Change in Accounting Policy
(a)
Stock Options
Effective  July  1,  2004,  the  Company  adopted  the  recommendations  of  the  CICA  Handbook
Section 3870 "Stock Based Compensation and Other Stock-Based Payments". This section was
amended  to  require  the  expensing  of  all  stock  based  compensation  awards  for  fiscal  years
beginning  after  January  1,  2003.  The  Company  has  chosen  to  adopt  the  recommendation
prospectively thereby recording the fair value of the stock options issued since July 1, 2004 in the
income statement using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. As a result of applying the new
accounting policy the Company recorded a stock option benefit of $149,109 (See Note 10).
(b)
Oil & Gas Accounting
During 2004, the Company adopted the recommendations of the new CICA Handbook guideline
AcG-16.  The primary difference related to this new accounting standard relates to the application
of the ceiling test. Under the new standard the capitalized costs less accumulated depletion and
amortization are restricted to the fair value of proved and probable reserves as opposed to the
undiscounted  value  of  proved  reserves  less  general  and  administrative  expenses,  tax  and
financing  costs.  As  a  result  of  applying  the  new  standards,  management  determined  that  a
transitional impairment loss of $1,945,786 should be recorded as at July 1, 2003.
