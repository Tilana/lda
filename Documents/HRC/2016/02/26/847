<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 48/141, in which the General Assembly established the post of 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Assembly directed the High 
Commissioner to promote and protect the realization of the right to development and to 
enhance support from relevant bodies of the United Nations system for this purpose. It also 
directed the High Commissioner to recognize the importance of promoting a balanced and 
sustainable development for all people and of ensuring realization of the right to 
development, as established in the Declaration on the Right to Development. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 24/4, requested the Office of the High 
Commissioner to continue to submit to the Council an annual report on its activities, 
including inter-agency coordination within the United Nations system with regard to the 
promotion and realization of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 68/158, the General Assembly requested the High Commissioner, in 
mainstreaming the right to development, to undertake effectively activities aimed at 
strengthening the global partnership for development among Member States, development 
agencies and the international development, financial and trade institutions, and to reflect 
those activities in detail in her next report to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>4. Also in resolution 68/158, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to 
submit a report to the Assembly for consideration at its sixty-ninth session, and an interim 
report to the Human Rights Council on the implementation of resolution 68/158, including 
efforts undertaken at the national, regional and international levels in the promotion and 
realization of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>5. The present report is submitted in accordance with the above requests and provides 
information on the activities undertaken by the Office of the High Commissioner (OHCHR) 
and United Nations human rights mechanisms during the period from May 2013 to April 
2014. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Operational framework for promoting and protecting the 
realization of the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>6. In implementing its mandate to promote and protect the realization of the right to 
development, OHCHR is guided by the Declaration on the Right to Development, the 
Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and relevant resolutions of the General 
Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>7. The Declaration on the Right to Development, in its article 1, states that the right to 
development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all 
peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and 
political development, in which all human rights and fundamental freedoms can be fully 
realized. 
</p>
<p>8. The right to development is a human right on an equal footing with all other human 
rights. The recognition that every human person and all peoples are entitled to a 
development process in which all human rights can be realized fully is at the core of the 
human rights-based approach to development. </p>


<p>9. The strategic framework for the period 2014&#8211;20151 sets an objective to contribute to 
the effective realization of the right to development as a means to advance the promotion 
and protection of the effective enjoyment of all human rights by all.  
10. In this regard, OHCHR seeks in particular:  
</p>
<p>(a) To integrate the promotion and protection of the right to development into 
global partnerships for development and, as appropriate, in the policies and operational 
activities of relevant actors at all levels; 
</p>
<p>(b) To promote and protect the realization of the right to development;  
(c) To enhance awareness, knowledge and understanding of the right to 
</p>
<p>development at all levels.  
</p>
<p>11. OHCHR has adopted a multidimensional strategy to support the implementation of 
the right to development, which focuses on: 
</p>
<p>(a) Ensuring the realization of the right to development throughout the human 
rights programme and by the relevant bodies of the United Nations system through 
strengthened and effective evaluation and monitoring to that end, and taking into account 
the need for sustainable development;  
</p>
<p>(b) Enhancing substantive support for the Human Rights Council and its 
subsidiary mechanisms relating to the right to development, including support for the open-
ended intergovernmental Working Group on the Right to Development; 
</p>
<p>(c) Building stronger partnerships and collaboration with relevant actors, 
including Member States, multilateral institutions and civil society, including non-
governmental organizations, so that support given to human rights bodies relevant to the 
right to development, as well as funds and specialized agencies, will have increased focus 
on its practical implementation;  
</p>
<p>(d) Encouraging the promotion and protection of the right to development in 
global development partnerships, as reflected in Millennium Development Goal 8 (aid, 
trade and debt reduction), through advocacy, networking, technical advice and the 
establishment of partnerships and other kinds of cooperation;  
</p>
<p>(e) Promoting the implementation of the right to development in technical 
assistance to requesting States and, taking into account a human rights-based approach, in 
national development strategies, such as poverty reduction strategy papers, where they 
exist, national Millennium Development Goals strategies and United Nations development 
frameworks, through close cooperation with Member States and United Nations agencies, 
funds and programmes; 
</p>
<p>(f) Identifying obstacles to the implementation of the right to development at the 
international, regional and national levels and promoting awareness about the content and 
importance of that right, including through increased engagement, research, advocacy and 
informational and educational activities; 
</p>
<p>(g) Promoting cooperation at the international and regional levels in 
mainstreaming the right to development, including by undertaking activities aimed at 
effectively strengthening the global partnership for development among Member States, 
development agencies and international development, financial and trade institutions. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 A/67/461, annex, approved by the General Assembly in its decision 67/542. </p>


<p>12. The above strategy is further reflected in the OHCHR Management Plan for the 
period 2014-2017, in which the right to development is part of the thematic priority 
&#8220;Human rights in development and in the economic sphere&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. As part of the thematic strategy of the Management Plan, OHCHR seeks:  
</p>
<p>(a) To integrate human rights into the formulation of and follow-up to the post-
2015 development agenda by, inter alia, advocating for a strengthened global partnership 
for development, and the individual and collective human rights responsibilities of States 
and other relevant actors, including with regard to the right to development; 
</p>
<p>(b) To integrate international human rights principles and standards, including 
the right to development, into finance, trade and investment policies, which requires the 
mainstreaming of the right to development into global partnerships between Member 
States, national development agencies, and businesses, and international development, 
financial and trade institutions;  
</p>
<p>(c) To integrate human rights standards and principles into common country 
assessments, United Nations development assistance frameworks, consolidated appeal 
processes and the work of United Nations agencies, which involves working to bring all 
human rights principles and standards, including the right to development, into United 
Nations policies guidelines and training tools related to development programming, through 
inputs to the work of all relevant inter-agency coordination mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities of the Office of the High Commissioner 
</b>14. OHCHR has conducted many activities and initiatives, a full account of which is 
available on the OHCHR webpage dedicated to the right to development 
(www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Development/Pages/DevelopmentIndex.aspx). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Publications 
</b></p>
<p>15. With a view to advancing a broader understanding of the right to development, the 
Office completed its publication entitled <i>Realizing the Right to Development: Essays in 
Commemoration of 25 Years of the United Nations Declaration on the Right to 
Development</i>. The publication focuses on the sustained, progressive and incremental steps 
necessary to protect and promote the realization of the right to development. The book 
presents a wide range of in-depth analytical studies by more than 30 international experts 
on the context, meaning and application of the right to development. It illustrates the 
usefulness of this right as a development paradigm, including in the post-2015 development 
agenda, and makes the case for reinvigorating it to advance peace and security, human 
rights and sustainable development. In particular, the forward by the High Commissioner 
sets out a basic understanding of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>16. Article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that the specific 
entitlement of the right to development is the right &#8220;to participate in, contribute to, and 
enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development&#8221;. This basic entitlement includes 
a number of constituent elements, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) People-centred development: the Declaration identifies &#8220;the human person&#8221; 
as the central subject, participant and beneficiary of development;  
</p>
<p>(b) A human rights-based approach: the Declaration specifically requires that 
development be carried out in a manner &#8220;in which all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms can be fully realized&#8221;; </p>


<p>(c) Participation: the Declaration calls for the &#8220;active, free and meaningful 
participation&#8221; of people in development; 
</p>
<p>(d) Equity: the Declaration underlines the need for &#8220;the fair distribution of the 
benefits&#8221; of development; 
</p>
<p>(e) Non-discrimination: the Declaration permits no &#8220;distinction as to race, sex, 
language or religion&#8221;;  
</p>
<p>(f) Self-determination: the Declaration integrates self-determination, including 
full sovereignty over natural resources, as a constituent element of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>17. Equally explicit are the prescriptions provided by the Declaration for the 
implementation of this right, inter alia: 
</p>
<p>(a) The formulation of appropriate national and international development 
policies; 
</p>
<p>(b) Effective international cooperation; 
(c) Reforms at the national and international levels; 
(d) Removal of obstacles to development, inter alia, human rights violations, 
</p>
<p>racism, colonialism, occupation and aggression;  
</p>
<p>(e) The promotion of peace and disarmament, and the redirecting of savings 
generated therefrom to development. 
</p>
<p>18. The book and related publicity materials (including an introductory pamphlet in all 
official languages of the United Nations) were disseminated and distributed to a broad 
range of stakeholders. The publication was launched at events on the theme &#8220;Realizing a 
vision for transformative development&#8221;, which brought together eminent experts, 
contributing authors, delegations, United Nations agencies, academia, activists, civil society 
organizations and university students to engage in interactive exchanges, which reinforced 
the call to revitalize this right in development and governance at all levels.2  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights and the financial crisis 
</b></p>
<p>19. In recognition of the devastating impact of the financial and economic crises on 
human rights worldwide and in an effort to promote awareness of the human rights 
implications of financial regulation, OHCHR organized two expert meetings on the human 
rights impact of austerity measures: &#8220;Rights in crisis: an expert meeting on rights-based 
approaches to financial regulation, macroeconomic policies and economic recovery&#8221;, in 
April 2013; and &#8220;Human rights and the financial crisis in focus: an expert meeting on 
promoting a rights-based approach to financial regulation and economic recovery&#8221;, in July 
2013. The damage caused by the economic and financial crisis and some of the measures 
taken to respond to it worldwide point to structural and systemic failures in the predominant 
development model.<footnote name="3">3. OHCHR is mandated to mainstream the right to development into United Nations 
policies, operational activities, guidelines and tools on development programming. To that 
end, OHCHR continued to chair and substantively lead the work of the United Nations 
Development Group human rights mainstreaming mechanism. </footnote>

<p>20. In May 2013, OHCHR issued a report4 and subsequently published a booklet5 on the 
impact of austerity measures on economic, social and cultural rights, in particular on the 
right to work and the right to social security, with a specific focus on women, migrants and 
older persons. The report lays out the criteria that States should apply when considering the 
adoption of austerity measures: 
</p>
<p>(a) The existence of a compelling State interest; 
(b) The necessity, reasonableness, temporariness and proportionality of the 
</p>
<p>austerity measures; 
</p>
<p>(c) The exhaustion of alternative and less restrictive measures; 
(d) The non-discriminatory nature of the measures proposed; 
(e) Protection of a minimum core content of the rights;  
(f) Genuine participation of affected groups and individuals in decision-making 
</p>
<p>processes. 
</p>
<p>21. In June 2013, OHCHR undertook a mission to Basel, Switzerland, for meetings with 
the financial standard-setting bodies, namely the Bank for International Settlements, the 
Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the International 
Association of Insurance Supervisors, the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems 
and the International Association of Deposit Insurers. The mission provided an entry point 
for further cooperation between these bodies and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Post-2015 development agenda 
</b></p>
<p>22. OHCHR has been active in promoting all human rights, including the right to 
development, in the deliberations and processes to define the post-2015 development 
agenda, through research, advocacy, consultations, expert meetings and engagement with 
Member States, civil society and the broader public. 
</p>
<p>23. The High Commissioner has highlighted the importance of building the post-2015 
development agenda on the standards of human rights, including the right to development. 
In June 2013, she issued an open letter to all Member States (available from 
www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/MDGs/HCOpenLetterPost2015.pdf) in which she called 
for a new universal and balanced development framework that addresses both &#8220;freedom 
from fear and want&#8221; to realize all human rights for all without discrimination. Subsequent 
discussions held by the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals reflected 
strong support and convergence on many human rights issues that the High Commissioner 
called for in her open letter. On 25 September 2013, the High Commissioner also addressed 
the General Assembly at the special event to follow up efforts made towards achieving the 
Millennium development Goals, at which a growing number of States expressed their 
strong support for a post-2015 development agenda based on human rights, as reflected in 
the outcome document.<footnote name="6">General Assembly resolution 68/6. </footnote> She has also directly engaged with Member States in the Open 
Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals, which was tasked to consider the goals 
for a new development agenda. On the invitation of the co-Chairs of the Working Group, a

</p>

<p>keynote was delivered on behalf of the High Commissioner at its sixth session on human 
rights and the right to development in December 2013.7  
</p>
<p>24. OHCHR has also provided technical assistance together with the United Nations 
system to support the work of the Working Group. It participated in the United Nations 
technical support team, which prepared thematic issue briefs to support the work of the 
Working Group, including on human rights and the right to development, inequality, 
governance and a global partnership for development. In particular, OHCHR co-authored 
the technical support team issues brief on &#8220;Human rights, including the right to 
development&#8221;,<footnote name="8">Available from 
 
 http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/2391TST%20Human%20Rights 
%20Issues%20Brief_FINAL.pdf. 
</footnote> which highlighted the fact that, in order for the post-2015 development 
agenda to be grounded securely on the right to development as defined by the international 
community, the new agenda must direct development efforts to the realization of human 
rights, including through strengthened rule of law, greater human rights accountability, the 
active, free and meaningful participation of all people (including women, young people, 
migrants, older persons, minorities and persons with disabilities) and enhanced 
international cooperation. Where indigenous populations are concerned, participation 
should be governed by the principle of free, prior and informed consent. OHCHR also 
contributed to the Working Group&#8217;s statistical note for the issue brief on &#8220;Human rights, 
including the right to development&#8221;. Building the post-2015 development agenda on human 
rights requires integrating human rights throughout it. Assessing progress in the realization 
of the future agenda requires measuring both outcome and effort, disaggregating data, 
ensuring civil society participation and applying transparent criteria when selecting goals, 
targets and indicators. All targets and indicators should therefore be aligned with relevant 
existing human rights standards, including the right to development.  
</p>
<p>25. In 2013, OHCHR also published jointly with the Center for Economic and Social 
Rights the report &#8220;Who will be accountable? Human Rights and the Post-2015 
Development Agenda&#8221;.<footnote name="9">Available from www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/WhoWillBeAccountable.pdf. </footnote>

<p><b> </b> 26. The High Commissioner reminded States that the right to development puts people 
at the centre of development. It addresses the linkages between the national and 
international conditions that are necessary for development. The right also provides 
substance for the guarantee enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of a 
social and international order in which human rights can be fully realized. A truly enabling 
environment for development must address both the national and international constraints 
that limit the potential for development in all countries. Human rights entail extraterritorial 
obligations for all States to ensure that their policy decisions (as well as other actors under 
their jurisdiction, such as private corporations) do not have a negative impact on the human 
rights of people living in other countries.10 
</p>
<p>27. The current model of development is unequal, unstable and unsustainable. The 
financial, food, fuel, energy and climate crises have exacerbated inequalities both within 
and between countries, depriving millions of people of their right to a decent standard of 
living. In the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development, entitled &#8220;The future we want&#8221;, States called for a world that is &#8220;just, 
equitable and inclusive&#8221;.11 
</p>
<p>28. A central objective of the new development agenda must be the eradication of 
poverty, especially extreme poverty, which should be understood more broadly than an 
income of $1.25 per day. Poverty is multidimensional. It is rooted in the chronic 
deprivation of resources, capabilities, choices, security and power necessary for an 
adequate standard of living and other fundamental human rights. The new agenda must 
therefore aim to promote and protect both freedom from want and freedom from fear for all 
people, without discrimination. It must aim to fulfil the rights to education, health, housing, 
food, water, sanitation and decent work and social security. It must also take account of 
people&#8217;s concerns relating to personal security, access to and administration of justice, and 
the possibility of political participation, including free expression and association. 
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, the imperative of equality should underpin the entire agenda, so that 
marginalized groups, previously locked out from development, are included. This implies 
that three principles &#8211;equality, non-discrimination and a broader sense of equity &#8211;are 
integrated throughout the sustainable development goals. One of the key failings of the 
Millennium Development Goals was their focus on average statistics and aggregate 
progress, which excluded many people from development. Inequalities, both within and 
between countries, have risen in ways that put economic growth and social cohesion at risk, 
as social tensions flare into divisive and violent conflict. Equality must be integrated 
throughout the new framework. This can be achieved by disaggregating data for all social 
groups for all goals, targets and indicators, and monitoring progress for each group. This 
will help to create greater equity in access to health, education and other key social 
services. It will help to ensure the inclusion of the marginalized, disempowered and 
excluded groups, including women, minorities, indigenous peoples, persons with 
disabilities, migrants and others. The new targets and indicators must also include measures 
to eliminate discrimination and measures to reduce social, economic and environmental 
inequalities. This should include addressing the unequal environmental burdens borne by 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10
 The high-level task force on the implementation of the right to development concluded that the 
</p>
<p>responsibility for the creation of an enabling environment for the realization of the right to 
development encompassed three main levels: (a) States acting collectively in global and regional 
partnerships; (b) States acting individually as they adopt and implement policies that affect persons 
not strictly within their jurisdiction; and (c) States acting individually as they formulate. national 
development policies and programmes affecting persons within their jurisdiction. See 
A/HRC/15/WG.2/TF/2/Add.2, annex.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>indigenous peoples, traditional farmers, pastoralists, herders, coastal communities and 
people living in small island States in the face of natural disasters, desertification and global 
climate change. 
</p>
<p>30. The new agenda must also address inequalities between countries. In the wake of 
global financial, food, climate and energy crises &#8211; and the self-evident failures of global 
governance to prevent and mitigate their effects &#8211; the post-2015 agenda must address the 
pressing need for reforms at the international level. This includes human rights-based 
reforms of the institutions, processes and policies of global governance. It also includes 
democratizing the institutions of global governance, to give real voice and participation to 
all countries in global decision-making and to ensure greater fairness and equity in the 
shaping of the rules of global governance. This is essential in, for example, the field of 
trade, where rules on agricultural subsidies and intellectual property are still skewed in 
favour of the more powerful countries, in ways that often undermine the rights to food and 
health of people in developing countries. Meaningful reforms of trade, finance, investment, 
intellectual property, climate and other regimes are also needed to ensure that international 
rules and policies are consistent with, and do not undercut, the minimum standards set by 
human rights. All States must have the policy space to protect the human rights of their 
people, and must be held accountable for doing so. 
</p>
<p>31. The new agenda must also include a strong accountability framework, including 
accountability of the private sector. Millennium Development Goal 8, on global 
partnerships, included some useful indicators on aid, trade, debt and technology transfer, as 
well as on the need for special and differential treatment for least developed countries, 
including land-locked and small island developing States. No measurable targets, however, 
were set, and progress was not effectively monitored. The new agenda must build strong 
accountability mechanisms so that all States are accountable for honouring the 
commitments that they make. Other powerful actors, including private actors (such as 
transnational corporations), should also be held to account, to ensure responsible business 
practices. The exercise of due diligence, the use of human rights impact assessments, and 
the full application of the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights must all be 
ensured.  
</p>
<p>32. Lastly, it is vital that the new agenda be universally applicable. In the outcome 
document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled &#8220;The 
future we want&#8221;, States established that sustainable development goals must be universally 
applicable to all countries, while taking into account different national realities, capacities 
and levels of development. &#8220;Common but differentiated responsibilities&#8221; is a well-known 
concept in environmental law. International human rights law also takes account of States&#8217; 
different levels and stages of development through concepts of &#8220;progressive realization&#8221;, 
&#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; and the duties of international assistance and cooperation. 
The right to development sets out the duty to create an enabling international environment. 
In the current debate over universality and differentiation, the universally agreed &#8211;and &#8211;
universally applicable &#8211; normative framework of human rights thus seems more relevant 
than ever. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Mainstreaming the right to development 
</b></p>

<p>34. One focus area of the mechanism is policy coherence across the United Nations 
system and strengthening the positioning of human rights within global development 
agendas as a whole. During the period under review, OHCHR and the mechanism worked 
to support Member States in the integration of human rights and right to development 
provisions in the quadrennial comprehensive policy review. The review requested the 
United Nations to link normative (including human rights) and operational work and to 
provide capacity-development towards a more participatory and accountable development 
process. The strategic priorities for 2014-2017 of the United Nations Development Group 
were also subsequently revised, and now aim to deliver more coherent, effective and 
efficient support to countries in the achievement of internationally agreed development 
goals and human rights treaty obligations. 
</p>
<p>35. OHCHR continues to lead the United Nations system with regard to the realization 
of the right to development. This includes forging potential concrete partnerships on 
specific thematic areas, such as trade, finance and investment. OHCHR will take the lead 
within the mainstreaming mechanism on how human rights, including the right to 
development, can be further integrated into the strategic positioning of human rights within 
the context of the United Nations Development Group and within development activities. 
</p>
<p>36. In 2013, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) adopted a 
document entitled &#8220;UN-Habitat commitment to the human rights-based approach to 
development&#8221;, and its Executive Director strongly supported a human rights-based 
approach in all aspects of its work. OHCHR contributed to this development through the 
joint UN-Habitat/OHCHR United Nations housing programme and different human rights 
mainstreaming activities, including side events during UN-Habitat governing body 
meetings, human rights training for UN-Habitat senior management and meetings between 
the High Commissioner and the Executive Director of UN-Habitat. The UN-Habitat human 
rights strategy is planned to be put in place through, inter alia, guidance notes and training 
for staff members, explaining the linkages between their sectorial work and human rights, 
incorporating adequate procedures and safeguard in projects, and the establishment of an 
advisory group on human rights within the organization. OHCHR will continue to provide 
assistance during this process. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Other activities  
</b></p>
<p>37. In September 2013, OHCHR participated in a side event held during the twenty-
fourth session of the Human Rights Council on the right to development and the post-2015 
development agenda, organized by the members of the Working Group on the Right to 
Development and International Solidarity of the Geneva Forum of Catholic-Inspired 
NGOs,12 speaking on the theme &#8220;Realizing the transformative vision of the Declaration on 
the Right to Development&#8221;. OHCHR participated in an event devoted to &#8220;International 
youth leadership on the right to development&#8221;, sponsored by the National Association of 
Women&#8217;s Organizations and Ariel Foundation International, with the co-sponsorship of 
World YWCA, the Inter-African Committee on Practices Affecting the Health of Women 
and Girls, GEO International and the Global Education Institute for Shipboard Education. 
OHCHR elaborated on the right to development, including through identifying and relating

<p>its principles to presentations by youth on a variety of themes of particular relevance to 
young people. 
</p>
<p>38. In October 2013, OHCHR made a presentation at a training course organized by the 
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Bosnia for economies in 
transition on a new generation of international investment policies. The presentation 
focused on the human rights impact of trade and investment agreements. In November 
2013, OHCHR organized jointly with the United Nations Development Programme and 
Transparency International, and in cooperation with Austria, Morocco and Poland, a side 
event on the human rights case against corruption during the fifth session of the Conference 
of the States Parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption in Panama. The 
event concluded, inter alia, that effective anti-corruption efforts are essential to the creation 
of an enabling environment for development at both the national and international levels, as 
envisaged in the Declaration on the Right to Development. Also in November, OHCHR 
provided a briefing on the right to development to some 50 European Union staff members 
in charge of human rights within the European Commission and the European External 
Action Service. The briefing covered the broad mandate of the High Commissioner with 
regard to the right to development, and the challenges faced in the implementation of this 
right. In January 2014, OHCHR delivered a briefing for Commonwealth Member States on 
the right to development, with a particular focus on the draft right to development criteria 
and sub-criteria, including entry points, opportunities and technical aspects for Member 
States to contribute to the revision of the draft criteria and sub-criteria within the Working 
Group on the Right to Development.  
</p>
<p>39. In March 2014, the High Commissioner addressed a side event held during the 
twenty-fifth session of the Human Rights Council on the theme &#8220;Africa and the right to 
development: towards the post-2015 development agenda&#8221;, organized by Egypt, the 
African Union and the National Council for Human Rights of Egypt. Against the backdrop 
of challenges faced by the continent in achieving sustainable and inclusive development, 
including inequitable and exploitative economic arrangements, poverty, inequalities and 
vulnerabilities, discrimination, conflict and disproportionate effects of climate change, 
participants in the event stressed in their presentations and discussions the need to place the 
right to development at the centre of the post-2015 agenda and sustainable development 
goals. The High Commissioner called for a new agenda aligned with the human rights 
framework, with the right to development at its centre, underpinned by a strong 
accountability framework of goals, targets and indicators. She advocated a new social and 
international order strengthened by the right to development to address systemic failures, 
structural injustices and responsibility gaps in global governance, and a genuine global 
partnership for development. 
</p>
<p>40. Also in March, OHCHR participated in a side event on human rights and sustainable 
development, organized by the Permanent Mission of Gabon. OHCHR spoke on the theme 
&#8220;The right to development and its inclusion in the post-2015 development agenda&#8221;. 
Recalling the universal human rights framework, the Declaration on the Right to 
Development and the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable 
Development, OHCHR stressed the need to place the right to development at the centre of 
the post-2015 development agenda and sustainable development goals, together with a 
strong framework for accountability. 
</p>
<p>41. In Addis Ababa, OHCHR participated in conferences organized by the Economic 
Commission for Africa in close partnership with the African Union on such themes as 
gender, development, statistics, trade, finance and justice, with a view to highlight the 
imperative and value of integrating the right to development and a human rights-based 
approach into the formulation, implementation and monitoring of policies and strategies in 
different fields. Interactions with the African Peer Review Mechanism Unit of the </p>


<p>Commission, including on the need to review the functioning of the Mechanism through the 
prism of the right to development, was initiated in 2012. The potential review of the 
Mechanism by OHCHR in the light of the tenets of the right to development constitutes one 
entry point to mainstreaming human rights, including the right to development, into the 
Mechanism. 
</p>
<p>42. In Beirut, OHCHR, as a member of the regional United Nations Development 
Group, raised awareness of the importance of integrating human rights including the right 
to development in development policies and programmes. Its increased engagement at the 
regional level on the right to development and the post-2015 development agenda seeks to 
strengthen collaboration with the regional United Nations Development Group and the 
Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia in analysing development plans with a 
view to aligning them with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>43. The above-mentioned activities resulted in greater visibility of the right to 
development both as a human right and a guiding instrument for the post-2015 development 
agenda. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Activities by United Nations human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p>44. OHCHR continued to provide support to the Working Group on the Right to 
Development, in particular at its fourteenth annual session, held from 13 to 17 May 2013, 
and its informal inter-sessional meeting, held on 3 and 4 April 2014. OHCHR also 
supported the Chairperson-Rapporteur in holding informal consultations and presenting the 
report of the Working Group to the Human Rights Council and to the General Assembly. In 
October 2013, OHCHR issued a press release thereon.13  
</p>
<p>45. In October 2013, the Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other 
related international financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human 
rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights submitted a report to the General 
Assembly on Millennium Development Goal 8, and in particular on the lessons for the post-
2015 development framework of the United Nations.14 In his report, the Independent Expert 
argued that implementing a human rights-based approach fully &#8211;with its emphasis on 
equality, non-discrimination, participation and accountability &#8211; could help to assure a more 
inclusive, equitable and sustainable post-2015 global development framework that is 
consistent with the obligations of States to realize human rights, including the right to 
development, and an effective partnership based on the principles of international 
cooperation and solidarity. 
</p>
<p>46. In April 2014, on the occasion of the Global Day of Action on Military Spending, 
the Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order 
urged States to cut military spending and invest more in human development.15 In this 
regard, article 7 of the Declaration on the Right to Development called upon all States to 
promote the establishment, maintenance and strengthening of international peace and 
security and, to that end, do their utmost to achieve general and complete disarmament 
under effective international control, as well as to ensure that the resources released by

of developing countries. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>47.<b> The active outreach, advocacy and awareness-raising conducted by the Office 
of the High Commissioner on the right to development has contributed to growing 
engagement by educational institutions, non-governmental organizations and youth 
groups, including through the organization of independent events promoting creative 
dialogue. In going forward, OHCHR will continue its efforts to enable, nurture and 
support the free, active and meaningful participation of civil society and youth for the 
right to development. It will continue to lead in sustained, progressive and 
incremental steps to promote and protect the realization of the right to development. 
</b></p>
<p>48.<b> The right to development should be central to the post-2015 development 
agenda. According to article 1 of the Declaration on the Right to Development, the 
right to development is an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human 
person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, 
social, cultural and political development, in which all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms can be fully realized.  
</b></p>
<p>49.<b> The right to development provides substance for the guarantee enshrined in the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights of a social and international order in which 
all human rights can be fully realized. The post-2015 development agenda will 
therefore need to aim at building a new, more equitable and sustainable national and 
international order, firmly based on the foundation of human rights, including the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Declaration on the Right to 
Development.
