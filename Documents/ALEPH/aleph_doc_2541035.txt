EXPLANATORY NOTE
On  November  17,  2014,  the  management  of Homeland  Resources  Ltd.  (the  “Company”)
and  its  Board  of  Directors  concluded that  the  previously  issued  financial  statements
contained in the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January
31, 2014 filed March 14, 2014 (the “Original Form 10-Q”) should no longer be relied upon
because  of  errors  related  to  the  presentation  of  certain  information  included in  the
financial  statements  and  footnotes  to  the  financial  statements.  The Company  has
determined  that  it  was  necessary  to  correct  the  accounting  for certain  transactions  as
presented within the statement of operations and statement of cash flows along with their
corresponding impact on the Company’s balance sheet.
The initial accounting for the conveyance of certain working interests in certain crude oil
and natural gas properties (“Interests”) sold during the fiscal quarter ended January 31,
2014 to an un-related third party resulted in the gain being over-stated. The methodology
initially utilized to arrive at the fair value applied to the Interests sold was inappropriately
applied at the time the transaction was initially recorded. Related to the re-allocation of the
fair  value  of  the  assets  sold,  the calculation  of  depletion  was  re-performed.  The  issues
were  discovered  in connection  with  the  audit  of  the  Company’s  July  31,  2014  financial
statements. The gain on the sale of assets initially reported as $147,978 was re-calculated
utilizing the appropriate fair value to arrive at a net gain of $73,871. Associated depletion
expense  reported  for  the  period  ended  January  31,  2014  was re-calculated,  changes
related  thereto  were  immaterial  but  have  been  adjusted for.  The  net  impact  of  these
adjustments resulted in a previous overstatement of net income of $68,527 or $.006 per
share for the three months ended January 31, 2014 (restated to reflect September 30, 2014
5-to-1 reverse stock split), to arrive at adjusted net income of $32,520 or $.003 per share
(restated  to reflect  September  30,  2014  5-to-1  reverse  stock  split).  For  the  six  months
ended  January  31,  2014  net  income  of  $28,778  will  be  restated  to  reflect  a  net loss  of
$(39,749) with a corresponding change in net income per share from $.002 to a net loss per
share of $(.003)(restated to reflect September 30, 2014 5-to-1 reverse stock split).
The  information  contained  in  this  Form 10-Q/A  is  provided  as  at  the  filing  date  of  the
Original Form 10-Q. With the exception of the restatement of the financial statements and
adjustments to the affected portions of management’s discussion and analysis and Item
4.,  Controls and  Procedures  the  Company  has  not  made  any  additional  changes  to
disclosure as provided in the Original Form 10-Q. Common stock issued and outstanding,
net income (loss) per common share and weighted average number of common shares
outstanding basic and diluted reflect September 30, 2014 5-to-1 reverse stock split.

HOMELAND RESOURCES LTD.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JANUARY 31, 2014
NOTE 1 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The interim financial statements of Homeland Resources Ltd. (“we”, “us”, “our”, “Homeland”, or
the “Company”) are unaudited and contain all adjustments (consisting primarily of normal
recurring accruals) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented.
Results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for a full year
or for previously reported periods due in part, but not limited to, interest rates, drilling risks,
geological risks, the timing of acquisitions, and our ability to obtain additional capital. These
interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes thereto included in Homeland’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July
31, 2013, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on October 29, 2013.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN
As of January 31, 2014, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $1,242,766 and for
the six months ended January 31, 2014, our net loss from operations was $67,164. Our results of
operations have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $633,503 and a total stockholders’ deficit
of $423,333 as of January 31, 2014. We have participated in the drilling of test wells on
undeveloped properties. We plan further participation in a drilling program for the remainder of
the fiscal year. It is difficult to anticipate our capital requirements for the remainder of the fiscal
year as significant drilling activities will continue. We will need to raise equity or borrow
additional capital to fund our continued participation in planned activities. If additional financing
is not available, we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our business activities. If we are
unable to fund our operating cash flow needs and planned capital investments, it may be
necessary to sell all or a portion of our interests in our oil and gas properties.
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Accounts Receivable – Accounts receivable consists of amounts receivable from oil and gas
sold from our well interests. As of January 31, 2014, our accounts receivable amounted to
$20,000, all of which is due from one party, the operator of our oil and gas properties.
Management believes this amount to be fully collectible; we will continue to monitor accounts
receivable for collectability on a periodic basis.
Asset Retirement Obligation – Asset retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived
assets are accounted for in accordance with ASC 410, “Accounting for Asset Retirement
Obligations.” The estimated fair value of the future costs associated with dismantlement,
abandonment and restoration of oil and gas properties is recorded generally upon the
completion of a well. The net estimated costs are discounted to present values using a risk
adjusted rate over the estimated economic life of the oil and gas properties. Such costs are
capitalized as part of the related asset. The asset is depleted on the units-of-production method
on a field-by-field basis. The liability is periodically adjusted to reflect: (1) new liabilities incurred;
(2) liabilities settled during the period; (3) accretion expense; and (4) revisions to estimated
future cash flow requirements. The accretion expense is recorded as a component of
depreciation, depletion accretion and amortization expense in the accompanying statements of
operations.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments – The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, notes
payable, and interest payable. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate
their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market
interest rates of these instruments.

HOMELAND RESOURCES LTD.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JANUARY 31, 2014
Concentrations - The Company received 100% of its revenues from the operator of its oil and
gas properties during the fiscal quarters ended January 31, 2013 and 2014.
Revenue Recognition – The Company recognizes oil and gas revenue when production is
sold at a fixed or determinable price, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred and title has transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured.
Estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
NOTE 4 – RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Accounting standards-setting organizations frequently issue new or revised accounting rules.
We regularly review all new pronouncements that have been issued to determine their impact, if
any, on our financial statements.
In July 2013, the FASB issued, ASU No. 2013-11 "Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit
When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward
Exists" (“ASU 2013-11”). ASU 2013-11 addresses the diversity in practice that exists for the
balance sheet presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss
carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. ASU 2013-11 requires that an
unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, should be presented in the
financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a
similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward. ASU No. 2013-11 is effective for the Company’s
fiscal quarter ending October 31, 2014. ASU 2013-11 impacts balance sheet presentation only.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new rule but believes the balance sheet
impact will not be material.
There were various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to
the accounting literature, reclassification of other comprehensive income or application to
specific industries and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
position, results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE 5 – INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss)
attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income per common share is computed in the same manner, but also considers the
effect of common stock shares underlying any instrument that might have a dilutive impact on
weighted average shares outstanding.
As of January 31, 2014 we did not have any instruments which would have an impact on our
weighted average shares outstanding.

In April 2010, we acquired a 5% working interest in the Washita Bend 3D Exploration Project for
a total buy-in cost of $46,250. The project initially provided for the acquisition of approximately
135 miles of 3D seismic data to identify drillable prospects in a study area comprising 119,680
acres in Oklahoma. The Washita prospect area is located in Cleveland, Garvin, McCain and
Pottawatomie Counties, Oklahoma. On May 14, 2013, drilling commenced on the first of an
anticipated 8-well Phase-I exploration program. Of the first six wells drilled in connection with
this Phase-I exploration program five have been deemed to be non-economic. As per the terms
of the initial purchase agreement, we will participate in all eight wells to be drilled in the Phase-I
exploration program.
As a component of the initial Washita Bend purchase agreement, we acquired from the seller a
5% carried working interest to casing point in the first eight wells drilled on this prospect area.
We have committed to participate in the drilling of the initial eight wells in the Phase-1
exploration program. Should we fail to participate in the drilling of any of the Phase-1 wells, we
are subject to forfeit our right to our share of seismic data gathered.
2010–1 Drilling Program
In April 2010, we acquired a 5% working interest in the 2010-1 Drilling Program located in
Garvin County, Oklahoma for total buy-in costs of $39,163. Of the four wells in which we
participated related to this program three wells went on production.
On December 3, 2013 we conveyed our interest in the Miss Jenny #1-8 to the operator of the
well, for total consideration of $200,000 effective November 1, 2013. We received $141,505 in
cash and a credit of $58,495 against accrued Joint Interest billing costs owed to the operator. We
have recorded a gain in connection with this conveyance in the amount of $73,871.
Impairment
Under the full cost method, the Company is subject to a ceiling test. This ceiling test determines
whether there is any impairment to the proved properties. The impairment amount represents the
excess of capitalized costs over the present value, discounted at 10%, of the estimated future net
cash flows from the proven oil and gas reserves plus the cost, or estimated fair market value.
Depletion

HOMELAND RESOURCES LTD.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JANUARY 31, 2014
Under the full cost method, depletion is computed on the units of production method based on
proved reserves, or upon reasonable estimates where proved reserves have not yet been
established due to the recent commencement of production. Depletion expense recognized was
$14,880 and $6,251 for the three month periods ended January 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively,
and was $32,978 and $8,388 for the six month periods ended January 31, 2014 and 2013,
respectively.

NOTE 12 - RESTATEMENT
The initial accounting for the conveyance of certain working interests in certain crude oil and
natural gas properties (“Interests”) sold during the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2014 to an
un-related third party resulted in the gain being over-stated. The methodology initially utilized to
arrive at the fair value applied to the Interests sold was inappropriately applied at the time the
transaction was initially recorded. Related to the re-allocation of the fair value of the assets sold,
the calculation of depletion was re-performed. The issues were discovered in connection with
the audit of the Company’s July 31, 2014 financial statements. The gain on the sale of assets
initially reported as $147,978 was re-calculated utilizing the appropriate fair value to arrive at a
net gain of $73,871. Associated depletion expense reported for the period ended January 31,
2014 was re-calculated, changes related thereto were immaterial but have been adjusted for.
The net impact of these adjustments resulted in a previous overstatement of net income of
$68,527 or $.006 per share for the three months ended January 31, 2014 (restated to reflect
September 30, 2014 5-to-1 reverse stock split), to arrive at adjusted net income of $32,520 or
$.003 per share (restated to reflect September 30, 2014 5-to-1 reverse stock split). For the six
months ended January 31, 2014 net income of $28,778 will be restated to reflect a net loss of
$(39,749) with a corresponding change in net income per share from $.002 to a net loss per
share of $(.003)(restated to reflect September 30, 2014 5-to-1 reverse stock split).
Common shares outstanding and weighted average number of common shares outstanding
basic and diluted for the three and six month periods ended January 31, 2014 as included in this
Form 10Q/A have not been restated for the September 30, 2014, 5-to-1 reverse stock split.

Item 2.     Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
General
Our  original  business  plan  was  to  proceed  with  the  exploration  of  the  Home  Ranch
Prospect to determine whether there were commercially exploitable reserves of minerals
located on the property comprising such mineral claims.  In fiscal 2010, we determined that
our ability to explore for minerals on these claims had become economically non-feasible
and  we  therefore  suspended  our  activities  on  the  Home  Ranch  Prospect  indefinitely  in
order  to  focus  on  our  oil  and  gas  interests.    We  did  not  conduct  any  operations  or
exploration  activities  on  the  Home  Ranch  Prospect  during  the  six  month  period  ended
January 31, 2014.  At the time of this report, we do not know when or if we will proceed with
the Home Ranch Prospect.
In April 2010, we acquired working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a
drilling  program  in  oil  and  gas  properties  located  in  Oklahoma,  as  further  described
below.  Our present plan of operation is to continue to invest in oil and gas properties.
Oil and Gas Properties
“Bbl” is defined herein to mean one stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume,
used in reference to oil or other liquid hydrocarbons.
“Mcf”  is  defined  herein  to  mean  one  thousand  cubic  feet  of  natural  gas  at  standard
atmospheric conditions.
Washita Bend 3D Exploration Project
In  April  2010,  we  acquired  a  5%  working  interest  in  the  Washita  Bend  3D  Exploration
Project for a total buy-in cost of $46,250.  The project initially provided for the acquisition
of approximately 135 miles of 3D seismic data to identify drillable prospects in a study area
comprising  119,680  acres  in  Oklahoma.    The  Washita  prospect  area  is  located  in
Cleveland,  Garvin,  McCain  and  Pottawatomie  Counties,  Oklahoma.    On  May  14,  2013,
drilling commenced on the first of an anticipated 8-well Phase-I exploration program. Of
the  first  six  wells  drilled  in  connection  with  this  Phase-I  exploration  program  five  have
been deemed to be non-economic. As per the terms of the initial purchase agreement, we
will participate in all eight wells to be drilled in the Phase-I exploration program.
As a component of the initial Washita Bend purchase agreement, we acquired from the
seller a 5% carried working interest to casing point in the first eight wells drilled on this
prospect area. We have committed to participate in the drilling of the initial eight wells in
the Phase-1 exploration program. Should we fail to participate in the drilling of any of the
Phase-1 wells, we are subject to forfeit our right to our share of seismic data gathered.
2010–1 Drilling Program
In April 2010, we acquired a 5% working interest in the 2010-1 Drilling Program located in
Garvin County, Oklahoma for total buy-in costs of $39,163. Of the four wells in which we
participated related to this program three wells went on production.
On December 3, 2013 we conveyed our interest in the Miss Jenny #1-8 to the operator of
the well, for total consideration of $200,000. We received $141,505 in cash and a credit of
$58,495  against  accrued  Joint  Interest  billing  costs  owed  to  the  operator.  We  have
recorded a gain in connection with this conveyance in the amount of $73,871.
Loans
On  August  12, 2013  and  September  6,  2013,  we  borrowed  $45,000  and  $30,000,
respectively, from Radium Ventures Corp. The borrowings are two year demand notes and
accrue interest at 6.5% annually. On October 10,
14
2013 and October 21, 2013, we borrowed $7,500 and $7,500, respectively, from two lenders
- $7,500 from our Chief Financial Officer, Paul D. Maniscalco, and $7,500 from an individual
shareholder, in order to pay expenditures relating to our share of the drilling programs.
The short term notes bear interest at 15%, and principal and interest are due and payable
in six equal installments commencing on February 1, 2014. The notes are convertible into
shares of our common stock at $.02 per share (a) at the election of the noteholders, (b) at
any time after maturity, or (c) upon the event of default. In connection with this embedded
conversion feature we have recorded a charge of $15,000 to interest expense during the
quarter ended October 31, 2013. Subsequent to January 31, 2014 these notes matured and
are past due.
Results of Operations
Three months ended January 31, 2014 compared to the three months ended January 31,
2013.
Revenues - We recognized $28,658 in revenues during the three months ended January
31,  2014,  compared  with  $45,157  for  the  three  months  ended  January  31,  2013.    The
decrease in revenue recognized of $16,499 or 37% relates to the sale of our interests in the
Miss-Jenny 1H, with an effective date of November 1, 2013, offset slightly by the addition of
one  well  in  our  Phase-I  drilling  program  coming  on  production.  Other  decreases  in
production  volume  result  from  natural  decline  curves  in  the  wells  in  which  we  have
ownership interests.
Expenses  -  During  the  three  months  ended  January  31,  2014,  we  incurred  operating
expenses of $53,898 as compared to $145,807 during the three months ended January 31,
2013, resulting in a decrease of $91,909 or 63%.  The increase in direct costs is primarily
attributable to the following:
decreased lease operating expenses of $1,585 as compared to $5,557 in the
corresponding prior period;
decreased general and administrative expense to $26,861 as compared to $123,161
in the corresponding prior period. Decreases in general and administrative expense
relate primarily to decreased share based compensation; of $0 in the current period
as compared to $80,000 in the prior period.  In January 2013, we appointed Paul D.
Maniscalco to serve as our chief operating officer and chief financial officer.  We
granted 500,000 shares of common stock, valued at $80,000, to Mr. Maniscalco in
connection with this appointment. Also contributing to the decrease in general and
administrative expense was a decrease of $17,000 in advertising and promotion, from
$17,000 in the prior period, to $0 in the current period.
Decreases  in  operating  expenses  were  offset  slightly  by  an  increase  in  depreciation,
depletion  and  accretion  (“DD&A”)  expense  to  $14,952  as  compared  to  $6,589  in  the
corresponding prior period. The increase in DD&A resulted primarily from increases in our
depletion rate resultant from negative adjustments to the pool of capitalized costs incurred
in connection with the conveyance of the interests in one of our producing wells partially
offset with decreases in our recoverable reserves related to the conveyance.
Other expenses - We incurred $16,111 in other expenses during the three months ended
January  31,  2014  as  compared  to  $17,441  during  the  three  months  ended  January  31,
2013.  Charges  to  other  expense  relate  to  interest  expense  related  to  our  loans  and  the
amortization  of  deferred  financing  costs.  Outstanding  balances  on  our  loans  have
increased  when  compared  to  the  prior  period,  while  deferred  financing  fees  have  been
fully amortized as of the current period resulting in decreased amortization expense.
Other  income - We conveyed our interests in the Miss Jenny #1-8 well during the three
months  ended  January  31,  2014.    The  sale  of  this  interest  resulted  in  the  Company
recognizing a gain on the conveyance of $73,871.
Six months ended January 31, 2014 compared to the six months ended January 31, 2013.
Revenues - We recognized $59,916 in revenues during the six months ended January 31,
2014, compared with $56,140 for the six months ended January 31, 2013. The increase in
revenue recognized of $3,776 or 7% relates to increased production volumes over the six
month period. Overall increases in the production volumes relate to statutory limits place
on production in the prior period. During the six months ended January 31, 2014 these
production limits were lifted however effective November 1, 2013 we sold our interest in
the Miss Jenny #1-8. An additional well came on production in December 2013.
15
Expenses  -  During  the  six  months  ended  January  31,  2014,  we  incurred  operating
expenses of $127,080 as compared to $208,056 during the six months ended January 31,
2013, resulting in a decrease of $80,976 or 39%.  The increase in direct costs is primarily
attributable to the following:
decreased general and administrative expenses to $69,256 as compared to $168,962
in the corresponding prior period. Decreases in general and administrative expense
relate primarily to increased share based compensation of $nil (as described
elsewhere herein) as compared to $80,000 in the corresponding prior period,  
marketing and promotions expense of $nil as compared to $17,000 in the
corresponding prior period and decreases in legal expense and management fees.
Decreases  in  operating  expenses  were  offset  slightly  by  lease  operating  expenses  of
$3,702  as  compared  to  $9,573  in  the  corresponding  prior  period,  and  depreciation,
depletion  accretion  and  amortization  expense  of  $33,122  as  compared  to  $8,521  in  the
corresponding prior period. The increase in DD&A resulted primarily from increases in our
depletion rate resultant from negative adjustments to the pool of capitalized costs incurred
in connection with the conveyance of the interests in one of our producing wells partially
offset with decreases in our recoverable reserves related to the conveyance.
Other  expenses – We incurred $46,456 in other expenses during the six months ended
January 31, 2014 as compared to $34,882 during the six months ended January 31, 2013
resulting in an increase of $11,574 or 33%.  The increase in other expenses is attributable
to increased interest expense related to increases in our notes payable balances during
the  current  period  versus  the  comparable  prior  period.  Increased  interest  expense  was
offset slightly by decreased amortization of deferred financing fees.
Other  income -  We  conveyed  our  interests  in  the  Miss  Jenny-#1-8  well  during  the  six
months ended January 31, 2014.  The conveyance of this interest resulted in the Company
recognizing a gain on the conveyance of $73,871.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of January 31, 2014, we had cash of $114,947 compared to cash of $5,989 as of July 31,
2013.    Our  working  capital  deficit  at  January  31,  2014  was  $1,242,766,  compared  to
$1,220,532  as  of  July  31,  2013.  The  increase  in  our  working  capital  deficit  relates  to
increased  cash  balances  offset  by  cash  used  in  operations,  coupled  with  increases  in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities and increases in accounts payable due to related
parties offset by increases in prepaid expenses.
We anticipate that we will be required to make additional expenditures relating to our share
of continuing drilling programs during the remainder of the fiscal year 2014. As of January
31, 2014, our cash balance was $114,947, and such cash will not be sufficient to meet our
requirements under our existing agreements. The ability to draw on our loan facility with
Radium expired on December 31, 2011. $649,709 of the total amount drawn on our credit
facility which were due 36 months from initial funding are past due. Two short term loans
totaling  $15,000  have  matured  and  are  past  due.  Although  we  are  in  negotiations  with
Radium to extend our credit instruments and despite the fact that the lender has advanced
us additional funds, there is no assurance that we will reach such an agreement before we
are required to make any expenditures in excess of what we hold in cash. If we exhaust all
our  cash,  are  unable  to  timely  arrange  for  new  financing,  and  do  not  pay  our  share  of
potential drilling program costs, we will be in default of our agreements with the operator
of  our  properties.  In  such  event  of  default,  we  may  incur  significant  liabilities,  and
potentially forfeit our rights to our acquired interests. The conveyance of the interests in
one  of  our  producing  wells  with  an  effective  date  of  November  1,  2013  may  place
additional constraints on our cash.

working capital as discussed above.
Net  Cash  Provided  by  (Used)  in  Investing  Activities. Net  cash  provided  by  investing
activities for the six months ended January 31, 2014 was $9,994 as compared to cash used
of $(11,336) for the six months ended January 31, 2013.  The increase in net cash provided
by investing activities relates to the conveyance of interests in oil and gas properties for
which  we  received  net  proceeds  of  $141,505  offset  by  investments  in  oil  and  gas
properties  of  $(131,511)  as  compared  to  the  corresponding  prior  period  wherein  we
invested $(11,336) in oil and gas properties.
Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities.  We received $90,000 in cash from financing
activities  for  the  six  months  ended  January  31,  2014  as  compared  to  $nil  in  the
corresponding  prior  period.  Borrowings  during  the  current  period  were  comprised  of
$75,000  in  short  term  borrowings  from  Radium  Ventures  and  short  term  borrowings  of
$7,500 from our Chief Financial Officer and $7,500 from an individual shareholder.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of January 31, 2014.
Going Concern
In  its  report  prepared  in  connection  with  our  fiscal  year  2013  financial  statements,  our
independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph stating
that, because we had an accumulated deficit of $593,754 and a working capital deficit of
$1,220,532 at July 31, 2013, there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
going  concern.    At  January  31,  2014,  our  accumulated  deficit  was  $633,503,  our
stockholder’s deficit amounted to $423,333, and our working capital deficit was $1,242,766.
  Our  continued  existence  will  depend  in  large  part  upon  our  ability  to  raise  sufficient
additional  capital  adequate  to  fund  our  participation  in  drilling  and  seismic  programs
through  debt  and  or  equity  offerings.    Our  financial  statements  do  not  include  any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
Forward Looking Statements
Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as statements made by
us in periodic press releases and oral statements made by our officials to analysts and
shareholders  in  the  course  of  presentations  about  the  Company,  constitute  “forward-
looking  statements.”      Such  forward-looking  statements  involve  known  and  unknown
risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or
achievements  to  be  materially  different  from  any  future  results,  performance  or

Rule  15d-15  under  the  Exchange  Act  requires  us  to  carry  out  an  evaluation  of  the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
July  31,  2013,  being  the  date  of  our  most  recently  completed  fiscal  year  end.  This
evaluation  was  conducted  by  President  and  Chief  Financial  Officer.  Based  on  this
evaluation we have concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures are not effective since the following significant deficiency:
There is an inherent lack of segregation of duties with respect to certain transactions
involving cash and accounts payable.
Management  is  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  adequate  internal  control
over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal
control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because
of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or
detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in
conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or  procedures  may
deteriorate.
Our President and Chief Financial Officer have assessed the effectiveness of our internal
controls over financial reporting as of January 31, 2014. In making this assessment, the
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (1992 version).
In conducting the evaluation, Our President and Chief Financial Officer considered advice
from  our 
Independent  Registered  Public Accounting  Firm,  StarkSchenkein,  LLP
(“StarkSchenkein”). StarkSchenkein indicates that there may be significant deficiencies in
our  internal  controls over financial reporting. Specifically, a material weakness related to
aspects of accounting for the conveyance of oil and gas interests in accordance with SEC
requirements  as  of  January  31,  2014,  and  the  following  potential  deficiency has  been
noted:

noted:
We do not have proper segregation of duties with respect to certain transactions
involving cash and accounts payable.
As a result of this deficiency in our internal controls, Our President and Chief Financial
Officer  concluded  further  that  the  design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure  controls  and
procedures may not be effective and that our internal control over financial reporting was
not effective. Our Executive Officers also considered various mitigating factors in making
this  determination.  Officers  also  noted  that  we  are  still  evaluating  and  implementing
changes in our internal controls in response to the requirements of Sarbanes Oxley §404.
During fiscal year ending July 31, 2014, we will attempt to implement appropriate changes
as they are identified, including changes to remediate the significant deficiencies in our
internal controls. There can be no guarantee that we will be successful in making these
changes as they may be considered cost prohibitive.
Changes In Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting
In connection with the evaluation of our internal controls during our last fiscal quarter, our
Chief Financial Officer and President have concluded that there were no material changes
in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter
ended January 31, 2014 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
In conjunction with the matter described above, management has re-evaluated its
previously provided assessments as of January 31, 2014, regarding the effectiveness of
the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures and determined that as of the period,
the disclosure controls and procedures were properly designed to detect a material
misstatement of its financial statements from occurring in the future. However, due to a
misinterpretation of the accounting standard the methodology initially utilized to arrive at
the fair value applied to the Interests sold was
18
inappropriately applied at the time the transaction was initially recorded, the filings and
disclosures made on the financial statements for the period ended January 31, 2014, the
disclosure control was ineffective.
