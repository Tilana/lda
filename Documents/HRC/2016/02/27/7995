<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights on the situation of human 
rights in Mali 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In its resolution 21/25, the Human Rights Council renewed its request to the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to submit, to its twenty-second 
session, a written report on the situation of human rights in Mali. For this purpose, from 
11 to 20 November 2012, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR) deployed a Mission to collect information in Mali, Burkina 
Faso, Mauritania and Niger. The Mission was assisted by two officials from the offices 
of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the fight against Sexual 
Violence in Conflict and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Children and Armed Conflict. 
</p>
<p> This report highlights the human rights violations that have been committed since 
the attacks against the Malian army carried out initially by the National Movement for 
the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and by Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), 
Ansar Dine and the Movement for Unity and Jihad in West Africa (MUJAO) in January 
</p><p>2012. The three main regions of northern Mali &#8212; Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu &#8212; are under 
the control of extremist groups, which are imposing the strict application of sharia on the 
population. This leads to serious human rights violations, including summary executions, 
rape, torture, the recruitment of child soldiers, violations of freedom of expression and of 
right to information and violations of the right to education and health. 
</p>
<p> This report also shows that, in the territories under Government control, the 
situation with regard to the administration of justice, freedom of expression and the right 
to information remains a matter of concern. The report refers to cases of members of the 
military and police force who have allegedly been detained and tortured in Bamako, 
without any real judicial guarantees. Despite the good faith expressed by the authorities, 
alarmingly, judicial inquiries are at a standstill.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its twenty-first session, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 21/25, 
which &#8220;renews its urgent invitation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to submit to the Council at its twenty-second session a written report on the situation 
of human rights in the Republic of Mali, particularly the northern part of the country&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. Data-collection method 
</b></p>
<p>2. In accordance with resolution 21/25, a team from the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (hereinafter &#8220;the Mission&#8221;) visited Mali from 11 to 20 
November 2012. The team consisted of two officials from the offices of the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the fight against Sexual Violence in Conflict 
and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict. 
Part of the team first visited Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Niger to gather information from 
refugees. The Mission was a follow-up to that of the Under-Secretary-General for Human 
Rights, Mr. Ivan &#352;imonovi&#263;, from 4 to 8 October 2012. The Mission worked in close 
cooperation with the Resident Coordinator of the United Nations system. It held meetings, 
both in Mali and in the other countries visited, with the key State actors, several 
representatives of civil society organizations, victims, witnesses, of United Nations 
agencies and members of the diplomatic corps. 
</p>
<p>3. This report, which covers, inter alia, the period from 17 January2 to 20 November 
2012, includes a chapter on the Malian context, without which the situation cannot be 
analysed. The Mission collected information on the situation of human rights on the basis 
of around 250 interviews conducted in the four countries visited, and analysed many 
documents. Thanks to the Ministry of Justice, the Mission was able to visit detainees in the 
Gendarmerie&#8217;s Camp 1 in Bamako. However, despite repeated requests to the authorities, it 
was unable to enter the detention centre at the Kati military camp, or that of the State 
Security.3 The Mission went to Mopti, but could not gain access to the northern part of the 
country due to the security situation. However, it did collect enough information to assess 
the human rights situation in the country.  
</p>
<p>4. The Mission wishes to emphasize that the violations observed in the north differ in 
their form, intensity and duration according to when they were committed. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework applicable to the situation in Mali 
</b></p>
<p>5. Mali has ratified the nine core international human rights instruments and six 
additional protocols. The State is also party to the Rome Statute of the International 
Criminal Court, the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide and the Geneva Conventions of 1949 relating to the protection of victims of 
armed conflicts and their additional Protocols I and II. Mali has also ratified the core human 
rights conventions of the African Union and the Economic Community of West African 
States (ECOWAS).

<p><b> IV. Context  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Diversity of the population of Mali 
</b></p>
<p>6. Mali is very diverse in terms of its ethnic, racial and religious composition. It has 20 
ethnic groups, the main ones being the Bambara, Malinke, Soninke or Sarakole. They are 
all part of the Mande language group and make up more than half of the population. The 
Peul, Dogon, Songhai, Bobo and Oul&#233;, Toucouleur, Senufo, Diola, Tuaregs and Moors, and 
other ethnic groups that are smaller in size make up the rest of the population. The 
Constitution of Mali guarantees the secular nature of the State (arts. 18, 25, 28 and 118). 
The vast majority of Malians are Muslim. A small minority are Christian or animist.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Tuareg rebellions in northern Mali and waves of violence and impunity 
</b></p>
<p>7. At different times in the history of Mali, the Tuareg communities have claimed their 
independence in the area they call &#8220;Azawad&#8221;, which covers the three administrative regions 
of the north (Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu). They have bitter memories of the first armed 
rebellion that took place after the proclamation of independence between 1962 and 1963. A 
second wave of rebellions took place between 1990 and 1995, punctuated with the peace 
agreements of Tamanrasset in 1991 and the National Pact in 1992. In 1996, the conflict 
officially ended. Following the Tuareg uprising of May 2006, the Algiers Accords were 
signed with the Government on 4 July of the same year. Another rebellion took place 
between 2007 and 2009. After the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, many Tuareg 
mercenaries returned to Mali, between September and November 2011 with their weapons. 
They joined the armed Tuareg activists to found the National Movement for the Liberation 
of Azawad (MNLA) in October 2011. The aim of the Movement is the independence of 
&#8220;Azawad&#8221;; it condemns the Malian Government&#8217;s failure to comply with the peace accords 
it signed, which were often accompanied by amnesty laws thereby establishing a culture of 
impunity.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Crisis of 2012: control of the north by armed groups  
</b></p>
<p>8. Starting in January 2012, MNLA members allegedly attacked army bases in 
northern Mali, in M&#233;naka, Aguelhok and Tessalit, and in early February in Kidal. Since 
then, various attacks have been carried out by MNLA and three Islamist armed groups: Al-
Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar Dine and the Movement for Unity and Jihad 
in West Africa (MUJAO).  
</p><p>9. Malian soldiers stationed in the north allegedly fled and officers of Tuareg and Arab 
origin deserted to join rebels taking with them the troops under their command, thereby 
greatly weakening the operating capability of the Malian army.4 
</p>
<p>10.  On 6 April 2012, the unilateral declaration of the State of Azawad by MNLA was 
immediately rejected by ECOWAS and the African Union. Nevertheless, MNLA and Ansar 
Dine concluded an agreement on 26 May 2012 establishing a State of Azawad. However, 
the agreement was the subject of clashes between the two movements over the application 
of sharia. Following the death of the municipal councillor, Mr. Idrissa Oumarou, in Gao, a 
significant portion of the population rebelled, blaming the crime on MNLA. Taking

 According to a military source, there were around 1,000 men.  </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-10067 
</p>
<p>advantage of this situation, on 27 June 2012, MUJAO drove MNLA out of the city. By 18 
November, Islamist movements controlled the north of the country as far as Douentza. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Development of the political situation since 17 January 2012 
</b></p>
<p>11. After the defeat of the army in the north and frustration at the inability of the 
Government of President Amadou Toumani Tour&#233; (commonly known as &#8220;ATT&#8221;) to contain 
the rebellion, a group of soldiers staged a coup on the night of 21 and 22 March 2012, 
bringing an end to the democratic process, which included the presidential elections 
planned for 30 April 2012. The leaders of the coup, united under the name of the national 
committee for the recovery of democracy and the restoration of the State led by Captain 
Amadou Sanogo Haya, suspended the Constitution and postponed the elections indefinitely. 
The coup was unanimously condemned by the Security Council, ECOWAS and the African 
Union. Mali has since then been suspended from regional and subregional organizations, 
and bilateral partners have frozen their cooperation with the country.  
</p>
<p>12. On 6 April 2012, a framework agreement was concluded between ECOWAS, 
represented by the President of Burkina Faso, Mr. Blaise Compaor&#233;, and the national 
committee that provided, inter alia, for the resignation of President Tour&#233;, the appointment 
of the current President of the National Assembly, Mr. Diouncounda Traor&#233;, as President of 
the Republic, of Mr. Cheick Modibo Diarra as Prime Minister, and the adoption of an 
amnesty law for perpetrators of the coup. A few weeks later, on the night of 30 April and 1 
May 2012, soldiers loyal to former President Tour&#233; allegedly attempted a counter-coup, 
which, according to a Malian official, caused the death of several dozen people, including 
civilians.  
</p>
<p>13. Against this background of mistrust and division at the highest levels of the State, 
protests led to a physical assault on President Traor&#233;, on 21 May 2012. After a long 
convalescence in France, he returned to Mali in August 2012, President Traor&#233; appointed a 
Government of national unity whose basic tasks were to regain control of the north and to 
organize elections. On 10 December 2012, on the orders of the former junta, Prime Minister 
Diarra was arrested and forced to resign in the morning of 11 December. On 12 December, 
the President appointed the Ombudsman, Mr. Diango Sissoko, as Prime Minister.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Displacement of persons 
</b></p>
<p>14. On 1 December 2012, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that the total number of Malian refugees stood at 155,187, 
including 54,117 in Mauritania, 61,880 in Niger, 37,626 in Burkina Faso, 44 in Guinea and 
20 in Togo. It is also estimated that 198,558 persons have been internally displaced.5 The 
refugee population of Burkina Faso, Niger and Mauritania is composed mainly of Tuaregs, 
Arabs, Peul and Bella people, from the regions of Timbuktu, Gao, Kidal and Mopti. Some 
people from the northern areas have also sought refuge in Algeria, but their exact number 
has yet to be determined. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Recurrent human rights violations problems  
</b></p>
<p>15. Since its independence, Mali has faced serious problems that must be taken into 
consideration in order to understand the current situation. These problems include a very 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>high level of poverty, the population&#8217;s limited access to basic social services and the 
inequitable distribution of national wealth, particularly from natural resources. 
</p>
<p>16. Malian society is also characterized by a high level of corruption, lack of 
independence of the judiciary, and by a number of &#8220;discriminatory and harmful cultural 
practices&#8221;6 that are detrimental to the enjoyment of the rights of the child and women. Early 
marriages, unequal access to education for girls and boys, female genital mutilation and the 
taboo on sexual violence against women and girls are symptomatic of a society where 
women&#8217;s rights remain largely ignored, especially in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>17. In addition, discrimination against certain ethnic and social groups continues, 
especially in some Tuareg communities that have a caste system and where slavery is still a 
widespread practice. This is particularly the case for the Bella people. Moreover, identity 
claims over the course of history have fostered intercommunity tensions.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights situation in the north of the country following 
the events of 17 January 2012 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The right to life: extrajudicial and summary executions 
</b>18. Numerous allegations of violations of the right to life have been reported, including 
extrajudicial killings and summary executions. Apparently such violations have been 
committed since the first attacks in January 2012 carried out by MNLA in the north of the 
country and subsequently by other armed groups.  
</p>
<p>19. The Mission was informed that in Aguelhok, armed combatants identified as 
belonging to MNLA, entered the town on 24 January 2012 and started firing at random. 
When they reached the Teacher Training Institute, they terrorized pupils and students and 
used them as human shields to attack the neighbouring military camp, forcing the soldiers 
to surrender. The assailants reportedly captured 153 soldiers and tied their arms behind 
their backs. Some 84 men (military estimate) had their throats slit or were executed with a 
bullet fired into the back of their head. Students at the Institute witnessed this massacre; the 
armed group Ansar Dine also claimed that it carried out the attack. 
</p>
<p>20. Reprisals against Tuareg soldiers in the national army and members of their families 
were carried out at the beginning of the conflict. In particular, an incident allegedly took 
place on 4 February 2012 in which nine Tuareg soldiers of the Timbuktu National Guard 
were hunted down. Seven of them were executed by soldiers in retaliation for the MNLA 
offensive. However, such information has not yet been confirmed by Malian military 
sources.  
</p>
<p>21. In Gao, in early April 2012, armed groups, including MNLA, looted the warehouses 
of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the World Food Programme 
(WFP), killing several people who refused to obey orders. On that occasion, a 70-year-old 
man and a 15-year-old child were killed by bullets. In a second ICRC warehouse, a woman 
was killed in the same conditions. The Mission was also apprised that during the looting of 
the WFP warehouses, a young Tamashek woman, who had resisted a rape attempt by armed 
men, was shot dead by her assailants. The Mission was also informed of the murder of Mr. 
Idrissa Oumarou, a municipal councillor in Gao, on the night of 25 June 2012.

<p><b>10</b> GE.13-10067 
</p>
<p>22. Various sources have also reported the case of the stoning of a young unmarried 
couple by MUJAO and Ansar Dine in Aguelhok, on 29 July 2012. The couple, accused of 
having children out of wedlock, were tied together, buried in a pit up to their necks and 
stoned to death in front of about 300 people.  
</p>
<p>23. Mines were allegedly planted either by the Malian army before the crisis or armed 
groups after January 2012. In Gao, Ansongo and Niafunk&#233;, MUJAO apparently planted 
anti-personnel mines around the towns to protect itself better against possible attacks. 
Between March and August, 28 serious incidents were allegedly caused by mines and 
explosive remnants of war in the north, killing 43 people, including 24 children.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment  
</b></p>
<p>24. At the start of the crisis, families linked to the Ganda Koy and Ganda Izo militias, as 
well as the immediate family of members of the army, were systematically targeted, beaten 
and subjected to various forms of violence and intimidation by MNLA.  
</p><p>25. Ten cases of amputations, in the name of a particular interpretation of sharia, have 
been recorded since the north was taken over by extremist armed groups: six in Gao, one in 
Ansongo and three in Timbuktu. The first case of amputation was carried out in Ansongo 
on 8 August 2012 on Al Hader Ag Al Mahmoud, aged 30, whose right hand was cut off by 
members of MUJAO after a summary trial for stealing cattle. The victim told the Mission: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;On 6 July 2012, I was returning from a weekly market in Ansongo, some 
people reported me to members of MUJAO who arrested me. After 14 days of 
imprisonment, I was referred to a committee of 10 people who convicted me after a 
summary trial. The head of MUJAO read out the sentence for the amputation of my 
right hand. They rounded up people on Independence Square to attend the event. I 
was securely tied to a chair, with my right hand on the armrest. Then a member of 
MUJAO cut off my right hand with a big kitchen knife. I was given treatment later 
by a first-aid worker.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>26. The Mission was informed by various sources that the people living in the north of 
the country continue to be subjected to degrading treatment by armed groups which, 
because of their extreme interpretation of sharia, harass, flog and beat women who are not 
wearing the veil or are not properly veiled, as well as men involved in the sale or 
consumption of cigarettes and alcohol or any other practices or conduct that they consider 
as not in conformity with sharia.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrests and detention 
</b></p>
<p>27. Since the withdrawal of Malian forces from the north of the country, the 
maintenance of order is ensured by armed groups through &#8220;Islamic police&#8221; that allegedly 
arrest, detain and ill-treat citizens, especially in the prisons of Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal, in 
flagrant violation of Malian law. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Recruitment of child soldiers 
</b></p>
<p>28. Although the exact number of children associated with armed groups could not be 
determined, the Mission collected credible information indicating that MNLA, AQIM, 
Ansar Dine and MUJAO recruit and train children in camps. Following the defeat of 
MNLA, most child soldiers reportedly joined other armed groups. </p>


<p>GE.13-10067 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>29. Children, sometimes aged between 10 and 12, recruited by MUJAO in Gao and by 
Ansar Dine in Niafunk&#233; were allegedly seen at checkpoints on the outskirts of towns 
controlled by these groups carrying out patrols on behalf of the &#8220;Islamic police&#8221;. While 
some children are handed over by their parents for religious reasons, most are apparently 
attracted by promises of receiving up to 350,000 CFA francs (CFAF).7 In Gao, MUJAO 
continues to actively recruit children in madrasas.8 These children receive religious 
instruction and learn to handle weapons. Parents reportedly receive CFAF 5,000 a month. 
</p>
<p>30. The Mission is also concerned about the recruitment of talib&#233; children entrusted by 
their parents to marabouts to receive an Islamic education and, who, in return, are allegedly 
exploited as beggars. A good many marabouts, who are in fact responsible for these 
children, have fled the north, leaving their pupils at risk of recruitment. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Sexual abuse 
</b></p>
<p>31. The Mission collected a significant amount of information on alleged sexual abuse 
by all the armed groups in control of the north. However, the stigmatization of victims is a 
major obstacle to their care. Sexual abuse is viewed as shameful in Mali, because of the 
loss of dignity for the families concerned. According to a victim, &#8220;in Mali, if you say you 
have been raped, your life is over&#8221;. The girls and women affected are stigmatized and can 
no longer marry or remarry. Under the circumstances, most cases of sexual abuse are not 
reported. Medical sources have reported that, in Mali, women do not seek medical advice 
after being raped. 
</p>
<p>32. According to some testimony, rapes are committed on ethnic grounds, especially 
during the offensives of some armed groups. The victims are usually &#8220;dark-skinned&#8221; 
people, who are considered inferior by their &#8220;fair-skinned&#8221; assailants. 
</p>
<p>33. A second form of sexual abuse faced by women and girls in the north is punitive 
rape for failing to observe the norms imposed by the extremist rebels, such as dress code 
and the ban on riding motorcycles. The rape of women and girls in their homes, in the 
presence of their families, is a form of intimidation and torture. In April 2012, in Gao, there 
were several such cases carried out by MNLA members during operations to find the 
relatives of members of the army or pro-government militias. On 2 April, a Sonrhai woman 
aged 36 years was raped in her home by two men wearing turbans. Bella, a 22-year-old 
woman from Timbuktu told how, on Tuesday, 3 April, after being accused of not wearing 
the veil at home, six armed men under the command of Mohammed Ansar Dine Iguin raped 
her at their base for two hours. 
</p>
<p>34. In order to legitimize their acts under sharia, Ansar Dine, AQIM and MUJAO are 
forcing families to make money from marrying their daughters, the youngest of whom are 
12 and 13 years old. These girls are often &#8220;married&#8221; to several rebels in camps, where they 
are gang-raped every night and then abandoned after a swift divorce. 
</p>
<p>35. The Mission also received allegations from multiple sources concerning the sexual 
abuse of women held in detention on the grounds of violating sharia, particularly in 
women&#8217;s prisons in Timbuktu and Gao.

</p>
<p><b> F. Attacks on property  
</b></p>
<p>36. Since the first attacks carried out by MNLA and subsequently Ansar Dine, MUJAO 
and AQIM, public property and infrastructure have been targeted and destroyed. Thus, the 
records of the civil registry, schools and hospitals have been systematically destroyed and 
burned. Numerous schools, hospitals, health centres and other Government buildings, 
private homes and shops have been looted, vandalized and sometimes occupied by armed 
groups. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Violations of freedom of expression and of the right to information 
</b></p>
<p>37. With the arrival of armed groups in the north at the beginning of 2012, local people 
have seen their freedom of expression systematically restricted. There are no longer any 
free media outlets in the region, which has been cut off from the press based in Bamako. 
The region, which before these events had a few radio stations, witnessed its best known 
radio station, Aadou Kou&#239;ma, in Gao, suspend broadcasting on 6 August 2012, after 
considerable intimidation and numerous death threats against its editor, Mr. Malik 
Akoumega. On two occasions, on 5 May and 6 August 2012, MUJAO rebels burst into the 
radio studio and allegedly took Mr. Akoumega outside the city to be subjected to severe 
torture. Since then, the station has been dismantled by the armed groups.  
</p>
<p><b> H. Violations of the right to education 
</b></p>
<p>38. Access to education in northern Mali is being undermined by the presence of armed 
groups, in particular because of the attacks against, destruction and looting of at least 115 
schools between April and May 2012, and the departure of 85 per cent of teachers. Only a 
small number of schools continue to function at a very basic level. Vocational colleges are 
also closed. Some children, who fled to the south, have not been able to enrol in new 
schools, because they do not have the necessary documents. 
</p>
<p>39. According to many sources, Ansar Dine has been unable to insist on separate 
facilities for boys and girls owing to the limited number of teachers available. In the 
schools that are still operating, some courses, such as art, music and sports have been 
banned, and some schools now offer a programme that is based exclusively on the Koran, 
which is detrimental to children who later will want to follow the official curriculum.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Violations of the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>40. According to official and medical sources, the occupation of the north by armed 
groups has led to the mass exodus of medical personnel and the destruction of health 
facilities. The two referral hospitals in Gao and Timbuktu and the Kidal clinic have been 
looted, resulting in a shortage of basic health services. Medical records have been 
completely destroyed in many places, including Gondam. Under such circumstances, it has 
become virtually impossible to deal with acute chronic diseases and medical emergencies.  
</p>
<p>41. Well before the onset of the crisis, there were around 950 HIV-positive persons in 
the three northern regions. Following the events in question, and with the tracking of 
previously identified cases interrupted, the risk that the condition of such persons will 
deteriorate, as well as the increased risk of contamination of HIV-negative persons is 
growing. In addition, the incidence of rape, including collective rape is increasing the risk 
of HIV prevalence in the region. </p>


<p>GE.13-10067 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>42. In response, since August 2012, the College of Physicians of Mali, supported by the 
World Health Organization and the United Nations system has organized several &#8220;care 
caravans&#8221; for the people in the north, with the help of volunteer doctors. 
</p>
<p>43.  Some sources have reported that medical staff in Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal work in 
conditions that are difficult and stressful owing to the presence of armed combatants in 
hospitals and health centres. The situation is particularly difficult for female employees and 
patients, including the victims of sexual abuse. It has also been reported that in some 
centres armed men often interrupt childbirth or surgery and brutalize midwives or nurses 
not wearing the veil or not wearing a proper veil. For example, in the Timbuktu hospital, 
men are normally present to make sure that women coming in and out of the building are 
properly veiled. On several occasions, employees and patients could not gain access to the 
hospital. In September 2012, a nurse was allegedly abducted from the hospital by armed 
combatants and forcibly taken to the Islamic police station on the grounds that she was not 
properly veiled. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Violations of cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>44. According to reliable sources, the cultural rights of the inhabitants of the north have 
been radically restricted by armed groups. Music, television and sport have been banned 
because of a fundamentalist interpretation of sharia. Bars in Gao and in other cities have 
been closed. Children bathing naked in rivers and women going to the river to wash have 
been beaten in Timbuktu and Niafunk&#233;. A strict dress code has been imposed, requiring 
girls (from the age of 5) and women to be covered from head to toe. On buses connecting 
major cities, men and women are now segregated, sometimes by a curtain. Boys and men 
must roll their trousers up to their ankles. Boys and girls and men and women no longer 
have the right to appear in public together unless they are married or are members of the 
same family. Girls and women can no longer ride with men on motorcycles. Islamic police 
monitor the application of these strict rules and the punishment for non-compliance is 
flogging. Faced with this situation, many women prefer not to go out. 
</p>
<p>45.  In addition, two days after the city of Timbuktu was inscribed on the List of World 
Heritage in Danger by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization, on 28 June 2012, Ansar Dine destroyed several cultural and religious sites in 
the city, including the mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud Ben Amar, Alpha Moya, Sidi Mokhtar 
and Cheikh el-Kebir. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Violation of the right to freedom of religion 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Mission was informed by various sources that Christian places of worship in the 
north, including the Church in Gao, have all been ransacked and looted. Following threats, 
Christian and animist populations, fearing for their lives, apparently fled upon the arrival of 
armed groups.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Situation of human rights in the territories under the control 
of the Malian Government  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Violations of the right to life, extrajudicial and summary executions  
</b>47. At the Gendarmerie&#8217;s Camp No. 1 in Bamako, a soldier who survived the counter-
coup said: </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.13-10067 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The morning after 30 April, a manhunt began among the members of the 
thirty-third regiment of paratroopers who were taken to the headquarters of Captain 
Sanogo in Kati where they received death threats, were then filmed at ORTM9 and 
subsequently severely beaten. Two of my brothers in arms died instantly. On 1 May, 
at around 2 a.m., a detachment of soldiers arrived. They did the roll call of 20 
soldiers and a non-commissioned officer, all of whom were red beret soldiers. They 
were tied up in pairs and then taken away in a truck. Since then, we have had no 
news of them. I was saved following a conversation about what to do with me 
between a captain and a sergeant-major who thought I was dying, as I had been 
severely tortured and had head wounds.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>48. The Mission was unable to determine the whereabouts of 21 soldiers who went 
missing in Kati. The military authorities questioned confirmed that the soldiers had in fact 
disappeared, but that did not mean that they were dead. The Mission was also informed 
that, on 2 May 2012, members of the army allegedly entered the Gabriel Tour&#233; Hospital in 
Bamako where they abducted a dozen seriously injured soldiers and took them to an 
unknown destination. 
</p>
<p>49. According to several corroborating sources, on 9 September 2012, in the 
municipality of Diabali, a detachment of the Malian army allegedly executed a group of 16 
pilgrims of the Dawa brotherhood, some of whom were Mauritanian nationals. According 
to the Ministry of Justice, this case is being handled by the military authorities. However, 
the authorities referred the Mission to the civil justice system. The Mission has been unable 
to determine what progress has been made with the investigation into these incidents or 
whether any court (civil or military) is dealing with the matter. Mauritania apparently 
announced that three experts have been dispatched to investigate the incident, together with 
the Malian authorities. Similarly, the Mission has been unable to obtain reliable information 
on the alleged execution by the military of at least six Tuareg civilians in a village near 
Diabali on 21 October 2012.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment  
</b></p>
<p>50. In the aftermath of the counter-coup, on 30 April 2012, members of the police force 
were subjected to ill-treatment on the premises of the Mobile Security Unit of the police 
force. Police officers and military personnel were transferred and incarcerated at the Kati 
military camp, where they were subjected to death threats, beatings and serious injuries. 
Some were hurled onto their stomach, with their hands and feet handcuffed behind them in 
what is often referred to as the &#8220;bicycle position&#8221;, and kicked hard in their genitals in order 
to extract information. 
</p>
<p>51. At the Kati military camp, 83 soldiers and members of the military &#8212; the alleged 
perpetrators of the counter-coup &#8212; were crammed into the underground cell known as &#8220;the 
Pit&#8221;, &#8220;the Fall&#8221; and &#8220;the Hole&#8221;, in sweltering heat, without any light or contact with the 
outside world, in unsanitary conditions, with two toilets overflowing with excrement and 
worms. The Mission was informed that some soldiers held at the military camp in Kati 
were apparently forced by the camp leaders to have sex with each other while their captors 
filmed the scene with amusement. The same soldiers stubbed cigarettes on different parts of 
their victims&#8217; bodies. During the initial days of imprisonment, all 83 prisoners were allowed 
only one can of water and one portion of rice. On certain days they were obliged to choose 
between eating and drinking. Others had no choice but to drink their own urine or that of 
other fellow prisoners.

<p><b> C. Arbitrary arrests and detention 
</b></p>
<p>52. The legal grounds for the arrest and detention of the 83 members of the military and 
police force imprisoned at Kati between 22 March and 6 September 2012 and subsequently 
transferred to the Gendarmerie&#8217;s Camp No. 1 have yet to be explained. The detainees 
included Brigadier General Hamidou Sissoko, ex Chief of Staff to former President Tour&#233;, 
Colonel Abdoulaye Ciss&#233;, Lieutenant Colonel Yacouba Traor&#233; and Commander Konar&#233;. 
Some of the police officers held said that they were reported, arrested and detained by 
policemen, who were members of a rival group that supports the military junta in power 
and compared their arrest to a settling of scores. 
</p>
<p>53. However, the Mission established that the officers and non-commissioned officers of 
Camp No. 1 were held in generally acceptable conditions. Although, seven of them did not 
have the services of a lawyer; soldiers and police were in the same situation. The Mission 
was apprised that 17 Malian civilians and 30 foreigners, including Cameroonians, 
Nigerians, Chadians and citizens of Burkina Faso were held during the counter-coup in 
similar conditions. They were released between 7 and 8 May 2012. 
</p>
<p>54. The Mission also received a report that Mr. Diouara Mahamadou, a young man aged 
28 years, the BBH10 militia leader, was allegedly kidnapped and held incommunicado at the 
State Security headquarters, without judicial guarantees, for several weeks before being 
transferred to the prison in Kati. 
</p>
<p>55. Checks and searches at road checkpoints manned by the military in S&#233;var&#233;11 
allegedly targeted &#8220;fair-skinned&#8221; people,12 and certain travellers who looked like members 
of armed groups were reportedly arrested, ill-treated and even detained, without legal 
grounds, simply because of their appearance. The military authorities informed the Mission 
that S&#233;var&#233; has become a strategic and sensitive location because, since the arrest of a 
young French jihadi of Malian origin, on 6 November 2012, the military has been homing 
in on certain travellers. According to them, this is all being done within the law. On account 
of this ethnic monitoring, the Tuareg and Arab populations in the north have repeatedly told 
the Mission that they no longer dare take this route and are obliged most of the time to 
make detours through neighbouring countries to reach Bamako, which constitutes an 
infringement of their freedom of movement. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Attacks on property 
</b></p>
<p>56. On 1 February 2012, on the sidelines of the event for the families of Malian soldiers, 
there were reprisals and violence against Arabs and Tuaregs in Bamako and Kati by angry 
young protesters. The Mission was apprised that the pharmacy and clinic of a Tuareg doctor 
originally from Timbuktu were vandalized in Kati. The house of the former Minister of 
Arts and Crafts and Tourism, Mr. Zakiyatou Oualett Halatine, who is of Tuareg origin, 
suffered the same fate. Without the intervention of the police, the Tuaregs would have been 
lynched.

<p><b>16</b> GE.13-10067 
</p>
<p><b> E. Violations of freedom of expression and of the right to information 
</b></p>
<p>57. The Mission found that in Bamako and Mopti freedom of expression and 
information are becoming increasingly restricted. Many people living in these two cities 
who were interviewed said that they were afraid to speak freely, especially to criticize the 
army or the Government.  
</p>
<p>58. Some serious incidents demonstrate the precarious nature of the freedom of the 
press, even if independent newspapers still regularly criticize State institutions, including 
the army. In this connection, on 2 July 2012, Mr. Abderrahmane Ke&#239;ta, editor of the 
biweekly <i>l&#8217;Aurore</i> was abducted at night by armed and hooded men, taken by car from the 
centre of Bamako and beaten up. His captors reportedly told him: &#8220;It is men like you who 
are causing trouble in the country!&#8221; Prior to the attack, Mr. Ke&#239;ta had received death 
threats. Ten days later, Mr. Saouti Ha&#239;dara, editor of the newspaper <i>l&#8217;Ind&#233;pendant</i>, was 
beaten up by masked men who threatened him with a gun and broke one of his arms.  
</p>
<p>59. The Mission was also informed, by many sources, of acts of persecution and death 
threats carried out in early November 2012 against a rapper from Bamako called Roberto 
Magic Sapper. He allegedly received death threats after a song criticizing the military. 
Unidentified armed men reportedly went to his home several times.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Deterioration of the socioeconomic situation  
</b></p>
<p>60. The crisis in Mali has a considerable impact on the economic situation. The 
suspension of direct international development aid to the Malian Government following the 
coup of 22 March has further reduced the meagre resources of the country, whose budget 
has been reduced by one third. The withdrawal of major donors and investors has led to the 
closure of major public works, exacerbating unemployment. Tourism has come to a 
standstill. In addition, families displaced from northern Mali are putting considerable 
pressure on the diminished resources of households and social institutions in the south. 
Well before the onset of the crisis, about 43 per cent of the population lived below the 
absolute poverty line (less than US$ 1.25 per day). Since the crisis, the rate has risen to 50 
per cent. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Fragility of the security sector and active tolerance of certain 
vigilante groups 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Mission noted with deep concern the current fragility of Malian institutions. 
Security forces are heavily polarized between supporters of the leaders of the coup (military 
green berets and the Sim&#233;on Keita police association) and their opponents (military red 
berets and the Tidjani Coulibaly police association). This situation generates a profound 
instability that does not encourage respect for human rights.  
</p>
<p>62.  The Mission is deeply concerned about the existence of vigilante groups, in 
violation of Malian law. Pro-government militias such as Ganda Koy (estimated to have 
1,842 men) enjoyed the complicity of successive governments and were deployed alongside 
the national army in strategic towns in the north until they fell under the control of rebel 
groups. The militia withdrew to S&#233;var&#233; in Mopti between April and May 2012. Since then, 
several other militias, such as Ganda Izo (estimated to have 1,337 men) and Forces de 
Lib&#233;ration des R&#233;gions Nord du Mali (FLN) (estimated to have 847 men), have been 
established in the south for deployment in the north to protect vulnerable populations and 
fight against insurgent rebel groups. A senior military official told the Mission &#8220;with a 
failed State and in view of the emergency situation in the country people are organizing </p>


<p>GE.13-10067 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>themselves however they can to regain control of the north&#8221;. These militias, though poorly 
equipped, are very organized. They distribute their own membership cards to national 
troops. The Mission has also received information about radio broadcasts mobilizing young 
people to join the militias. The presence of children under 18 years of age enlisted in Ganda 
Izo and the FLN has been reported. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Ethnic dimension of the crisis and attendant risks  
</b></p>
<p>63. The Mission was alarmed by the growing ethnic dimension of the crisis. Although 
for a long time, life in Mali was apparently harmonious, many stories have highlighted the 
strong ethnic ramifications of the current crisis that seem to stem from uneven development 
among the regions, the persistence of impunity, discrimination on ethnic and racial grounds 
as well as past conflicts and violence, including the Tuareg rebellions that were very much 
concealed, repressed and denied. The strongest ethnic tensions were observed between the 
Arab and Tuareg communities on the one hand, and other ethnic groups in Mali, on the 
other hand. The Mission received testimony from all sides concerning discriminatory and 
humiliating acts, abuse and violence (sometimes resulting in death) motivated by ethnic 
considerations. The Mission also heard similar statements of incitement to racial hatred 
from the persons interviewed. The Mission observed a deep sense of frustration and desire 
for revenge among many of the people it met. Although the ethnic issue remains taboo in 
Mali, it is insidiously leading to the polarization of society, divisions and potential reprisals.  
</p>
<p><b> IX. Humanitarian access in the north 
</b></p>
<p>64.  Following the extreme violence carried out by armed groups at the beginning of 
2012 and the massive destruction of basic infrastructures, the State and its agents swiftly 
withdrew from the northern territories. The vast majority of humanitarian and development 
organizations have left the area; only a minority has stayed there and is generally operating 
with local staff. The effective delivery and distribution of humanitarian aid in the north has 
often proved problematic and difficult to monitor. With one or two exceptions, there was no 
reliable, independent system for monitoring distribution of humanitarian aid at the time of 
the Mission&#8217;s visit.  
</p>
<p>65. For the most part, the humanitarian actors in the area have had to negotiate with 
armed groups the strategies and methods for distributing aid, without necessarily organizing 
the whole process. The Mission has heard of cases where aid is entirely under the unilateral 
control of armed groups, without any guarantee that it has been distributed to recipients. 
Some leaders of armed groups and local public figures allegedly distribute humanitarian aid 
received based on ethnic or religious grounds. The Mission also learned that aid has 
sometimes been distributed in mosques and, in such cases, not given directly to women.  
</p>
<p><b> X. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>66. <b>Against a background of the increasing polarization of Malian society, it has 
been difficult to verify all information received. In this connection, given the limited 
time available to carry out the Mission and, considering the seriousness of the 
allegations reported, there is an urgent need for further study of the facts that can 
only be done by a United Nations commission of inquiry, in order to pave the way for 
a meaningful process of truth, justice and reconciliation.</b> 
67. <b>The Mission wishes to point out that a possible military intervention by 
ECOWAS to help the Malian army regain control of the north could have major </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.13-10067 
</p>
<p><b>human rights implications. Some members of the armed groups are from the local 
population and have the support of certain local public figures. The ethnic dimension, 
including the fact that one sector of the population and members of the military are 
confusing civilians from Tamashek and Arab groups with armed groups, and the 
distress of the Malian army at the setback it suffered point to the risk of reprisals 
against the civilian population in the event of a military intervention. The fact that 
many militias are driven by revenge, and, sometimes, a sense of identity is also a 
matter of concern. The fragile state of the institutions described in this report makes 
the situation even more precarious.</b> 
</p>
<p>68. <b>On the humanitarian front, specialized staff fear a massive flux of displaced 
persons and refugees, currently estimated at more than 300,000 persons, in the event 
of a military intervention. Such a scenario would put considerable pressure on the 
national humanitarian system, as well as on other States in the region and 
humanitarian agencies to absorb the additional mass of displaced persons and 
refugees. The situation also risks creating some instability in the subregion. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>Finally, it should be noted that increasing ethnic tensions in Mali foster a 
climate that is not favourable to national unity. If nothing is done about it and if these 
tensions are, in addition, manipulated for political purposes, Mali is likely to 
experience violence on an unprecedented scale. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>In view of the foregoing, the High Commissioner makes the following 
recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>Recommendations to the Government of Mali: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)  Ensure that all perpetrators of human rights violations committed 
during the crisis are brought to justice;</b> 
 <b>(b)</b>  <b>Ensure that the rights of all Malians are observed, including the prompt 
organization of fair trials or release of those who are unlawfully detained;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(c)</b> <b>Ensure that all security forces receive training on the principles of 
international law, human rights law and humanitarian law;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(d) Put in place a process of inclusive dialogue for the establishment of a 
transitional justice mechanism covering the violations committed in connection with 
the 2012 crisis and during previous waves of violence;</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(e) Organize campaigns to raise awareness of human rights, in particular 
against: (i) ethnic and religious intolerance, (ii) exploitation and abuse of and violence 
against children and women; 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(f) As part of the reform of the security sector, adopt measures: (i) to 
conduct a certification process for the defence and security forces; (ii) to establish, 
with the support of the United Nations system, disarmament, demobilization and 
community reintegration programmes; (iii) to prohibit the operations of the militias; 
</b> <b>(g)</b> <b>Enhance the participation of women and young people in mediation and 
negotiation processes, and in decision-making, as well as in the global humanitarian 
response and the electoral process. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Recommendations to the international community: 
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>Strengthen the capacity of the United Nations system in Mali in the 
following areas: (i) the prevention, monitoring and follow-up of human rights 
violations; (ii) national capacity-building for the protection of human rights, including

Mali, as well as in the event of possible sanctions against protagonists, particularly by 
ensuring that civilian rights are fully upheld. Implement the human rights due 
diligence policy, in particular, by conducting risk assessments before providing any 
United Nations support to non-United Nations forces and by establishing monitoring 
and action mechanisms in the event of allegations of serious violations by the armed 
forces involved in the military intervention; strengthen the capacity of national 
security forces for the greater protection of civilians. Establish a United Nations 
mission with a strong human rights component to support the efforts of the Malian 
authorities;

<p><b> (d)</b> <b>Establish without delay an international commission of inquiry or fact-
finding mission into human rights violations that have occurred in Mali since January 
2012.
