</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The present report contains a brief overview of the activities of the Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms relating to the promotion and protection of the realization of the right to 
</p>
<p>development. It covers the period from May 2014 to April 2015 and complements the 
</p>
<p>report of the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner on the right to development 
</p>
<p>submitted to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session (A/HRC/27/27). 
</p>
<p>The activities included support for relevant Council mechanisms, as well as events 
</p>
<p>and initiatives in the areas of inter-agency coordination and mainstreaming of the right to 
</p>
<p>development into the policies and programmes of international organizations and into the 
</p>
<p>post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><b>  I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 48/141 establishing the post of United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights, the General Assembly directed the High Commissioner to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect the realization of the right to development and to enhance support from relevant 
</p>
<p>bodies of the United Nations system for this purpose. It also directed the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner to recognize the importance of promoting a balanced and sustainable 
</p>
<p>development for all people and of ensuring the realization of the right to development, as 
</p>
<p>established in the United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development. 
</p>
<p>2. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 27/2, requested the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to continue to submit to the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council an annual report on its activities, including on inter-agency 
</p>
<p>coordination within the United Nations system with regard to the promotion and realization 
</p>
<p>of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>3. In its resolution 69/181, the General Assembly reaffirmed the request to the High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights, in mainstreaming the right to development, to effectively 
</p>
<p>undertake activities aimed at strengthening the global partnership for development among 
</p>
<p>Member States, development agencies and the international development, financial and 
</p>
<p>trade institutions, and to reflect those activities in detail in his next report to the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>4. In the same resolution, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>submit a report to the General Assembly at its seventieth session and an interim report to 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council on the implementation of that resolution, including efforts 
</p>
<p>undertaken at the national, regional and international levels in the promotion and realization 
</p>
<p>of the right to development.  
</p>
<p>5. The present report is submitted in accordance with the above requests and provides 
</p>
<p>information on the activities undertaken by OHCHR and the United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms between May 2014 and April 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Activities of the Office of the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p><b>High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>6. The operational framework for promoting and protecting the realization of the right 
</p>
<p>to development is contained in the Secretary-General&#8217;s strategic framework for the period 
</p>
<p>2014&#8211;2015 and the OHCHR Management Plan for the period 2014&#8211;2017.1  
</p>
<p>7. During the period under review, OHCHR has conducted numerous activities, a full 
</p>
<p>account of which is available on the OHCHR website, including the web page dedicated to 
</p>
<p>the right to development.2

<p><b> A. Support to the Working Group on the Right to Development 
</b></p>
<p>8. OHCHR provided support to the Working Group on the Right to Development 
</p>
<p>during its fifteenth annual session, held from 12 to 16 May 2014. OHCHR also provided 
</p>
<p>support to the informal intersessional meetings of the Working Group, held on 16 February 
</p>
<p>and 24 April 2015, in preparation for its sixteenth annual session. Furthermore, OHCHR 
</p>
<p>supported the Chair-Rapporteur in holding informal consultations and presenting the report 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly. In October 
</p>
<p>2014, OHCHR issued a press release on the report.3  
</p>
<p>9. During its thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth sessions, the Working Group reviewed 
</p>
<p>and made numerous proposals to amend the draft right to development criteria and 
</p>
<p>corresponding operational sub-criteria. These were initially proposed by the high-level task 
</p>
<p>force on the implementation of the right to development. The Working Group is mandated 
</p>
<p>to continue, at its sixteenth session, to accomplish its tasks including, in particular, to 
</p>
<p>consider, revise and refine the draft right to development criteria and corresponding 
</p>
<p>operational sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p>10. Over the past five years, the Working Group has received several contributions on 
</p>
<p>the proposed draft right to development criteria and corresponding operational sub-criteria. 
</p>
<p>In total, it has received 4 submissions from groups of States (2 from the Non-Aligned 
</p>
<p>Movement and 2 from the European Union), 34 from Member States, 12 from 
</p>
<p>organizations of the United Nations system, 4 from national human rights institutions (2 
</p>
<p>from the National Human Rights Commission of India, 1 from the Independent Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Commission of Afghanistan and 1 from the Advisory Council on Human Rights of 
</p>
<p>Morocco), 1 from a United Nations treaty body (the Committee on Economic, Social and 
</p>
<p>Cultural Rights), 4 joint submissions from non-governmental organizations (3 from a 
</p>
<p>working group of Catholic-inspired non-governmental organizations on the right to 
</p>
<p>development and international solidarity and 1 from an indigenous peoples&#8217; organization) 
</p>
<p>and 12 individual submissions from civil society organizations and academics. All the 
</p>
<p>submissions have been posted in their original versions on the OHCHR web page dedicated 
</p>
<p>to the Working Group. 
</p>
<p>11. In addition, the Working Group has engaged in an effort to revitalize its work. With 
</p>
<p>the support of OHCHR, and at the request of the Working Group, the former Chair-
</p>
<p>Rapporteur submitted to the sixteenth session of the Working Group a draft framework to 
</p>
<p>improve its effectiveness and efficiency with a view to accomplishing its mandate 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.2/16/2). 
</p>
<p>12. In the first part of her report, the Chair-Rapporteur briefly reviewed the past work of 
</p>
<p>the Working Group, drawing on its agreed conclusions and recommendations, assessing the 
</p>
<p>extent to which the Working Group had addressed all aspects of its mandate and the factors 
</p>
<p>and conditions that had influenced its effectiveness and efficiency. 
</p>
<p>13. The Chair-Rapporteur identified the three processes that had characterized the work 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group: first, interaction with the Independent Expert on the right to 
</p>
<p>development; second, interaction with the high-level task force on the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the right to development; and third, the intergovernmental process that had been taking 
</p>
<p>place since 2011, focusing on the revision and refinement of the criteria and corresponding 
</p>
<p>operational sub-criteria for the implementation of the right to development. 
</p>
<p>14. In the second part of her report, the Chair-Rapporteur drew on lessons learned and 
</p>
<p>formulated a draft framework. She observed an imbalance in the manner in which the tasks 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 See www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=15204&amp;LangID=E. </p>


<p>entrusted to the Working Group by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 
</p>
<p>1998/72 had been implemented, with some aspects trailing behind others. She highlighted 
</p>
<p>three main factors that needed to be addressed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group: political will and commitment; an effective agenda; and the 
</p>
<p>availability of means that are commensurate with the tasks entrusted to the Working Group, 
</p>
<p>including mechanisms, modalities, time, and human and material resources. She made 
</p>
<p>several recommendations, primarily procedural, to address those factors with a view to 
</p>
<p>accomplishing all aspects of the Working Group&#8217;s mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Events and activities 
</b></p>
<p>15. OHCHR organized jointly with the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung Geneva Office a 
</p>
<p>workshop on 17 and 18 September 2014 for 24 experts, practitioners and academics in the 
</p>
<p>fields of human rights impact assessments, trade and investment. The workshop focused on 
</p>
<p>the issues involved in human rights impact assessments in trade and investment regimes, 
</p>
<p>and the role that various stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations and 
</p>
<p>OHCHR, can play in improving the effectiveness of future assessments in trade and 
</p>
<p>investment. There is increasing recognition of the potential benefits that human rights 
</p>
<p>impact assessments of trade and investment regimes can bring. In principle, these 
</p>
<p>assessments can be effective in identifying, quantifying and assessing the ways trade and 
</p>
<p>investment affect the full spectrum of human rights. Their practice, however, is beset by 
</p>
<p>challenges relating to the form they take, how and when they are conducted, the person or 
</p>
<p>body undertaking the assessment, and the use that is made of the results. The workshop 
</p>
<p>found that trade and investment processes, while not fully transparent, are subject to more 
</p>
<p>scrutiny than ever before. In most cases, a small window is open for the use of human rights 
</p>
<p>impact assessments. In addition, the political landscape is changing, with more sensitivity 
</p>
<p>towards human rights and development issues, and more discussion on the human rights 
</p>
<p>implications of investor-State dispute settlement. If human rights impact assessments are to 
</p>
<p>be effective in addressing the human rights impacts of trade and investment agreements, 
</p>
<p>further guidance, capacity-building and support for their practice is essential. Through 
</p>
<p>developing the practice of such assessments, respective roles will be balanced, creating a 
</p>
<p>more democratic and transparent process for the design, negotiation and implementation of 
</p>
<p>trade and investment agreements. Trade and investment should be about making the right 
</p>
<p>development impact on the ground and human rights impact assessments are an important, 
</p>
<p>if still modest, pathway to making that happen.4 
</p>
<p>16. In the wake of the workshop, OHCHR is now collaborating with the Economic 
</p>
<p>Commission for Africa and Friedrich Ebert Stiftung on a potential human rights impact 
</p>
<p>assessment of the Continental Free Trade Area agreement in Africa. OHCHR prepared an 
</p>
<p>issues paper for that purpose, which was considered at a multi-stakeholder expert workshop 
</p>
<p>held on 16 and 17 April 2015 in Addis Ababa. If a human rights impact assessment were 
</p>
<p>undertaken, negotiating countries would be provided with an evidence base and policy 
</p>
<p>recommendations from which they could develop an effective and coherent approach to the 
</p>
<p>negotiations, with a view to realizing outcomes that are aligned with human rights as well 
</p>
<p>as national development commitments and priorities. 
</p>
<p>17. With regard to investment and the right to development, OHCHR, in collaboration 
</p>
<p>with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), organized a 
</p>
<p>panel discussion on human rights and investment policymaking at the World Investment 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 The report of the workshop is available at 
</p>
<p>www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Globalization/Report_HRIA_Workshop.pdf. </p>


<p>Forum on 15 October 2014 in Geneva. OHCHR also intervened at the plenary of the 
</p>
<p>International Investment Agreements Conference, the UNCTAD World Investment Forum, 
</p>
<p>on 16 October. This was later followed up with a statement at the UNCTAD Expert 
</p>
<p>Meeting on the Transformation of the International Investment Agreement Regime, held on 
</p>
<p>25 February 2015 in Geneva.5 
</p>
<p>18. On 2 December 2014, in commemoration of the anniversary of the Declaration on 
</p>
<p>the Right to Development, OHCHR organized a panel discussion on the theme of 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainable Development with Dignity and Justice for All &#8211; Realizing the Right to 
</p>
<p>Development for Present and Future Generations&#8221;.6 The event was attended by 
</p>
<p>representatives of Member States, international organizations and civil society and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders, with notable and active participation by young people and students. 
</p>
<p>Participants shared stories, good practices, case studies and practical suggestions 
</p>
<p>illustrating how the right to development can help realize sustainable development. Themes 
</p>
<p>included: the obstacles posed by the international economic architecture on realizing the 
</p>
<p>right to sustainable development; the right to development and the SIDS Accelerated 
</p>
<p>Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway; Ebola virus and the right to development: 
</p>
<p>realizing State responsibility; implementing the right to development for justice and peace; 
</p>
<p>the path to sustainable development: lessons from the Bhopal disaster; the implications of 
</p>
<p>hazardous substances on the rights of future generations; advancing the right to 
</p>
<p>development: a child rights-based perspective; and young people&#8217;s participation at the 
</p>
<p>United Nations to shape the world they want to see. The discussions reaffirmed the critical 
</p>
<p>importance of fulfilling the right to development so as to meet equitably the developmental 
</p>
<p>and environmental needs of present and future generations. They reflected broad agreement 
</p>
<p>that the right to development presents a vision for transformative development as it 
</p>
<p>mandates an enabling environment, at both the national and international levels, for 
</p>
<p>development that addresses root causes, systemic issues and structural challenges. 
</p>
<p>19. During the 2015 Social Forum of the Human Rights Council, which took place from 
</p>
<p>18 to 20 February, participants considered the issue of access to medicines in the context of 
</p>
<p>the right to health. OHCHR organized the three-day meeting, which brought together 
</p>
<p>participants representing States, international organizations, civil society organizations, 
</p>
<p>pharmaceutical companies, academia, medical professionals, patients and other 
</p>
<p>stakeholders. They engaged in discussions that included the intersection of intellectual 
</p>
<p>property and human rights law, health-care financing, strengthening health systems, 
</p>
<p>improving health delivery systems in challenging contexts, access to medicines for women 
</p>
<p>and children, lessons learned and emerging challenges in the global response to AIDS, 
</p>
<p>patient-centred approaches to access to medicines, and innovative approaches to promoting 
</p>
<p>access to medicines. Several side events, including documentary film screenings, 
</p>
<p>complemented the main programme.7 
</p>
<p>20. Together with the Mary Robinson Foundation &#8211; Climate Justice, OHCHR hosted the 
</p>
<p>Climate Justice Dialogue on 7 February 2015. The Dialogue brought together over 50 
</p>
<p>representatives of the climate change and human rights constituencies to discuss links 
</p>
<p>between human rights and climate change in advance of the February meeting of the Ad 
</p>
<p>Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action in Geneva. Those 
</p>
<p>meetings resulted in the launch of the Geneva Pledge for Human Rights in Climate Action, 
</p>

<p>which calls for meaningful collaboration between national representatives in human rights 
</p>
<p>and climate change processes to inform climate action. 
</p>
<p>21. OHCHR organized a full-day discussion on human rights and climate change on 6 
</p>
<p>March 2015, during the twenty-eighth session of the Human Rights Council. Panellists 
</p>
<p>included the President of Kiribati, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu, the Foreign Ministers of 
</p>
<p>Bangladesh and the Philippines and the President of the Mary Robinson Foundation &#8211;
</p>
<p>Climate Justice, among other distinguished speakers. The discussions revealed a broad 
</p>
<p>consensus that climate change has profound impacts on human rights, and is one of the 
</p>
<p>greatest moral challenges facing humanity. Both panellists and participants called for 
</p>
<p>urgent, collective and concrete action. Many panellists agreed that such action must be 
</p>
<p>driven by a new vision for sustainable development, taking due account of climate 
</p>
<p>vulnerabilities and injustices. Discussants emphasized the need for a rights-based approach, 
</p>
<p>including application of the right to development, to ensure climate change prevention, 
</p>
<p>adaptation and mitigation and international cooperation to support national efforts for 
</p>
<p>transition to low-carbon, climate-resilient development that leaves no one behind. It was 
</p>
<p>emphasized that people in small island developing States face existential threats to survival, 
</p>
<p>and international solidarity is critical, including for migration with dignity. Participants 
</p>
<p>called for concerted measures to integrate human rights in climate change negotiations and 
</p>
<p>for sharing of knowledge and best practices across the human rights and climate change 
</p>
<p>communities.  
</p>
<p>22. OHCHR supported the eighth annual human rights film festival which took place 
</p>
<p>from 7 to 11 October 2014 in Kyrgyzstan. The theme of the festival was the right to 
</p>
<p>development. The festival inspired debate and raised civic awareness in Kyrgyzstan. Over 
</p>
<p>the course of the week, citizens had the opportunity to see how communities from other 
</p>
<p>parts of the world have dealt with and solved many of the problems that the country faces 
</p>
<p>today on its path to development. The discussions and round-table events hosted along with 
</p>
<p>the films provided a public space for citizens to collaborate on how these problems must be 
</p>
<p>confronted within the local political and civic environment. In partnership with the non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization Bir Duino, OHCHR contributed to the event by providing 
</p>
<p>financial assistance for website design and interpretation at panel discussions, delivering 
</p>
<p>several opening and closing statements at different stages throughout the festival and 
</p>
<p>providing print and video materials for use during panel discussions. 
</p>
<p>23. In Madagascar, OHCHR has promoted the integration of human rights into laws 
</p>
<p>regulating the exploitation of natural resources and is assisting with efforts aimed at 
</p>
<p>developing a human rights-compliant social corporate responsibility policy, as well as 
</p>
<p>facilitating dialogue between mining and petroleum companies, communities and the State. 
</p>
<p>24. In 2015, OHCHR developed and posted on its website a chronology of major 
</p>
<p>developments before and after the adoption of the United Nations Declaration on the Right 
</p>
<p>to Development.8 This initiative contributed to advancing knowledge and understanding of 
</p>
<p>the right to development in the broader context. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Inter-agency cooperation and mainstreaming the right to development 
</b></p>
<p>25. Mainstreaming human rights, including the right to development, into United 
</p>
<p>Nations policies, operational activities, guidelines and tools on development programming 
</p>
<p>is an integral part of the High Commissioner&#8217;s mandate and a major pillar of the 
</p>

<p>programme of work of the Office. OHCHR continued to play a leading and instrumental 
</p>
<p>role in coordinating and supporting United Nations inter-agency initiatives on 
</p>
<p>mainstreaming all human rights, including the right to development, in United Nations 
</p>
<p>policies and operational programmes. Specifically, the Deputy High Commissioner led and 
</p>
<p>co-chaired the United Nations Development Group human rights mainstreaming 
</p>
<p>mechanism. The mechanism was established in 2009 at the request of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>to institutionalize the mainstreaming of human rights in United Nations development work, 
</p>
<p>including through policy and operational coherence, leadership, capacity-building at the 
</p>
<p>national level, and strengthening advocacy and knowledge platforms. It served as an 
</p>
<p>important senior-level policy forum at which to discuss critical policy issues on human 
</p>
<p>rights and provided strong operational support to the work of resident coordinators and 
</p>
<p>United Nations country teams, supported by the Multi-Partner Trust Fund Office of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Development Programme. 
</p>
<p>26. OHCHR has been working to integrate all human rights, including the right to 
</p>
<p>development, into the post-2015 development agenda as well as into the two other main 
</p>
<p>international development processes of 2015, namely the Third International Conference on 
</p>
<p>Financing for Development, to be held in Addis Ababa in July, and the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Climate Change Conference, to be held in Paris in December.  
</p>
<p>27. In September, United Nations leaders will gather in New York for a summit to adopt 
</p>
<p>the post-2015 development agenda. Encouragingly, the sustainable development goals 
</p>
<p>proposed by the Open Working Group of the General Assembly on Sustainable 
</p>
<p>Development Goals reflect the substantive content of several human rights obligations, 
</p>
<p>including the right to development. The draft text of the solemn declaration, which is to 
</p>
<p>precede these goals and targets, makes it amply clear that the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda is to be guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p>and grounded in international human rights standards, including the right to development. 
</p>
<p>28. In March 2015, the United Nations Statistical Commission presented preliminary 
</p>
<p>global indicators for the sustainable development goals and targets. From a human rights 
</p>
<p>perspective, these indicators should be transformative and capture the priorities of a people-
</p>
<p>centred development agenda. They should measure who is left behind. Data disaggregation 
</p>
<p>will therefore be a fundamental tool to reveal inequalities and deprivation across all 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals and targets. Indicators that measure the extent to which an 
</p>
<p>enabling national and international legal and policy environment is present to promote and 
</p>
<p>protect all human rights, including the right to development, should be indispensable 
</p>
<p>components of the post-2015 framework.  
</p>
<p>29. Adopting a financing framework that lives up to the ambition of the post-2015 
</p>
<p>development agenda is of paramount importance. The underlying thread should be article 2 
</p>
<p>of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which enshrines the 
</p>
<p>commitment to mobilize maximum available resources, including through international 
</p>
<p>cooperation, for the progressive realization of economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>However, the issue is not just effective resource mobilization; it is also about resource 
</p>
<p>allocation and distribution in the spirit of solidarity between countries and towards the 
</p>
<p>poorest and most vulnerable in all societies. This duty is echoed in the Declaration on the 
</p>
<p>Right to Development, in particular in articles 4 (2) and 2 (3), according to which effective 
</p>
<p>international cooperation is essential for the realization of the right to development in 
</p>
<p>providing developing countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their 
</p>
<p>comprehensive development, as is the fair distribution of the benefits resulting from 
</p>
<p>development nationally.  
</p>
<p>30. In this regard, OHCHR has emphasized several important human rights 
</p>
<p>considerations: access to financial services and resources should be provided without 
</p>
<p>discrimination; foreign direct investment should not undermine human rights; business </p>


<p>enterprises should rigorously apply due diligence and assess the human rights impact of 
</p>
<p>their planned investments and be held accountable therefore; arrangements for transparent, 
</p>
<p>orderly and participatory sovereign debt restructuring have to be strengthened; guidelines 
</p>
<p>that ensure sustainable, transparent lending and borrowing that benefits and is accountable 
</p>
<p>to people should be developed; and reporting on financing for development should be based 
</p>
<p>on specific time-bound targets. The monitoring of the post-2015 financing framework 
</p>
<p>needs to go beyond the tracking of financial flows, and also assess the development results, 
</p>
<p>in human rights terms. 
</p>
<p>31. In its advocacy on climate change, OHCHR has emphasized that this issue, more 
</p>
<p>than any other, reveals the interdependence between States. No country working alone can 
</p>
<p>protect its citizens from the impacts of climate change, and if energetic and timely steps are 
</p>
<p>not taken, even collective measures will come too late. The international community must 
</p>
<p>work together to address the challenges that climate change poses for the realization of all 
</p>
<p>human rights, especially the right to development.  
</p>
<p>32. The new climate agreement should build upon commitments already made at the 
</p>
<p>United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun to ensure that parties should, in all 
</p>
<p>climate change-related actions, fully respect, protect, promote and fulfil human rights. 
</p>
<p>OHCHR has appealed for clear references in the climate agreement to the human rights 
</p>
<p>principles of equality, non-discrimination, accountability, participation, empowerment, 
</p>
<p>transparency, sustainability and international cooperation, and for the inclusion of strong 
</p>
<p>language on human rights at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Activities of the United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>33. At its twenty-seventh session, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 27/30 
</p>
<p>on the activities of vulture funds, in which it requested the Advisory Committee to prepare 
</p>
<p>a research-based report on the activities of vulture funds and the impact on human rights. 
</p>
<p>The Committee is to present a progress report for the consideration of the Council at its 
</p>
<p>thirty-first session, to be held in March 2016. 
</p>
<p>34. At its fifty-fourth session, held from 23 February to 6 March 2015, the Committee 
</p>
<p>on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights adopted its statement on social protection floors: 
</p>
<p>an essential element of the right to social security and of the sustainable development goals 
</p>
<p>(E/C.12/2015/1). The Committee recalled that social security was a human right and an 
</p>
<p>economic and social necessity for development and progress. The Committee reiterated that 
</p>
<p>adequate resources must be allocated at the national level and through international 
</p>
<p>assistance and cooperation to comply with the obligation to progressively realize the rights 
</p>
<p>enshrined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It also 
</p>
<p>encouraged States to include social protection floors in the sustainable development goals. 
</p>
<p>35. In her 2014 report to the General Assembly, the Special Rapporteur on adequate 
</p>
<p>housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to 
</p>
<p>non-discrimination in this context (A/69/274), outlined priority areas of work. She referred 
</p>
<p>to issues that were global or transnational in scope, and that had a direct impact on the right 
</p>
<p>to adequate housing in many countries. Global bodies such as transnational corporations, 
</p>
<p>multilateral or bilateral financial institutions and United Nations agencies played significant 
</p>
<p>roles in relation to the right to adequate housing. The actions of transnational extractive 
</p>
<p>industries or development projects, sometimes initiated and overseen by multiple partners, 
</p>
<p>including international financial institutions, might have far-reaching effects on the right to 
</p>
<p>adequate housing, including large-scale displacements, the destruction of sources of 
</p>
<p>livelihood and forced evictions. Similarly, trade and investment agreements and investor </p>


<p>dispute mechanisms increasingly involved important issues of public policy and often failed 
</p>
<p>to ensure the consideration of fundamental rights such as the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>Those problems had led to important work to assess and clarify issues of corporate 
</p>
<p>accountability, extraterritorial obligations, and human rights in relation to trade and 
</p>
<p>investment agreements. The Special Rapporteur expected to be actively engaged with 
</p>
<p>respect to those emerging issues as they related to the right to adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>36. In his 2014 report to the General Assembly, the Chair of the Working Group of 
</p>
<p>Experts on People of African Descent (A/69/318) welcomed the proclamation by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly, by its resolution 68/237, of the International Decade for People of 
</p>
<p>African Descent starting on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2024, with the 
</p>
<p>theme &#8220;People of African descent: recognition, justice and development&#8221;. The Working 
</p>
<p>Group observed that development was considered in two ways: first, in terms of the role 
</p>
<p>that people of African descent had played historically and contemporarily in global 
</p>
<p>development; and second, in terms of the need for a human rights-based approach to all 
</p>
<p>development activities (para. 36). Owing to the special and unique nature of discrimination 
</p>
<p>often faced by people of African descent, in particular in relation to the legacies of 
</p>
<p>colonialism, enslavement and the transatlantic slave trade, the Working Group deemed it 
</p>
<p>appropriate to make a careful distinction between their situation and that of other groups 
</p>
<p>who also faced racial and other forms of discrimination (para. 38). At the sixteenth session 
</p>
<p>of the Working Group, one of its members delivered a statement on reparation and the right 
</p>
<p>to development.9  
</p>
<p>37. The 2014 report to the Human Rights Council of the Special Rapporteur in the field 
</p>
<p>of cultural rights, on copyright policy and the right to science and culture (A/HRC/28/57), 
</p>
<p>included a number of recommendations relevant for the right to development. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur recommended that international copyright instruments should be subject to 
</p>
<p>human rights impact assessments and contain safeguards for freedom of expression, the 
</p>
<p>right to science and culture, and other human rights (para. 94). Such instruments should 
</p>
<p>never impede the ability of States to adopt exceptions and limitations that reconciled 
</p>
<p>copyright protection with the right to science and culture or other human rights, based on 
</p>
<p>domestic circumstances. Member States of the World Intellectual Property Organization 
</p>
<p>should support the adoption of international instruments on copyright exceptions and 
</p>
<p>limitations for libraries and education. The possibility of establishing a core list of 
</p>
<p>minimum required exceptions and limitations incorporating those currently recognized by 
</p>
<p>most States, and/or an international fair use provision, should also be explored. The World 
</p>
<p>Trade Organization should preserve the exemption of least developed countries from 
</p>
<p>complying with provisions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual 
</p>
<p>Property Rights until they reached a stage of development at which they no longer qualified 
</p>
<p>as least developed countries. 
</p>
<p>38. In her responses to questions during the interactive dialogue at the twenty-seventh 
</p>
<p>session of the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe 
</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation addressed the right to development. She pointed out that 
</p>
<p>development and the realization of human rights needed to go hand in hand. Efforts 
</p>
<p>targeted at development must benefit the people, and development and the progressive 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights must be undertaken simultaneously. It could not be assumed 
</p>
<p>that development must be promoted first, while ignoring human rights, and that, when 
</p>
<p>development had been achieved, human rights would miraculously be realized. Experience 
</p>
<p>had shown that certain parts of the population would continue to be discriminated against 
</p>
<p>and left behind unless deliberate measures were adopted targeting them. There was a need 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 Available at www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Racism/WGEAPD/Session16/VereneShepherd.pdf. </p>


<p>to redefine development with a focus on eliminating inequalities in general, and in access to 
</p>
<p>water and sanitation more specifically. Only when no one was left behind could one truly 
</p>
<p>speak of development. In that regard, access to justice was essential and must not be an 
</p>
<p>afterthought. Where people&#8217;s human rights were violated, whether through projects pursued 
</p>
<p>under the umbrella of development, through persisting inequalities or other actions or 
</p>
<p>omissions, people must be able to seek remedies.10 
</p>
<p>39. The report to the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council of the 
</p>
<p>Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order 
</p>
<p>addressed the issue of disarmament for development (A/HRC/27/51). Among other things, 
</p>
<p>the Independent Expert concluded that disarmament and demilitarization were keys to 
</p>
<p>development and human security. He recommended that States should regularly report to 
</p>
<p>the Human Rights Council on their military expenditures and contrast them with 
</p>
<p>expenditures for education, health care and the administration of justice. States should 
</p>
<p>ensure that such expenditures were discussed within the framework of the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review mechanism of the Human Rights Council and Governments should be 
</p>
<p>persuaded to devote a greater percentage of their budgets to the promotion of civil, cultural, 
</p>
<p>economic, political and social rights, and to make concrete proposals to convert from a 
</p>
<p>military-first to a human security paradigm. He also recommended that States should 
</p>
<p>significantly reduce military spending and develop conversion strategies to reorient 
</p>
<p>resources towards social services, the creation of employment in peaceful industries, and 
</p>
<p>greater support to the post-2015 development agenda. States should individually and 
</p>
<p>multilaterally allocate savings made from reduced military spending to the economic and 
</p>
<p>social transition required to respond to the global climate change challenge, as envisaged by 
</p>
<p>the United Nations in establishing the Green Climate Fund, pursuant to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Framework Convention on Climate Change. Furthermore, a portion of the financial 
</p>
<p>resources released should be devoted to research and development of sustainable energy, 
</p>
<p>including solar energy, and should be used to address the looming problem of water 
</p>
<p>scarcity, which had the potential to fuel future wars. An international effort to develop 
</p>
<p>efficient desalination industries should be envisaged.  
</p>
<p>40. The Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
</p>
<p>financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
</p>
<p>economic, social and cultural rights, in his interim study on illicit financial flows, human 
</p>
<p>rights and the post-2015 development agenda (A/HRC/28/60) observed that it has been 
</p>
<p>estimated that the majority of all illicit financial flows were related to cross-border tax-
</p>
<p>related transactions. In developing countries, trade and transfer mispricing was the main 
</p>
<p>vehicle for tax evasion or abuse, and the financial crisis had focused attention in high-
</p>
<p>income countries on tax evasion and avoidance schemes of transnational corporations. He 
</p>
<p>recommended that States include a goal to reduce illicit financial flows in the final set of 
</p>
<p>sustainable development goals, together with measurable targets and indicators to ensure 
</p>
<p>accountability for implementation. He also recommended establishing an intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>committee on tax cooperation, under the auspices of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>41. The 2015 report to the Human Rights Council of the Working Group on the issue of 
</p>
<p>human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises (A/HRC/29/28) 
</p>
<p>focused on how the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights needed to be further 
</p>
<p>embedded throughout United Nations programmes and processes in order to improve policy 
</p>
<p>coherence for inclusive and sustainable development. The Working Group noted that a 
</p>
<p>major challenge was achieving policy coherence between States&#8217; conduct in multilateral 
</p>
<p>institutions that dealt with business- and development-related issues and their international 
</p>
<p>

<p>human rights obligations. That was especially relevant in the context of State-driven 
</p>
<p>processes at the United Nations, including the negotiations on the post-2015 development 
</p>
<p>agenda. 
</p>
<p>42. In her report to the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/27/53), outlined the priorities on which she intended to focus during her tenure. 
</p>
<p>Among them, she identified the structural and systemic causes of poverty and inequality, 
</p>
<p>which rendered the poor and marginalized most vulnerable to slavery and labour 
</p>
<p>exploitation.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>43. <b>United Nations human rights mechanisms are paying increasing attention to 
</b></p>
<p><b>issues at the core of the right to development.  
</b></p>
<p>44. <b>During the reporting period, relevant work undertaken by OHCHR and the

<p><b>United Nations human rights mechanisms, including special rapporteurs and treaty 
</b></p>
<p><b>bodies, centred principally on the post-2015 development agenda, the 2015 United
