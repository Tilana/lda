BACKGROUND AND CORE BUSINESS 
 
Alliance Growers Corp. (formerly Sheslay Mining Inc.) (the "Company”) was incorporated under 
the  British  Columbia  Business  Corporation  Act  on  June  19,  2014.  On  October  3,  2014,  the 
Company  became  a  reporting  issuer  in  British  Columbia  and  Alberta.  The  head  office  of  the 
Company and records office is 500-666 Burrard Street, Vancouver, British Columbia. 
 
Amalgamation
On  June  8,  2015,  the  Company  completed  an  amalgamation  with  Sheslay  Acquisition  Corp.,  a 
wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the  Company,  Alliance  Biotech  Corp.  (formerly  Alliance  Growers 
Corp.),  a  British  Columbia  corporation  (“Alliance  Biotech”),  and  BC  Maramed  Production  Ltd. 
(“BCMM”), a British Columbia corporation, over which the Company has significant influence due to 
its ownership of 45% of the issued and outstanding shares of BCMM.
The  Company  changed  its  name  from  Sheslay  Mining  Inc.  to  Alliance  Growers  Corp.  on  June  8, 
2015  in  conjunction  with  the  amalgamation.    The  Company’s  trading  symbol  on  the  Canadian 
Securities Exchange is “ACG”.
The Company issued an aggregate of 21,473,157 common shares of the Company (“Shares”) to the 
shareholders of Alliance Biotech on the basis of one Share for every one Alliance Biotech share held 
by  the  Alliance  Biotech  shareholders.  Alliance  Biotech  is  now  a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of  the 
Company.  Currently there are 25,691,352 Shares issued and outstanding.  Of the 21,473,157 Shares 
issued on the closing of the Amalgamation, 3,994,040 Shares are subject to escrow with 1/4 of such 
escrowed  Shares  released  upon  the  date  that  the  Shares  were  listed  on  the  Canadian  Securities 
Exchange, being June 22, 2015 (the “Listing Date”), 1/3 of the remaining escrowed Shares released 
upon the date that is 6 months from the Listing Date, being December 22, 2015, 1/2 of the remaining 
escrowed  Shares  to  be  released  upon  the  date  that  is  12  months  from  the  Listing  Date  and  the 
remaining escrowed Shares to be released upon the date that is 18 months from the Listing Date.
Alliance Biotech is being treated as the accounting parent (legal subsidiary) and the Company is being 
treated  as  the  accounting  subsidiary  (legal  parent)  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements.    As 
Alliance  Biotech  was  deemed  to  be  the  acquirer  for  accounting  purposes,  its  assets,  liabilities  and 
operations  since  incorporation  are  included  in  these  consolidated  financial  statements  at  their 
historical carrying values.  The Company’s results of operations have been included from the date of 
the amalgamation.  The legal capital continues to be that of the Company, the legal parent.
Investment in Laguna Blends Inc.
In  August,  2014,  the  Company  loaned  $40,000  to  Laguna  Blends  Inc.  (“Laguna”),  a  CSE  listed 
company with common shareholders. During the three month period ended November 30, 2014, the 
Company loaned an additional $65,000 to Laguna, On January 30, 2015, the Company converted the 
$105,000  in  loans  into  1,200,000  common  shares  of  Laguna.  (formerly  3,000,000  shares  prior  to  a 
share consolidation effective January 6, 2016).
During the nine months ended May 31, 2016 the Company sold 110,000 common shares of Laguna at 
a realized gain of $2,575.
As  at  May  31,  2016,  the  Company  had  1,090,000  common  shares  of  Laguna  with  a  fair  value  of 
$114,450 based on the market trading price of these shares on May 31, 2016.
Investment in BCMM
3
On August 22, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire BCMM, a company located 
in Kelowna, British Columbia. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company paid $225,000 
for a 45% interest in BCMM.
Subsequently,  the  Company  entered  into  the  following  amendment  agreements  with  respect  to  an 
acquisition of additional interests in BCMM: 
 
1.
In December 2014, the Company agreed to issue 6,600,000 common shares in its capital stock 
to  the  five  shareholders  of  BCMM  to  purchase  the  remaining  55%  interest  in  BCMM,  which 
acquisition  was  subject  to  BCMM  receiving  a  medical  marijuana  production  and  distribution 
license issued by Health Canada e under the Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (the 
“License”) on or before December 31, 2015.
2.
Effective December 31, 2015, two BCMM shareholders, holding an aggregate of 17.5% of the 
remaining  55%  interest  in  BCMM,  agreed  to  extend  their  respective  agreements  with  the 
Company  to  December  31,  2016.    Upon  receipt  of  the  License  or  earlier  as  agreed  by  the 
parties, their 17.5% interest in BCMM will be transferred to the Company upon the issuance of 
2,100,000 common shares in its capital stock.
3.  On January 8, 2016, one of the shareholders agreed to sell their 5% interest to the Company in 
consideration  of  the issuance  of 600,000  common  shares  in the capital  of  the  Company.    The 
shares were issued January 25, 2016.
Accordingly, the Company now holds a 50% interest in BCMM, and will acquire an additional 12.5% 
interest  upon  receipt  of  the  License  or  earlier.    The  Company  was  unable  to  come  to  an  agreement 
with the remaining BCMM shareholders to acquire the remaining 37.5% interest in BCMM.
The Company exercises significant influence over BCMM as the Company owns 50% of the issued 
and  outstanding  shares  of  BCMM.  Therefore,  the  Company  accounts  for  its  investment  under  the 
equity method.
As  at  May  31,  2016,  BCMM  owns  a  leasehold  interest  and  equipment  for  a  production  facility  in 
Kelowna,  British  Columbia,  and  is  in  the  process  of  applying  to  become  a  licensed  producer  of 
medical marijuana under Health Canada’s new Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations. During 
the  nine  months  ended  May  31,  2016  and  the  year  ended  August  31,  2015,  the  Company  fully 
impaired  the  investment  as  BCMM  has  insignificant  net  assets,  and  there  is  significant  uncertainty  
that it will receive the required license.
Current Development
On  May  26,  2016  we  announced  our  ‘Four  Pillars’  business  organization.  The  Company  has 
organized  into  four  divisions:  Marijuana  for  Medical  Purposes  Regulations  (“MMPR”)  licensed 
facilities, distribution networks, consumer products, and research and development - to focus Alliance 
Growers’ potential for success in the medical marijuana market.
MMPR
Alliance holds a 50% interest in BC Maramed Production Ltd. (“BCMM”), which owns a leasehold 
interest  and  equipment  for  an  11,000  square  foot  production  facility  in  Kelowna,  British  Columbia.  
BCMM  has  submitted  an  application  to  become  a  Licensed  Producer  of  medical  marijuana  under 
Health  Canada’s  MMPR  program.  Upon  receipt  by  BCMM  of an  approved  MMPR  Production 
License  from  Health  Canada,  a  further  12.5%  interest  in  BCMM  will  be  transferred  to  Alliance 
Growers.
4
Alliance Growers is being led through the MMPR license process by Rupert Shore with assistance 
from members of the Advisory board.
Distribution Networks
The Company continues to look for attractive acquisition opportunities and commercial relationships. 
Charles Rendina, Regulatory and Financial Advisor to Alliance Growers, along with other members 
of the team, will be identifying and managing the opportunities for the US distribution network.
In addition to identifying acquisition opportunities in Washington State, Colorado and Oregon, 
Alliance is actively pursuing the purchase of dispensaries in Vancouver for distribution of medical 
Cannabis products.  Alliance has all the expertise it requires in its management and advisory members 
to be successful in this area.
Consumer Products
The Company is constantly seeking new accretive acquisition opportunities as well as commercial 
relationships for its Consumer Products division.  Alliance is currently in discussions with entities that 
will source, develop, distribute and sell cannabis related paraphernalia and edibles through retail 
establishments located in the emerging permitted US and Canadian markets. All members of the 
advisory board and management bring their respective consumer product resources to Alliance.  In 
addition to product acquisition, licensing and distribution, Alliance will be developing its own 
proprietary products under the guidance of Mr. Sina Pirooz, a Director and a compounding 
pharmacist.  Mr. Pirooz is a registered and practicing pharmacist and a professional member of the 
College of Pharmacists of British Columbia with over ten years of pharmaceuticals and pharmacy 
management experience. Mr. Shore will also be assisting with monitoring the current and proposed 
rules and regulations with regard to sales of medical cannabis and recreational cannabis products in 
both Canada and the US.
Research and Development
Under the guidance of one of Alliance Growers’ Director Sina Pirooz, the Company will be heavily 
engaged in research and development including certain product development involving his expertise 
in compounding pharmaceuticals. Mr. Pirooz, will also be a valuable asset for the Retail and 
Consumer Product divisions of the Company.
On June  30,  2016  we  announced  that  we  had signed a  Letter of  Intent  with  WFS  Pharmagreen  Inc. 
(“Pharmagreen”)  where  it  had  previously  been  agreed  that  Pharmagreen  would  provide  information 
about  its  business  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  Canna  Companion  Products  Inc.  (“Canna”). 
Alliance  Growers  proposes  to  work  with  and  investigate  possible  joint  business  interests  and 
opportunities  with  Pharmagreen  and  Canna,  including  a  potential  full  merger  of  Pharmagreen  and 
Alliance Growers, subject to extensive due diligence and analysis.
The  initial  step  is  a  proposal  to  obtain  an  exclusive  license  from  Pharmagreen  for  the  marketing, 
distribution  and  sales  of  all  present  and  future  Tissue  Culture  plantlet  products  utilizing  the 
proprietary “Chibafreen Invitro Plant Production System” for the jurisdiction of Canada, for a fee of 
CAD$400,000.  Consistent  quality  for  mass  production  for  the  agriculture  and  marijuana  industry 
stems  from  disease-free,  genetically  identical,  healthy  starting  plant  material  that  can  only  be  truly 
achieved through Chibafreen Invitro technology.
5
The  execution  of  the  formal  license  agreement  shall  be  on  or  before  the  closing  of  the  Financing 
referred to below. Additionally both parties agree to possible further development of a “Full Spectrum 
DNA Botany Lab”, which would be the only such lab facility in Western Canada.  A unique blend of 
clean room lab facilities including a botanical oils extraction lab would be built under the heading of 
“Botany  Center”.  Licensing  opportunities  for  the  “Botany  Center”  for  the  UK  and  European  Union 
are subject to further negotiations and terms.
Subject to regulatory approval, Alliance will use its best efforts to raise a minimum of CAD$400,000 
to a maximum of CAD$500,000 on or before August 31, 2016 by way of a private placement offering 
of  common  shares  (the  “Financing”)  to  pay  the  license  fee  and  continue  its  due  diligence  in 
Pharmagreen and its subsidiaries.
On  July  27,  2016  we  announced  that,  further  to  our  announcement  on  June  30,  2016,  the  Letter  of 
Intent  with  WFS  Pharmagreen  Inc.  (“Pharmagreen”)  on  obtaining  an  exclusive  license  for  the 
commercialization  of  the  “Chibafreen  Invitro  Plant  Production  System”  in  Canada  is  progressing 
much faster than expected and has led to additional joint business opportunities to be explored.  The 
Exclusive License from Pharmagreen covers the marketing, distribution and sales of all present and 
future Tissue Culture plantlet products utilizing the proprietary “Chibafreen Invitro Plant Production 
System” for the jurisdiction of Canada.  Alliance has advanced on its discussions regarding additional 
joint  business  interests  and  opportunities  with  Pharmagreen,  including  a  potential  full  merger  of 
Pharmagreen and Alliance Growers, subject to continued extensive due diligence and analysis.
Growing  Cannabis  using  tissue  culture  propagation,  specifically  the  “Chibafreen  Invitro  Plant 
Production  System”,  assures  consistent  composition  and  purity  of  each  plantlet  for  the  growers, 
regardless  of  where  and  by  whom  the  plants  are  cultivated.  Licensing  Pharmagreen’s  proprietary 
process provides tremendous advantages including rapid and efﬁcient growth of plants that will result 
in  30-50%  shorter  production  period.  Plantlets  that  are  produced  under  uniformly  controlled 
environment in the protected area are free from pest insects/pathogens and the disturbance of outside 
weather.    Additionally,  such  plantlets  are  of  very  high  quality,  disease  free  and  geared  for  optimal 
growth. Each plantlet will always have the same genetic makeup as its parent stock.
While  moving  toward  the  execution  of  a  formal  license  agreement,  both  Alliance  and  Pharmagreen 
agree  to  possible  further  development  of  a  “Full  Spectrum  DNA  Botany  Lab”,  which  would  be  the 
only  such  lab  facility  in  Western  Canada.    A  unique  blend  of  clean  room  lab  facilities  including  a 
botanical  oils  extraction  lab  would  be  built  under  the  heading  of  “Botany  Center”.  Licensing 
opportunities  for  the  “Botany  Center”  for  the  UK  and  European  Union  are  subject  to  further 
negotiations and terms.
From a monetary perspective, Pharmagreen’s business initiatives are on the cutting edge of functional 
innovations  that  not  only  bear  significant  profit  margins,  but  also  provide  a  model  of  micro 
propagation technology that can be applied across the entire agriculture industry on a mass production 
scale  with  “Chibafreen  Invitro  Plant  Production  System”.    To  put  this  in  perspective,  potential 
revenue from this system is only limited by the size of the production facility.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
Nine Months ended May 31, 2016
($0.04)
The Company had a net loss of $140,601 for the nine months ended May 31, 2016, compared to a net 
loss of $198,825 for the nine months ended May 31, 2015.  The primary reason for the difference was 
that  operating  expenses  of $161,028  decreased  from  prior  period’s  operation  expenses  of  $209,655, 
gain on debt settlement increased from  $10,830 in the prior period to $26,851 in the current period, 
and  a  realized  gain  on  sale  of  Laguna  Blends  shares  of  $2,575  for  the  nine  months  ended  May  31, 
2016 while we did not have such gain in the prior period.
Operating expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 were $161,028 compared to $209,655, 
the nine months ended May 31, 2015.  Operating expenses in the nine months ended May 31, 2016 
were  lower  than  the  prior  period,  primarily  due  to  a  decrease  in  the  following  expenses;  legal  fees 
decreased  by  $15,153,  accounting  fees  decreased  by  $14,700,  travel  and  meal  and  entertainment 
expenses  decreased  by  $9,228  and  total  management  and  consulting  fees  decreased  by  $28,639.  
Legal fees and consulting fees were higher  in the prior period primarily due to expenses incurred in 
the prior period for listing on the CSE.  Directors’ fees of $12,350 in the nine months ended May 31, 
2016 increased from $nil during the nine months ended May 31, 2015, because in the prior period the 
Company was a private corporation without a board of directors.
In  addition,  we  recorded  unrealized  gain  of  $19,076  on  the  fair  value  of  our  Laguna  Blends  shares 
based on their market value on May 31, 2016.  
 
During the nine months ended both May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, basic and diluted loss per share 
was $0.01.
Three Months ended May 31, 2016
7
The  net  loss  totaled  $78,423  for  the  three  months  ended  May  31,  2016  compared  to  a  net  loss  of 
$26,130 for the three months ended May 31, 2015.
The  other  comprehensive  loss  in  the  quarter  ended  May  31,  2016  included  an  unrealized  loss  of 
$115,924 from February 29, 2016 on the fair value of our Laguna Blends shares based on their market 
value on May 31, 2016.
The total expenses and loss from operations totaled $80,998 for the three months ended May 31, 2016 
compared to total expenses and operating loss of $26,130 for the three months ended May 31, 2015.  
The  increase  is  due  to  higher  accrued  consulting  and  management  fees  and  general  operating 
expenses.  Operating expenses were much lower in the prior three month period because the company 
was not yet public and was much less active. 
 
During the three months ended May 31, 2016 we recorded gain on sale of our Laguna Blends shares 
of $2,575. In the three months ended May 31, 2015 we did not have such sales or gain.  
 
During the three months ended both May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, basic and diluted loss per share 
was $0.00. 
 
Cash flows for the period ended May 31, 2016 
 
Operating Activities
During  the  nine  months  ended  May  31,  2016  and  May  31,  2015,  operating  activities  used  cash  of 
$31,068 and $124,250, respectively.
Investing Activities
During  the  nine  months  ended  May  31,  2016  we  received  proceeds  of  $12,200  from  a  sale  of  our 
Laguna Blends shares and we used $Nil cash for investments.  During the nine months ended May 31, 
2015 we used cash of $65,000 for purchasing common shares of Laguna Blends.
Financing Activities
During  the  nine  months  ended  May  31,  2016  we  were  advanced  $18,092  from  a  lender,  which  is 
unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable upon demand. During the nine months ended May 31, 
2015, we raised $283,150 by issuing common shares of the Company.    
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 
As at May 31, 2016 the Company had a working capital deficit of $107,759 as compared to working 
capital deficit of $17,270 at August 31, 2015.  
 
As at May 31, 2016 the Company had bank indebtedness of $3,590 as compared to cash balance of 
$1,906 at August 31, 2015.  
 
The Company’s continued development is contingent upon its ability to raise sufficient financing both 
in  the  short  and  long-term.  There  are  no  guarantees  that  additional  sources  of  funding  will  be 
available  to  the  Company;  however,  management  is  committed  to  pursuing  all  possible  sources  of 
financing in order to execute its business plan. Due to the uncertainty of its ability to meet its current 
operating  and  capital  expenses,  in  the  notes  to  its  audited  financial  statements  for  the  year  ended 
August 31, 2015, the Company’s independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding 
their substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
New standard not yet adopted
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (Revised)
IFRS  9  was  issued  by  the  IASB  in  October  2010.  It  incorporates  revised  requirements  for  the 
classification  and  measurement  of  financial  liabilities  and  carrying  over  the  existing  de-recognition 
requirements  from  IAS  39  Financial  instruments:  recognition  and  measurement.  The  revised 
financial  liability  provisions  maintain  the  existing  amortized  cost  measurement  basis  for  most 
liabilities. New requirements apply where an entity chooses to measure a liability at fair value through 
profit or loss – in these cases, the portion of the change in fair value related to changes in the entity's 
own credit risk is presented in other comprehensive income rather than within profit or loss. IFRS 9 is 
effective  for  annual  periods  beginning  on  or  after  January  1,  2018.  The  impact  of  IFRS  9  on  our 
company’s financial instruments has not yet been determined.

The  Company’s  financial instruments  are  exposed to certain  financial  risks. The  risk  exposures  and 
the  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  instruments  at  August  31,  2016  are  summarized  below.  The 
board  of  directors  reviews  with  management  the  principal  risks  affecting  the  Company  and  the 
systems that have been put in place to manage these risks. 
 
Foreign currency risk
The  Company’s  functional  currency  is  the  Canadian  dollar.    The  Company  is  not  exposed  to 
significant currency risk at this time.  
 
Interest Risk and Credit Risk
The  Company  has  no  credit  risk  on  its  note  receivable  and  no  significant  interest  rate  risk.  The 
Company's current policy is to invest excess cash in investment-grade short-term deposit certificates 
issued  by  reputable  financial  institutions  with  which  it  keeps  its  bank  accounts  and  management 
believes the risk of loss to be low.  
 
The Company periodically monitors the investments it makes and is satisfied with the credit ratings of 
its banks. 
  
Liquidity Risk
The  Company  intends  to  manage  liquidity  risk  by  maintaining  sufficient  cash  balances.    Liquidity 
requirements  are  managed  based  on  expected  cash  flows  to  ensure  that  there  is  sufficient  capital  in 
order  to  meet  short  term  obligations.  As  at  May  31,  2016,  the  Company  had  no  cash,  and  current 
liabilities of $229,922. The Company will need to source additional financing to pay its obligations as 
they come due.   
 
Capital Management
The Company’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in order to pursue the development of its projects and to maintain a flexible capital 
structure  for  its  projects  for  the  benefit  of  its  stakeholders.  As  the  Company  is  in  the  development 
stage, its principal source of funds is from the issuance of common shares.
11
In  the  management  of  capital,  the  Company  includes  the  components  of  shareholders’  equity 
(deficiency), net of cash. 
 
The  Company  manages  the  capital  structure  and  makes  adjustments  to  it  in  light  of  changes  in 
economic  conditions  and  the  risk  characteristics  of  the  underlying  assets.  To  maintain  or  adjust  the 
capital structure, the Company may attempt to issue new shares, enter into joint arrangements, acquire 
or  dispose  of  assets  or  adjust  the  amount  of  cash  and  investments.  There  were  no  changes  in  the 
Company’s approach to capital management during the period. 
 
Fair Value
The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments including cash, accounts payables, and 
due to related parties  approximates  their  fair  value  due to the  immediate  or short  term  maturity  of 
these financial instruments. 
 
Financial  instruments  measured  at  fair  value  are  classified  into  one  of  three  levels  in  the  fair  value 
hierarchy according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values. The three 
levels of the fair value hierarchy are:
  Level 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; 
  Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
either directly or indirectly; and
  Level 3 – Inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The investment in Laguna is recorded at fair value determined based on the market price of the shares 
on May 31, 2016 (a level 1 input).
