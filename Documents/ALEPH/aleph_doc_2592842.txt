Forward-Looking Statements
In addition to historical information, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain "forward-
looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, or the “Securities Act,” and Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act,” that involve many risks and uncertainties. These
statements relate to our expectations for future events and time periods. All statements other than
statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed to be forward-looking
statements, including, but not limited to, statements regarding:
•future financial performance and growth targets or expectations;
market and industry trends and developments, including the declines in oil and natural gas
prices;
the potential benefits of our completed and any future merger, acquisition, disposition,
restructuring, and financing transactions;
the expected timing for completion of the restructuring transactions described herein and in our
other filings with the SEC;
•the expected effect of the restructuring transactions; and
•the expected timing for completing the refinancing of our asset-based revolving credit facility.
You can identify these and other forward-looking statements by the use of words such as
•
•
•
“anticipates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “may,”
“might,” “will,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “potential,” “future,” “continue,” “ongoing,” “forecast,”
“project,” “target” or similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words.
These forward-looking statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this
Quarterly Report and our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as
representing our views as of any subsequent date. Future performance cannot be ensured, and
actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Some factors that
could cause actual results to differ include:
failure to complete all aspects of our restructuring transactions, including the rights offering and
implementation of the management incentive plan;
•failure to refinance our indebtedness under our asset-based revolving credit facility;
•
•
•
financial results that may be volatile and may not reflect historical trends due to, among other
things, changes in commodity prices or general market conditions, acquisition and disposition
activities, fluctuations in consumer trends, pricing pressures, changes in raw material or labor
prices or rates related to our business and changing regulations or political developments in the
markets in which we operate;
risks associated with our indebtedness, including changes to interest rates, deterioration in the
value of our machinery and equipment, our ability to manage our liquidity needs and to comply
with covenants under our credit facilities, including the indentures governing our notes;
risks associated with our capital structure, including our ability to refinance or restructure our
indebtedness to access necessary funding under our existing or future credit facilities and to
generate sufficient operating cash flow to meet our debt service obligations;
changes in customer drilling, completion and production activities and capital expenditure plans,
including impacts due to low oil and/or natural gas prices or the economic or regulatory
environment;
difficulties in identifying and completing acquisitions and divestitures, and differences in the type
and availability of consideration or financing for such acquisitions and divestitures;
•difficulties in completing any refinancing or restructuring transactions;
difficulties in successfully executing our growth initiatives, including difficulties in permitting,
financing and constructing pipelines and waste treatment assets and in structuring economically
viable agreements with potential customers, joint venture partners, financing sources and other
parties;
our ability to attract, motivate and retain key executives and qualified employees in key areas of
our business;
•

•
fluctuations in prices, transportation costs and demand for commodities such as oil and natural
gas;
risks associated with the operation, construction and development of saltwater disposal wells,
solids and liquids treatment assets, landfills and pipelines, including access to additional
locations and rights-of-way, environmental remediation obligations, unscheduled delays or
inefficiencies and reductions in volume due to micro- and macro-economic factors or the
availability of less expensive alternatives;
•risks associated with our ability to collect outstanding receivables as a result of liquidity
•
constraints on our customers resulting from low oil and/or natural gas prices;
the availability of less favorable credit and payment terms due to the downturn in our industry and
our financial condition, including more stringent or costly payment terms from our vendors and
additional requirements from sureties to collateralize our performance bonds with letters of credit,
which may further constrain our liquidity and reduce availability under our revolving credit facility;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•risks associated with new technologies and the impact on our business;
the effects of competition in the markets in which we operate, including the adverse impact of
competitive product announcements or new entrants into our markets and transfers of resources
by competitors into our markets;
changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate or in the world generally,
including as a result of political uncertainty;
reduced demand for our services due to regulatory or other influences related to extraction
methods such as hydraulic fracturing, shifts in production among shale areas in which we operate
or into shale areas in which we do not currently have operations or the loss of key customers;
the impact of changes in laws and regulation on waste management and disposal activities,
including those impacting the delivery, storage, collection, transportation treatment and disposal
of waste products, as well as the use or reuse of recycled or treated products or byproducts;
•control of costs and expenses;
•present and possible future claims, litigation or enforcement actions or investigations;
natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and floods, or acts of terrorism, or extreme
weather conditions, that may impact our corporate headquarters, assets, including wells or
pipelines, distribution channels, or which otherwise disrupt our or our customers’ operations or
the markets we serve;
•the threat or occurrence of international armed conflict;
the unknown future impact on our business from legislation and governmental rulemaking,
including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act and the rules to be promulgated thereunder;
risks involving developments in environmental or other governmental laws and regulations in the
markets in which we operate and our ability to effectively respond to those developments
including laws and regulations relating to oil and natural gas extraction businesses, particularly
relating to water usage, and the disposal, transportation and treatment of liquid and solid wastes;
and
other risks identified in this Quarterly Report or referenced from time to time in our filings with the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak
only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Except as required by law, we do not undertake any
obligation to update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect any
events or circumstances, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in
assumptions or otherwise, after the date hereof.

NUVERRA ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTIONS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Basis of Presentation
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Nuverra Environmental
Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Nuverra,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) are
unaudited, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission ("SEC"). Our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015,
included herein, has been derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(or "GAAP"). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such
rules and regulations. In our opinion, the condensed consolidated financial statements include the
normal, recurring adjustments necessary for the fair statement of the results for the interim periods.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements, including the notes thereto, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2016.
All dollar and share amounts in the footnote tabular presentations are in thousands, except per
share amounts and unless otherwise noted. Unless stated otherwise, any reference to statement
of operations items in these accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements refers to
results from continuing operations.
Reclassifications
Certain reclassifications and adjustments have been made to prior period amounts in the
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and notes thereto in order to conform to
the current year’s presentation including:
As of January 1, 2016, and further discussed below under "Significant Accounting Policies," we
retrospectively adopted, for all comparative periods presented, ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU 2015-15, Presentation and Subsequent
Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. As a result,
$6.8 million of our unamortized debt issuance costs related to our 9.875% Senior Notes due 2018
(the "2018 Notes), 12.5%/10.0% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes")
and $24.0 million term loan (the "Term Loan") have been presented in “Long-term debt” on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. Further, $8.7 million of unamortized
•
debt issuance costs related to our 2018 Notes have been reclassified from “Other assets” to
“Current portion of long-term debt” on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December
31, 2015. Additionally, as the debt associated with our asset-based revolving credit facility is
presented as short-term, the related debt issuance costs of $1.7 million and $2.2 million as of
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, have been reclassified from "Other assets"
to "Other current assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The total assets for the
Corporate/Other segment reported in Note 15 have been adjusted for this reclassification.
Going Concern
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a
going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the condensed consolidated financial
statements, we had an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2016, and a net loss for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These factors, coupled with our large outstanding debt balance,
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are attempting to
generate sufficient revenues and reduce costs; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to
support our daily operations if we are not successful. While we have executed a comprehensive
strategy to restructure our indebtedness, improve liquidity and reduce costs, including cash
interest expense, to sustain operations through the prolonged depression in oil and natural gas
prices and the corresponding impact on our business operations, there can be no assurances to
that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate
sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and operating needs. While we were, and remain, in
compliance with our existing debt arrangements, we recognize that absent an improvement in oil
prices, it is likely that we will not have enough liquidity, including cash on hand, to service our
debt, operations, and avoid covenant violations. See the "Exchange Offer" and "Term Loan"
discussion in Note 8 and the "Subsequent Events Related to Restructuring" discussion in Note 18
for details on our debt restructuring in 2016.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that
might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

Table of Contents
Significant Accounting Policies
As of January 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted, for all comparative periods presented, ASU
2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, and ASU 2015-15, Presentation
and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit
Arrangements. The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The current condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of June 30, 2016 presents $6.8 million of our unamortized debt issuance costs
related to our 2018 Notes, 2021 Notes and Term Loan in “Long-term debt.” In order to conform to
the current financial statement presentation, $8.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs
related to our 2018 Notes have been reclassified from “Other assets” to “Current portion of long-
term debt” on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The guidance
in ASU 2015-15 prescribes that deferred initial up-front commitment fees paid by a borrower to a
lender represent the benefit of being able to access capital over the contractual term, and
therefore, meet the definition of an asset, while debt issuance costs in the scope of ASU 2015-03
do not. As such, we will continue to present the costs associated with our asset-based revolving
credit facility as an asset. Deferred issuance costs associated with our asset-based revolving
credit facility of $1.7 million and $2.2 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, are included in “Other current assets” on the condensed consolidated balance sheets
as this debt is considered short-term.
On March 10, 2016, we entered into an amendment to our guaranty and security agreement
related to our asset-based revolving credit facility ("ABL Facility"), which is described in further
detail in Note 8 under "ABL Facility Amendments." This amendment implemented a daily cash
sweep of our collection lockbox and certain depository accounts, the proceeds of which are
required to be applied against the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. As a result of the
sweep occurring one day in arrears, we had an ending balance of $0.1 million in our collection
lockbox and certain depository accounts on June 30, 2016, which we have classified as
"Restricted cash" on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as this cash is not available for
operations and was subsequently swept by the lender on July 1, 2016, and applied against the
outstanding balance under the ABL Facility.
There have been no other material changes or developments in our significant accounting policies
or evaluation of accounting estimates and underlying assumptions or methodologies from those
disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Note 2 - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards
Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-
09”). The amendments in this update will be added to the ASC as Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers, and replaces the guidance in Topic 605. The underlying principle of the
guidance in this update is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects
to receive in exchange for the goods or services. This new revenue standard also calls for more
detailed disclosures and provides guidance for transactions that weren’t addressed completely,
such as service revenue and contract modifications which may be applied retrospectively or
modified retrospectively. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date ("ASU 2015-14"). The
guidance in ASU 2015-14 delays the effective date for the new revenue recognition guidance
outlined in ASU 2014-09 to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which for us is
the reporting period starting January 1, 2018. We are reviewing the guidance in ASU 2014-09 and
have not yet assessed the impact, if any, on our consolidated financial statements and have not
determined our method of adoption.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (“ASU 2014-15”). ASU 2014-15 requires management to
evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern
and to provide related footnote disclosures. In doing so, companies will have reduced diversity in
the timing and content of footnote disclosures than under today’s guidance. ASU 2014-15 is
effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, which for us is the reporting
period starting January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We are reviewing the guidance in
ASU 2014-15 and evaluating the impact this new guidance may have on our consolidated
financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASU 2016-02"),
which requires an entity that is a lessee to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from leases
on the balance sheet. This guidance also requires disclosures about the amount, timing and
uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. This guidance is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods,
using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption of ASU 2016-09 is permitted. We are
evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our
9
Table of Contents
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Based upon the current effective date,
the new guidance would first apply to our reporting period starting January 1, 2019.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation:
Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ("ASU 2016-09"), which involves
several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the
statement of cash flows.  Under the new standard, income tax benefits and deficiencies are to be
recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and the tax effects of
exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which
they occur.  An entity should also recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit
reduces taxes payable in the current period.  Excess tax benefits should be classified along with
other income tax cash flows as an operating activity.  In regards to forfeitures, the entity may make
an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are
expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period,
however early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the guidance in ASU 2016-09 to
determine our adoption method and the effect it will have on our consolidated financial
statements.
Note 3 - Earnings Per Common Share
Basic and diluted loss per common share from continuing operations, basic and diluted loss per
common share from discontinued operations and net loss per basic and diluted common share
have been computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, no shares of common stock
underlying stock options, restricted stock, or warrants were included in the computation of diluted
earnings per common share ("EPS") from continuing operations because the inclusion of such
shares would be anti-dilutive based on the net losses from continuing operations reported for
those periods. Accordingly, for the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, no shares of
common stock underlying stock options, restricted stock, or warrants were included in the
computations of diluted EPS from income from discontinued operations or diluted EPS from net
loss per common share, because such shares were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS
from continuing operations for those periods.

Note 5 - Assets Held for Sale and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets
located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, including trucks, tanks, and a parcel of land.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we began to actively market these assets, which
we expect to sell within one year. As all of the criteria for classification as assets held for sale were
met, these assets are presented separately as "Assets held for sale" in our condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the assets were recorded at the lower of net
book value or fair value less costs to sell. Upon reclassification we ceased to recognize
depreciation expense on the assets. As the fair value of the assets was lower than its net book
value, an impairment charge of $2.7 million was recognized during the three months ended June
30, 2016, and is included in "Impairment of long-lived assets" on our condensed consolidated
statements of operations. Of the $2.7 million recorded, $2.4 million related to the Northeast
division and $0.3 million related to the Southern division. The fair value of the assets was
measured using third party quoted prices for similar assets (Level 3).
Additionally, long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangibles
subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. There
were no indicators of potential impairment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
If reduced customer activity levels decrease demand for our services for a prolonged period of
time, or if we make downward adjustments to our projections, our actual cash flows could be less
than our estimated cash flows, which could result in future impairment charges for long-lived
assets.
Note 6 - Fair Value Measurements
Measurements
Fair value represents an exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-
based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing an asset or liability. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1 — Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the
measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;
Level 2 — Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either
directly or indirectly; and
Level 3 — Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the
reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.

Derivative Warrant Liability
In connection with our debt restructuring as described in Note 8 under "Exchange Offer" and
"Term Loan," we issued warrants with derivative features during the three months ended June 30,
2016. These instruments are accounted for as derivative liabilities as described further in Note 9.
Our derivative warrant liability is adjusted to reflect the estimated fair value at each quarter end,
with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value being recorded in "Other income, net"
accordingly, as adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liabilities.
We used Level 3 inputs for the valuation methodology of the derivative liabilities. The estimated
fair values were computed using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The key inputs in determining
our derivative warrant liability included our stock price, the volatility of our stock price, and the risk
free interest rate. Future changes in these factors could have a significant impact on the computed
fair value of the derivative warrant liability. As such, we expect future changes in the fair value of
the warrants to vary significantly from quarter to quarter.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the
"Derivative warrant liability" presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheet for the three
months ended June 30, 2016.

Contingent Consideration
We are liable for certain contingent consideration payments in connection with the performance of
various acquisitions. The fair values of the contingent consideration obligations were determined
using a probability-weighted income approach at the acquisition date and are revalued at each
reporting date or more frequently if circumstances dictate based on changes in the discount
periods and rates, changes in the timing and amount of the revenue estimates and changes in
probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the performance measurements
upon which the obligations are based.
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we determined that it would be unlikely that the
required permits and certificates necessary for the issuance of a second special waste disposal
permit to Ideal Oilfield Disposal, LLC would be issued within one year. As such, we reclassified
the $8.5 million contingent consideration liability related to the Ideal Oilfield Disposal, LLC
acquisition from current to long-term in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30,
2016. Changes to the fair

value of contingent consideration are recorded as "Other income, net" in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs
not observable in the market, which are referred to as Level 3 inputs.

In addition to our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we are
required by GAAP to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis
after initial recognition. Generally, assets, liabilities and reporting units are measured at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment reviews and any resulting impairment charge. In
connection with our impairment review of long-lived assets, we measure the fair value of our asset
groups for those asset groups deemed not recoverable, based on Level 3 inputs consisting of the
discounted future cash flows associated with the use and eventual disposition of the asset group.
Our cost method investment in Underground Solutions Inc. (or "UGSI") is measured at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis when deemed necessary, using observable inputs such as trading prices
of the stock, as well as using discounted cash flows, incorporating adjusted available market
discount rate information and our estimates for liquidity risk. UGSI was acquired during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, which is discussed in further detail in Note 14.

The interest rate presented represents the interest rate on the $85.0 million ABL Facility at
June 30, 2016.
The interest rate presented represents the coupon rate on our 2018 Notes, excluding the effects
of deferred financing costs, original issue discounts and original issue premiums. Including the
impact of these items, the effective interest rate on the 2018 Notes is approximately 11.0%.
Interest payments are due semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year.
The interest rate presented represents the current coupon rate on our 2021 Notes, excluding the
effects of deferred financing costs, original issue discounts and original issue premiums.
Including the impact of these items, the effective interest rate on the 2021 Notes is
approximately 11.9%. Interest will be paid in kind semi-annually by increasing the principal
amount payable and due at maturity and/or in cash as follows: interest payable on October 15,
2016 will be paid in kind at an annual rate of 12.5%; interest payable after October 15, 2016 but
on or before April 15, 2018 will be paid at a rate of 10% with 50% in kind and 50% in cash;
interest payable after April 15, 2018 will be paid in cash at a rate of 10% until maturity.
The Term Loan accrues interest at a rate of 13% compounded monthly and which is to be paid
in kind by increasing the principal amount payable thereunder. Principal including the paid in
kind interest is due April 15, 2018.
Vehicle financings consist of capital lease arrangements related to fleet purchases with a
weighted-average annual interest rate of approximately 3.04%, which mature in varying
installments between 2016 and 2020. Capital lease obligations were $10.0 million and $12.3
(f)
(g)
million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
During the three months ended June 30, 2015, we settled our $11.0 million financing obligation
to acquire the remaining 49% interest in Appalachian Water Services, LLC ("AWS") from the
non-controlling interest holder with a $4.0 million cash payment and a $7.4 million note payable
with principal and interest due in equal quarterly installments through April 2019.
As discussed in greater detail in the "Exchange Offer" section below, on April 15, 2016, $327.2
million in principal 2018 Notes were exchanged for new 2021 Notes. The note for note
exchange was accounted for as a modification, and as a result $57.3 thousand and $16.8
thousand of the original issuance discount and premium, respectively, will continue to be
amortized over the remaining term of the 2018 Notes, while $0.5 million and $0.1 million of the
original issuance discount and premium, respectively, will be amortized over the term of the
new 2021 Notes. Further, a total of $32.3
14
Table of Contents
million in principal 2018 Notes were exchanged for common stock and $45.8 thousand and $13.4
thousand of the original issuance discount and premium, respectively, were included in the
calculation of the gain/(loss) on extinguishment.
(h)
The estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes and our 2021 Notes is based on reported trading
prices as of June 30, 2016. Our ABL Facility and vehicle financings bear interest at rates
commensurate with market rates and therefore their respective carrying values approximate fair
value.
As discussed previously in Note 1, upon retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03, we have
presented the deferred financing costs associated with the 2018 Notes, 2021 Notes and Term
Loan in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability as
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In accordance with ASU 2015-15, the deferred
financing costs related to the ABL Facility continue to be presented as an asset, and are
included in "Other current assets" on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015. Additionally, as discussed in greater detail in the "Exchange
Offer" section below, on April 15, 2016, $327.2 million in principal 2018 Notes were exchanged
for new 2021 Notes. The note for note exchange was accounted for as a modification, and as a
result $0.8 million of the original deferred financing costs associated with the 2018 Notes will
continue to be amortized over the remaining term of the 2018 Notes, while $6.3 million will be
amortized over the term of the new 2021 Notes. Further, a total of $32.3 million in principal 2018
Notes were exchanged for common stock and $0.6 million of the original deferred financing
costs associated with the 2018 Notes were included in the calculation of the gain/(loss) on
extinguishment.
The debt discount for issuance of warrants represents the initial fair value of the warrants issued
in connection with the debt restructuring described in the "Exchange Offer" and "Term Loan"
sections below, which will be amortized through interest expense over the terms of the new
2021 Notes and the Term Loan. As described further in Note 9, these warrants are accounted for
as derivative liabilities.
As a result of the Eighth Amendment to our ABL Facility on June 29, 2016, which changed the
scheduled maturity date from January 15, 2018 to December 31, 2016, the carrying value of the
ABL Facility was reclassified to current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of June
30, 2016. In addition, the principal payments due within one year for the vehicle financings and
note payable are also classified as current.
(i)
(j)
(k)
(l)
The carrying value of the ABL Facility and the 2018 Notes were presented as current liabilities
as of December 31, 2015 due to the probability of breaching one of the financial covenants at
that date. In addition, the principal payments due within one year for the vehicle financings and
note payable were also classified as current.
For a discussion of material changes and developments in our debt and its principal terms, see
our discussion below regarding the "Exchange Offer," "Term Loan," and "ABL Facility
Amendments," in addition to the discussion in Note 18 on "Subsequent Events Related to
Restructuring - Rights Offering."
Indebtedness
Exchange Offer
On March 11, 2016, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with holders of more than
80% of the 2018 Notes relating to a debt restructuring and recapitalization plan (the
“Restructuring”), subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including shareholder
approval of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, and minimum noteholder participation. On April 15, 2016, we closed our exchange offer
(the “Exchange Offer”) relating to our 2018 Notes as part of the comprehensive restructuring of our
outstanding indebtedness pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement.
Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, we offered to exchange our 2021 Notes and shares of our
common stock at a conversion price per share of $0.32 (the “Conversion Price”) for any and all of
our 2018 Notes validly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or prior to the expiration date, with
the exception of approximately $31.4 million in principal 2018 Notes owned by an entity controlled
by Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We settled the
Exchange Offer on April 15, 2016 by delivering to tendering holders of the 2018 Notes (i) $327.2
million in aggregate principal amount of the new 2021 Notes to those tendering holders electing to
exchange for 2021 Notes and $0.9 million in shares of common stock converted at the Conversion
Price to those tendering holders electing to exchange for common stock and (ii) a pro rata share
(based on the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes validly tendered) of penny warrants
sufficient to purchase 10% of shares of our common stock (the "Exchange Warrants"). In addition,
$31.4 million in principal 2018 Notes held by an entity controlled by Mr. Johnsrud were canceled
upon closing of the Exchange Offer, and converted to shares of our common stock on May 26,
2016 at the Conversion Price, following shareholder approval at the May 20, 2016 Special
Meeting of Shareholders to approve an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of
15
Table of Contents
authorized shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 50 million to 350 million
(the "Johnsrud Note Conversion"). As a result of the exchange, a total of 101,071,875 shares of
common stock were issued, with 2,837,500 to tendering holders electing to exchange their 2018
Notes for common stock, and 98,234,375 for the Johnsrud Note Conversion.
The exchange of the $327.2 million in principal 2018 Notes for new 2021 Notes was accounted for
as a debt modification, and all third party expenses related to the exchange were expensed to
"General and administrative expenses" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for
the three months ended June 30, 2016. The exchange of the $0.9 million in principal 2018 Notes
for common stock was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, which generated an immaterial
loss on extinguishment recorded in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Finally, the
exchange of $31.4 million in principal 2018 Notes held by an entity controlled by Mr. Johnsrud for
common stock was accounted as a capital transaction as Mr. Johnsrud is a related party, with the
loss on extinguishment recorded in "Additional paid-in-capital" on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The Warrants issued in connection with the Exchange Offer
are discussed in further detail in Note 9 on "Derivative Warrants."
In connection with the issuance of the new 2021 Notes, we entered into a new Indenture that
governs the terms of the new 2021 Notes, dated as of April 15, 2016, between the Company,
Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee, and the Guarantors party thereto. Pursuant to
the new Indenture, the 2021 Notes will mature on April 15, 2021. Interest will be paid in kind semi-
annually by increasing the principal amount payable and due at maturity and/or in cash as follows:
interest payable on October 15, 2016 will be paid in kind at an annual rate of 12.5%; interest
payable after October 15, 2016 but on or before April 15, 2018 will be paid at a rate of 10% with
50% in kind and 50% in cash; interest payable after April 15, 2018 will be paid in cash at a rate of
10% until maturity. As a result, our annual cash interest payment obligations have been reduced
by approximately $17.8 million for the remainder of 2016, $17.9 million for 2017 and $8.6 million
through April 15, 2018. Interest on the 2021 Notes accrues from the most recent date interest has
been paid, or if no interest has been paid, from and including the issue date. The 2021 Notes are
secured by junior liens on the same collateral as our ABL Facility and rank equal in right of
payment to all senior indebtedness and senior to all subordinated indebtedness of the Company.
The 2021 Notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries.
Upon settlement of the Exchange Offer, there remained outstanding approximately $40.4
million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes. Ongoing semi-annual interest expense with
respect to the remaining 2018 Notes is approximately $2.0 million. In addition, based on the
completion of the Exchange Offer, consents from each exchanging holder of the 2018 Notes for
the waiver of certain provisions of the 2018 Notes Indenture became effective. The consents,
among other things, waive substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the 2018 Notes Indenture
and potential defaults arising from non-compliance with such waived covenants.
Term Loan
Concurrent to the Exchange Offer we entered into a $24.0 million Term Loan funded by certain
holders of the 2018 Notes that were also parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement. The
Term Loan accrues interest at a rate of 13% compounded monthly to be paid in kind by increasing
the principal amount payable thereunder. Principal including the paid in kind interest is due April
15, 2018. The Term Loan is subject to a minimum EBITDA covenant that is identical in all respects
to the minimum EBITDA covenant applicable to the ABL Facility. To the extent actual EBITDA (as
defined by the Term Loan) falls short of the minimum EBITDA targets, the Term Loan accrues
interest at rate of 17%. The Term Loan is secured by junior liens on the same collateral as our ABL
Facility and guaranteed by our subsidiaries. In connection with the Term Loan, we entered into a
warrant agreement with the lenders under the Term Loan, pursuant to which, as a commitment fee
for entering into the Term Loan, the lenders received warrants to purchase up to 5% of our then-
outstanding stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the "Term Loan Warrants").
The Exchange Warrants and the Term Loan Warrants (collectively, the "Warrants") contain anti-
dilution provisions which adjust the number of shares issuable upon exercise thereof in certain
circumstances, including adjustments intended to preserve the proportion of outstanding common
stock into which such Warrants are exercisable after giving effect to the Johnsrud Note
Conversion, and the Rights Offering. The Warrants are discussed in greater detail in Note 9 on
"Derivative Warrants" and the Rights Offering is discussed in Note 18 on "Subsequent Events
Related to Restructuring - Rights Offering."
Proceeds from the Term Loan were applied to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of
the ABL Facility and were reborrowed by us to fund the scheduled interest payment on the 2018
Notes and pay related transaction fees and expenses.
On June 30, 2016, we entered into a First Amendment to Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term
Loan Agreement Amendment”) by and among the Required Lenders (as defined therein) and the
Company, which amends the Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated
16
Table of Contents
as of April 15, 2016, by and among Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative
agent (the “Agent”), the lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”), and the Company, as borrower (the
“Term Loan Agreement”).
The Term Loan Agreement Amendment amends the Term Loan Agreement by amending the
minimum EBITDA financial maintenance covenant to conform to the revised minimum EBITDA
financial maintenance covenant provided by the Eighth Amendment to Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement (discussed below) through December 31, 2016, modifying the applicable
periods for measurement and reducing the applicable amounts required to be achieved for each
period. In connection with the Term Loan Agreement Amendment, we paid a non-refundable
amendment fee in the amount of $0.1 million to the Lenders, pro-rata to their respective
commitment amount under the Term Loan Agreement, which was capitalized as deferred
financing costs during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
ABL Facility Amendments
On March 10, 2016, we entered into a Consent and Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement (the “Fifth ABL Facility Amendment”) and a Third Amendment to Amended and
Restated Guaranty and Security Agreement (the "Third GSA Amendment") by and among Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association as agent ("Agent"), the Lenders named therein (the “Lenders”),
and the Company. Under the Fifth ABL Facility Amendment, the Lenders consented to the
inclusion of a “going concern” qualification in the opinion from our registered public accounting
firm, which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015. Under the Third GSA Amendment, we consented to and implemented a daily cash sweep of
our collection lockbox and depository accounts, the proceeds of which are required to be applied
against the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. The Third GSA Amendment also requires the
segregation of all receipts and disbursements in separate bank accounts and limits the end of day
balance in our operating bank account to an amount not to exceed $1.0 million.
On March 24, 2016, in connection with the Restructuring Support Agreement to implement the
Restructuring, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
(the “Sixth ABL Facility Amendment”) by and among the Agent, the Lenders and the Company.
Among other terms and conditions, the Sixth ABL Facility Amendment amended the ABL Facility
as follows:
•Reduced the maximum revolver commitments from $125.0 million to $100.0 million;
Replaced the leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant with a new minimum EBITDA
financial maintenance covenant that will be tested monthly;
•
Amended the definition of “EBITDA” for purposes of the financial maintenance covenant to
provide allowances for certain unusual or non-recurring fees, costs and expenses, with testing
monthly beginning in April 2016;
Amended the definition of “Borrowing Base” (i) to set the eligible equipment advance rates based
on net book value at 60% and on Net Orderly Liquidation Value (as defined in the ABL Facility) at
80% and (ii) to cap Borrowing Base availability attributable to eligible equipment at 75%;
Increased the default rate upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default from 2% to
4%;
Increased the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the
ABL Facility) and the unused line fee;
Eliminated our ability to voluntarily reduce the commitments without termination of the ABL
Facility;
Requires us to apply proceeds from the Restructuring transactions and related agreements to pay
down the ABL Facility;
Amended the definition of “Permitted Disposition” to permit the sale of our equity investment in
Underground Solutions, Inc., discussed further in Note 14, and to expand the permitted
disposition general basket (which excludes the sale of machinery and equipment in the ordinary
course of business) from $5.0 million to $7.5 million;
Applies a Permitted Disposition Reserve of 50% against our availability for net cash proceeds in
excess of $7.5 million made on or after March 10, 2016 for sales specifically related to the
Permitted Disposition general basket; and
Amended certain definitions in connection with the Restructuring transactions, including “Change
of Control”, “Permitted Indebtedness”, and “Permitted Liens”.

In addition, we agreed to certain make-whole fees that would be payable to the Lenders upon
early termination of the ABL Facility as a result of acceleration, bankruptcy or otherwise, unless
amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are paid in full. In connection with the Sixth ABL
Facility Amendment we incurred amendment fees of approximately $0.6 million which were
17
Table of Contents
capitalized as deferred financing costs during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Further, we
wrote off a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our ABL Facility of
approximately $0.4 million which are included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the
condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
On April 15, 2016, we entered into a Seventh Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated April 15, 2016 (the “Seventh ABL Facility Amendment”), by and among the
Agent, the Lenders and the Company to make conforming amendments in connection with the
Restructuring transactions. Among other terms and conditions, the Seventh Amendment amends
the ABL Facility to: (i) require that the we apply excess proceeds from asset sales to pay down the
ABL Facility; (ii) prohibit us from optionally prepaying or acquiring other indebtedness, making any
payment on subordinated indebtedness, or amending certain agreements and documents; and
(iii) amend certain definitions in the ABL Facility.
On June 29, 2016, we entered into an Eighth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement (the “Eighth ABL Facility Amendment”) by and among the Agent, the Lenders, and the
Company, which further amends our ABL Facility. Among other terms and conditions, the Eighth
ABL Facility Amendment amended the ABL Facility as follows:
•Reduced the maximum revolver commitments from $100.0 million to $85.0 million;
•
Amended the minimum EBITDA financial maintenance covenant, modifying the applicable
periods for measurement and reducing the applicable amounts required to be achieved for each
period;
•
Changed the scheduled maturity date of the ABL Facility from January 15, 2018 to December 31,
2016;
•
Added a covenant requiring us to refinance the ABL Facility in full on or before September 30,
2016;
•
Requires us to consummate a rights offering on or before July 29, 2016, which was subsequently
waived by the Lenders on August 5, 2016, and to apply the proceeds from the rights offering to
pay down the ABL Facility, which must equal $5.0 million (with any shortfall to be covered by the
$5.0 million backstop funds previously placed in escrow by Mark D. Johnsrud, the Company’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) - (see Note 18 for further updates and details on the
Rights Offering);
•
Replaced the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant with an immediate availability block
in the amount of $12.5 million, increasing to $15.0 million upon receipt of the Rights Offering
proceeds;
•
Establishes a Permitted Disposition Reserve equal to 50% of the aggregate amount of net cash
proceeds arising from Permitted Dispositions of any property (excluding the sale of machinery
and equipment in the ordinary course of business) consummated after June 29, 2016;
•
Increased the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate and Base Rate Loans (as defined in the ABL
Facility).
In connection with the Eighth ABL Facility Amendment we incurred amendment fees of
approximately $0.4 million which were capitalized as deferred financing costs during the three
months ended June 30, 2016. Further, we wrote off a portion of the unamortized deferred financing
costs associated with our ABL Facility of approximately $0.3 million which are included in "Loss
on extinguishment of debt" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three
months ended June 30, 2016.
Financial Covenants and Borrowing Limitations
The ABL Facility, as amended, requires, and any future credit facilities will likely require, us to
comply with specified financial ratios that may limit the amount we can borrow under our ABL
Facility. A breach of any of the covenants under the indenture governing the 2018 Notes and 2021
Notes (the “Indentures”), the ABL Facility, or the Term Loan, as applicable, could result in an event
of default. Our ability to satisfy those covenants depends principally upon our ability to meet or
exceed certain positive operating performance metrics including, but not limited to, earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and ratios thereof, as well as
certain balance sheet ratios. Any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further limit our
ability to enter into certain types of transactions.
The ABL Facility and Term Loan contain certain financial covenants, including a minimum
EBITDA covenant. The minimum EBITDA covenant requires us to meet a stated year-to-date
EBITDA target (as defined by the ABL Facility). As of June 30, 2016, we remained in compliance
with our debt covenants and availability under the ABL Facility was $12.6 million, after applying
the availability block and other availability restrictions.

Table of Contents
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Agent for the ABL Facility commenced a
borrowing base redetermination involving a valuation of the net orderly liquidation value of our
eligible machinery and equipment by a third party specialist. The redetermination resulted in an
approximately $21.0 million decline in our borrowing base and availability under the ABL Facility.
Due to this decrease in our borrowing base and the implementation of the daily sweep of our
lockbox and certain depository bank accounts, we made cumulative payments of $130.7 million
during the six months ended June 30, 2016, offset by borrowings of $77.0 million, thus reducing
the amount outstanding under the ABL Facility from $101.8 million as of December 31, 2015 to
$48.1 million as of June 30, 2016.
The ABL Facility's borrowing base limitations are based upon eligible accounts receivable and
equipment. If the value of our eligible accounts receivable or equipment decreases for any reason,
or if some portion of our accounts receivable or equipment is deemed ineligible under the terms of
our ABL Facility, the amount we can borrow under the ABL Facility could be reduced. These
limitations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. In
addition, the Agent for our ABL Facility has the periodic right to commission appraisals of the
assets comprising our borrowing base, and we are obligated to reimburse the cost of up to four full
appraisals including two field examinations, during any 12 consecutive months. If an appraisal
results in a reduction of the borrowing base, we may be required to repay a portion of the amount
outstanding under the ABL Facility in order to remain in compliance with applicable borrowing
limitations. At June 30, 2016 we had $12.6 million of net availability under the ABL Facility. During
the remainder of 2016, we expect further deterioration to our ABL borrowing base due to declining
accounts receivable and downward pressure on the orderly liquidation values of our machinery
and equipment. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we reduced the outstanding balance
of the ABL Facility by $53.7 million, a portion of which was made to cover the borrowing base
deterioration. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash on hand or other
sources of liquidity to make any such future repayments if necessary.
The Indentures contain restrictive covenants on the incurrence of senior secured indebtedness. To
the extent that the fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Indentures) is below 2.0 to 1.0, the
Indentures prohibit our incurrence of new senior secured indebtedness under the ABL Facility or
any other secured credit facility, at that point in time, to the greater of $150.0 million and the
amount of debt as restricted by the secured leverage ratio, which is the ratio of secured debt to
EBITDA, of 2.0 to 1.0, as determined pursuant to the Indentures. The 2.0 to 1.0 fixed charge
coverage ratio and secured leverage ratio are incurrence covenants, not maintenance covenants.
The covenants do not require repayment of existing borrowings incurred previously in accordance
with the covenants, but rather limits new borrowings during any such period. As a result of the
Eighth ABL Facility Amendment, our ability to incur new borrowings under the ABL Facility is
limited to a maximum of $85.0 million irrespective of the permitted availability of up to $150.0
million under the Indentures.
The covenants described above are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The
continued effect of low oil and natural gas prices will negatively impact our compliance with our
covenants, and we cannot guarantee that we will satisfy those requirements. If we do not obtain a
long term waiver for any breached covenants, such breach would result in a default under the
Indentures, ABL Facility or other debt obligations, or any future credit facilities we may enter into,
which could allow all amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared immediately due and
payable, subject to the terms and conditions of the documents governing such indebtedness. If we
were unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our secured lenders could proceed against the
collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. This would likely in turn trigger cross
acceleration and cross-default rights under any other credit facilities and indentures. If the amounts
outstanding under the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes, or any other indebtedness outstanding at such
time, were to be accelerated or were the subject of foreclosure actions, we cannot guarantee that
our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt
holders. We cannot guarantee that we will be granted waivers or amendments to the Indentures
governing the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes, the ABL Facility, or such other debt obligations if for
any reason we are unable to comply with our obligations thereunder. Any such limitations on
borrowing under our ABL Facility could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. Failure to
comply with any of our debt obligations, or obtain waivers thereof, may cause us to seek relief
under the United States Bankruptcy Code.
ABL Facility Refinancing Covenant and Maturity Date
Our ABL Facility contains a covenant requiring us to refinance the ABL Facility in full on or before
September 30, 2016 and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to refinance the ABL Facility by September 30, 2016, or that any such
refinancing would be available to us on attractive or acceptable terms. Any refinancing of the ABL
Facility could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we fail to comply with our
refinancing covenant, we would request a waiver from the Lenders or may be required to repay the
outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. Failure to obtain a waiver or cure the default through
repayment of the facility would create an event of cross default under our other credit facilities and
indentures, including the Term Loan and the Indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2021
Notes. There can be no assurance that the Lenders under the ABL Facility will grant a waiver of
the covenant default or that the lenders under the Term Loan will grant a waiver of, or that the
holders of our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes will consent to, any cross default, and we currently do
not have
19
Table of Contents
sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility or
our other indebtedness. In the event that we are unable to timely refinance the ABL Facility, or
obtain a waiver thereof, or repay the ABL Facility when due, we may need to seek relief under the
United States Bankruptcy Code.
Number of Warrants
Note 9 - Derivative Warrants
On April 15, 2016, we closed our Exchange Offer relating to our 2018 Notes as part of the
Restructuring, which included delivering to tendering holders of the 2018 Notes a pro rata share of
penny warrants sufficient to purchase 10% of shares of our common stock (the "Exchange
Warrants"). Additionally, we entered into a warrant agreement with the lenders under the new
$24.0 million Term Loan, pursuant to which, as a commitment fee for entering into the Term Loan,
the lenders received warrants to purchase up to 5% of our then-outstanding stock at an exercise
price of $0.01 per share (the "Term Loan Warrants"). The Exchange Warrants and the Term Loan
Warrants (collectively, the "Warrants") contain anti-dilution provisions which adjust the number of
shares issuable upon exercise thereof in certain circumstances, including adjustments intended to
preserve the proportion of outstanding common stock into which such Warrants are exercisable
after giving effect to the Johnsrud Note Conversion and the Rights Offering, which is described in
Note 18 on "Subsequent Events Related to Restructuring - Rights Offering."
After giving effect to the anti-dilution adjustment following the Johnsrud Note Conversion, a total of
22.8 million Warrants were issued during the three months ended June 30, 2016, with 15.1 million
Warrants for the exchange of 2018 Notes for new 2021 Notes, 0.1 million Warrants for the
exchange of 2018 Notes for common stock, and 7.6 million Warrants for the Term Loan lenders.
All Warrants were issued with an exercise price of $0.01 and have a term of ten years.
The following table shows the Warrant activity for the three months ended June 30, 2016:
 
Outstanding as of March 31, 2016 —
Issued
Exercised
Outstanding as of June 30, 2016  22,796
We accounted for Warrants in accordance with the accounting guidance for derivatives, which sets
forth a two-step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument is indexed to an
entity's own stock which would qualify such financial instruments for a scope exception. This
scope exception specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative
financial instrument would not be considered as such if the contract is both (i) indexed to the
entity's own stock and (ii) classified in the shareholders' equity section of the entity's balance
sheet. We determined that the Warrants were ineligible for equity classification due to the anti-
dilution provisions set forth therein and describe above. As such, the Warrants have been
recorded as derivative liabilities at fair value on the "Derivative warrant liability" line in the
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The Warrants are classified as a
current liability in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as they can be exercised by the
holders at any time.
As discussed previously in Note 6, the fair value of the derivative warrant liability was estimated
using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of issue and is re-measured at each quarter end
until expiration or exercise of the underlying warrants with the resulting fair value adjustment
recored in "Other income, net" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.
The fair value of the derivative warrant liability was estimated using the following model inputs:

Note 10 - Restructuring and Exit Costs
In March 2015, we initiated a plan to restructure our business in certain shale basins and reduce
costs, including an exit from the Mississippian ("MidCon") shale area and the Tuscaloosa Marine
Shale logistics business. Additionally, we closed certain yards within the Northeast and Southern
divisions and transferred many of the related assets to our other operating locations, primarily in
the Eagle Ford shale basin. The total costs of the restructuring recognized in 2015 were
approximately $7.1 million, and included severance and termination benefits, lease exit costs,
other exits costs related to the movement of vehicles and rental fleet, and an asset impairment
charge.
There were no restructuring costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016. We
recorded $0.4 million and $1.1 million in restructuring costs during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2015, which were included in "Other, net" in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statements of operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, approximately $0.6 million,
$0.1 million and $0.4 million of the total charge was recorded in the Southern, Northeast and
Corporate/Other operating segments, respectively.
The remaining liability for the restructuring and exit costs incurred represents lease exit costs
under non-cancellable operating leases and totaled approximately $0.2 million as of June 30,
2016, which is included in "Accrued liabilities" in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. A
rollforward of the liability from December 31, 2015 through June 30, 2016 is as follows:

The following table shows the components of the income tax benefit for the periods indicated:
 
 
 
Current income tax (expense) benefit$ (750
Deferred income tax expense
Total income tax (expense) benefit $ (773
The effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was 1.9% and
1.2%, which differs from the federal statutory benefit rate of 35.0%. The difference is primarily due
to permanent differences, including income from the cancellation of debt which generated a cash
tax liability under the alternative minimum tax ("AMT") provisions. Under the AMT provisions, the
use of net operating losses ("NOLs") is limited to 90% of a taxpayer's AMT income, thus
generating tax on the remaining income. Once we use our NOLs and are paying regular tax, we
will receive a credit for the AMT tax paid. The AMT liability as of June 30, 2016 was $0.8 million
and is included with accrued taxes in the "Accrued liabilities" line on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet.
The effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 was less than
0.1%, which differs from the federal statutory rate of 35.0% primarily due to the increase in the
valuation allowance on deferred tax assets resulting from current year losses.
We have significant deferred tax assets, consisting primarily of NOLs, which have a limited life,
generally expiring between the years 2029 and 2036 and capital losses, which have a five year
carryforward expiring in 2020. We regularly assess the available positive and negative evidence
to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax
assets. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative losses
incurred this year and in recent years. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other
subjective evidence such as our projections for future taxable income.
In light of our continued ordinary losses, at June 30, 2016 we determined that our deferred tax
liabilities were not sufficient to fully realize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a valuation
allowance continues to be required against the portion of our
21
Table of Contents
deferred tax assets that is not offset by deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, we expect our effective
income tax rate to be near zero for 2016.

These laws, rules and regulations address environmental, health and safety and related concerns,
including water quality and employee safety. We have installed safety, monitoring and
environmental protection equipment such as pressure sensors and relief valves, and have
established reporting and responsibility protocols for environmental protection and reporting to
such relevant local environmental protection departments as required by law.
We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental protection laws and
regulations in the United States and the states in which we operate. We believe that there are no
unrecorded liabilities as of the periods reported herein in connection with our compliance with
applicable environmental laws and regulations. The condensed consolidated balance sheets at
June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included accruals totaling $0.5 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, for various environmental matters.
Litigation
There are various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or
asserted against us, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect
to securities and shareholder class actions, personal injury,
22
Table of Contents
vehicular and industrial accidents, commercial contracts, legal and regulatory compliance,
securities disclosure, labor and employment, and employee benefits and environmental matters,
the more significant of which are summarized below. We record a provision for these matters when
it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. Any provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impact
and status of settlements, rulings, advice of counsel and other information and events pertinent to
a particular matter.
We believe that we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Based
on our experience, we also believe that the damage amounts claimed in the lawsuits disclosed
below are not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our potential liability. Litigation is inherently
unpredictable, and it is possible that our results of operations or cash flow could be materially
affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of the legal matters pending
against us. We do not expect that the outcome of other current claims and legal actions not
discussed below will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.
AWS Arbitration Demand
On April 28, 2015, the holder of the non-controlling interest in AWS issued to us a Demand for
Arbitration pursuant to the terms of the AWS operating agreement, relating to alleged breaches by
us of certain of our obligations under the operating agreement. We entered into a settlement of this
matter with the non-controlling interest holder in June 2015 whereby we purchased the remaining
interest in AWS for $4.0 million in cash and a $7.4 million note payable with principal and interest
due in equal quarterly installments through April 2019. If we fail to meet the payment terms of this
obligation, or if we become insolvent or declare bankruptcy, all remaining outstanding balances on
the note payable would become immediately due and payable.  If such an acceleration were to
occur, we would request a waiver from the non-controlling interest holder, but there can be no
assurance that such waiver would be forthcoming or that we would have sufficient available
liquidity to make any required repayment.
Note 14 - Related Party and Affiliated Company Transactions
Termination of Aircraft Lease Agreement
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the aircraft lease agreement with an entity owned
and controlled by Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of
directors, was terminated. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, reimbursements
payable to the entity in exchange for use of the aircraft, in the aggregate amount of $45 thousand,
were paid in full. There were no remaining reimbursements payable to the entity as of March 31,
2016.
There have been no significant changes to the other related party transactions with Mr. Johnsrud
for apartment rentals, purchases of fresh water for resale and use of land where certain of our
saltwater disposal wells are situated as described in Note 19 to the consolidated financial
statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cost Method Investment - Underground Solutions, Inc.
On February 18, 2016, Aegion Corporation (or "Aegion") announced the completion of the
acquisition of Underground Solutions, Inc. (or "UGSI"), an entity in which we held an approximate
7% equity interest, whereby Aegion paid approximately $85.0 million to acquire UGSI. Our total
proceeds will be approximately $5.2 million. In April of 2016, we received proceeds of $5.0 million,
which exceeded our cost basis of approximately $3.2 million. As such during the three months
ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a net gain on the sale of approximately $1.7 million,
including approximately $0.1 million in costs incurred by us in the closing. The remaining $0.2
million of proceeds are pending the review of final closing working capital adjustments. We expect
to receive these funds in several installments through August 2017, which would increase our net
gain on sale by approximately $0.2 million.
Note 15 - Segments
We evaluate business segment performance based on income (loss) before income taxes
exclusive of corporate general and administrative costs and interest expense, which are not
allocated to the segments. Our shale solutions business is comprised of three operating divisions,
which we consider to be operating and reportable segments of our continuing operations: (1) the
Northeast division comprising the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas, (2) the Southern division
comprising the Haynesville, Eagle Ford, and Permian Basin Shale areas and (3) the Rocky
Mountain division comprising the Bakken Shale area. Corporate/Other includes certain corporate
costs and certain other corporate assets.
As discussed in Note 10, in March 2015, we initiated a plan to restructure our business in certain
shale basins and reduce costs, including an exit from the Mississippian (or "MidCon") shale area.
As a result, revenues and costs associated with revenue generating activities of the MidCon shale
area were included in the Southern division for the three months ended March 31, 2015, with
minimal or no revenue activity thereafter. As a result of our restructuring in the MidCon, some
remaining operating

expenses for shut-down activities, as well as depreciation and amortization, were included in the
Southern division during the three months ended June 30, 2015, and the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016.
Financial information for our reportable segments related to continuing operations is presented
below.

Note 16 - Discontinued Operations
Our former industrial solutions operating and reportable segment, Thermo Fluids, Inc. ("TFI"), has
been classified as discontinued operations since the sale process with various prospective
acquirers began in fourth quarter of 2013.
On April 11, 2015, we completed the TFI disposition with Safety-Kleen, Inc. ("Safety-Kleen"), a
subsidiary of Clean Harbors, Inc., whereby Safety-Kleen acquired TFI for $85.0 million in an all-
cash transaction, subject to working capital adjustments. Pursuant to the purchase agreement,
$4.3 million of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account to satisfy our
indemnification obligations under the purchase agreement. Any remaining balance in the escrow
account after indemnifications and completing the post-closing working capital reconciliation will
be released to us 18 months following the closing date, unless both parties mutually agree to
release the remaining balance prior to such date. The $4.3 million was reported as "Restricted
cash" in our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.
The post-closing working capital reconciliation was completed during the three months ended
June 30, 2016, and as a result we recorded an additional loss on the sale of TFI of $1.3 million,
bringing the total loss on sale to $1.5 million. A total of $3.8 million was released from escrow, of
which $2.5 million was returned to us and $1.3 million was paid to Safety-Kleen for the post-
closing adjustment and certain indemnification claims. As of June 30, 2016, $0.4 million remained
in escrow to satisfy indemnification obligations and is expected to be released to us during the
three months ended December 31, 2016, if there are no further indemnification claims.
We recorded losses related to the sale of TFI of $1.3 million and $2.1 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2015, respectively, and $1.2 million and $1.2 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016, and June 30, 2015, respectively, as a component of "Loss from
discontinued operations, net of income taxes" in our condensed consolidated statements of
operations.
The following table provides selected financial information of discontinued operations related to
TFI (and includes TFI's results through the sale on April 11, 2015):

Note 17 - Subsidiary Guarantors
Our obligations under the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes are jointly and severally, fully and
unconditionally guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the Indenture,
the guarantees are full and unconditional, but are subject to release under the following
circumstances:

in connection with any sale, disposition or transfer of all of the capital stock of that subsidiary
guarantor to a person that is not the Company or a subsidiary guarantor;
if we designate any restricted subsidiary that is a subsidiary guarantor to be an unrestricted
subsidiary; or
•upon legal defeasance or the discharge of our obligations under the Indenture.
•
Although the guarantees are subject to release under the above described circumstances, we
have concluded they are still deemed full and unconditional for purposes of Rule 3-10 of
Regulation S-X because these circumstances are customary, and accordingly, we concluded that
we may rely on Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X, as the other requirements of Rule 3-10 have been
met.

Table of Contents
The following tables present consolidating financial information for Nuverra Environmental
Solutions, Inc. (“Parent”) and its 100% wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”)
as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015. During the three months ended December 31, 2015, Nuverra Rocky Mountain
Pipeline, LLC (or "RMP") was released from all obligations including as guarantor for our debt
obligations. However, because RMP's individual results are not material as there are no active
contracts for new pipelines, we have not separately presented RMP as a Non-Guarantor, but
rather continued to include RMP in the Guarantor Subsidiaries column. These condensed
consolidating financial statements have been prepared from our financial information on the same
basis of accounting as our condensed consolidated financial statements. The principal elimination
entries relate to investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions.

Rights Offering
As part of the Restructuring, we plan to pursue an equity rights offering (the “Rights Offering”) in
the second half of 2016, in which all holders of our common stock will be granted the right to
participate. Each shareholder who participates in the Rights Offering will have the right to
subscribe for a pro-rata share of $5.0 million of common stock exercisable at a 20% discount to the
Conversion Price (or $0.256). Mr. Johnsrud has agreed to backstop the Rights Offering by
committing to purchase rights that are not exercised by other shareholders in order to ensure that
the Company receives the additional liquidity, in exchange for a backstop fee of 5% payable in the
form of additional common stock issued at $0.32 per share. On April 15, 2016, the Company and
Mr. Johnsrud entered into an Escrow Agreement, pursuant to which Mr. Johnsrud deposited $5.0
million for the purpose of securing Mr. Johnsrud’s backstop obligations under the Rights Offering.
The $5.0 million in escrow is included in "Restricted cash" with a corresponding liability recorded
in "Accrued liabilities" on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
On July 29, 2016, the Company and Mr. Johnsrud entered into an amendment to the Escrow
Agreement, pursuant to which the Company and Mr. Johnsrud agreed to an irrevocable early
release of the $5.0 million in escrow securing the backstop obligation, which was used to pay
down the ABL Facility. In exchange for the release of the $5.0 million, we deposited into an
escrow account 20,312,500 shares of our common stock, which represents shares underlying the
subscription rights to be distributed in the Rights Offering and the shares to be provided to Mr.
Johnsrud for the backstop fee. The shares in the escrow account will be released to Mr. Johnsrud
upon the consummation of the Rights Offering or the occurrence of other specified events,
including failure to consummate the Rights Offering. Upon consummation of the Rights Offering,
the shares of common
31
Table of Contents
stock released to Mr. Johnsrud from escrow will be reduced by the aggregate number of shares
subscribed for in the Rights Offering and the corresponding number of shares of common stock
underlying the backstop fee payable to Mr. Johnsrud. Any shares not distributed from escrow to
Mr. Johnsrud will be returned to the Company. In addition, Mr. Johnsrud will receive the aggregate
amount of gross proceeds raised, if any, from subscribing shareholders in the Rights Offering to
offset the early release of his backstop obligation from escrow. The Escrow Shares will be
deemed voted for and against any matters submitted to our shareholders in the same proportion as
the vote of the common stock of the Company on any such matter.
ABL Facility Amendment
On August 5, 2016, we entered into a Ninth Amendment (the "Ninth Amendment") to the ABL
Facility by and among the Agent, the Lenders, and the Company. The Ninth Amendment amended
the ABL Facility by removing the requirement to consummate the Rights Offering by a date certain,
and required us to remit to Agent by August 5, 2016 the $5.0 million deposited into escrow by Mr.
Johnsrud. In connection with the amendment to the Escrow Agreement discussed above, the $5.0
million backstop obligation was released from escrow and irrevocably funded to us and we timely
remitted such funds to the Agent in order to comply with the Ninth Amendment.

Item 2.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Special Note about Forward-Looking Statements
This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
should be read in conjunction with the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes thereto. See “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 3 of
this Quarterly Report and “Risk Factors” included herein on page 48 and in our filings with the
SEC for a description of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected
results.
Company Overview
Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. (“Nuverra,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is among the
largest companies in the United States dedicated to providing comprehensive, full-cycle
environmental solutions to customers focused on the development and ongoing production of oil
and natural gas from shale formations. Nuverra’s strategy is to provide one-stop, total
environmental solutions, including delivery, collection, treatment, recycling, and disposal of water,
wastewater, waste fluids, hydrocarbons, and restricted solids that are part of the drilling,
completion, and ongoing production of shale oil and natural gas.
We operate in shale basins where customer exploration and production (“E&P”) activities are
predominantly focused on shale oil and natural gas as follows:
• Oil shale areas: includes our operations in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Permian Basin Shale
areas.
• Natural gas shale areas: includes our operations in the Marcellus, Utica and Haynesville Shale
areas.
Nuverra supports its customers’ demand for diverse, comprehensive and regulatory compliant
environmental solutions required for the safe and efficient drilling, completion and production of oil
and natural gas from shale formations. Current services, as well as prospective services in which
Nuverra has made investments, include (i) fluid logistics via water procurement, delivery,
collection, storage, treatment, recycling and disposal, (ii) solid drilling waste collection, treatment,
recycling and disposal, (iii) permanent and portable pipeline facilities, water infrastructure services
and equipment rental services, and (iv) other ancillary services for E&P companies focused on the
extraction of oil and natural gas resources.
To meet our customers’ environmental needs, Nuverra utilizes a broad array of assets to provide
comprehensive environmental solutions. Our logistics assets include trucks and trailers, temporary
and permanent pipelines, temporary and permanent storage facilities, ancillary rental equipment,
treatment facilities, and liquid and solid waste disposal sites. We continue to expand our suite of
solutions to customers who demand environmental compliance and accountability from their
service providers.
As a result of our historical acquisition activity to expand our presence in existing shale basins,
access new markets and to expand the breadth and scope of services we provide, we have
accumulated a large level of indebtedness. Due to the continued decline in oil and natural gas
prices, and the resulting decrease in drilling and completion activities, there is less demand for our
services. The decrease in demand for our services, which we expect to continue throughout the
second half of 2016, impacts our overall liquidity and our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet
our debt obligations and operating needs. Additionally, if the decrease in demand for our services
continues for a prolonged period of time, or if we make downward adjustments to our projections,
our actual cash flows could be less than our estimated cash flows, which could result in future
impairment charges for long-lived assets.
In response to our financial results and concerns about long-term liquidity, we have executed a
restructuring of our indebtedness, intended to improve liquidity, defer cash interest expense, and
preserve value for holders of our common stock. See Note 8 and Note 18 of the Notes to the
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our restructuring
transactions.
Trends Affecting Our Operating Results
Our results are driven by demand for our services, which are in turn affected by E&P spending
trends in the shale areas in which we operate, in particular the level of drilling activity (which
impacts the amount of environmental waste products being managed) and active wells (which
impacts the amount of produced water being managed). In general, drilling activity in the oil and
natural gas industry is affected by the market prices (or anticipated prices) for those commodities.
Persistent low natural gas prices over the past several years have resulted in dramatically reduced
drilling activity in “dry” gas shale areas such as the Haynesville and Marcellus Shale areas where
natural gas is the predominant natural resource. In addition, the low natural gas prices have in the
past caused many natural gas producers to curtail capital budgets and these cuts in spending
curtailed drilling
33
Table of Contents
programs, as well as discretionary spending on well services in certain shale areas, and
accordingly reduced demand for our services in these areas. The oil and "wet" gas basins such as
the Eagle Ford, Permian Basin, Utica and Bakken shale areas experienced a dramatic decline in
oil prices that began in the fourth quarter of 2014, which substantially reduced drilling and
completion activity in these areas since that time. We continued to see decreased activity levels in
the six months ended June 30, 2016, and anticipate that the decrease in demand for our services
will continue throughout the remainder of 2016.
Our results are also driven by a number of other factors, including (i) our available inventory of
equipment, which we have built through acquisitions and capital expenditures over the past
several years, (ii) transportation costs, which are affected by fuel costs, (iii) utilization rates for our
equipment, which are also affected by the level of our customers’ drilling and production activities
and competition, and our ability to relocate our equipment to areas in which oil and natural gas
exploration and production activities are growing, (iv) the availability of qualified drivers (or
alternatively, subcontractors) in the areas in which we operate, particularly in the Bakken and
Marcellus/Utica Shale areas, (v) labor costs, which have been generally increasing through the
periods discussed due to tight labor market conditions and increased government regulation,
including the Affordable Care Act, (vi) developments in governmental regulations, (vii) seasonality
and weather events and (viii) our health, safety and environmental performance record.

Non-Rental Revenue
Non-rental revenue consists of fees charged to customers for the sale and transportation of fresh
water and saltwater by our fleet of logistics assets, and/or through water midstream assets owned
by us, to customer sites for use in drilling and completion activities and from customer sites to
remove and dispose of flowback and produced water originating from oil and natural gas wells.
Non-rental revenue also includes fees for solids management services. Non-rental revenue for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 was $31.4 million, down $54.2 million, or 63.3%, from $85.5
million in the prior year period. Lower drilling and completion activities in all divisions, as well as
pricing pressures, led to lower non-rental revenue as compared to the same period in the prior
year. The primary driver of the decreased demand was a 53% decline in average operating oil rigs
from those operating in the same period in the prior year.
Rental Revenue
Rental revenue consists of fees charged to customers over the term of the rental for use of
equipment owned by us, as well as other fees charged to customers for items such as delivery and
pickup. Rental revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.6 million, down $4.3

million, or 62.2%, from $6.9 million in the prior year period. The decrease was the result of lower
utilization of our equipment rental fleet in conjunction with the reduction in drilling and completion
activities due to depressed oil prices.
Direct Operating Expenses
Direct operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $41.3 million to
$30.3 million compared to the prior year period. The decrease in direct operating expenses is
attributable to lower revenues as a result of decreased activities,
35
Table of Contents
as well as our continued focus on our cost-management initiatives implemented during 2015.
Additionally, direct operating expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2015 included a loss on the sale of assets of $1.8 million and a gain on the sale of assets
of $0.7 million, respectively.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to
$14.2 million, an increase of $4.5 million from $9.7 million in the prior year period. The increase is
primarily driven by legal and professional fees of $8.4 million incurred in connection with the
restructuring of our indebtedness, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit expenses as
a result of headcount reductions in response to the decrease in drilling and completion activities.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $15.2 million, down
$3.1 million, or 16.9%, from $18.3 million in the prior year period. The decrease is primarily
attributable to a lower depreciable asset base as we have reduced capital spending and sold
underutilized or non-core assets as a result of lower oil prices and decreased activities by our
customers.
Impairment of long-lived assets
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets
located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, including trucks, tanks, and a parcel of land.
These assets qualified to be classified as assets-held-for-sale and as a result the assets were
recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell, resulting in a long-lived
asset impairment charge of $2.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. There were no
impairment charges for long-lived assets recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Other, net
We recorded charges of approximately $0.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 related
to our plan to restructure our business in certain shale basins and reduce costs, including an exit
from the Mississippian (or "MidCon") shale area and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale logistics
business. There were no similar costs incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net during the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $14.0 million, up $1.5
million or 12.2% from $12.5 million in the prior year period. The increase in interest expense
compared to the prior year period is primarily attributable to the restructuring of our indebtedness
during the three months ended June 30, 2016. As part of this plan, a portion of our 2018 Notes
were exchanged for new 2021 Notes whereby the interest due on October 15, 2016 is payable in
kind at an annual rate of 12.5%. Additionally, we entered into a new $24.0 million Term Loan with
interest payable in kind at 13% compounded monthly. (See Note 8 and 18 in the Notes the
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details and discussions surrounding our
debt restructuring.)
Other Income, net
Other income, net was $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $0.4
million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to the gain on the sale of
Underground Solutions, Inc. ("UGSI") of $1.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016
(see Note 14 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, we
recorded a $1.0 million gain associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant
liability. In connection with our debt restructuring, during the three months ended June 30, 2016
we issued warrants with derivative features. These instruments are accounted for as derivative
liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in "Other income, net."
(See Note 6, Note 8, and Note 9 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for further details on the warrants.)
Loss on extinguishment of debt
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we amended our ABL Facility which reduced the
maximum revolver commitment from $100.0 million to $85.0 million and changed the scheduled
maturity date to December 31, 2016. As a result of the decrease in the borrowing capacity, we
wrote off a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our ABL Facility of
approximately $0.3 million. (See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - ABL Facility Amendments"
later in this section for further discussion on the amendment.)
36
Table of Contents
Income Taxes
Income tax expense was $0.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to
$15.0 thousand in the prior year period. The primary item impacting income taxes for the three-
month period ended June 30, 2016 was the permanent differences, which includes income from
the cancellation of debt which generated a cash tax liability under the alternative minimum tax
("AMT") provisions. Under the AMT provisions, the use of net operating losses ("NOLs") is limited
to 90% of a taxpayer's AMT income, thus generating tax on the remaining income. Once use our
NOLs and are paying regular tax, we will receive a credit for the AMT tax paid.
We have significant deferred tax assets, consisting primarily of net operating losses (“NOLs”),
which have a limited life, generally expiring between the years 2029 and 2036 and capital losses,
which have a five year carryforward expiring in 2020. Management regularly assesses the
available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be
generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. A significant piece of objective negative
evidence evaluated was the cumulative losses incurred this quarter and in recent years. Such
objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as our projections
for future taxable income.
In light of our continued ordinary losses, at June 30, 2016 we determined that our deferred tax
liabilities were not sufficient to fully realize our deferred tax assets. Accordingly, a valuation
allowance continues to be required against the portion of our deferred tax assets that is not offset
by deferred tax liabilities. Accordingly, we expect our effective income tax rate to be near zero for
2016.

Non-Rental Revenue
Non-rental revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $75.4 million, down $117.1
million, or 60.8% from $192.5 million in the prior year period. Lower drilling and completion
activities in all divisions, as well as pricing pressures, led to lower non-rental revenue as
compared to the same period in the prior year. The primary driver of the decreased demand was a
58% decline in average operating oil rigs from those operating in the same period in the prior year.
Rental Revenue
Rental revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $5.6 million, down $13.4 million, or
70.7%, from $19.0 million in the prior year period. Similar to the three month comparative periods,
the decrease was the result of lower utilization of our equipment rental fleet, in conjunction with the
reduction in drilling and completion activities due to depressed oil prices.
Direct Operating Expenses
Direct operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $68.9 million, compared
to $159.6 million in the prior year period. The decrease in direct operating expenses is attributable
to lower revenues as a result of decreased activities, as well as our continued focus on our cost-
management initiatives implemented during 2015. Additionally, direct operating expenses during
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 included a loss on the sale of assets of
$0.7 million and a gain on the sale of assets of $1.3 million, respectively.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 amounted to $21.7
million, down $0.7 million from $22.4 million in the prior year period. The decrease in general and
administrative expenses during the six months ended June 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to
lower compensation and benefit expenses as a result of headcount reductions in response to the
decrease in drilling and completion activities, offset by $8.4 million in legal and professional fees
incurred in connection with the restructuring of our indebtedness.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $31.1 million, down
approximately $4.7 million from $35.8 million in the prior year period. The decrease is primarily
attributable to a lower depreciable asset base as we have reduced capital spending and sold
underutilized or non-core assets as a result of lower oil prices and decreased activities by our
customers.
Impairment of long-lived assets
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, management approved plans to sell certain assets
located in both the Northeast and Southern divisions, including trucks, tanks, and a parcel of land.
These assets qualified to be classified as assets-held-for-sale and as a result the assets were
recorded at the lower of net book value or fair value less costs to sell, resulting in a long-lived
asset impairment charge of $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. There were no
impairment charges for long-lived assets recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Other, net
We recorded charges of approximately $1.1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 related
to our plan to restructure our business in certain shale basins and reduce costs, including an exit
from the MidCon shale area and the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale logistics business. There were no
similar costs incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Interest Expense, net
Interest expense, net during the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $26.0 million, or $1.0 million
higher than the $25.0 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily due to the
restructuring of our indebtedness during the three months ended June 30, 2016. As part of this
plan, a portion of our 2018 Notes were exchanged for new 2021 Notes whereby the interest due
on October 15, 2016 is payable in kind at an annual rate of 12.5%. Additionally, we entered into a
new $24.0 million Term Loan with interest payable in kind at 13% compounded monthly. (See
Note 8 and 18 in the Notes the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details
and discussions surrounding our debt restructuring.)
Other Income, net
Other income, net was $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, up $2.2 million
compared to $0.7 million in the prior year period. The increase is primarily attributable to the gain
on the sale of UGSI of $1.7 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016 (see Note 14 in
the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements). Additionally, we
38
Table of Contents
recorded a $1.0 million gain associated with the change in fair value of the derivative warrant
liability. In connection with our debt restructuring, during the three months ended June 30, 2016
we issued warrants with derivative features. These instruments are accounted for as derivative
liabilities with any decrease or increase in the estimated fair value recorded in "Other income, net."
(See Note 6, Note 8, and Note 9 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for further details on the warrants.)
Loss on Extinguishment of Debt
Loss on extinguishment of debt was $0.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $1.0 million in the prior year period. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we
executed two amendments to our ABL Facility, and as a result, we collectively wrote off $0.7
million million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the ABL Facility. See
"Liquidity and Capital Resources - ABL Facility Amendments" later in this section for further
discussion on the amendments. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, in connection with
the closing of the Thermo Fluids, Inc (or "TFI") disposition in April 2015, we amended our ABL
Facility and wrote off a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the
ABL Facility of $1.0 million.
Income Taxes
The income tax expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.8 million compared to a
benefit of $9.0 thousand in the prior year period. The primary items impacting income taxes for the
six month period ended June 30, 2016 were permanent differences, which includes income from
the cancellation of debt which generated a cash tax liability under the alternative minimum tax
("AMT") provisions. Under the AMT provisions, the use of net operating losses ("NOLs") is limited
to 90% of a taxpayer's AMT income, thus generating tax on the remaining income. Once use our
NOLs and are paying regular tax, we will receive a credit for the AMT tax paid.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash Flows and Liquidity
Our primary source of capital is from borrowings available under our ABL Facility, with additional
sources of capital in prior years from debt and equity accessed through the capital markets. Our
historical acquisition activity was highly capital intensive and required significant investments in
order to expand our presence in existing shale basins, access new markets and to expand the
breadth and scope of services we provide. Additionally, we have historically issued equity as
consideration in acquisition transactions. Our sources of capital for 2016 have included cash
generated by our operations, restructuring transactions, asset sales and borrowings under our
ABL Facility to the extent our borrowing base and financial covenants permit such borrowings.
Additional sources of cash for the second half of 2016 may include additional asset sales,
sale/leaseback transactions, additional debt or equity financing and reductions in our operating
costs.
We have incurred operating losses of $40.6 million and $67.9 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2016, respectively, and operating losses of $20.6 million and $32.6 million for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. Cash used in operating activities was
$12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash
equivalents of $0.3 million, and $12.6 million of net availability under the ABL Facility.
Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a
going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the condensed consolidated financial
statements, we had an accumulated deficit at June 30, 2016, and a net loss for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These factors, coupled with our large outstanding debt balance,
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We are attempting to
generate sufficient revenues and reduce costs; however, our cash position may not be sufficient to
support our daily operations if we are not successful. While we have executed a comprehensive
strategy to restructure our indebtedness, improve liquidity and reduce costs, including cash
interest expense, to sustain operations through the prolonged depression in oil and natural gas
prices and the corresponding impact on our business operations, there can be no assurances to
that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate
sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and operating needs. While we were, and remain, in
compliance with our existing debt arrangements, we recognize that absent an improvement in oil
prices, it is likely that we will not have enough liquidity, including cash on hand, to service our
debt, operations, and pay-down debt to avoid covenant violations. Failure to comply with any of
our debt obligations, or obtain waivers thereof, may cause us to seek relief under the United States
Bankruptcy Code. See Note 8 and Note 18 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for details on management's debt restructuring in 2016.
Given the current macro environment and depressed oil and natural gas prices, we anticipate
lower revenues and reductions in costs from operations to continue through the second half of
2016. We used cash on hand and liquidity from our restructuring transactions to repay a portion of
our ABL Facility in order to maintain compliance with our ABL Facility financial covenants
39
Table of Contents
and to cover the deterioration to our ABL Facility borrowing base due to declining accounts
receivable and downward pressure on the orderly liquidation values of our machinery and
equipment. If there is further deterioration to our ABL Facility borrowing base, in the event our cash
on hand is not adequate to cover any shortfall, we would be required to seek alternate sources of
debt at higher rates of interest, and such debt may not be available to us. See Note 8 and Note 18
in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on management's
debt restructuring in 2016.
In addition, our ABL Facility contains a covenant requiring us to refinance the ABL Facility in full
on or before September 30, 2016. There can be no assurances that we will be able to refinance
the ABL Facility by September 30, 2016, that such refinancing will be available on attractive or
acceptable terms, or that such refinancing would provide us with sufficient liquidity to service our
debt obligations and operations through the prolonged decline in oil and natural gas prices. In the
event we are unable to refinance our ABL Facility, or refinance on terms attractive or acceptable to
us, it is likely we would not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt obligations and operations.
This would likely cause us to seek relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code. See Note 8 in
the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on our ABL Facility
refinancing covenant.

million from December 31, 2015. The primary reason for the decrease in cash and cash
equivalents is due to net repayments of $53.7 million on our ABL Facility and the execution of an
amendment to our guaranty and security agreement related to our ABL Facility in March 2016,
which is described in further detail later in this section under "ABL Facility Amendments." This
amendment implemented a daily cash sweep of our collection lockbox and certain depository
accounts, the proceeds of which are required to be applied against the outstanding balance of the
ABL Facility. We had an ending balance of $0.1 million in our collection lockbox and certain
depository accounts on June 30, 2016, which we have classified as "Restricted cash" on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet as this cash is not available for operations and was
subsequently swept by the lender on July 1, 2016. The amendment also requires the segregation
of all receipts and disbursements in separate bank accounts and limits the end of day balance in
our operating bank account to an amount not to exceed $1.0 million.
Operating Activities
Net cash used in operating activities was $12.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, used cash of $32.0
million, compared to cash provided of $6.9 million in the corresponding 2015 period. Changes in
operating assets and liabilities provided $19.4 million in cash primarily due to a decrease in
accounts receivable as a result of lower activity levels and billings in the current year, offset by an
increase in other current assets. The non-cash items and other adjustments included $31.1 million
of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of debt issuance costs of $2.6
million, a long-lived asset impairment charge of $2.7 million, write off of deferred financing costs of
$0.7 million, stock-based compensation of $0.7 million, and a $0.7 million loss on disposal of
property, plant and equipment, partially offset by a $1.7 million gain on the sale of UGSI and a $1.0
million gain resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative warrant liability.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $42.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. The net loss from continuing operations, after adjustments for non-cash items, provided
cash of $6.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $35.4 million primarily
due to a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of increased efforts on collections which was
partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in
prepaid expenses and other receivables. The non-cash items and other adjustments included
$35.8 million of depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, amortization of debt issuance
costs of $2.4 million, stock-based compensation of $1.5 million and write off of deferred financing
costs of $1.0 million, partially offset by a $1.3 million gain on disposal of property, plant and
equipment.

Table of Contents
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities was $7.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
which primarily consisted of $6.0 million of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and
equipment and $5.0 million in proceeds from the sale of UGSI, partially offset by $2.1 million of
purchases of property, plant and equipment and a $1.3 million increase in restricted cash. The
increase in restricted cash during the six months ended June 30, 2016 is a result of the $5.0
million deposited in escrow for the purpose of securing the backstop obligations under the Rights
Offering for Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, offset by the
release of funds from escrow as a result of the completion of the post-closing working capital
reconciliation related to the sale of TFI.
Net cash provided by investing activities was $67.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015 and consisted primarily of $78.9 million of proceeds from the sale of TFI and $3.4 million of
proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $10.8 million of
purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $34.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and was primarily comprised of $53.7 million of net repayments under ABL Facility and $3.3
million of payments on vehicle financing and other financing activities, offset by $24.0 million in
proceeds from the issuance of the new Term Loan.
Net cash used by financing activities was $89.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015
and consisted of $81.6 million of payments under our ABL Facility and $7.8 million of payments on
vehicle financing and other financing activities.
Capital Expenditures
Our capital expenditure program is subject to market conditions, including customer activity levels,
commodity prices, industry capacity and specific customer needs. Due to the difficult 2016 macro
environment and the corresponding impact of depressed oil and natural gas prices, we have
sought to maximize liquidity by limiting our capital expenditures to only those deemed critical to
our ongoing operations and those necessary to support our key growth initiatives. In addition, we
offset the cash impact of these expenditures by selling underutilized or non-core assets. Cash
required for capital expenditures (related to continuing operations) for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 totaled $2.1 million compared to $10.8 million for the six months ended June 30,
2015. These capital expenditures were partially offset by proceeds received from the sale of
under-utilized or non-core assets of $6.0 million and $3.4 million in the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively. Historically, a portion of our transportation-related capital
requirements were financed through capital leases, which are excluded from the capital
expenditures figures cited above. Such equipment additions under capital leases totaled
approximately $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. We had no new equipment
additions under capital leases in the six months ended June 30, 2016. We continue to focus on
improving the utilization of our existing assets and optimizing the allocation of resources in the
various shale areas in which we operate. Our planned capital expenditures for the remainder of
2016 are expected to be financed through cash flow from operations, borrowings under existing or
new credit facilities if available, capital leases, other financing structures, or a combination of the
foregoing.
Indebtedness
We are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs result from debt service
requirements and from funding our costs of operations and capital expenditures. As of June 30,
2016, we had $464.6 million of indebtedness outstanding, consisting of $40.4 million of 2018
Notes, $335.7 million of 2021 Notes, $24.7 million under a Term Loan, $48.1 million under the
ABL Facility, and $15.6 million of capital leases for vehicle financings and a note payable for the
purchase of the remaining interest in AWS.
Exchange Offer
On March 11, 2016, we entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement with holders of more than
80% of the 2018 Notes relating to a debt restructuring and recapitalization plan (the
“Restructuring”), subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions including shareholder
approval of an amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, and minimum noteholder participation. On April 15, 2016, we closed our exchange offer
(the “Exchange Offer”) relating to our 2018 Notes as part of the comprehensive restructuring of our
outstanding indebtedness pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement.
Pursuant to the Exchange Offer, we offered to exchange our 2021 Notes and shares of our
common stock at a conversion price per share of $0.32 (the “Conversion Price”) for any and all of
our 2018 Notes validly tendered and not properly withdrawn at or prior to the expiration date, with
the exception of approximately $31.4 million in principal 2018 Notes owned by an entity
41
Table of Contents
controlled by Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We
settled the Exchange Offer on April 15, 2016 by delivering to tendering holders of the 2018 Notes
(i) $327.2 million in aggregate principal amount of the new 2021 Notes to those tendering holders
electing to exchange for 2021 Notes and $0.9 million in shares of common stock converted at the
Conversion Price to those tendering holders electing to exchange for common stock and (ii) a pro
rata share (based on the aggregate principal amount of the 2018 Notes validly tendered) of penny
warrants sufficient to purchase 10% of shares of our common stock (the "Exchange Warrants"). In
addition, $31.4 million in principal 2018 Notes held by an entity controlled by Mr. Johnsrud were
canceled upon closing of the Exchange Offer, and converted to shares of our common stock on
May 26, 2016 at the Conversion Price, following shareholder approval at the May 20, 2016
Special Meeting of Shareholders to approve an amendment to our Amended and Restated
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of authorized shares of our
common stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 50 million to 350 million (the "Johnsrud Note
Conversion"). As a result of the exchange, a total of 101,071,875 shares of common stock were
issued, with 2,837,500 to tendering holders electing to exchange their 2018 Notes for common
stock, and 98,234,375 for the Johnsrud Note Conversion.
The exchange of the $327.2 million in principal 2018 Notes for new 2021 Notes was accounted for
as a debt modification, and all third party expenses related to the exchange were expensed to
"General and administrative expenses" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for
the three months ended June 30, 2016. The exchange of the $0.9 million in principal 2018 Notes
for common stock was accounted for as a debt extinguishment, which generated an immaterial
loss on extinguishment recorded in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Finally, the
exchange of $31.4 million in principal 2018 Notes held by an entity controlled by Mr. Johnsrud for
common stock was accounted as a capital transaction as Mr. Johnsrud is a related party, with the
loss on extinguishment recorded in "Additional paid-in-capital" on the condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The Warrants issued in connection with the Exchange Offer
are discussed in further detail in Note 9 on "Derivative Warrants."
In connection with the issuance of the new 2021 Notes, we entered into a new Indenture that
governs the terms of the new 2021 Notes, dated as of April 15, 2016, between the Company,
Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as Trustee, and the Guarantors party thereto. Pursuant to
the new Indenture, the 2021 Notes will mature on April 15, 2021. Interest will be paid in kind semi-
annually by increasing the principal amount payable and due at maturity and/or in cash as follows:
interest payable on October 15, 2016 will be paid in kind at an annual rate of 12.5%; interest
payable after October 15, 2016 but on or before April 15, 2018 will be paid at a rate of 10% with
50% in kind and 50% in cash; interest payable after April 15, 2018 will be paid in cash at a rate of
10% until maturity. As a result, our annual cash interest payment obligations have been reduced
by approximately $17.8 million for the remainder of 2016, $17.9 million for 2017 and $8.6 million
through April 15, 2018. Interest on the 2021 Notes accrues from the most recent date interest has
been paid, or if no interest has been paid, from and including the issue date. The 2021 Notes are
secured by junior liens on the same collateral as our ABL Facility and rank equal in right of
payment to all senior indebtedness and senior to all subordinated indebtedness of the Company.
The 2021 Notes are guaranteed by our subsidiaries.
Upon settlement of the Exchange Offer, there remained outstanding approximately $40.4
million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes. Ongoing semi-annual interest expense with
respect to the remaining 2018 Notes is approximately $2.0 million. In addition, based on the
completion of the Exchange Offer, consents from each exchanging holder of the 2018 Notes for
the waiver of certain provisions of the 2018 Notes Indenture became effective. The consents,
among other things, waive substantially all of the restrictive covenants in the 2018 Notes Indenture
and potential defaults arising from non-compliance with such waived covenants.
Term Loan
Concurrent to the Exchange Offer we entered into a $24.0 million Term Loan funded by certain
holders of the 2018 Notes that were also parties to the Restructuring Support Agreement. The
Term Loan accrues interest at a rate of 13% compounded monthly to be paid in kind by increasing
the principal amount payable thereunder. Principal including the paid in kind interest is due April
15, 2018. The Term Loan is subject to a minimum EBITDA covenant that is identical in all respects
to the minimum EBITDA covenant applicable to the ABL Facility. To the extent actual EBITDA (as
defined by the Term Loan) falls short of the minimum EBITDA targets, the Term Loan accrues
interest at rate of 17%. The Term Loan is secured by junior liens on the same collateral as our ABL
Facility and guaranteed by our subsidiaries. In connection with the Term Loan, we entered into a
warrant agreement with the lenders under the Term Loan, pursuant to which, as a commitment fee
for entering into the Term Loan, the lenders received warrants to purchase up to 5% of our then-
outstanding stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share (the "Term Loan Warrants").
The Exchange Warrants and the Term Loan Warrants (collectively, the "Warrants") contain anti-
dilution provisions which adjust the number of shares issuable upon exercise thereof in certain
circumstances, including adjustments intended to preserve the
42
Table of Contents
proportion of outstanding common stock into which such Warrants are exercisable after giving
effect to the Johnsrud Note Conversion, and the Rights Offering. The Warrants are discussed in
greater detail in Note 9 on "Derivative Warrants" and the Rights Offering is discussed in Note 18
on "Subsequent Events Related to Restructuring - Rights Offering."
Proceeds from the Term Loan were applied to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of
the ABL Facility and were reborrowed by us to fund the scheduled interest payment on the 2018
Notes and pay related transaction fees and expenses.
On June 30, 2016, we entered into a First Amendment to Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term
Loan Agreement Amendment”) by and among the Required Lenders (as defined therein) and the
Company, which amends the Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated as of April 15, 2016, by and
among Wilmington Savings Fund Society, FSB, as administrative agent (the “Agent”), the lenders
party thereto (the “Lenders”), and the Company, as borrower (the “Term Loan Agreement”).
The Term Loan Agreement Amendment amends the Term Loan Agreement by amending the
minimum EBITDA financial maintenance covenant to conform to the revised minimum EBITDA
financial maintenance covenant provided by the Eighth Amendment to Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement (discussed below) through December 31, 2016, modifying the applicable
periods for measurement and reducing the applicable amounts required to be achieved for each
period. In connection with the Term Loan Agreement Amendment, we paid a non-refundable
amendment fee in the amount of $0.1 million to the Lenders, pro-rata to their respective
commitment amount under the Term Loan Agreement, which was capitalized as deferred
financing costs during the three months ended June 30, 2016.
ABL Facility Amendments
On March 10, 2016, we entered into a Consent and Fifth Amendment to Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement (the “Fifth ABL Facility Amendment”) and a Third Amendment to Amended and
Restated Guaranty and Security Agreement (the "Third GSA Amendment") by and among Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association as agent ("Agent"), the Lenders named therein (the “Lenders”),
and the Company. Under the Fifth ABL Facility Amendment, the Lenders consented to the
inclusion of a “going concern” qualification in the opinion from our registered public accounting
firm, which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2015. Under the Third GSA Amendment, we consented to and implemented a daily cash sweep of
our collection lockbox and depository accounts, the proceeds of which are required to be applied
against the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. The Third GSA Amendment also requires the
segregation of all receipts and disbursements in separate bank accounts and limits the end of day
balance in our operating bank account to an amount not to exceed $1.0 million.
On March 24, 2016, in connection with the Restructuring Support Agreement to implement the
Restructuring, we entered into a Sixth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
(the “Sixth ABL Facility Amendment”) by and among the Agent, the Lenders and the Company.
Among other terms and conditions, the Sixth ABL Facility Amendment amended the ABL Facility
as follows:
•Reduced the maximum revolver commitments from $125.0 million to $100.0 million;
Replaced the leverage ratio financial maintenance covenant with a new minimum EBITDA
financial maintenance covenant that will be tested monthly;
Amended the definition of “EBITDA” for purposes of the financial maintenance covenant to
provide allowances for certain unusual or non-recurring fees, costs and expenses, with testing
monthly beginning in April 2016;
Amended the definition of “Borrowing Base” (i) to set the eligible equipment advance rates based
on net book value at 60% and on Net Orderly Liquidation Value (as defined in the ABL Facility) at
80% and (ii) to cap Borrowing Base availability attributable to eligible equipment at 75%;
Increased the default rate upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default from 2% to
4%;
Increased the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate and Base Rate Loans (each as defined in the
ABL Facility) and the unused line fee;
Eliminated our ability to voluntarily reduce the commitments without termination of the ABL
Facility;
Requires us to apply proceeds from the Restructuring transactions and related agreements to pay
down the ABL Facility;
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Amended the definition of “Permitted Disposition” to permit the sale of our equity investment in
Underground Solutions, Inc., discussed further in Note 14, and to expand the permitted
disposition general basket (which excludes the sale of machinery and equipment in the ordinary
course of business) from $5.0 million to $7.5 million;
43
Table of Contents
Applies a Permitted Disposition Reserve of 50% against our availability for net cash proceeds in
excess of $7.5 million made on or after March 10, 2016 for sales specifically related to the
Permitted Disposition general basket; and
Amended certain definitions in connection with the Restructuring transactions, including “Change
of Control”, “Permitted Indebtedness”, and “Permitted Liens”.
•
•
In addition, we agreed to certain make-whole fees that would be payable to the Lenders upon
early termination of the ABL Facility as a result of acceleration, bankruptcy or otherwise, unless
amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility are paid in full. In connection with the Sixth ABL
Facility Amendment we incurred amendment fees of approximately $0.6 million which were
capitalized as deferred financing costs during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Further, we
wrote off a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our ABL Facility of
approximately $0.4 million which are included in "Loss on extinguishment of debt" in the
condensed consolidated statement of operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016.
On April 15, 2016, we entered into a Seventh Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated April 15, 2016 (the “Seventh ABL Facility Amendment”), by and among the
Agent, the Lenders and the Company to make conforming amendments in connection with the
Restructuring transactions. Among other terms and conditions, the Seventh Amendment amends
the ABL Facility to: (i) require that the we apply excess proceeds from asset sales to pay down the
ABL Facility; (ii) prohibit us from optionally prepaying or acquiring other indebtedness, making any
payment on subordinated indebtedness, or amending certain agreements and documents; and
(iii) amend certain definitions in the ABL Facility.
On June 29, 2016, we entered into an Eighth Amendment to Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement (the “Eighth ABL Facility Amendment”) by and among the Agent, the Lenders, and the
Company, which further amends our ABL Facility. Among other terms and conditions, the Eighth
ABL Facility Amendment amended the ABL Facility as follows:
•Reduced the maximum revolver commitments from $100.0 million to $85.0 million;
•
Amended the minimum EBITDA financial maintenance covenant, modifying the applicable
periods for measurement and reducing the applicable amounts required to be achieved for each
period;
•
Changed the scheduled maturity date of the ABL Facility from January 15, 2018 to December 31,
2016;
•
Added a covenant requiring us to refinance the ABL Facility in full on or before September 30,
2016;
Requires us to consummate a rights offering on or before July 29, 2016, which was subsequently
waived by the Lenders on August 5, 2016, and to apply the proceeds from the rights offering to
pay down the ABL Facility, which must equal $5.0 million (with any shortfall to be covered by the
backstop obligation funds previously placed in escrow by Mark D. Johnsrud, the Company’s
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer) - (see Note 18 for further updates and details on the
Rights Offering);
•
•
Replaced the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant with an immediate availability block
in the amount of $12.5 million, increasing to $15.0 million upon receipt of the Rights Offering
proceeds;
•
Establishes a Permitted Disposition Reserve equal to 50% of the aggregate amount of net cash
proceeds arising from Permitted Dispositions of any property (excluding the sale of machinery
and equipment in the ordinary course of business) consummated after June 29, 2016;
•
Increased the applicable margin on LIBOR Rate and Base Rate Loans (as defined in the ABL
Facility).
In connection with the Eighth ABL Facility Amendment we incurred amendment fees of
approximately $0.4 million which were capitalized as deferred financing costs during the three
months ended June 30, 2016. Further, we wrote off a portion of the unamortized deferred financing
costs associated with our ABL Facility of approximately $0.3 million which are included in "Loss
on extinguishment of debt" in the condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three
months ended June 30, 2016.
Financial Covenants and Borrowing Limitations
The ABL Facility, as amended, requires, and any future credit facilities will likely require, us to
comply with specified financial ratios that may limit the amount we can borrow under our ABL
Facility. A breach of any of the covenants under the indenture governing the 2018 Notes and 2021
Notes (the “Indentures”), the ABL Facility, or the Term Loan, as applicable, could result in
44
Table of Contents
an event of default. Our ability to satisfy those covenants depends principally upon our ability to
meet or exceed certain positive operating performance metrics including, but not limited to,
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, and ratios thereof, as
well as certain balance sheet ratios. Any debt agreements we enter into in the future may further
limit our ability to enter into certain types of transactions.
The ABL Facility and Term Loan contain certain financial covenants, including a minimum
EBITDA covenant. The minimum EBITDA covenant requires us to meet a stated year-to-date
EBITDA target (as defined by the ABL Facility). As of June 30, 2016, we remained in compliance
with our debt covenants and availability under the ABL Facility was $12.6 million, after applying
the availability block and other availability restrictions.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Agent for the ABL Facility commenced a
borrowing base redetermination involving a valuation of the net orderly liquidation value of our
eligible machinery and equipment by a third party specialist. As a result, the lenders applied an
$21.0 million reserve against our availability based on the estimated decline to our borrowing
base. Due to the application of this reserve against our availability and due to the implementation
of the daily sweep of our lockbox and certain depository bank accounts, we made cumulative
payments of $130.7 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016, offset by borrowings of
$77.0 million, thus reducing the amount outstanding under the ABL Facility from $101.8 million as
of December 31, 2015 to $48.1 million as of June 30, 2016.
The ABL Facility's borrowing base limitations are based upon eligible accounts receivable and
equipment. If the value of our eligible accounts receivable or equipment decreases for any reason,
or if some portion of our accounts receivable or equipment is deemed ineligible under the terms of
our ABL Facility, the amount we can borrow under the ABL Facility could be reduced. These
limitations could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and financial condition. In
addition, the Agent for our ABL Facility has the periodic right to commission appraisals of the
assets comprising our borrowing base, and we are obligated to reimburse the cost of up to four full
appraisals including two field examinations, during any 12 consecutive months. If an appraisal
results in a reduction of the borrowing base, we may be required to repay a portion of the amount
outstanding under the ABL Facility in order to remain in compliance with applicable borrowing
limitations. At June 30, 2016 we had $12.6 million of net availability under the ABL Facility. During
the remainder of 2016, we expect further deterioration to our ABL borrowing base due to declining
accounts receivable and downward pressure on the orderly liquidation values of our machinery
and equipment. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we reduced the outstanding balance
of the ABL Facility by $53.7 million, a portion of which was made to cover the borrowing base
deterioration. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash on hand or other
sources of liquidity to make any such future repayments if necessary.
The Indentures contain restrictive covenants on the incurrence of senior secured indebtedness. To
the extent that the fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Indentures) is below 2.0 to 1.0, the
Indentures prohibit our incurrence of new senior secured indebtedness under the ABL Facility or
any other secured credit facility, at that point in time, to the greater of $150.0 million and the
amount of debt as restricted by the secured leverage ratio, which is the ratio of secured debt to
EBITDA, of 2.0 to 1.0, as determined pursuant to the Indentures. The 2.0 to 1.0 fixed charge
coverage ratio and secured leverage ratio are incurrence covenants, not maintenance covenants.
The covenants do not require repayment of existing borrowings incurred previously in accordance
with the covenants, but rather limits new borrowings during any such period. As a result of the
Eighth ABL Facility Amendment, our ability to incur new borrowings under the ABL Facility is
limited to a maximum of $85.0 million irrespective of the permitted availability of up to $150.0
million under the Indentures.
The covenants described above are subject to important exceptions and qualifications. The
continued effect of low oil and natural gas prices will negatively impact our compliance with our
covenants, and we cannot guarantee that we will satisfy those requirements. If we do not obtain a
long term waiver for any breached covenants, such breach would result in a default under the
Indentures, ABL Facility or other debt obligations, or any future credit facilities we may enter into,
which could allow all amounts outstanding thereunder to be declared immediately due and
payable, subject to the terms and conditions of the documents governing such indebtedness. If we
were unable to repay the accelerated amounts, our secured lenders could proceed against the
collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. This would likely in turn trigger cross
acceleration and cross-default rights under any other credit facilities and indentures. If the amounts
outstanding under the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes, or any other indebtedness outstanding at such
time, were to be accelerated or were the subject of foreclosure actions, we cannot guarantee that
our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the money owed to the lenders or to our other debt
holders. We cannot guarantee that we will be granted waivers or amendments to the Indentures
governing the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes, the ABL Facility, or such other debt obligations if for
any reason we are unable to comply with our obligations thereunder. Any such limitations on
borrowing under our ABL Facility could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity. Failure to
comply with any of our debt obligations, or obtain waivers thereof, may cause us to seek relief
under the United States Bankruptcy Code.

ABL Facility Refinancing Covenant and Maturity Date
Our ABL Facility contains a covenant requiring us to refinance the ABL Facility in full on or before
September 30, 2016 and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to refinance the ABL Facility by September 30, 2016, or that any such
refinancing would be available to us on attractive or acceptable terms. Any refinancing of the ABL
Facility could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we fail to comply with our
refinancing covenant, we would request a waiver from the Lenders or may be required to repay the
outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. Failure to obtain a waiver or cure the default through
repayment of the facility would create an event of cross default under our other credit facilities and
indentures, including the Term Loan and the Indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2021
Notes. There can be no assurance that the Lenders under the ABL Facility will grant a waiver of
the covenant default or that the lenders under the Term Loan will grant a waiver of, or that the
holders of our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes will consent to, any cross default, and we currently do
not have sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance of the ABL
Facility or our other indebtedness. In the event that we are unable to timely refinance the ABL
Facility, or obtain a waiver thereof, or repay the ABL Facility when due, we may need to seek relief
under the United States Bankruptcy Code.
EBITDA
As a supplement to the financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which are
prepared in accordance with GAAP, we also present EBITDA. EBITDA is consolidated net income
(loss) from continuing operations before net interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and
amortization. We present EBITDA because we believe this information is useful to financial
statement users in evaluating our financial performance. We also use EBITDA to evaluate our
financial performance, make business decisions, including developing budgets, managing
expenditures, forecasting future periods, and evaluating capital structure impacts of various
strategic scenarios. EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with
GAAP, may not necessarily be indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to fund
cash needs, and there are material limitations to its usefulness on a stand-alone basis. EBITDA
does not include reductions for cash payments for our obligations to service our debt, fund our
working capital and pay our income taxes. In addition, certain items excluded from EBITDA such
as interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization are significant components in
understanding and assessing our financial performance. All companies do not calculate EBITDA
in the same manner and our presentation may not be comparable to those presented by other
companies. Financial statement users should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative
to, net income (loss) as defined under and calculated in accordance with GAAP.

condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we performed an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer), of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in
Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “Exchange Act”)). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at that time to provide reasonable assurance
that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange
Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC’s rules and forms, and are accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months
ended June 30, 2016 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.
As disclosed in our Form 8-K filed on April 1, 2016, our Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer resigned from that position effective April 1, 2016. As a result, there have been
changes in the individuals responsible for executing the controls; however, we continue to execute
our business processes under the same controls and we do not believe this organizational change
materially affects, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

PART II—OTHER INFORMATION
Item  1.Legal Proceedings.
See “Legal Matters” in Note 13 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
for a description of our material legal proceedings.
Item  1A.Risk Factors.
Risk Factors Related To Our Common Stock
We were delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, and there is a limited trading volume for our
common stock on the OTCQB.
In January 2016, our common stock was delisted from the NYSE. Our common stock currently
trades on the OTCQB U.S. Market (the “OTCQB”) under the symbol NESC, and there is a limited
trading volume for our common stock. As a result, relatively small trades of our common stock may
have a significant impact on the price of our common stock and, therefore, may contribute to the
price volatility of our common stock. Because of limited trading volume in our common stock and
the price volatility of our common stock, you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock
when you desire or at the price you desire. The inability to sell your shares in a declining market
because of such illiquidity or at a price you desire may substantially increase your risk of loss.
The delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could adversely affect institutional investor
interest in holding or acquiring our common stock and otherwise reduce the number of investors
willing to hold or acquire our common stock. This could negatively affect our ability to raise capital
necessary to maintain operations and service our debt. In addition, the delisting of our common
stock from the NYSE may cause a loss of confidence among our employees and customers and
otherwise negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We do not now, and are not expected to in the foreseeable future, meet the listing standards of the
NYSE or any other national securities exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock
will continue to be quoted on the OTCQB. As a result of the limited trading volume for our common
stock, investors may be unable to sell shares of common stock at the times or in the quantities
desired and, therefore, may be required to hold some or all of their shares for an indefinite period
of time.
Our stock price may be volatile, which could result in substantial losses for investors in our
securities.
The stock markets have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the
operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely
affect the trading price of our common stock. The market price of our common stock may also
fluctuate significantly in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:
•variations in our quarterly operating results and changes in our liquidity position;
•changes in securities analysts’ estimates of our financial performance;
inaccurate or negative comments about us on social networking websites or other media
channels;
•changes in market valuations of similar companies;
•
•
announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic
partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, new products or product enhancements, as
well as our or our competitors’ success or failure in successfully executing such matters;
•changes in the price of oil and natural gas;
•loss of a major customer or failure to complete significant transactions; and
•additions or departures of key personnel.
There is no assurance that an active public trading market will continue.
There can be no assurance that an active public trading market for our common stock will be
sustained. If for any reason an active public trading market does not continue, purchasers of the
shares of our common stock may have difficulty in selling their securities should they desire to do
so and the price of our common stock may decline.
48
Table of Contents
If securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade
our stock, the price of our stock could decline.
The trading market for our shares of common stock could rely in part on the research and reporting
that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these
analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock, the
price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company,
we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.
Future sales by us or our existing shareholders could depress the market price of our common
stock.
If we or our existing shareholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, the market
price of our common stock could decline significantly. Further, even the perception in the public
market that we or our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the
market price of the common stock.
The exercise of our warrants may result in substantial dilution and may depress the market price of
our common stock.
As of June 30, 2016, we had outstanding 129.3 million shares of common stock and also (i) 1.8
million shares of our common stock issuable under employee benefit plans, (ii) the Exchange
Warrants exercisable for 15.2 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to
$0.01 per share, and (iii) the First Lien Term Loan (or "FLTL") Warrants exercisable for 7.6 million
shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.01 per share. If the shares issuable under
employee stock purchase plans are issued or the Warrants are exercised and the shares of
common stock are issued pursuant to the employee stock purchase plans or upon such exercise
are sold, our common shareholders may experience substantial dilution and the market price of
our shares of common stock could decline. Further, the perception that such securities might be
exercised could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock. In addition,
holders of the Warrants are likely to exercise them when, in all likelihood, we could obtain
additional capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided by the Warrants. Further,
during the time that the foregoing securities are outstanding, they may adversely affect the terms
on which we could obtain additional capital.
We may issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the future and shareholders
may be adversely affected by the issuance of those shares.
We may raise additional capital or refinance or restructure our existing debt by issuing shares of
common stock, or other securities convertible into common stock, which will increase the number
of shares of common stock outstanding and may result in substantial dilution in the equity interest
of our current shareholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We
have previously issued 1.8 million shares of common stock at a total price of $80.1 million under a
shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC and we could seek to issue new debt,
equity and hybrid securities in the future. In addition, we have issued shares of our common stock
pursuant to private placement exemptions from Securities Act registration requirements, and may
do so in connection with financings, acquisitions, the settlement of litigation and other strategic
transactions in the future. The issuance, and the resale or potential resale, of shares of our
common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and could be dilutive
to our shareholders.
The completion of our comprehensive plan to restructure our outstanding indebtedness, including
the conversion of Mr. Johnsrud’s 2018 Notes to equity and the Rights Offering, will result in
substantial dilution to our existing shareholders.
We have executed a plan to restructure our outstanding indebtedness. The completion of our plan
to restructure our indebtedness, including the conversion of Mr. Johnsrud’s 2018 Notes and the
Rights Offering, will result in substantial dilution to our existing shareholders. As part of the
exchange offer for our 2018 Notes, we converted approximately $31.4 million aggregate principal
amount of the 2018 Notes for our common stock at a conversion price per share of $0.32 (the
“Conversion Price”) which were held by an entity controlled by Mr. Mark D. Johnsrud, our Chief
Executive Officer and Chairman of the board of directors.  Mr. Johnsrud received approximately
98.3 million shares for the conversion of his 2018 Notes.  In addition, as part of our debt
restructuring plan, we will pursue an equity rights offering (the “Rights Offering”), in which all
holders of our common stock will be granted the right to participate. Each shareholder who
participates in the Rights Offering will have the right to subscribe for a pro rata share of $5.0 million
of common stock exercisable at a 20% discount to the Conversion Price. We intend to complete
the Rights Offering during the second half of 2016. Mr. Johnsrud agreed to backstop the Rights
Offering in exchange for a 5% backstop fee. We intend to issue approximately 20.3 million shares
of common stock in connection with the Rights Offering, which includes the backstop fee that will
be paid to Mr. Johnsrud in the form of approximately 790 thousand shares of common stock.
49
Table of Contents
Our shareholders will suffer substantial dilution in their percentage ownership as a result of the
conversion of Mr. Johnsrud’s 2018 Notes to equity.  In addition, shareholders who do not fully
exercise their subscription rights in the Rights Offering, or exercise less than all of their rights, will
suffer further dilution in their percentage ownership of our common stock relative to such other
shareholders who fully exercise their subscription rights or a greater proportion of their
subscription rights. In addition, if the Rights Offering subscription price of $0.256 is less than the
market value per share of our common stock, then our shareholders will experience an immediate
dilution of the aggregate net market value of their shares as a result of the Rights Offering. The
amount of any decrease in net market value is not predictable because it is not known at this time
what the market value per share will be on the expiration date of the Rights Offering.
We currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock.
We currently do not intend to pay any dividends on our common stock, and restrictions and
covenants in our debt agreements may prohibit us from paying dividends now or in the future.
While we may declare dividends at some point in the future, subject to compliance with such
restrictions and covenants, we cannot assure you that you will ever receive cash dividends as a
result of ownership of our common stock and any gains from investment in our common stock may
only come from increases in the market price of our common stock, if any.
We are subject to anti-takeover effects of certain charter and bylaw provisions and Delaware law,
as well as of our substantial insider ownership.
Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each as amended and restated, and
Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that shareholders may
consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for
your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our
shareholders to replace or remove our management and board of directors. These provisions
include:
•
•
•
authorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock without any need for action by
shareholders;
establishing a classified board of directors, so that only approximately one-third of our directors
are elected each year;
providing our board of directors with the ability to set the number of directors and to fill vacancies
on the board of directors occurring between shareholder meetings;
providing that directors may only be removed for “cause” and only by the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least a majority in voting power of our issued and outstanding capital stock; and
•limiting the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings.
•
We are also subject to provisions of the Delaware corporation law that, in general, prohibit any
business combination with a beneficial owner of 15% or more of our common stock for three years
following the date the beneficial owner acquired at least 15% of our stock, unless various
conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our board of directors. Together, these
charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may
discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market
prices for our common stock.
The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures, as well as the significant
amount of common stock beneficially owned by our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, Mr.
Johnsrud, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our
common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the
likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.
Risk Factors Related To Our Company and Our Indebtedness
Our ABL Facility contains a covenant requiring us to refinance the ABL Facility in full on or before
September 30, 2016 and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to timely refinance the ABL Facility, that any such refinancing would be
available to us on attractive or acceptable terms, or that we will be able to otherwise obtain funds
by selling assets or raising equity to repay the ABL Facility when due. Failure to timely refinance
the ABL Facility, or obtain a waiver thereof, or repay the ABL Facility when due, may cause us to
seek relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), which will
adversely affect our financial condition and impair potential recoveries by creditors, including the
lenders under our ABL Facility and the Term Loan and holders of our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes,
and by holders of our common stock.
Our ABL Facility contains a covenant requiring us to refinance the ABL Facility in full on or before
September 30, 2016 and has a maturity date of December 31, 2016. There can be no assurances
that we will be able to refinance the ABL Facility by September 30, 2016 or that any such
refinancing would be available to us on attractive or acceptable terms. Any refinancing of the ABL
50
Table of Contents
Facility could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous
covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. If we fail to comply with our
refinancing covenant, we would request a waiver from the lenders or may be required to repay the
outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. Failure to obtain a waiver or cure the default through
repayment of the facility would create an event of cross default under our other credit facilities and
indentures, including the Term Loan and the Indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2021
Notes. There can be no assurance that the lenders under the ABL Facility will grant a waiver of the
covenant default or that the lenders under the Term Loan will grant a waiver of, or that the holders
of our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes will consent to, any cross default, and we currently do not have
sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility or
our other indebtedness. Even if a waiver of the refinancing covenant can be obtained, we do not
have sufficient liquidity, including cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance of the ABL
Facility as required on September 30, 2016 or upon maturity on December 31, 2016. If we are
unable to refinance our ABL Facility, we may need to dispose of assets or operations or issue
equity to obtain necessary funds to repay the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. In the event
we are required to dispose of material assets or operations in order to repay our ABL Facility, we
cannot provide assurance that we could effect these actions on a timely basis, on commercially
reasonable terms or at all, or that these actions would be sufficient to meet our obligations. Any
issuance of equity in connection with repayment of our ABL Facility could be materially dilutive to
existing shareholders. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of these actions, if
necessary, on a timely basis or on terms satisfactory to us or at all. In the event that we are unable
to timely refinance the ABL Facility, or obtain a waiver thereof, or repay the ABL Facility when due,
we may need to restructure under the Bankruptcy Code, which will adversely affect our financial
condition and impair potential recoveries by creditors, including the lenders under our ABL Facility
and the Term Loan, holders of our 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes, and by holders of our common
stock.
Our liquidity continues to decline due to deteriorating operating results and constraints imposed by
our ABL Facility. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to
generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and operating needs.
The substantial and extended decline in oil and natural gas prices has resulted in significant
reductions in our customers’ operating and capital expenditures. This extended downturn has
resulted in a reduction in demand for our services as well as lower prices and operating margins,
and has adversely affected our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, resulting
in a decline in liquidity to cover our operations. In addition, recent amendments to our ABL Facility
have further constrained our liquidity by reducing the maximum revolver commitments and
availability thereunder through the implementation of additional reserves and an availability block
and a reduction in availability attributable to eligible equipment. This has resulted in a material
reduction in the amount we can borrow under the ABL Facility. In addition, the administrative
agent for our ABL Facility has the periodic right to commission appraisals of the assets comprising
our borrowing base. Recent appraisals have resulted in a reduction of the borrowing base and
have required us to repay a portion of the amount outstanding under the ABL Facility in order to
remain in compliance with applicable borrowing limitations. The administrative agent has the right
to undertake future periodic appraisals and there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient
cash on hand or other sources of liquidity to make any future repayments required as a result of
such appraisals. These limitations under our ABL Facility could have a material adverse impact on
our liquidity and financial condition as our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to generate sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and operating needs.
Our ABL Facility and Term Loan contain minimum EBITDA covenants requiring us to meet a
stated year-to-date EBITDA targets. Factors beyond our control could result in our failure to
comply with such EBITDA covenants. Failure to comply with such covenants would result in an
event of default under our ABL Facility and/or Term Loan, as applicable.
Our ABL facility and Term Loan contain minimum EBITDA financial maintenance covenants that
are tested monthly. The minimum EBITDA covenant requires us to meet a stated year-to-date
EBITDA target (as defined) through the respective maturity dates of the ABL Facility and Term
Loan. Our ability to meet our minimum EBITDA covenants will depend upon our future operating
performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and
other factors, certain of which are beyond our control. As our minimum EBITDA covenants are
tested monthly on a year-to-date basis, unanticipated results with respect to any given monthly
period may have an adverse effect on compliance with such covenants. There can be no
assurances that we will maintain compliance with the minimum EBITDA covenants under our ABL
Facility or Term Loan.
If we fail to comply with our minimum EBITDA financial maintenance covenant, we would request
a waiver from the lenders or may be required to repay the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility
and/or Term Loan. Failure to obtain a waiver or cure the default through repayment of the facility
would create an event of cross default under our other credit facilities and indentures, including the
ABL Facility, the Term Loan and the Indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes. There
can be no assurance that the lenders will grant a waiver, and we currently do not have sufficient
liquidity, including cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance of any such indebtedness.

We may not be able to generate a sufficient amount of cash flow to meet our debt service
obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, which could adversely affect our ability to raise
additional capital to fund operations or limit our ability to react to changes in the economy.
Our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect our
indebtedness will depend on our financial and operating performance which, in turn, is subject to
prevailing economic conditions and to certain financial, competitive, business and other factors,
including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets as well as the other risks
described herein, all of which are beyond our control. If our cash flow and capital resources are
insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and our other commitments, we could face
substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled expansions and
capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our
debt. In addition, we cannot assure you that our operating performance, cash flow and capital
resources will be sufficient for payment of our debt in the future. If we are unable to meet our debt
obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a
portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity.
Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In the event
that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt to meet our
debt service and other obligations, we cannot provide assurance that we could effect any of these
actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that these actions would
be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, the terms of our existing or future debt
agreements may restrict us from effecting certain or any of these alternatives.
If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:
•our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; and
•we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences, including the following:
•it may limit our ability to borrow money for our debt service requirements or other purposes;
a substantial portion of our cash flow will be dedicated to the repayment of our indebtedness and
will not be available for other purposes;
•
•it may limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our operations or business;
•
we are and will be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which may place us at a
competitive disadvantage;
•it may make us more vulnerable to downturns in our business or the economy;
•
it may restrict us from making strategic acquisitions, introducing new technologies or exploiting
business opportunities; and
•
it may limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among
other things, our ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets.
The terms of our the Indentures governing the 2018 Notes and the 2021 Notes, the ABL Facility
and the Term Loan may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond
to changes in our business or to take certain actions.
The terms of our Indentures governing the 2018 Notes and 2021 Notes (the “Indentures”), the ABL
Facility and the Term Loan contain, and the terms of any of other future indebtedness would likely
contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose certain operating and other restrictions.
Our Indentures, the ABL Facility and the Term Loan include covenants that, among other things,
restrict our ability to:
•incur additional debt;
52
Table of Contents
•pay dividends, redeem stock or make other distributions;
•make other restricted payments and investments;
•create liens;
•enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
•merge, consolidate or transfer or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and
•enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates.
A breach of any of the restrictive covenants in our Indentures would result in a default and, as a
result:
•our debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable; and
•we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.
The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in those agreements and any future
financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs
or to engage in other business activities.
Our ability to meet our obligations under our indebtedness depends in part on our earnings and
cash flows and those of our subsidiaries and on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay
dividends or advance or repay funds to us.
We conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries. Consequently, our ability to service our
debt is dependent, in large part, upon the earnings from the businesses conducted by our
subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to
pay any amounts to us, whether by dividends, loans, advances or other payments. The ability of
our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us depends on their earnings,
capital requirements and general financial conditions and is restricted by, among other things,
applicable corporate and other laws and regulations as well as, in the future, agreements to which
our subsidiaries may be a party.
We will recognize a significant amount of cancellation of indebtedness, which we refer to as
“COD” income, as a result of the restructuring transactions.
The exchange of the 2018 Notes for the 2021 Notes pursuant to the Exchange Offer and other
Restructuring Transactions will result in the recognition $212.2 million of COD income for United
States federal income tax purposes. However, we generally anticipate that any COD income that
we recognize in the Exchange Offer will be offset, at least in part, by our existing net operating
losses, or “NOLs,” and certain other tax attributes. We will incur a cash tax liability for “alternative
minimum tax” even if we otherwise have sufficient NOLs to offset all of the COD income from the
Exchange Offer and Restructuring Transactions. Under the “alternative minimum tax” provisions,
the use of NOLs is limited to 90% of alternative minimum taxable income.
Our ability to use net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses to
reduce future tax payments is limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is
possible that the restructuring transactions resulted in material additional limitations on our ability
to use our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, contain rules that limit
the ability of a company that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in
ownership of more than 50% of its stock over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss
and tax credit carryforwards and certain built-in losses recognized in years after the ownership
change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes involving shareholders
owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of a company and any change in ownership
arising from a new issuance of stock by the company. Generally, if an ownership change occurs,
the yearly taxable income limitation on the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards
and certain built-in losses is equal to the product of the applicable long term tax exempt rate and
the value of the company’s stock immediately before the ownership change. We may be unable to
offset our taxable income with losses, or our tax liability with credits, before such losses and
credits expire and therefore would incur larger federal income tax liability. The restructuring
transactions completed to date may have resulted in a change in control as defined by Section
382, or could result in a change in control in the future.
