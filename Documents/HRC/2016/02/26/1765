<p><i>Summary 
</i> Since January 2011, Tunisia has rapidly undertaken a multiplicity of transitional 
justice initiatives, mainly related to truth-seeking and reparations. While successive 
Governments have commendably striven to respond expeditiously to emerging claims from 
victims, there is an urgent need to place the largely unrelated and ad hoc measures taken to 
date in a comprehensive framework.  
</p>
<p> The transitional justice measures adopted in Tunisia have been mainly designed with 
an &#8220;event-based&#8221; or &#8220;period-based&#8221; approach, which has led to the creation of different 
categories of victims of past gross human rights violations and, as a result, to a serious 
fragmentation among those groups, as well as within society itself. The central means to 
reversing this trend consists in the adoption of a human rights perspective that treats gross 
violations of certain types of rights as the sole factor giving access to redress and other 
transitional justice measures, regardless of the event or period when the violation occurred, 
the cause to which the victims may have adhered or the group to which the victim belongs. 
</p>
<p> With human rights at the core of the transitional justice agenda, more headway needs 
to be made urgently in the areas of guarantees of non-recurrence and prosecutions. The 
establishment of effective institutions, mechanisms and procedures is central to the prevention 
of the recurrence of similar gross human rights violations. This chiefly includes legal,

<p> United Nations A/HRC/24/42/Add.<footnote name="1">2. One of the first initiatives was the establishment in February 2011 of the National 
Fact-Finding Commission. The Commission was mandated by decree-law 8/2011 to 
investigate abuses and violations that occurred in the period of 17 December 2010 until the 
accomplishment of the Commission&#8217;s objectives. The Commission Chairman was 
appointed by decree, and he in turn selected the other 15 Commission members from 
among independent competent national personalities, including nine women, following 
consultations with civil society.

<p>institutional and personnel reforms in the crucial areas of justice and security. Lack of reform 
in these areas coupled with the persisting failure to bring alleged perpetrators of gross 
violation to justice might in the long term lead to a situation where trust of the population in 
State institutions is virtually impossible to re-establish.  
</p>
<p> Prosecutions and trials, besides aiming at establishing a chain of command leading up 
to the actual gross violation, should abide by international human rights standards and allow 
for effective victim participation. Only transitional justice measures that are designed and 
implemented in a manner compliant with the rule of law and centred on the notion of human 
rights will be sustainable and effective in enhancing and protecting human rights, reversing 
the fragmentation process and furthering reconciliation as a final objective.

given that a multitude of donors, each with their own preferred project, interests, approach 
and set of requirements, can easily lead to an overload of projects without sufficient focus. 
Coherent reforms require an ongoing process of consultations and coordination among 
agencies interested in supporting the various areas of transitional justice, together with the 
Tunisian authorities, to agree on an efficient division of labour and thus ensure that the 
country does not lose sight of its core objectives.  </footnote> 4

The four transitional justice areas straddle the competencies of not only the Ministries of 
Justice, the Interior and Human Rights, but also of Finance, Education, Health, and Social, 
Family and Gender Affairs, as well as others. They necessarily require their close and 
transparent collaboration. In his discussions with several ministries, the Special Rapporteur 
noted a limited awareness of the importance of effective collaboration and the significant 
effort called for in the implementation of relevant measures. He therefore reiterates that 
inter-agency collaboration is crucial to address the important challenges that lie ahead and 
to guarantee adequate service delivery to victims.

<p>the displacement of human rights ...................................................................  10&#8211;<footnote name="2">6. Another consequence of adopting an event-based approach to redress is the tendency 
to over-emphasize the reliance on reparation &#8211; and indeed, on monetary compensation&#8212;
perhaps to the detriment of other transitional justice dimensions. While acknowledging that 
the needs of victims is urgent and that addressing them is something that cannot be 
postponed, the Special Rapporteur warns that reparations, particularly in the form of 
financial compensation, without systematic truth-seeking, justice and the various aspects of 
institutional reform, as well as other guarantees of non-recurrence, risk compromising their 
character as justice measures and may become, in the eyes of many, tokens of 
compensation distributed in order to gain the acquiescence of victims. This view was 
reflected in the opinions of victims brought to his attention who had refused to accept 
financial compensation in the absence of any actual prospect of discovering the truth of the 
violations endured.

point that the technical committee of the recently established Ministry of Human Rights and 
Transitional Justice had already produced a first version. On 22 January 2013, the bill was

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 18/7, the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion of truth, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, 
conducted an official visit to Tunisia from 11 to 16 November 2012, at the invitation of the 
Government. 
</p>
<p>2. The purpose of the visit was to assess the measures taken by the Government in the 
areas of truth-seeking, justice, reparation and guarantees of non-recurrence, and to advise 
the authorities and society on finding sustainable ways in the process of transitioning to an 
order based on the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Minister for Human Rights and 
Transitional Justice, the Minister for Justice, the Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry 
of Finance, the Deputy Chief of Cabinet at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Rights 
and Liberties Commission of the National Constituent Assembly. He also held meetings 
with the Court of Cassation and the Directorate of Military Justice. While in Tunis, he 
conducted meetings with the Technical Committee on Transitional Justice, the National 
Fact-Finding Commission and the National Commission of Investigation on Corruption and 
Embezzlement. He also travelled to Sidi Bouzid, where he met the Governor and the chiefs 
of police and of the national guard. In Gafsa, the Special Rapporteur met with the Regional 
Technical Subcommittee on Transitional Justice. During his mission, he met with a large 
number of victims and a wide range of civil society and professional associations in Tunis, 
Sidi Bouzid and Redeyef. He also held meetings with the United Nations country team and 
the diplomatic corps. He thanks everyone who shared their valuable and important 
experiences and insights. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the invitation and the 
cooperation extended to him throughout his visit. He also expresses his appreciation to the 
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Tunisia 
for its support in the preparation of and during the visit.

<p>affiliation to the posts of the Minister for Justice, for the Interior, for Defence and for 
Foreign Affairs. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Continuing and new human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>8. Prior to the uprising, Tunisia was party to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination , the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the two Optional Protocols 
thereto, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women 
and the Optional Protocol thereto, and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto.  
</p>
<p>9. Following the ousting of President Ben Ali, Tunisia acceded to the Optional 
Protocol to Convention against Torture, the first Optional Protocol to the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Convention for the Protection 
of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance. In October 2012, the Government issued a 
decree withdrawing all previous reservations made with regard to the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The State also ratified the 
Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Underlying challenges to the transitional justice process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Proliferation of event-based redress initiatives and the displacement of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p>10. Since January 2011, Tunisia has rapidly undertaken a multiplicity of transitional 
justice initiatives, mainly related to truth-seeking and reparations. Such initiatives are 
interpreted by the Special Rapporteur as a commendable indication of the interest on the 
part of the Government and of the determination of civil society to take seriously the issues 
of concern to his mandate.  
</p>
<p>11. A central characteristic shared by all the initiatives is that they are designed around 
specific events or periods of time rather than on types of human rights violations. In the 
present report, the Special Rapporteur will elaborate on the significance of this choice.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. National Fact-Finding Commission 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>14. While struggling with the lack of precise regulations regarding the procedures to be 
employed, the unclear time frame of the mandate and insufficient financial means to 
accomplish its objectives, the Commission contributed significantly to the ongoing truth-
seeking process. The report of the Commission,1 issued in May 2012 and more than 1,000 
pages long, documented 338 deaths and the wounding of 2,147 people during the period 
from 17 December 2010 to 23 October 2011, and affirmed that 132 persons had been killed 
and 1,452 injured in the period between 17 December 2010 and 14 January 2011. The 
names of the deceased or injured victims were listed in the annex to the report. According 
to the Commission, 66 per cent of those killed had died from gunshot wounds. In addition, 
it found that 82 per cent of fatalities and 76 per cent of those injured were younger than 40 
years of age, and that 95 per cent of all victims were male. In its report, the Commission 
indicated that institutional responsibilities for the violence lay with the Presidency and the 
Ministries of the Interior, Defence, Health and Communication. It also found that police 
forces appeared to have been responsible for 99 per cent of the violations between 17 
December 2010 and 14 January 2011 investigated by the Commission. After that date, the 
military, having assumed some internal order functions, was considered responsible for 49 
per cent of violations.  
</p>
<p>15.  The Commission recommended a series of legislative and institutional reforms, 
including human rights protection at the constitutional level, effective victim and witness 
protection, the reform of the justice, security and penitentiary systems, as well as of the 
media. The Commission made specific recommendations in relation to other transitional 
justice measures, such as the establishment of a reparations programme for victims and 
their families, including adequate medical treatment, and the establishment of a &#8220;truth 
entity&#8221;, the functions and period of investigation of which were to be specified by a 
national debate.  
</p>
<p>16. In the discussion with the Special Rapporteur, the members of the Commission 
indicated that they had not been informed about the steps that the Government had taken 
following the submission of the Commission report, and how the Commission&#8217;s work 
would feed, or has fed, into any official actions taken. The Commission noted the 
discrepancy between the numbers of victims listed in the annex to the report and the lists of 
victims drawn up by other entities. Some members pointed to the deteriorating situation of 
a large number of victims owing to the absence of official rehabilitation programmes, and 
noted that assistance was mainly provided by private associations. Specifically, the 
members mentioned the concern to reintegrate victims into society, which they considered 
particularly important given that the majority of the victims were under 40 years of age. 
Bearing in mind the wealth of information accumulated by the Commission, the Special 
Rapporteur finds it disappointing that the Commission seems not to have been involved in 
discussions on the overall transitional justice strategy.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Reparation and amnesty for former political prisoners 
</b></p>
<p>17. On 19 February 2011, the first interim Government issued a decree-law granting 
amnesty to more than 500 political prisoners of the former regime, most of whom had been 
convicted or were facing charges under the counter-terrorism law. Article 2 of the decree-
law stipulated that all those concerned by the amnesty also had a right to be reintegrated 
into their previous employment and could request reparation. While prisoners have been 
released and some of them reintegrated, lack of action on reparation has led to protests and 
discontent.

<p><b> 3. Financial compensation for victims of the revolution 
</b></p>
<p>18. According to the information received, the interim authorities governing until 
October 2011 provided relatives of those killed during the uprising with financial 
compensation of two instalments of 20,000 Tunisian Dinars (around $12,750) in February 
and December 2011, respectively. Injured persons received two instalments of 3,000 
Tunisian Dinars each ($1,900). It appears, however, that no clear criteria were defined to 
determine who had been injured as a result of excessive use of force by the State. 
Furthermore, the beneficiaries seem to have not been informed about the rationale for and 
amount of compensation. The Special Rapporteur received information according to which 
several families of those killed had partly refused compensation, raising claims for justice 
and revelation of the truth; others are still waiting to receive the compensation promised.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Reparation for &#8220;martyrs&#8221; and their families 
</b></p>
<p>19. On 24 October 2011, decree law No. 97 on reparation for the families of the 
&#8220;martyrs&#8221; and wounded persons of the revolution was promulgated. &#8220;Martyrs&#8221; were 
defined as &#8220;persons who risked their lives for the revolution, died or were victims of 
physical harm causing them an infirmity, during the period extending from 17 December 
2010 to 19 February 2011&#8221;. The decree created the Commission for the Martyrs and Injured 
of the Revolution, to be in charge of coordinating the compensation process and preparing a 
list of eligible persons. 
</p>
<p>20. The decree-law provided for compensatory measures for victims and families of 
martyrs, including a monthly pension, free medical care in public hospitals and free public 
transport. While free medical care in public hospitals was offered, the injuries of some 
victims required equipment and/or treatment that the public facilities did not have or could 
provide. According to the information received, medical care did not extend to 
psychosocial treatment. 
</p>
<p>21. Other measures contained in the decree-law were of symbolic character, such as the 
construction of a monument paying homage to the martyrs and other victims of the 
revolution, the establishment of a museum for the preservation of national memory, the 
naming of streets and public squares after martyrs and the annual celebration of the 
anniversary of the revolution.2 The decree-law also provides for the incorporation of a 
chapter on the struggle of human rights defenders during the revolution in school 
programmes. While the renaming of places and streets seems to be ongoing, the Special 
Rapporteur was not able to ascertain the progress made in relation to changes made to 
curricula in public education.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Displacement of a human rights-based approach and social fragmentation  
</b></p>
<p>22. The measures mentioned were initiated in an ad hoc manner and designed to provide 
redress to victims of specific events or periods of time. While the Special Rapporteur 
commends the willingness of the Government to undertake such initiatives, an &#8220;event-
based&#8221; approach inevitably has serious consequences, the main one being that it gives rise, 
by its very nature, to different categories of victims and, ultimately, that it both manifests 
and results in the displacement of the notion of human rights. With an event-based 
approach, access to the various initiatives for redress is triggered not by rights but by 
affiliation or some other reason, thereby defeating one of the fundamental aims of 
transitional justice measures, which is to strengthen human rights regimes.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>23. The measures taken to date have come with conditions, being associated with a 
specific event or period of time. With no such affiliation, no redress is available. This 
concern was specifically raised in meetings that the Special Rapporteur held with victims 
and civil society in the region of Gafsa, and particularly in Redeyef, where an uprising in 
2008 led to gross human rights violations that, at the time of the visit, remained 
unaddressed, given that these events were not on the list of events covered by a specific 
initiative. Since then, access to some of the measures has been granted to some of these 
victims through their integration into an initiative covering another event. The disparities in 
treatment for victims, however, only highlight the complications engendered by the event-
based approach.   
</p>
<p>24.  The Special Rapporteur stresses that, from a human rights standpoint, the violation 
of a right is a proper and sufficient reason to establish and secure access to redress 
mechanisms, including truth, justice, reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence. In this 
connection, he expresses the hope that the centrality of the category of &#8220;martyrs&#8221; in 
discussions about transitional justice in Tunisia does not obscure the fact that 
considerations such as the antecedent behaviour of the victim, desert or the identity of the 
perpetrator are not relevant when justifying the provision of redress. Against this 
background, the Special Rapporteur stresses that the obligations concerning justice, truth, 
reparations and guarantees of non-recurrence are a matter of human rights and of universal 
entitlement, and not dependent upon praiseworthy behaviour, having made a contribution to 
any given cause, having a particular affiliation or having participated or not in a particular 
set of events. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that the creation of different categories of 
victims through the establishment of initiatives dedicated to the redress of the victims not of 
human rights violations in general but of a particular set of events constitutes the most 
serious challenge facing the transitional justice process in the country. Such classification 
has rapidly evolved into a fragmentation among different categories of victims, and raises 
the question of equality of treatment not just among the different categories thus generated 
but, even more fundamentally, among them and victims who have suffered gross violations 
of a similar kind, except not during events/periods that have been the subject of one of the 
initiatives. This further undermines the idea that transitional justice measures are both the 
means to and manifestations of strengthening human rights regimes.

<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>spelled out previously by the Special Rapporteur.3 It is therefore necessary that the 
measures be conceived and implemented as part of an integrated policy.4 
</p>
<p><b> C. The continuing challenges of inclusiveness 
</b></p>
<p>28. In an effort to address the shortcomings of ad hoc transitional justice initiatives, the 
authorities have taken some noteworthy steps (whether these measures are also sufficiently 
human rights-centred to confront the problem addressed above is an independent question, 
the answer to which is pending). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Ministry for Human Rights and Transitional Justice 
</b>29. On 19 January 2012, the Government, by decree 2012-22, established the Ministry 
for Human Rights and Transitional Justice, tasked to develop strategies to address human 
rights violations committed in the past &#8220;on the basis of the pursuit of the truth, judgement 
and reconciliation in accordance with the principles of transitional justice as adopted at the 
national level, in order to reinforce the democratic transition and to contribute to national 
reconciliation&#8221;, as well as guaranteeing and promoting human rights. The Special 
Rapporteur notes the concerns expressed by various stakeholders that the Ministry may 
limit the role played by civil society and its involvement in the deliberations regarding the 
overall transitional justice framework. Whether their concerns are valid depends much on 
the openness that the Ministry shows to civil society. While there is nothing in the 
establishment of such a Ministry that makes the expressed concern unavoidable, it seems 
that, in practice, the Ministry has yet to allay the apprehensions of civil society.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. National consultations insufficient to mend the fragmentation of society 
</b></p>
<p>30. In an order issued by the Ministry of Human Rights and Transitional Justice on 9 
October 2012, a technical committee, to be facilitated by the Ministry, was tasked to 
prepare a bill on transitional justice to be submitted to the National Constituent Assembly. 
The Committee expressed an interest in establishing a national consultation as part of the 
process and, to that effect, carried out an ambitious and formally organized national 
dialogue on transitional justice. Interest in consultations is often expressed in transitional 
situations but rarely institutionalized; hence, the Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight the 
underlying commitment to such consultation processes and to commend the Committee for 
taking this issue seriously. There is much to appreciate in the plan to have formally 
organized consultations and, particularly, in the idea of taking the consultations to the 
regions. Given the relative dearth of formal experience with processes of this scope in other 
transitional situations, the difficulties posed by such an endeavour should not be 
underestimated.    
</p>
<p>31. The process was divided into two stages. In April 2012, a national dialogue on three 
thematic issues was held in Tunis. The second stage was held for a period of three weeks in 
September and October 2012, with 24 consultations organized in different regions of the 
country. Apparently, no official consultations have been held since.  
</p>
<p>32. In meetings the Special Rapporteur held in different parts of the country, questions 
were repeatedly raised about whether the consultations had elicited the views of a 
sufficiently broad range of stakeholders and, more specifically, about the criteria used for 
selecting participants in them. The view that political affiliation was used in a way that

expressed. Furthermore, the voices of women, so crucial in the deliberations of a country on 
how to move ahead, were not sufficiently represented.  
</p>
<p>33. In conversations held, and in particular in those held outside the capital, the Special 
Rapporteur learned that the consultations had been unable to bridge the gap between the 
urban coast and the interior of the country. As such, they seem to have tracked the status 
quo ante that the very transitional justice process is intended to address.  
34.  Lastly, and with an eye to both the future of the experience in Tunisia and further 
consultation efforts elsewhere, the Special Rapporteur takes the opportunity to emphasize 
that, regardless of how ambitious and well-intended the structure of formal dialogues are, 
consultations should not be conceived of as one-off instances. Capturing with sufficient 
sensitivity and efficacy the views of individuals and civil society about transitional justice 
requires the establishment of ongoing mechanisms of consultation. This is particularly 
important in contexts where at least in some areas and with respect to some topics 
individuals have been given few reasons to think that they are entitled to raise claims based 
on rights, so their views about questions of justice are developing over time and, it is hoped, 
aided by the transitional justice processes themselves.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Achieving a comprehensive transitional justice strategy through a truth 
commission 
</b></p>
<p>35. One suitable opportunity to place the ad hoc transitional justice initiatives into a 
comprehensive framework was provided by the work on the draft basic law on the 
foundations and fields of transitional justice. The Special Rapporteur commends the 
technical committee and the Ministry for their efforts to create a legal framework that refers 
to the four elements of transitional justice and provides for the possibility of adopting a 
more systematic approach to transitional justice.  
36. The Special Rapporteur would like to briefly make his main observations and 
express his concerns regarding the bill of January 2013.5 As a first general observation, it 
should be noted that the bill is more expansive with regard to the definition of terms and 
internal functions than overall strategy. Indeed, the bill is more a law establishing a truth 
commission (albeit one with a broad set of functions, to be discussed below) than a law on 
transitional justice expressing a truly comprehensive approach to the issue. For instance, the 
bill is short on questions of institutional reforms and criminal prosecutions.  
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Mandate and functions of the commission 
</b></p>
<p>37. In addition to the function of investigating and disclosing the truth concerning 
human rights violations familiar from truth commissions worldwide, the bill assigns to the 
commission notably ambitious functions on reparations and issues relating to corruption. 
First, it would be responsible not merely for making recommendations concerning 
reparations but also for administering a reparations programme of its own creation. Second, 
the bill attributes to the commission broad powers to deal with the issue of corruption, to 
both recommend institutional reforms and address individual corruption cases through an 
arbitration and reconciliation committee. This is a novel experiment that, predictably, will 
pose significant challenges, not the least given the range of competencies called for by the 
commission&#8217;s different functions. Truth commissions with simpler attributions have already 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
  The Special Rapporteur will share a more detailed analysis of the bill in his ongoing bilateral 
</p>
<p>exchanges with the Government of Tunisia. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>faced challenges in meeting their goals. The Special Rapporteur stresses that some of the 
functions that the bill assigns to the commission, for example, the administration of 
reparations and the work on corruption cases, will very likely overburden the commission 
and, as a consequence, distract it from its very core functions as a truth commission.  
</p>
<p>38. Specifically, the work on financial files, which will, in accordance with the bill, give 
the commission arbitration functions with an eye to the settlement of cases, will not only 
bring an enormous administrative burden but also carry significant reputation and 
credibility risks, given that arbitration in matters of corruption is likely to be controversial. 
Settling individual cases of corruption will require quasi-judicial procedures in order to 
guarantee minimal fairness in decisions that cannot be appealed; a huge workload is 
therefore to be expected. Settling cases by arbitration will involve a significant likelihood 
of defeating the expectations of the public, which is likely to have maximalist aspirations of 
recovery and punishment, even when the main parties to arbitration find the outcome 
acceptable; hence the reputation and credibility risks.  
</p>
<p>39. The particularly broad mixture of functions assigned to the commission is 
challenging not only on account of the different technical competencies required to carry 
out human rights investigations and at the same time deal with the financial files, but also in 
terms of the dispositions required for completing these different tasks successfully, and the 
criteria by which these efforts will be assessed. The very same commission that is mandated 
to be proactive with recommendations for prosecutions and vetting will also be expected to 
act as an arbitration and settlement body. The Special Rapporteur would like to highlight 
the importance of anticipating the enormous challenges and internal tensions that this 
combination of functions is likely to generate.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Selection of commission members 
</b></p>
<p>40. The seriousness of the transitional justice efforts made by the Government will be 
judged as initio by the political will to establish a selection mechanism that allows for the 
appointment of truly impartial and independent commissioners. According to articles 20 to 
27, the bill leaves the responsibility for selecting the members of the independent truth and 
dignity commission to a political body, the National Constituent Assembly, and, in first 
instance, to a committee composed of the President or Vice President of the Assembly and 
the presidents of the parliamentary blocs. Leaving the selection of commissioners to a 
political body is not objectionable; in the given circumstances, however, and in the light of 
recent political tensions and the above-mentioned social fragmentation, the authorities may 
well consider the establishment of additional procedural safeguards to ensure the 
commission&#8217;s independence in both its functioning and appearance. Such safeguards could 
include a clearer nominating process, which would encourage greater involvement of civil 
society in proposing candidates; requiring the Assembly to hold public hearings with and 
about at least a short list of candidates; making changes to the first instance appointment 
procedure so that this responsibility is not given to a committee likely to track existing 
political lines; and tightening the criteria of eligibility of commission members so that only 
persons with a track record of independence of all narrow partisan affiliations (and not just 
independence of one party as in the current draft (art. 23)) are considered.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Uneven prosecutions and concerns about the use of military justice  
 1. Scope, systematic nature and impartiality of prosecutorial efforts  
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>level. In the Le Kef trial, former President Ben Ali, two former Ministers for the Interior, 
four Directors General of the Security Forces and 16 other high-ranking and lower-ranking 
members of the security forces stood trial before the Le Kef Permanent Military Tribunal 
for the murder and attempted murder of demonstrators in the governorates of Le Kef, 
Jenouba, B&#233;ja, Siliana, Kasserine and Kairouan in the period from 17 December 2010 to 14 
January 2011. In June 2012, the trial resulted in 13 convictions, including a life sentence in 
absentia for the former President and 12 years of imprisonment for former Minister for the 
Interior Rafik Haj Kacem. In the Tunis trial, 43 defendants, including Ben Ali and high-
ranking officials of the security sector, were tried before the Permanent Military Tribunal of 
Tunis for the killing of protesters in the cities of Tunis, Ariana, al-Manouba, Ben Arous, 
Bizerte, Nabeul, Zaghouan, Sousse and Monastir. This resulted in July 2012 in a life 
sentence for the former President, and prison sentences from five to 20 years for other high-
ranking officials. Both the Le Kef and the Tunis trials are now being appealed. In addition, 
proceedings were held before the Permanent Military Tribunal of Tunis and the Permanent 
Military Tribunal of Sfax against lower-level members of the internal security services for 
killings in Ouardanine, and Sfax and Regueb, respectively.  
</p>
<p>42.  Efforts to ensure criminal justice after a transition are complex and may be subject 
to criticism of various sorts, even by supporters of the idea of using courts in such 
circumstances - which, the Special Rapporteur strongly emphasizes, is a matter of legal 
obligation. It is important to distinguish three different types of criticisms. Prosecutorial 
efforts and trials may be (a) too narrow, focusing on too few cases and individuals; (b) 
disorganized, unsystematic, haphazard, obeying no clear strategy; and (c) politically biased, 
targeting only some individuals that can be safely scapegoated, thereby offering de facto 
immunity to others, for partisan political reasons.  
</p>
<p>43. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur heard accounts of the above-mentioned 
types of criticism, among others. The fact that some trials have been held and that they have 
included high-ranking members of the previous regime is noteworthy. It is nonetheless 
evident that a significant number of perpetrators alleged to have been involved in the 
commission of gross violations during the uprising have not yet been prosecuted or tried.  
</p>
<p>44. Even setting aside reservations regarding in absentia trials, ultimately, the sincerity 
of criminal justice efforts cannot be asserted merely by the willingness to open prosecutions 
or even try cases of members of a previous regime not only wholly discredited but largely 
on the run. The real test will rather be whether the criminal justice system is both allowed 
and enabled to operate wherever the evidence leads it, and on the basis of clear and 
deliberate investigatory and prosecutorial strategies that reflect a commitment to attaining a 
full picture of the entire chain of command that made the violations possible, and to holding 
to account those responsible, regardless of all other considerations, including their current 
status or past political affiliations. As argued by the Special Rapporteur in his report 
submitted to the General Assembly, criminal prosecutions that are not derailed by the 
positions of power of alleged perpetrators or influenced by political considerations are an 
effective way of signalling a commitment to the idea that the law applies equally to 
everyone, a basic dimension of the rule of law.6  
</p>
<p>45. Nothing in the visit persuaded the Special Rapporteur that a comprehensive 
prosecutorial strategy to deal with alleged cases of gross human rights violations had been 
set in place. Investigations, prosecutions and trials against perpetrators of alleged gross 
human rights violations committed prior to the uprising, in particular during the 
administration of Ben Ali, as well as those relating to the uprising itself, have been 
conducted to date in what appears to be an ad hoc manner, despite the fact that the cases 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>involve violations that include torture and other forms of ill-treatment, secret detention and 
widespread prolonged arbitrary detention &#8211; in other words, the sort of system crimes that 
require complex and relatively stable structures, the dismantlement of which requires 
deliberate and comprehensive prosecutorial strategies.7  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Use of military courts 
</b></p>
<p>46. According to article 22 of the Law on Internal Security Forces, military courts have 
the competence for offences committed by members of the security forces in the course of 
duty, regardless of the identity of the victim. As a result, all complaints against law 
enforcement officers, including those relating to gross human rights violations, are tried 
before military courts in Tunisia. 
</p>
<p>47. Decree-law No. 69 of 2011, amending the Military Justice Law of 1957, introduced 
new elements aimed at providing attributions of independence to the military justice 
system. The main changes included the removal of the obligation of the general prosecutor 
to inform and receive confirmation from the Minister for Defence prior to criminal 
proceedings; the revocation of the power of the Minister for Defence to suspend the 
execution of convictions issued by military courts; the creation of a two-tier jurisdiction 
structure headed by the Court of Cassation; mixed composition of military courts, securing 
the participation of both military and civilian judges; and the establishment of a military 
judicial council in charge of appointments, promotions and disciplinary measures.  
48. While appreciating the various reforms steps taken, the Special Rapporteur notes 
that the institutional independence of military judges remains questionable by the fact that 
the Minister for Defence presides over the above-mentioned military judicial council. 
Furthermore, military judges are appointed by decree following the proposal by the 
Minister further to a decision of the said council; civilian judges are appointed by decree 
following a proposal by the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence.  
</p>
<p>49.  The Special Rapporteur would like to note positively that law No. 9 of 29 July 2011 
entitles victims to be a <i>partie civile</i> in proceedings before military courts and to make 
claims for reparation for the harm suffered on the basis of the rules applicable in the 
ordinary criminal procedure code. While this judicial route should have been possible for 
victims having participated in proceedings before military courts after 29 July 2011, 
including the Le Kef and Tunis trials, the Special Rapporteur was not in a position to 
ascertain the practical impact that this new provision has on victims, and particularly the 
effectiveness of their rights to justice and reparation. He nonetheless takes this opportunity 
to stress the importance of victims&#8217; participation in such trials, particularly given that they 
relate to alleged gross human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>50. In discussions with various stakeholders, the Special Rapporteur learned that a large 
proportion of the population sees the military courts as being more independent than the 
civilian justice courts. He associates this perception with the important reforms undertaken 
in the area of the military justice system and the special role played by the military during 
the period from December 2010 to January 2011, both of which need to be acknowledged. 
The lack of measureable progress in reforming the civilian court system is, however, also 
inevitably behind this widespread perception. The fact that citizens consider military courts 
to be more effective in securing their rights than civilian courts speaks to the challenges that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
  One of the cases relating to the Ben Ali era is that of Barraket Essahel, in which 244 members of the 
</p>
<p>military were arrested on the accusation of having prepared a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in 1991, a large number of 
whom were subsequently subjected to torture and other ill-treatment. The former President was 
sentenced to five years of imprisonment in 2012; other high-level officials received between two to 
five years (raising additional questions with regard to proportionality between crime and sentence).  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>the judicial system in Tunisia currently faces. Obviously, the solution cannot consist merely 
in a decision to move to unreformed civilian courts; such a solution also lies in an earnest 
and systematic effort to improve their reliability.  
</p>
<p>51. In discussions held with the Directorate of Military Justice, the Special Rapporteur 
learned of plans to specialize the military justice system further in order to minimize the 
appearance of civilians before military courts. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
highlights the need to shift the competence to try members of security and military forces 
for human rights violations to the civilian justice system, a process that should be pursued 
alongside comprehensive reform of the civilian judiciary, to guarantee its full independence 
and impartiality.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Insufficient progress in guarantees of non-recurrence 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur notes, in particular in the context of the Constitution 
drafting process, an increasing awareness of the importance to put in place institutions and 
procedures to prevent the recurrence of gross human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Strengthened human rights protection  
</b></p>
<p>53. Since October 2011, the National Constituent Assembly has been working on a new 
draft Constitution. The Special Rapporteur notes the catalogue of rights and freedoms 
enshrined in articles 22 to 48 of the third draft. The initiative to establish an independent 
constitutional court with which individuals may directly file complaints on alleged 
violations of their constitutional rights and freedoms is a commendable project. 
Furthermore, he also took note of the plans to establish an authority of good governance 
and anti-corruption as an action following up on the suggestions made by the National 
Commission of Investigation on Corruption and Embezzlement. 
</p>
<p>54. Furthermore, a number of key pieces of legislation central to the right of citizens to 
participate in political life, including laws on political parties, freedom of association, 
assembly and expression, and press and media freedom have been adopted following 
respective draft legislation prepared by the High Commission for the Realization of 
Revolution Objectives, Political Reforms and Democratic Transition.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Justice sector reform  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Judicial system under the former regime 
</i>55. The judicial system under the previous regime was characterized by a judiciary that 
was heavily influenced by the executive.8 The majority of members of the former High 
Judicial Council came from the executive branch or were magistrates appointed by the 
Government. Only a minority of members was elected. Under the former Constitution, the 
Council was in charge of the appointment, promotion and transfer of and disciplinary 
measures against magistrates. It was the executive branch, however, that played the 
decisive role in appointments. The majority of magistrates were appointed by presidential 
decree on the proposal of the High Judicial Council, while higher-level judicial positions 
were directly filled by the executive branch. Judges who had the courage to speak out 
against the misuse of the judiciary for political interests were often arbitrarily transferred to 
distant regions without their consent. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Minister for Justice had the competence to initiate disciplinary proceedings 
against &#8220;any failure by a magistrate in duties, honour or dignity&#8221; before the Disciplinary 
Council of the High Judicial Council conducting the procedure. In the absence of a code of 
ethics defining the rules of judicial conduct and the elements that constitute a disciplinary 
offence, the Ministry and the Council were able to initiate proceedings without the minimal 
constraints afforded by a precise definition of the relevant &#8220;failures&#8221;. To make matters 
worse, after 2005, there was no judicial recourse possible before an administrative court 
against the disciplinary decision. Instead, the concerned judge had to address the Remedy 
Commission of the very same High Judicial Council.  
</p>
<p>57. Public prosecutors worked under the hierarchic control of their respective chiefs and 
the authority of the Ministry of Justice.9 This arrangement, combined with the discretionary 
power of the prosecutor to assign files to an investigating judge of his or her choice, led to a 
lack of effective investigations and prosecutions into gross human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><i> (b) Status of reform initiatives 
</i>58. The above-mentioned situation reflects a dire need for reform. Too little progress, 
however, has been made, indeed even initiated, in structural terms, in particular as the 
uprising occurred almost two and a half years ago. The strategic plan for 2012-2016 
prepared by the Ministry of Justice mainly contains reform initiatives aimed at modernizing 
the Ministry and strengthening the administration of the judiciary and judicial processes. 
The institutional reforms includes the creation of a &#8220;judicial pol&#8221; attached to the court of 
first instance of Tunis, in charge of corruption cases. The plan also envisages legislative 
revisions strengthening the autonomy of prosecutors and ensuring that lawyers have access 
to detained persons from the time of arrest. The plan does not, however, contain major 
proposals for structural reforms ensuring the independence and self-regulation of the 
judiciary.  
</p>
<p><i> (c) Absence of a functioning high judicial council 
</i>59. Following the adoption of the provisional Constitution in December 2011, the 
former High Judicial Council was suspended. A draft organic law for the establishment of a 
provisional body supervising the judiciary was submitted to the National Constituent 
Assembly in June 2012. This temporary body was meant to fill the gap until a new 
independent permanent judicial entity administering and overseeing the judiciary was 
created. Six months after the visit of the Special Rapporteur, the draft organic law had still 
not been adopted, and consequently no temporary body was in place. Given the central role 
that such a higher judicial entity has to play to ensure the independent, self-regulated 
administration of the judiciary, this delay undermines the reputation of and public 
confidence in the justice system. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Arbitrary dismissals 
</i>60. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur learned about several dismissals of judges, 
including the decision by the Ministry of Justice, published in July 2012, to dismiss several 
dozen magistrates two months earlier. In his discussion, the Minister for Justice noted that 
due process requirements had been afforded to the magistrates concerned. Nonetheless, the 
Minister failed to provide the Special Rapporteur with concrete figures or with detailed 
information. From several other meetings that the Special Rapporteur held, it appeared that 
the decisions had been made without adequate respect for due process guarantees, including 
for the right to be informed about the specific reasons for one&#8217;s dismissal. Instead, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>decisions were reportedly founded on broad, generalized allegations of corruption and of 
&#8220;loyalty to the former regime&#8221;. It also seemed that only after a professional judicial 
association declared a strike were the persons concerned granted the right to appeal to an 
administrative court. An undetermined but small number of the judges dismissed have 
reportedly been reinstated. 
</p>
<p>61. While highlighting that the vetting of members of the judiciary is a requirement for 
effective guarantees of non-recurrence, the Special Rapporteur underscores the fact that 
such initiatives should not be conducted in an arbitrary and piecemeal fashion, but rather as 
part of an overall strategy, and that dismissals can only follow procedures that are 
respectful of the requirements of the rule of law and international human rights standards. It 
is in this connection that he takes note of the draft organic law of 2012 pertaining to the 
vetting of the judiciary and legal profession. According to the draft, a committee is be 
established, comprising 11 members elected by an absolute majority of the National 
Constituent Assembly from among judges, attorneys at the Court of Cassation and 
academia specialized in law to investigate ex officio cases of financial corruption of 
members of the judiciary, cases pertaining to the rendering of illegal judgements, and other 
crimes committed within the framework of defending the former regime in the period from 
7 November 1987 to 14 January 2011. The decisions of the committee are to be appealable 
before the competent administrative court. The Special Rapporteur would like to stress that 
the draft Organic Law is, on the one hand, severely underdeveloped, even in terms of 
definitions and institutional set-up and procedures and, on the other, overambitious in that it 
includes in its purview the vetting of lawyers in private practice. He insists on the 
importance of guaranteeing that vetting processes comply with international due process 
standards.  
</p>
<p>62.  As an example of the need to view the different elements of transitional justice in a 
comprehensive manner, it should be noted that, without an actual vetting of the judiciary it 
is unlikely that the cases that the Truth and Dignity Commission will forward to the 
judiciary for prosecution in accordance with article 45 of the draft law could be dealt with 
in a reliable way.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Security sector 
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Security sector under the previous regime 
</i>63. The opacity of the structure of and procedures followed within the internal security 
sector under the former President and the secrecy of large parts of the relevant legislation 
make a detailed description difficult. The internal security services, consisting of the 
national police, the national guard, the civil protection force and prison guard functioned 
under the direct control of the President. 
</p>
<p>64. The intelligence apparatus was characterized by an absence of any publicly 
accessible regulation of its role and functions. The Directorate of State Security, with its 
<i>Police judiciaire</i>, which has been abolished in the meantime, largely misused legislation 
through an overly broad definition of terrorism. This unjustifiably restricted the enjoyment 
of human rights pertaining to the exercise of peaceful activities, including dissent and 
political opposition through legitimate associations.10  
</p>
<p>65. As concluded by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment following his mission to Tunisia in 2011, the systematic 
practice of torture and ill-treatment was deeply entrenched and institutionalized within the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>security sector, with torture being practised and abetted by law enforcement officials, the 
former State Security Department, the personnel of the Ministry of the Interior and prison 
staff, with complete impunity.11  
</p>
<p>66. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur held several meetings with victims of 
torture and other gross human rights violations and/or family members. Given the gross and 
systematic nature of the violations, which in their viciousness defy the notion that this is 
what a legitimate system of law would have required from its officers, the victims and their 
families understandably fail to see any justification for the continued membership of so 
many alleged perpetrators of torture or other gross violations in the security services. The 
family members of several victims referred to the difficulties of seeing those responsible for 
the torture or death of loved ones still wearing a uniform and performing official functions. 
These family members reported instances of repeated imprisonment and torture that, in 
several cases, led to death (in at least one case, insanity came first). In almost all cases, 
family members and direct victims referred to the disruptive impact on the employment and 
livelihood of the families that resulted not only from prolonged imprisonment and its 
natural consequences but also from the active efforts of security services to prevent victims 
(even post-release) from holding jobs by means of draconian administrative control 
measures.  
</p>
<p>67. In contrast to the internal security services, the military forces experienced rather 
limited political influence from the previous regime. The population remains grateful to the 
military for its refusal to follow the orders of the former President to shoot at demonstrators 
during the uprising. This is also one of the reasons for which the military is generally 
perceived as a mostly apolitical force focused on the defence of the country.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Status of reform initiatives 
</i>68. The information gathered by the Special Rapporteur would indicate that there has 
been no progress in the reform of the internal security forces. This concern does not regard 
so much the completion of structural security sector reforms, which is, admittedly, a 
complex and challenging undertaking, but rather the lack of any serious reform initiatives. 
This state of affairs is apparently due to the fact that several supporters of the former 
regime remain within the Ministry of the Interior, including in high-level positions.  
</p>
<p>69. While a number of high-level officials allied to the former regime were dismissed 
from the Ministry of the Interior in 2011, the dismissal in 2012 of key figures allegedly 
involved in gross human rights violations during the uprising was heavily opposed by the 
staff of the Ministry, including at high levels, and was eventually reversed. One high-level 
official in the Ministry suspected of involvement was promoted following an unsuccessful 
attempted dismissal. 
</p>
<p>70. Similarly, no apparent progress has been made in reforming the legislation of the 
security sector; much relevant legislation indeed remains unpublished. This situation is an 
obstruction to the process of transition. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
his view that legislative and structural reforms concerning the security sector, including the 
vetting of members of the security service, require a framework applicable to all, without 
discrimination, and should comply with international human rights standards.12

</p>
<p><i> (c) Calls by police for neutrality 
</i>71. The newly formed police associations have become vocal advocates for security 
sector reform. One of the main demands raised in conversations with the Special 
Rapporteur was ensuring that the principle of neutrality of the security services was 
enshrined in the new Constitution, in order to prevent any political instrumentalization of 
the internal security forces by the executive branch. He was also informed that the 
associations had submitted their own proposals for a reformed legal framework, including 
with regard to recruitment, promotions, training, remuneration and the preparation of a code 
of ethics. 
</p>
<p><i> (d) Need for urgent institutional restructuring and inquiry mechanisms 
</i>72. Transparency, oversight and accountability should be the guiding principles in the 
urgent institutional restructuring of the security sector. The establishment of effective 
mechanisms to enforce those principles, coupled with institutionalized vetting procedures 
that respect human rights standards, is a priority. Effective dialogue to this end of the 
authorities with civil society, including with relevant professional associations, should be 
the first step in this endeavour.  
</p>
<p>73. Past practices of torture and ill-treatment within the security sector should be 
investigated urgently and in an independent, impartial and expeditious manner, and the 
perpetrators found to be involved should be prosecuted and sanctioned in proportion to the 
violations committed. The cycle of impunity urgently needs to be broken. Measures for the 
prevention of similar gross violations should be put in place to ensure their non-recurrence, 
together with effective complaint procedures accessible to all. For example, safeguards 
during arrest and detention must be guaranteed in law and in practice, and a national 
preventive mechanism against torture should be established. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur warns that failure to address impunity would send a 
negative signal to Tunisian society. The lack of any visible reform coupled with the deep 
mistrust of the population in internal law enforcement bodies could in the long run lead to a 
situation where confidence in these institutions will be virtually impossible to re-establish.

<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> Since January 2011, Tunisia has rapidly undertaken a multiplicity of 
transitional justice initiatives that have mainly touched upon truth-seeking and 
reparations. While successive Governments have commendably striven to respond 
expeditiously to emerging claims from victims, there is an urgent need to place the 
largely unrelated and ad hoc measures taken to date in a comprehensive framework.  
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The transitional justice measures taken to date have been mainly designed with 
an &#8220;event-based&#8221; or &#8220;period-based&#8221; approach, which in itself gives rise to the creation 
of different categories of victims and, as a result, to a serious fragmentation among the 
different groups of victims thereby generated, as well as within the population, 
including civil society actors. If transitional justice measures are to be effective and 
society to come to terms with its past, this pattern of fragmentation needs to be 
urgently reversed.  
</b></p>
<p>79.<b> The essential means to reversing this trend consists in the adoption of a human 
rights perspective that treats gross violations of certain types of rights as the sole 
factor giving access to redress and other transitional justice measures, regardless of 
the event or period when the violation occurred or the group to which the victim 
belongs. It is the only effective remedy to charges of improvisation, favouritism and 
lack of systematization.  
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> With human rights at the core of the transitional justice agenda, more headway 
needs to be made urgently in the areas of guarantees of non-recurrence and 
prosecutions. The establishment of effective mechanisms is essential to the prevention 
of the recurrence of similar gross human rights violations. This chiefly includes legal, 
institutional and personnel reforms in the crucial areas of justice and security. Many 
alleged perpetrators of gross human rights violations remain active members of the 
security services. The Special Rapporteur warns that failure to address impunity 
would send a negative signal to Tunisian society. The lack of any visible reform 
coupled with the deep mistrust of the population in the justice and security sectors 
could, in the long run, lead to a situation where confidence in these institutions will be 
virtually impossible to re-establish. 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> Prosecutions should be conducted within the framework of an overall strategy 
aimed at retracing the complete chain of command leading up to the actual gross 
violation. Furthermore, prosecutions and trials should abide by international human 
rights standards and allow for effective victim participation. Only transitional justice 
measures that are designed and implemented in a manner compliant with the rule of 
law will be sustainable and effective in enhancing and protecting human rights, 
reversing the process of fragmentation and furthering reconciliation as one of the final 
objectives.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Special Rapporteur calls on the Tunisian authorities and society to place 
human rights at the centre of all transitional justice efforts. In this spirit, he makes the 
recommendations below. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p>83.<b> In the area of a comprehensive transitional justice strategy, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends that the authorities: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that the notion of human rights guides the design and 
implementation of all transitional justice measures; in particular, guarantee 
that the violation of human rights is a sufficient reason for access to redress 
measures rather than other considerations relating to affiliation with or 
contribution or opposition to any given cause, or any other contingent factor;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that a truly comprehensive policy, involving the four elements of 
transitional justice &#8211; truth, criminal justice, reparation and guarantees of non-
recurrence &#8211; is effectively adopted, avoiding overreliance on any element to the 
exclusion of others; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that the draft law on transitional justice, currently long on 
definitions but short on specifying functions, clearly establishes how the four 
different elements will be effectively adopted; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Ensure effective victim participation in all areas of transitional justice 
while providing for adequate protection schemes; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Find ways to ensure that the voices of society, and particularly victims, 
are taken into account in ongoing manner; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Take effective efforts to remedy shortcomings in consultations, such as 
by reaching out to all sectors of society in a non-discriminatory manner, 
including women, thereby bridging the gap between the urban coast and the 
country&#8217;s interior. Inclusive consultations are a precondition for reversing the 
trend of social fragmentation. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> In the area of truth-seeking, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
authorities: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Transparently present the actions taken and planned in response to the 
reports published by the National Fact-Finding Commission and the National 
Commission of Investigation on Corruption and Embezzlement, and explain 
how their findings and recommendations have been taken into account during 
the elaboration of the overall transitional justice strategy, and effectively 
incorporate the expertise and information of the two commissions in ongoing 
efforts; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Revisit the suggested competences, functions and responsibilities of the 
new Truth and Dignity Commission to ensure it delivers on its core objective. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> In the area of justice initiatives, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
authorities: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Facilitate the adoption of a coherent and systematic prosecution strategy 
that does not lend itself to charges that it is too narrow, ad hoc or politically 
biased; the strategy should aim at establishing the full chain of command for 
gross violations during the uprising and preceding periods; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Conduct prosecutions and trials in compliance with international human 
rights standards, and allow for the effective participation of victims in 
proceedings while affording adequate protection;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Adopt legislation and guarantee in practice that the investigation and 
jurisdiction of cases involving gross violations of human rights, including those 
with the alleged involvement of military and security forces, are transferred 
from military courts to the ordinary civilian justice system, and ensure that the </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p><b>jurisdiction of military tribunals is limited to military personnel who have 
committed military offences (assuming demonstrable progress by civilian 
courts); 
(d) Consider the possibility of retrials or review of cases, conducted in 
accordance with international fair trial standards, in ordinary civilian courts, 
including the proposed constitutional court, for cases involving gross human 
rights violations previously tried before military courts.  
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> With regard to reparation, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
authorities: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Take a human rights-based approach when designing and implementing 
reparation schemes; the same type of violations should trigger the same 
possibilities and equivalent forms of redress; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Ensure that there is no gender discrimination in relation to the provision 
of reparation, including financial compensation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Ensure that reparations include the provision of free medical and 
psychosocial assistance, on a continuing basis if warranted by the harm 
suffered, and measures that further the rehabilitation and reintegration of the 
victim and/or their family into society; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Given the devastating effect of decades of deliberate marginalization of 
entire areas of the country, include collective reparations in such reparation 
schemes, in addition to and distinct from regional development initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> With regard to guarantees of non-recurrence, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the authorities:  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(a)</b> <b>Adopt strong institutional and procedural provisions for human rights 
protection, and reform the public education system by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Considering extending planned individual complaints procedures before 
the proposed constitutional court to all violations of constitutional rights 
resulting from the unconstitutional implementation of any acts of public 
authority; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Strengthening the competences and role of the Higher Committee for 
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Revising the curricula of the public education programme to reflect 
historical changes, the importance of the rule of law in practice and the role 
that human rights defenders play in the transitional process. 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) In the area of judicial reform, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the authorities: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Adopt constitutional guarantees and legislation providing for the 
independence of the judiciary, and guarantee the conditions of service, 
appointment, mandate, promotion and discipline of magistrates in accordance 
with international standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Guarantee in law and in practice the self-regulation of the judiciary, 
including by putting an end to all forms of control and influence retained by the 
Minister for Justice; 
(iii) Prioritize the establishment and functioning of a permanent, 
independent high judicial council in charge of administering the judiciary, 
including appointments, promotions and disciplinary procedures; </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/24/42/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b>  
</p>
<p><b>(iv) Define standards of misconduct that would trigger disciplinary action, 
adopt an ethical code for the judiciary and ensure that the high judicial council 
is the body responsible for the initiation and conduct of any disciplinary 
proceedings, in compliance with international human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Gradually establish security of tenure guaranteeing the irremovable 
status of judges, coupled with vetting initiatives, applied in a systematic manner 
and compliant with international human rights standards of due process; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(vi) Guarantee, in law and in practice, the impartiality of the Office of the 
Public Prosecutor, thereby ending the authority and control exercised by the 
Minister for Justice. 
(c) In the security sector, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
authorities: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Clearly define the competences of the different internal security forces, 
including intelligence services, ensuring that there is no overlap of 
competences; and also, at the constitutional level, the function of the military in 
external defence; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Guarantee, in law and in practice, the neutrality of the internal security 
forces, to prevent them from being unduly instrumentalized by the executive 
branch; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iii) Establish effective oversight mechanisms to ensure transparency and 
accountability of the internal security forces, coupled with institutionalized 
vetting procedures that respect human rights standards; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(iv) Break the cycle of impunity and promptly investigate past practices of 
torture and ill-treatment, and other gross human rights violations, in an 
independent, impartial and expedient manner, and prosecute all allegedly 
involved perpetrators and sanction them, if found guilty, in a way 
commensurate with the violations committed; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(v) Effectively involve civil society, including victims and associations of law 
enforcement bodies, in deliberations on the design of security sector reform 
initiatives. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The Special Rapporteur suggests that the Government establish an inter-
agency coordination body to lead collaboration efforts on the implementation of the 
various transitional justice measures.  
</b>89.<b> Lastly, the Special Rapporteur suggests that efforts be made to coordinate 
international assistance on transitional justice to guarantee that different initiatives 
reinforce one another, avoid working at cross-purposes or overloading capacities for 
change. Such a coordination mechanism can take many different shapes. The Ministry 
of Human Rights and Transitional Justice, together with OHCHR in Tunis, for 
example, could play a facilitating role in this effort.
