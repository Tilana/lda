PETRO RIVER OIL CORP.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
For the three months ended July 31, 2015 and 2014
Petro River Oil Corp (the “Company”) is an independent exploration and production company with a focus on drilling, completion, recompletions, and applying modern
technologies to both conventional and unconventional oil and gas assets. The Company’s core holdings are in the Mid Continent region in Oklahoma and Kansas. The
Company’s operations are currently focused on the Mississippi Lime play, capitalizing on the experience, knowledge, and drilling techniques of its team. The Company is
driven to utilize its expertise both in the region and in similar formations to exploit hydrocarbon prone resources with tight and/or challenging characteristics in order to create
value for the Company and its shareholders. The Company’s principal administrative office is located in Houston, Texas and its principal operations are in Oklahoma with
secondary operations in Kansas and Western Missouri. The Company also has an office in New York, New York, which is also headquarters to Petro Spring LLC (“ Petro
Spring”), the Company’s technology focused subsidiary.
Petro River Oil LLC (“Petro”), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on March 3, 2011. Through proceeds received from the issuance of various promissory
notes, on February 1, 2012, Petro purchased various interests in oil and gas leases, wells, records, data and related personal property located along the Mississippi Lime play in
the state of Kansas from Metro Energy Corporation (“Metro”), a Louisiana company, and other interrelated entities, through a court approved order as Metro was undergoing
Chapter 11 Bankruptcy proceedings as a Debtor-In-Possession of these various oil and gas assets. Petro purchased these assets for cash consideration of $2,000,000 as well as
a 25% non-managing membership interest in Petro. The Company engaged Energy Source Advisors to renew a number of the leases acquired in the Metro purchase and to
lease additional acreage. As a result of the asset purchase from Metro and the completion of the additional lease renewals and additional acreage purchases, the Company
obtained a total of 115,000 gross (85,000 net acres) of leases, having unproven reserves at the time of acquisition, in the Mississippi Lime in Southeast Kansas for total cost of
$12.2 million.
On April 23, 2013, the Company executed a securities purchase agreement by and among the Company, Petro, and the investors in Petro (the “ Investors”), namely, the holders
of outstanding secured promissory notes of Petro (the “Notes”), and those holding membership interests in Petro (the “Membership Interests”, and, together with the Notes,
the “Acquired Securities”) sold by Petro (the “Share Exchange”). In the Share Exchange, the Investors exchanged their Acquired Securities for 591,021,011 newly issued
shares of the Company's common stock. Upon completion of the Share Exchange, Petro became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary.
As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company acquired 100% of the membership units of Petro and consequently, control of the business and operations of Petro. Under
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), because Petro’s former members and note holders held 80% of the issued and outstanding shares
of the Company as a result of the Share Exchange, Petro is deemed the accounting acquirer while the Company remains the legal acquirer. Petro adopted the fiscal year of the
Company. Prior to the Share Exchange, all historical financial statements presented are those of Petro. The equity of the Company is the historical equity of Petro, restated to
reflect the number of shares issued by the Company in the transaction.
 
Recent Developments
Acquistion of Havelide and Coalthane Assets.  On February 18, 2015, Petro Spring I, LLC ("Petro Spring I"), a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by Petro Spring,
entered  into  a  definitive  asset  purchase  agreement  ("Havelide  Purchase Agreement")  to  purchase  substantially  all  of  the  assets  of  Havelide  GTL  LLC  ("Havelide")  and
Coalthane Tech LLC ("Coalthane"), consisting of certain patents and other intellectual property, trade secrets, and assets developed and owned by Havelide to produce a
gasoline-like liquid and high-purity hydrogen from natural gas, at low temperature and at low pressure (the "Havelide Assets") and consisting of certain patents and other
intellectual property, trade secrets, and assets developed and owned by Coalthane to reduce the methane from coal mines and other wells (the "Coalthane Assets")..  The
purchase of the Coalthane and Havelide Assets was consummated on February 27, 2015.  The acquisitions reflect the increased focus on technology solutions in an effort to
diversify our business amid a challenging oil price environment.  We believe the patents acquired can potentially be licensed or sold for a profit.
 
Change in Personia West Concession.  On July 31, 2015, the Company received formal notice from the Osage Mineral Council that the new concession terms for the Pearsonia
West Concession (“Pearsonia West”) are effective and formalized. Pearsonia West is a 106,500 contiguous acre position in Osage County, Oklahoma which the Company owns
a controlling interest in through its investment in Bandolier Energy LLC, whole owner of the concession.
The new terms allow for vertical drilling obligations to hold the concession which previously had horizontal drilling obligations.  This provides a significant cost savings to the
Company and preserves potential control of its core asset until 2018, assuming the negotiated obligations are met. Previously, the concession required 11 horizontal wells to be
drilled by the end of 2015 with the concession terminating in the event these wells were not drilled.  The estimated cost of this obligation was approximately $22.1 million.
-4-
Table of Contents
Pursuant to the new terms, assuming completion costs of $300,000 per vertical well, the drilling obligations only require capital expenditures of: $1.8 million in 2016, $2.7 million
in 2017, and $3.6 million in 2018, collectively $8.1 million to hold the entire concession.  This represents a cost savings to the Company of approximately $14.0 million while
gaining an extra three years of potential control.
The Company is currently exploring multiple options for development for the Pearsonia Concession including entertaining inquiries from industry and joint venture partners.
Termination of Renzhi MOU.  On July 9, 2014 the Company and Sichuan Renzhi Oilfield Technology Services Co. Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the laws of The
People’s  Republic  of  China  and  traded  on  the  Shenzhen  Stock  Exchange  (“Renzhi”)  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (“MOU”)  for  the  sale  of  one  of  the
Company’s  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  to  Renzhi  and  the  joint  development  by  the  Company  and  Renzhi  of  oil  and  gas  technology  and  properties  (collectively,  the
“Transactions”). As  of  June  30,  2015,  the  Company  has  ceased  all  discussions  and  negotiations  with  Renzhi,  including  discussions  regarding  the  completion  of  the
Transactions contemplated by the MOU.
Approval of Reverse Stock Split.   At its 2015 annual meeting of stockholders held on July 8, 2015, stockholders approved a resolution to authorize the Company’s Board of
Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, without further action of the stockholders, to amend its Certificate of Incorporation to (i) implement a reverse stock split of its
common stock at a ratio of not less than 1-for-2, and not greater than 1-for-250, within one year from the date of the annual meeting, with the exact ratio to be determined by the
Board of Directors (the “Reverse Split”); and (ii) immediately following the Reverse Split, increase the total number of authorized shares of its Common Stock to 100.0 million.
As of the date of this filing, the Company has not formally applied for the reverse stock split.
 
Acquisition of Interest in Bandolier Energy LLC .   On May 30, 2014, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement pursuant to which the Company was issued a 50%
interest  in  Bandolier  Energy,  LLC  (“Bandolier”)  in  exchange  for  a  capital  contribution  of  $5.0  million  (the  “Bandolier Acquisition”).  In  connection  with  the  Bandolier
Acquisition, the Company has the right to appoint a majority of the board of managers of Bandolier. The Company’s Executive Chairman is a manager of, and investor in,
Pearsonia West Investment Group, LLC (“PWIG”), a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of investing in Bandolier with the Company and Ranger Station, LLC
(“Ranger Station”). Concurrently with the Bandolier Acquisition, PWIG was issued a 44% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $4.4 million, and Ranger Station was
issued a 6% interest in Bandolier for cash consideration of $600,000. In connection with PWIG’s investment in Bandolier, the Company and PWIG entered into an agreement,
dated May 30, 2014, granting the members of PWIG an option, exercisable at any time prior to May 30, 2017, to exchange their pro rata share of the Bandolier membership
interests for shares of the Company’s common stock, at a price of $0.08 per share, subject to adjustment (the “Option”). The Option, if fully exercised, would result in the
Company issuing 55,000,000 shares of its common stock, or 6% to the members of PWIG.
The Company has operational control along with a 50% ownership interest in Bandolier. As a result, the Company consolidates Bandolier. The remaining 50% non–controlling
interest represents the equity investment from PWIG and Ranger Station. The Company will allocate the proportionate share of the net operating income/loss to both the
Company and the non-controlling interest.
Subsequent to the initial capitalization of Bandolier, Bandolier acquired for $8,712,893, less a $407,161 claw back, all of the issued and outstanding equity of Spyglass Energy
Group, LLC (“Spyglass”), the owner of oil and gas leases, leaseholds, lands, and options and concessions thereto located in Osage County, Oklahoma. Spyglass controls a
significant  contiguous  oil  and  gas  acreage  position  in  Northeastern  Oklahoma,  consisting  of  approximately  106,000  acres,  with  substantial  original  oil  in  place,  stacked
reservoirs, as well as exploratory and development opportunities that can be accessed through both horizontal and vertical drilling. Significant infrastructure is already in place
including 32 square miles of 3D seismic, 3 phase power, a dedicated sub-station as well as multiple oil producing horizontal wells.  No additional contingencies were assumed.
As a result of Bandolier’s subsequent acquisition of Spyglass, the Company has both proven developed and proven undeveloped oil and gas assets.
-5-
Table of Contents
 
The Company recorded the purchase of Spyglass using the acquisition method of accounting as specified in ASC 805 “Business Combinations.” This method of accounting
requires the acquirer to (i) record purchase consideration issued to sellers in a business combination at fair value on the date control is obtained, (ii) determine the fair value of
any non-controlling interest, and (iii) allocate the purchase consideration to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their acquisition date
fair values. Further, the Company commenced reporting the results of Spyglass on a consolidated basis with those of the Company effective upon the date of the acquisition.
The Company consolidated Bandolier as of May 30, 2014, and the results of operations of the Company include that of Bandolier from June 1, 2014.
 
The following table summarizes, on an unaudited pro forma basis, the results of operations of the Company as though the acquisition had occurred as of May 1, 2014. The pro
forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of either the actual operation results had the acquisition transaction occurred as of May 1, 2014.

As of April 30, 2015, the Company performed a ceiling test on the Oklahoma oil and gas assets.  As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $1,246,975 on the
Oklahoma oil and gas assets. No further impairment was recognized on these assets during the three month ended July 31, 2015.

Going Concern and Management’s Plan
The  accompanying  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis,  which  contemplates  the  realization  of  assets  and  the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of July 31, 2015, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $17,335,417.  The Company has incurred significant
losses since inception. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements do
not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset amounts or the classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.

Table of Contents
 
At July 31, 2015, the Company had working capital of approximately $262,000.  As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating activities, and the development of its assets,
the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations. In addition, the Company has a limited operating history prior to acquisition of Bandolier.  At July 31, 2015,
the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.8 million.  The Company’s primary source of operating funds since inception has been equity financings.
 
Management is currently in the process of evaluating all paths for the Company at this point amid a difficult oil price environment.  This includes curtailing oil and gas
operations and increasing focus on the Company’s technology initiatives.  Obtaining funding in this environment for exploration and production assets is challenging though
the Company continues to work hard to meet its capital needs.  The Company is exploring farm in and joint venture opportunities for its oil and gas assets as well as exit
opportunities through an outright sale.
 
The Company is currently focused on developing its core position in the Mississippi Lime, specifically in the Pearsonia West Concession in Osage County acquired during the
Bandolier Acquisition and Bandolier’s acquisition of Spyglass. Over the last 12 months the Company has continued to build out its leadership and technical team with
individuals  with  extensive  experience  in  the  Mississippi  Lime  play. Additionally,  the  Company  has  been  in  discussions  with  industry  partners  to  capitalize  and  develop
additional acreage in the Mississippi Lime. The Company continues to seek out joint venture partners and acquisition targets.

Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates
The Company’s significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 4 — Significant Accounting Policies in the 2015 Annual Report. Since the date of the 2015 Annual
Report,  there  have  been  no  material  changes  to  the  Company’s  significant  accounting  policies.  The  preparation  of  the  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.   These estimates and assumptions include volumes of oil and natural gas reserves, abandonment
obligations, impairment of oil and natural gas properties, depreciation and accretion, income taxes, fair value of financial instruments, and contingencies. Actual results could
differ from the estimates.
Per Share Amounts:
(a)
 
Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Diluted net loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive
effect of common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, which is the case for the three months ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, as presented in these financial
statements, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. 
 
The Company had the following common stock equivalents at July 31, 2015 and 2014:

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014–09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Amendments in this Update
create Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry–
specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendments supersede the cost guidance in Subtopic 605–35,
Revenue Recognition—Construction–Type and Production–Type Contracts, and create new Subtopic 340–40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers.
In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration  to  which  the  entity  expects  to  be  entitled  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  This Accounting  Standards  Update  is  the  final  version  of  Proposed
Accounting  Standards  Update  2011–230—Revenue  Recognition  (Topic  605)  and  Proposed Accounting  Standards  Update  2011–250—Revenue  Recognition  (Topic  605):
Codification Amendments, both of which have been deleted. Accounting Standards Update 2014–09. The amendments in this Update are effective for the Company for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014–09 on
the consolidated financial statements.

The total future asset retirement obligation was estimated based on the Company’s ownership interest in all wells and facilities, the estimated legal obligations required to retire,
dismantle, abandon and reclaim the wells and facilities and the estimated timing of such payments. The Company estimated the present value of its asset retirement obligations
at both July 31, 2015 and April 30, 2015, based on a future undiscounted liability of $1,144,990 and $1,143,857, respectively. These costs are expected to be incurred within one
to 24 years. A credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate of 10% and an inflation rate of 2% were used to calculate the present value.
As of July 31, 2015 and April 30, 2015, the Company has $0 of reclamation deposits with authorities to secure certain abandonment liabilities.

Contingency and Contractual Obligations
As a result of the Share Exchange, the Company inherited the following contingencies:
 
(a) In January 2010, the Company experienced a flood in its Calgary office premises as a result of a broken water pipe. There was significant damage to the premises rendering
them unusable until the landlord had completed remediation. Pursuant to the lease contract, the Company asserted that rent should be abated during the remediation process
and accordingly, the Company did not pay any rent after December 2009. During the remediation process, the Company engaged an independent environmental testing
company to test for air quality and for the existence of other potentially hazardous conditions. The testing revealed the existence of potentially hazardous mold and the
consultant provided specific written instructions for the effective remediation of the premises. During the remediation process, the landlord did not follow the consultant’s
instructions and correct the potentially hazardous mold situation and subsequently in June 2010 gave notice and declared the premises to be ready for occupancy. The
Company re-engaged the consultant to re-test the premises and the testing results again revealed the presence of potentially hazardous mold. The Company determined that
the premises were not fit for re-occupancy and considered the landlord to be in default of the lease and the lease terminated.
On January 30, 2014 the landlord filed a Statement of Claim against the Company for rental arrears in the amount aggregating approximately CAD $759,000. On October 20, 2014,
the Company filed a summary judgment application stating that the landlord’s claim is barred as it was commenced outside the 2-year statute of limitation period under the
Alberta Limitations Act. The landlord subsequently filed a cross-application to amend its Statement of Claim to add a claim for loss of prospective rent in an amount of
approximately CAD $665,000. The applications were heard on June 25, 2015.   On July 3, 2015 the court issued a decision allowing both applications.  On the basis of this
decision, the landlord’s claim for rental arrears in the approximate amount of CAD $759,000 has now been replaced by a claim for loss of prospective rent in the approximate
amount of CAD $665,000 (which the Company believes is more accurately quantified at approximately CAD $450,000).  The decision has been appealed by both parties and the
appeal hearing has been scheduled for March 16, 2016.
(b)  In  September  2013,  the  Company  was  notified  by  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas  (the  “Commission”)  that  the  Company  was  not  in  compliance  with  regulations
promulgated by the Commission. The Company was therefore deemed to have lost its corporate privileges within the State of Texas and as a result, all wells within the state
would have to be plugged. The Commission therefore collected $25,000 from the Company, which was originally deposited with the Commission, to cover a portion of the
estimated costs of $88,960 to plug the wells. In addition to the above, the Commission also reserved its right to separately seek any remedies against the Company resulting
from its noncompliance.

(c) On August 11, 2014, Martha Donelson and John Friend amended their complaint in an existing lawsuit by filing a class action complaint styled: Martha Donelson and John
Friend, et al. v. United States of America, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Devon Energy Production, LP, et al.,  Case No. 14-CV-316-JHP-TLW,
United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma (the “Proceeding”).  The plaintiffs added as defendants twenty-seven (27) specifically named operators,
including the Company, as well as all Osage County lessees and operators who have obtained a concession agreement, lease or drilling permit approved by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs (“BIA”) in Osage County allegedly in violation of National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the BIA improperly
approved oil and gas leases, concession agreements and drilling permits prior to August 12, 2014, without satisfying the BIA’s obligations under federal regulations or NEPA,
and seek a determination that such oil and gas leases, concession agreements and drilling permits are void ab initio.  Plaintiffs are seeking damages against the defendants for
alleged nuisance, trespass, negligence and unjust enrichment.  The potential consequences of such complaint could jeopardize the corresponding leases.
On October 7, 2014 Spyglass, along with other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the August 11, 2014 Proceeding on various procedural and legal arguments.  Plaintiffs filed
their response to the motion to dismiss on October 27, 2014.  Spyglass filed its reply brief on November 10, 2014 and the plaintiffs were granted leave until November 19, 2014 to
file a reply to Spyglass’ reply brief.  Once the briefing cycle concluded on November 19, 2014, the motion to dismiss became ripe for determination by the court.  Oral arguments
may be ordered by the court.  There is no specific timeline by which the court must render a ruling.
 
(d) Mega West Energy Missouri Corp. (“Mega West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is involved in two cases related to oil leases in West Central, Missouri.  The
first case (James Long and Jodeane Long v. Mega West Energy Missouri and Petro River Oil Corp. , case number 13B4-CV00019) is a case for unlawful detainer, pursuant to
which the plaintiffs contend that Mega West oil and gas lease has expired and Mega West is unlawfully possessing the plaintiffs real property by asserting that the leases
remain in effect.  The case was originally filed in Vernon County, Missouri on September 20, 2013.  Mega West filed  an Answer and Counterclaims on November 26, 2013 and
the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims. Mega West filed a motion for Change of Judge and Change of Venue and the case was transferred to Barton County. 
The court granted the motion to dismiss the counterclaims on February 3, 2014.  As to the other allegations in the complaint, the matter is still pending.
 
Mega West filed a second case on October 14, 2014 (Mega West Energy Missouri Corp. v. James Long, Jodeane Long, and Arrow Mines LLC , case number 14VE-CV00599). 
This case is pending in Vernon County, Missouri.  Although the two cases are separate, they are interrelated.  In the Vernon County case, Mega West has made claims for: (1)
replevin for personal property; (2) conversion of personal property; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment regarding the lease; (4) constructive eviction of the lease; (5)
breach of fiduciary obligation against James Long; (6) declaratory judgment that the oil and gas lease did not terminate; and (7) injunctive relief to enjoin the action pending in
Barton County, Missouri.  The plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss on November 4, 2014, and Arrow Mines, LLC filed a motion to dismiss on November 13, 2014.  Both motions
remain pending, and Mega West will file an opposition to the motions in the near future.
(e) The Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. It does not believe that any of these claims and proceedings against it is
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.

Business Overview
 
Petro River Oil Corp. is an independent exploration and production company with a focus on drilling, recompletions, and applying modern technologies to both conventional
and unconventional oil and gas assets. Specific targets include: increasing production by developing our acreage, increasing profit margins by evaluating and optimizing our
production, and executing our business plan to increase property values, reserves, and expanding our asset base.
 
We benefit from having an experienced management team with proven acquisition, operating and financing capabilities. Mr. Scot Cohen, our Executive Chairman, has over 20
years of financial management experience including five years as managing partner of Iroquois Capital Opportunity Fund, a private equity fund focused on oil and gas. He has
raised equity and debt for a number of small and microcap public companies.
Mr. Cohen is joined by Daniel Smith and Ruben Alba who make up the Company’s technical leadership.  Mr. Smith is a registered petroleum engineer with over 15 years’
experience. Mr. Smith spent his career at XTO Energy where he served as an operations engineer responsible for managing fields producing in excess of 100 million cubic feet
of natural gas per day. Mr. Alba has been active in the oil and gas industry since 1997. Previously he was with Halliburton Energy Services and Superior Well Services

Table of Contents
 
The Company is focused on developing its Mississippi Lime acreage, and has been in discussions with industry partners to capitalize and develop acreage in the Mississippi
Lime. The Company continues to seek out joint venture partners and acquisition targets.
 
Projects related to the heavy oil reservoirs are in technical review. The Company has an extensive amount of technical and reservoir information on the Missouri, Oklahoma and
Kentucky positions. The data is being utilized in the understanding and test phases to develop an economic heavy oil production reserve base.
 
The Company continues to explore various opportunities to raise capital to support the growth of the Company. These opportunities include, without limitation, potential joint
ventures with various on and offshore entities and potential private issuances of equity, debt or a combination thereof. There can be no assurance that the Company will enter
into any of these transactions. Mr. Cohen has extensive experience in capital markets and oil and gas joint ventures.
 
The Company continues to build out its technology focused business segment through Petro Spring LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Petro Spring”). 
Management has devoted additional resources to effectively establishing the framework for Petro Spring to develop and execute its business plan.  Petro Spring was launched
with an intentionally broad mandate to acquire and commercialize cutting edge technologies with the intent to capitalize on the significant technological experience of its
leadership team and network of industry relationships within the energy sector.
In light of the challenging oil price environment and capital markets, management is currently in the process of evaluating all options for the Company, including curtailing oil
and gas operations, and increasing focus on our technology initiatives.  In addition to focusing on obtaining necessary working capital to execute our business plan and
continue as a going concern, we are exploring farm in and joint venture opportunities for our oil and gas assets, as well as exit opportunities through an outright sale.  No
assurances can be given that management will be successful.
Recent Developments
Change in Personia West Concession.  On July 31, 2015, the Company received formal notice from the Osage Mineral Council that the new concession terms for the Pearsonia
West Concession (“Pearsonia West”) are effective and formalized. Pearsonia West is a 106,500 contiguous acre position in Osage County, Oklahoma which the Company owns
a controlling interest in through its investment in Bandolier Energy LLC, whole owner of the concession.
The new terms allow for vertical drilling obligations to hold the concession, which previously had horizontal drilling obligations.  This provides a significant cost savings to the
Company and preserves potential control of its core asset until 2018, assuming the negotiated obligations are met. Previously, the concession required 11 horizontal wells to be
drilled by the end of 2015 with the concession terminating in the event these wells were not drilled.  The estimated cost of this obligation was approximately $22.1 million.
Pursuant to the new terms, assuming completion costs of $300,000 per vertical well, the drilling obligations only require capital expenditures of: $1.8 million in 2016, $2.7 million
in 2017, and $3.6 million in 2018, collectively $8.1 million to hold the entire concession.  This represents a cost savings to the Company of approximately $14.0 million while
gaining an extra three years of potential control.

The Company is currently exploring multiple options for development for the Pearsonia Concession including entertaining inquiries from industry and joint venture partners.
Termination of Renzhi MOU.  On July 9, 2014 the Company and Sichuan Renzhi Oilfield Technology Services Co. Ltd., a corporation incorporated under the laws of The
People’s  Republic  of  China  and  traded  on  the  Shenzhen  Stock  Exchange  (“Renzhi”)  entered  into  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (“ MOU”)  for  the  sale  of  one  of  the
Company’s  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  to  Renzhi  and  the  joint  development  by  the  Company  and  Renzhi  of  oil  and  gas  technology  and  properties  (collectively,  the
“Transactions”). As  of  June  30,  2015,  the  Company  has  ceased  all  discussions  and  negotiations  with  Renzhi,  including  discussions  regarding  the  completion  of  the
Transactions contemplated by the MOU.
Approval of Reverse Stock Split.   At its 2015 annual meeting of stockholders held on July 8, 2015, stockholders approved resolution to authorize the Company’s Board of
Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, without further action of the stockholders, to amend our Certificate of Incorporation to (i) implement a reverse stock split of our
common stock at a ratio of not less than 1-for-2, and not greater than 1-for-250, within one year from the date of the annual meeting, with the exact ratio to be determined by the
Board of Directors (the “Reverse Split”);  and  (ii)  immediately  following  the  Reverse  Split,  increase  the  total  number  of  authorized  shares  of  our  Common  Stock  to  100.0
million. As of the date of this filing, the Company has not formally applied for the reverse stock split.
Acquisition of Havelide Assets.  On February 18, 2015, Petro Spring I, LLC (“Petro Spring I”), a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by Petro Spring, entered into a
definitive asset purchase agreement (“Havelide Purchase Agreement ”) to purchase substantially all of the assets of Havelide GTL LLC (“Havelide”), consisting of certain
patents and other intellectual property, trade secrets, and assets developed and owned by Havelide to produce a gasoline-like liquid and high-purity hydrogen from natural
gas, at low temperature and at low pressure (the “Havelide Assets”).  The purchase of the Havelide Assets was consummated on February 27, 2015.  Havelide was founded by
Stephen Boyd, who joined the Company as its Chief Technology Officer under the terms of an Employment Agreement dated February 18, 2015.
Under the terms of the Havelide Purchase Agreement, in consideration for the Havelide Assets, the Company issued to Havelide 13,333,333 shares of common stock of the
Company and a warrant to purchase an additional 26,666,667 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.25 per share. The shares of the Company's common stock were
valued at approximately $520,000 based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on February 27, 2015.
 
The Company computed the economic benefit of the above warrant grant as of February 27, 2015 utilizing a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company utilized the
following assumptions: common share value based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock as quoted on the Over the Counter Bulletin Board, $0.039; Exercise price
of $0.25; expected volatility of 176%; and a discount rate of 1.50%. The grant date fair value was $923,685.
 
The Company recorded the Havelide assets based on the fair value of the common stock and warrants $1,443,685 and allocated the purchase price to the intangible assets
purchased.
 
Acquisition of Coalthane Assets.  On February 18, 2015, Petro Spring II, LLC (“Petro Spring II”), a Delaware limited liability company wholly owned by Petro Spring, entered
into a definitive asset purchase agreement (“Coalthane Purchase Agreement”) to purchase substantially all of the assets of Coalthane Tech LLC (“Coalthane”), consisting of
certain patents and other intellectual property, trade secrets, and assets developed and owned by Coalthane to reduce the methane from coal mines and other wells (the
“Coalthane Assets”).  The purchase of the Coalthane Assets was consummated on February 27, 2015.  Under the terms of the Coalthane Purchase Agreement, in consideration
for the Coalthane Assets, the Company issued to Coalthane 20,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. The shares of the Company's common stock were valued at
approximately $780,000 based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on February 27, 2015.  The Company recorded the Coalthane Assets based on the fair value
of the common stock $780,000 and allocated the purchase price to the intangible assets purchased.
 
The above acquisitions reflect the increased focus on technology solutions in an effort to diversify our business amid a challenging oil price environment.  We believe the
patents acquired can potentially be licensed or sold for a profit.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
 
Our  discussion  and  analysis  of  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  are  based  upon  our  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements.  These  condensed
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“US GAAP”), which requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, to disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of
the condensed consolidated financial statements, and to disclose the reported amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial reporting period. The most
significant estimates and assumptions include the valuation of accounts receivable, and the useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible
assets, the valuation of deferred tax assets and inventories and the provision for income taxes. We continue to evaluate these estimates and assumptions that we believe to be
reasonable under the circumstances. We rely on these evaluations as the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Since the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. Some of our
accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. We believe critical accounting policies as disclosed in this Form 10-Q reflect the more
significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. We believe there have been no material changes to our critical
accounting policies and estimates.
 
The following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions and estimates and were used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements:
 
Oil and Gas Operations
 
The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations whereby all costs related to exploration and development of oil and gas reserves are
capitalized. Under this method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves,
including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities, however, are
expensed in the period incurred. Costs are capitalized on a country-by-country basis. To date, there has only been one cost center, the United States.
The present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by applying the average first-day-of-the-month prices during the previous twelve-month period of oil and
natural gas to estimated future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of year-end less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing
the proved reserves and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions. Prior to December 31, 2009, prices and costs used to calculate future net cash flows were those
as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period.
Following the discovery of reserves and the commencement of production, the Company will compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties using the unit-of-production
method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities. Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is
determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. Unproved properties are assessed for impairment annually. Significant properties are assessed
individually.
 
The Company assesses all items classified as unproved property on an annual basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a
group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: land relinquishment; intent to drill; remaining
lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved
reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors indicate impairment, the related exploration costs incurred are transferred to the full cost pool and are then
subject to depletion and the ceiling limitations on development oil and natural gas expenditures.
 
Proceeds  from  the  sale  of  oil  and  gas  assets  are  applied  against  capitalized  costs,  with  no  gain  or  loss  recognized,  unless  a  sale  would  alter  the  rate  of  depletion  and
depreciation by 25 percent or more.
 
Significant changes in these factors could reduce our estimates of future net proceeds and accordingly could result in an impairment of our oil and gas assets. Management will
perform annual assessments of the carrying amounts of its oil and gas assets as additional data from ongoing exploration activities becomes available.

As of April 30, 2015, management performed a ceiling test on the Oklahoma assets acquired in the Bandolier transaction.  As a result, the Company recognized an impairment
charge of $1,246,975 on the Oklahoma oil and gas assets. No further impairment was recognized on these assets during the three month ended July 31, 2015.
 
NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
 
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014–09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Amendments in this Update
create Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and supersede the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, including most industry–
specific revenue recognition guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. In addition, the amendments supersede the cost guidance in Subtopic 605–35,
Revenue Recognition—Construction–Type and Production–Type Contracts,  and create new Subtopic 340–40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs—Contracts with Customers.
In summary, the core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration  to  which  the  entity  expects  to  be  entitled  in  exchange  for  those  goods  or  services.  This Accounting  Standards  Update  is  the  final  version  of  Proposed
Accounting  Standards  Update  2011–230—Revenue  Recognition  (Topic  605)  and  Proposed Accounting  Standards  Update  2011–250—Revenue  Recognition  (Topic  605):
Codification Amendments, both of which have been deleted. Accounting Standards Update 2014–09. The amendments in this Update are effective for the Company for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014–09 on
the condensed consolidated financial statements.
 
Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements.

Operating Expenses
 
During the three months ended July 31, 2015, operating expenses were $175,953, as compared to operating expenses of $340,668 for the three months ended July 31, 2014. The
overall decrease in operating expenses of $164,715 is primarily attributable to management’s commitment to substantially reduce operating expenses in light of the current
challenging oil price environment.
 
General and Administrative Expenses
 
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended July 31, 2015 were $559,975, as compared to $1,861,532 for the three months ended July 31, 2014. The decrease
is primarily attributable to management’s commitment to substantially reduce general and administrative expenses in light of the current challenging oil price environment, as
well as the significant decrease in stock based compensation and professional fees compared to the 2014 period. These changes are outlined below:

Salary and benefits include non-cash stock-based compensation of $228,930 for three months ended July 31, 2015 compared to $189,244 for the three months ended July 31,
2014. The increase in stock-based compensation from the prior comparable period is due to additional awards during the periods subsequent to July 31, 2014 that were
expensed during the three months ended July 31, 2015 which were expensed over the corresponding vesting periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
 
At July 31, 2015, the Company had working capital of approximately $0.3 million.  As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating activities, and the development of its
assets, the Company has incurred losses since it commenced operations.  In addition, the Company has a limited operating history prior to the acquisition of Bandolier.  At July
31, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.8 million.  The current level of working capital is insufficient to maintain current operations in
Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri for the next twelve months.  Additional capital will therefore be necessary for management to execute its business plan, develop the Havelide
Assets and Coalthane Assets, further expand the Company’s exploration and development programs for the next twelve months, and continue as a going concern.  To address
the Company’s working capital requirements and execute its business plan, management intends to continue to raise capital through the issuance of debt and equity securities.
In addition, and to address the recent volatility and substantial decreases in crude oil prices, the Company initiated cost-cutting measures in November 1, 2014, which initiatives
continue. No assurances can be provided that the Company will be successful in its efforts to raise additional required capital, which efforts may be more difficult given the
recent volatility and substantial decrease in the price of crude oil.  Furthermore, our inability to maintain or raise additional capital may damage the Company’s reputation and
credibility with industry participants. The Company’s inability to raise additional funds when required may have a negative impact on its consolidated results of operations and
financial condition, and challenge our ability to continue as a going concern.
Management is also currently in the process of evaluating all options for the Company, including curtailing oil and gas operations, and increasing focus on our technology
initiatives.  In addition to focusing on obtaining necessary working capital to execute our business plan and continue as a going concern, we are exploring farm in and joint
venture opportunities for our oil and gas assets, as well as exit opportunities through an outright sale.  No assurances can be given that management will be successful.

Operating Activities
 
The Company used $519,003 in operating activities during the three months ended July 31, 2015, as compared to $1,636,292 used in operating activities during the three months
ended July 31, 2014. The Company incurred a net loss during the three months ended July 31, 2015 of $768,290 as compared to a net loss of $1,718,043 for three months ended
July 31, 2014. For the three months ended July 31, 2015, the loss was offset by non-cash items such as stock-based compensation, depreciation, depletion and amortization, and
accretion of asset retirement obligation. Cash used in operations was also influenced by decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses as well as a increase in other
assets,  accounts  payable  and  accrued  expenses.  For  the  three  months  ended  July  31,  2014,  the  loss  was  offset  by  non-cash  items  such  as  stock-based  compensation,
depreciation, depletion and amortization, and accretion of asset retirement obligation. Cash used in operations was also influenced by increases in accounts receivable as well
as decreases in prepaid expenses and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
 
Investing Activities
 
The Company received $271,730 in investing activities during the three months ended July 31, 2015, from the disposal of assets for cash offset by $7,283 of expenditures on oil
and gas assets. During the three months ended July 31, 2014, the Company used $8,305,732 for expenditures on oil and gas assets as part of the Bandolier acquisition during
the three months ended July 31, 2014. In addition, the Company purchased $3,796 of office equipment and vehicles of which $31,500 was funded by a note payable.
 
Financing Activities
 
During the three months ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had $0 and $5,000,000 in cash provided by financing activities. The $5,000,000 was contributed from the
non-controlling interest holder of Bandolier in May 2014.
 
Availability of Additional Funds
Based upon our working capital position as of July 31, 2015, we require equity and/or debt financing to continue our operations. The Company does not expect that its current
cash on hand will fund its operations for the next twelve months. Due to the impending lack of funds, we will need to raise further capital, through the sale of additional equity
securities or otherwise, to support our future operations. Our operating needs include the planned costs to operate our business, including amounts required to fund working
capital and capital expenditures. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully
commercialize our products and services, and competing technological and market developments.
 
We may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it or to raise capital on favorable terms. Debt financing may require us to pledge certain assets and enter
into covenants that could restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness, and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders
or us. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or to obtain funds by entering into
financing agreements on unattractive terms.
These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate our continuation as a going
concern and the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the condensed
consolidated financial statements do not necessarily purport to represent realizable or settlement values. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
A. Material Weaknesses
 
As discussed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2015, we identified material weaknesses in the design and operation of our
internal controls. The material weaknesses are due to the limited number of employees, which impacts our ability to conduct a thorough internal review, and the Company’s
reliance on external accounting personnel to prepare financial statements.
 
To remediate the material weakness, the Company is developing a plan to design and implement the operation of our internal controls.  Upon the Company obtaining additional
capital, the Company intends to hire additional accounting staff, and operations and administrative executives in the future to address its material weaknesses.
We will continue to monitor and assess our remediation initiatives to ensure that the aforementioned material weaknesses are remediated.
 
B. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s filings under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and
forms.  The  Company’s  management,  with  the  participation  of  its  principal  executive  and  principal  financial  officers,  has  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation and solely due to the unremediated
material weaknesses described above, the Company’s principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
for the purpose for which they were designed as of the end of such period. As a result of this conclusion, the financial statements for the period covered by this report were
prepared with particular attention to the unremediated material weaknesses previously disclosed. Accordingly, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods
presented, in accordance with US GAAP, notwithstanding the unremediated weaknesses.
 
C. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
There was no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that was identified in connection with such evaluation that occurred during the period covered
by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
(a) In January 2010, the Company experienced a flood in its Calgary office premises as a result of a broken water pipe. There was significant damage to the premises rendering
them unusable until the landlord had completed remediation. Pursuant to the lease contract, the Company asserted that rent should be abated during the remediation process
and accordingly, the Company did not pay any rent after December 2009. During the remediation process, the Company engaged an independent environmental testing
company to test for air quality and for the existence of other potentially hazardous conditions. The testing revealed the existence of potentially hazardous mold and the
consultant provided specific written instructions for the effective remediation of the premises. During the remediation process, the landlord did not follow the consultant’s
instructions and correct the potentially hazardous mold situation and subsequently in June 2010 gave notice and declared the premises to be ready for occupancy. The
Company re-engaged the consultant to re-test the premises and the testing results again revealed the presence of potentially hazardous mold. The Company determined that
the premises were not fit for re-occupancy and considered the landlord to be in default of the lease and the lease terminated.
On January 30, 2014 the landlord filed a Statement of Claim against the Company for rental arrears in the amount aggregating approximately CAD $759,000. On October 20, 2014,
the Company filed a summary judgment application stating that the landlord’s claim is barred as it was commenced outside the 2-year statute of limitation period under the
Alberta Limitations Act. The landlord subsequently filed a cross-application to amend its Statement of Claim to add a claim for loss of prospective rent in an amount of
approximately CAD $665,000. The applications were heard on June 25, 2015.  The court reserved its decision and there is no specific timeline by which it must render a ruling.
(b)  In  September  2013,  the  Company  was  notified  by  the  Railroad  Commission  of  Texas  (the  “Commission”)  that  the  Company  was  not  in  compliance  with  regulations
promulgated by the Commission. The Company was therefore deemed to have lost its corporate privileges within the State of Texas and as a result, all wells within the state
would have to be plugged. The Commission therefore collected $25,000 from the Company, which was originally deposited with the Commission, to cover a portion of the
estimated costs of $88,960 to plug the wells. In addition to the above, the Commission also reserved its right to separately seek any remedies against the Company resulting
from its noncompliance. As of August 11, 2015, there is not further update to the issue.
 
(c) On August 11, 2014, Martha Donelson and John Friend amended their complaint in an existing lawsuit by filing a class action complaint styled: Martha Donelson and John
Friend, et al. v. United States of America, Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Devon Energy Production, LP, et al.,  Case No. 14-CV-316-JHP-TLW,
United States District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma (the “Proceeding”).  The plaintiffs added as defendants twenty-seven (27) specifically named operators,
including the Company, as well as all Osage County lessees and operators who have obtained a concession agreement, lease or drilling permit approved by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs (“BIA”) in Osage County allegedly in violation of National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”).  Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment that the BIA improperly
approved oil and gas leases, concession agreements and drilling permits prior to August 12, 2014, without satisfying the BIA’s obligations under federal regulations or NEPA,
and seek a determination that such oil and gas leases, concession agreements and drilling permits are void ab initio.  Plaintiffs are seeking damages against the defendants for
alleged nuisance, trespass, negligence and unjust enrichment.
On October 7, 2014 Spyglass, along with other defendants, filed a motion to dismiss the August 11, 2014 Proceeding on various procedural and legal arguments.  Plaintiffs filed
their response to the motion to dismiss on October 27, 2014.  Spyglass filed its reply brief on November 10, 2014 and the plaintiffs were granted leave until November 19, 2014 to
file a reply to Spyglass’s reply brief.  Once the briefing cycle concluded on November 19, 2014, the motion to dismiss became ripe for determination by the court.  Oral
arguments may be ordered by the court.  There is no specific timeline by which the court must render a ruling.
(d) Mega West Energy Missouri Corp. (“Mega West”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is involved in two cases related to oil leases in West Central, Missouri.  The
first case (James Long and Jodeane Long v. Mega West Energy Missouri and Petro River Oil Corp. , case number 13B4-CV00019) is a case for unlawful detainer, pursuant to
which the plaintiffs contend that Mega West oil and gas lease has expired and Mega West is unlawfully possessing the plaintiffs real property by asserting that the leases
remain in effect.  The case was originally filed in Vernon County, Missouri on September 20, 2013.  Mega West filed an Answer and Counterclaims on November 26, 2013 and
the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims. Mega West filed a motion for Change of Judge and Change of Venue and the case was transferred to Barton County. 
The court granted the motion to dismiss the counterclaims on February 3, 2014.  As to the other allegations in the complaint, the matter is still pending.
Table of Contents
-21-
Mega West filed a second case on October 14, 2014 (Mega West Energy Missouri Corp. v. James Long, Jodeane Long, and Arrow Mines LLC , case number 14VE-CV00599). 
This case is pending in Vernon County, Missouri.  Although the two cases are separate, they are interrelated.  In the Vernon County case, Mega West has made claims for: (1)
replevin for personal property; (2) conversion of personal property; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment regarding the lease; (4) constructive eviction of the lease; (5)
breach of fiduciary obligation against James Long; (6) declaratory judgment that the oil and gas lease did not terminate; and (7) injunctive relief to enjoin the action pending in
Barton County, Missouri.  The plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss on November 4, 2014, and Arrow Mines, LLC filed a motion to dismiss on November 13, 2014.  Both motions
remain pending, and Mega West will file an opposition to the motions in the near future.
(e) The Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. It does not believe that any of these claims and proceedings against it is
likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.
 
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
 
We have identified the following risk factor in addition to the risks factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended April 30, 2015:
We have substantially reduced operations in light of the substantial decrease in the price of oil and gas, and currently require additional capital to execute our business
plan and continue as a going concern.  If we are unable to obtain funding, our business operations will be materially and adversely harmed, and we will not be able to
continue as a going concern.
 
As a result of the recent substantial decrease in the price of oil and gas, we have substantially reduced the development of our oil and gas and other assets, our exploration
activity, and our operating activities and expenses. Despite these efforts, implementation of our current business plan, including future acquisitions and future exploration,
development, production, leasing activities and marketing activities, as well as our administrative requirements (such as salaries, insurance expenses and general overhead
expenses, as well as legal compliance costs and accounting expenses) will require a substantial amount of additional capital and cash flow. Accordingly, we will require
additional capital to continue to operate our business, further expand our exploration and development programs, and continue as a going concern.
 
We intend to pursue sources of needed capital through various financing transactions or arrangements, including, but not limited to, joint venturing of projects, debt financing,
equity financing or other means. We may not be successful in raising the capital needed and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means. If we are unable to
secure adequate funds on a timely basis, we will not be able to continue as a going concern.
 
In addition to the above risk factor, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business,
financial position and results of operations.
