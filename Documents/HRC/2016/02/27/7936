<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its fifteenth 
session from 21 January to 1 February 2013. The review of Mali was held at the 4th 
meeting on 22 January. The delegation of Mali was headed by Malick Coulibaly, Minister 
of Justice and Garde des Sceaux. At its 10th meeting, held on 25 January 2013, the 
Working Group adopted the report on Mali. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Mali: Angola, Montenegro and United Arab 
Emirates. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Mali: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation given in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/15/MLI/1); 
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/MLI/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/MLI/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Mexico, the 
Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia and Spain was transmitted to Mali through the troika. These 
questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Mali explained that the national report had been prepared through 
an inclusive national dialogue in which State agencies and civil society, supported by 
experts from the International Organization of la Francophonie, had facilitated the 
gathering and processing of information on human rights. Thanks to this participatory 
approach, the comments and recommendations made by various groups in civil society such 
as the National Human Rights Commission, the Malian Human Rights Association and the 
Ombudsman have been included in the report. 
</p>
<p>6. The national report was being submitted under special circumstances, marred by 
social and political upheaval. The political situation in Mali had been changed by the 
overthrow of the constitutional order and the occupation of the northern portion of the 
territory. The political stability that the country had enjoyed had been shaken by a crisis 
with both institutional and security dimensions. Military operations were under way in 
order to restore Mali&#8217;s territorial integrity and put an end to the population&#8217;s suffering in the 
north of the country. 
</p>
<p>7. The delegation recalled that Mali&#8217;s commitment to the universal values of human 
rights had been expressed in the legal sphere by the adoption of constitutional, legislative 
and regulatory instruments. At the international level, Mali had consistently ratified the 
regional and international instruments for the promotion and protection of human rights; it 
had submitted reports to certain treaty bodies and implemented the comments and </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.13-11815 
</p>
<p>observations they had made. Against this background, the delegation mentioned the 
establishment of an interministerial committee to facilitate the drafting of initial and 
periodic reports on the implementation of the conventions ratified by Mali. Mali had also 
developed manuals and teaching materials on human rights, the culture of peace, 
democracy and citizenship. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation noted that the competencies and powers of a number of institutions 
and agencies for the promotion and protection of human rights had been reinforced: for 
example, the National Human Rights Commission had gained legislative powers, and the 
Ombudsman had been given new responsibilities in respect of conflict resolution and 
improvements in the rule of law, governance and human rights. 
</p>
<p>9. With regard to the situation of women and children, the delegation recalled that the 
Government had a department specifically devoted to the promotion of the family, the child 
and women. Although Mali had been criticized for adopting a Personal and Family Code 
that was not favourable to women&#8217;s rights, substantial efforts had been made to improve the 
situation of women and children, and the Code had filled a great number of legal gaps. On 
24 November 2010, Mali had adopted a national policy and plan of action on gender for 
2011&#8211;2013; a National Programme to Fight Excision, whose purpose is to coordinate, 
follow up on and evaluate policies and strategies to fight excision, is being carried out. 
</p>
<p>10. The delegation also referred to a draft constitutional law to allow for affirmative 
action for women that had been adopted by the National Assembly. A return to the normal 
constitutional order should facilitate progress in that domain. In order to give women more 
margin for their endeavours, 10 women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s centres had been set up in Bamako 
and in regional capitals. 
</p>
<p>11. With respect to the rights of the child, the delegation pointed out that Mali is on the 
verge of adopting a national policy for the promotion and protection of children&#8217;s rights, 
together with an action plan for 2013&#8211;2017. Mali has likewise stepped up the struggle 
against child labour by creating a national institution for that purpose and setting up a 
national coordinating committee to combat trafficking in persons and related practices. 
</p>
<p>12. As regards social rights, the delegation noted that there are laws instituting a 
compulsory health-care scheme and a medical assistance regime. Mali had ratified the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol 
thereto; the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance; and the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of 
Internally Displaced Persons in Africa.  
</p>
<p>13. With regard to judicial reforms, the delegation said that a number of legislative texts 
had been developed to ameliorate the administration of justice and access to legal services. 
In addition, the strengthening of institutional and operational capacities for the 
administration of justice is addressed in the operating plan for the Ten-Year Justice 
Development Programme (PRODEJ). 
</p><p>14. The delegation also noted that a national policy for the promotion and protection of 
human rights was being developed and was expected to be adopted in the second half of 
2013.  
</p>
<p>15. Concerning the death penalty, the delegation said that while no law on its abolition 
had been adopted, the relevant draft legislation had been before the National Assembly 
since 2008. A de facto moratorium had been observed since the 1980s, and death sentences 
were systematically commuted to life imprisonment. The Malian population, which is not 
very enthusiastic about the draft legislation, is currently being educated about it.  </p>


<p>GE.13-11815 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>16. The delegation noted that the crisis through which Mali is now living has a 
pernicious effect on the maintenance and consolidation of progress made in human rights: 
hence the need for assistance from the international community. 
</p>
<p>17. Mali was asking for support from the international community in the following 
areas: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Capacity-building for the interministerial committee to facilitate the drafting of 
initial and periodic reports; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Capacity-building for the team on the strategy for communication and awareness-
raising to foster new behaviour; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Continued implementation of the strategy for encouraging women to apply to the 
civil service; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Capacity-building for the prison administration in order to improve prison 
conditions; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Training of prison guards and social workers; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Continued implementation of the PRODEJ operating plan for 2010&#8211;2014; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Continued implementation of the national action plan on the recommendations 
resulting from the national consultations on corruption and financial crime; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Capacity-building on defence and security; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ample technical and financial assistance in the electoral process; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Material, technical and financial assistance in addressing the humanitarian impact of 
the crisis. 
</p>

<p><b>6</b> GE.13-11815 
</p>
<p>24. Ethiopia commended the efforts by Mali to put in place legal and policy frameworks 
to improve the human rights situation in the country. It called on the international 
community to extend the necessary support to re-establish rule of law in the country. 
</p>
<p>25. France was concerned about the human rights situation in Mali. It reaffirmed its

and financial support needed. 
</p>

<p>GE.13-11815 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>37. Lithuania was concerned about human rights violations, including torture and sexual 
violence against women and children. It encouraged the implementation of 
recommendations made in the recent OHCHR report (A/HRC/22/33). It encouraged 
national dialogue on the conclusions of the European Union Foreign Affairs Council. It 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>38. Malaysia hoped that the Government of Mali would continue efforts to end the 
conflict. It applauded the measures taken to protect and promote human rights, especially in 
the areas of health and education and in that of women&#8217;s rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Mauritania welcomed measures taken to give effect to the recommendations made

creation of the National Human Rights Commission and the extension of the scope of 
powers of the Ombudsman.  
</p>
<p>40. Mexico was concerned particularly by extrajudicial executions and cruel treatment 
committed by Islamist groups in the north of Mali. It noted measures adopted to implement 
previous recommendations, including programmes to raise awareness of and to end the 
practice of FGM. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>41. Montenegro commended the adoption of a National Action Plan for the Elimination 
of Child Labour. It asked which measures the transitional Government would take to bring 
the Personal and Family Code further into conformity with international standards on 
women&#8217;s rights. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>42. Turkey considered that Security Council resolution 2085 (2012) should be 
immediately implemented and condemned the serious human rights violations committed 
by armed groups in the north of Mali. It noted that Government action regarding internally 
displaced persons and refugees was laudable. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. The Netherlands stated that it was essential to take action in the context of the 
current political situation. It highlighted the signing of several international conventions, 
including the convention concerning discrimination against women. The Netherlands noted 
that FGM persisted throughout the country. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Denmark expressed concern that abuses such as torture and enforced disappearances 
were not mentioned in the report and stated that it should be better balanced. It observed 
that the Family Code did not fully conform to the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women and was not implemented uniformly throughout 
the country. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>45. The State of Palestine congratulated Mali on its efforts, welcomed progress made in

access to property, secondary and higher education, employment and income-generating 
activities. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>46. Paraguay noted progress made in the fields of national legislation and international

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Paraguay made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>47. Poland expressed deep concern about the humanitarian situation in the north of Mali. 
It noted the Government&#8217;s efforts to develop action plans to promote and protect human 
rights including in the areas of gender equality, forced marriage and child labour. It made

</p>
<p>48. The Malian delegation replied to the question about what steps might be taken by 
the transitional Government to bring the Personal and Family Code into conformity with </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.13-11815 
</p>
<p>international standards on women&#8217;s human rights by saying that the transitional authorities 
had two tasks: to reconquer the north of the country and to organize free and transparent 
elections. As the Government was the product of an inclusive dialogue, however, its 
purview was limited and it could not accomplish what democratic institutions had been 
unable to achieve. Moreover, it was not a propitious moment for such reforms, as they 
might undermine the social solidarity needed to restore the country to normalcy. In 2008, 
the State had committed itself to reforming the Personal and Family Code to eliminate the 
discrimination to which women and children were subjected. The unrest had intervened 
before that project could be realized, however, forcing the Government to temporarily set 
aside the reforms that would bring it fully into line with its international commitments. In 
addition, social reforms of that nature called for the State to be strong, and that was 
currently not the case. Once it was, however, the rights enshrined in the conventions would 
be incorporated into the domestic legal system. 
</p>
<p>49. As to what the transitional Government was going to do to eradicate female genital 
mutilation (FGM), the delegation replied that the Government would continue to carry out 
the National Programme to Fight Excision and the national policy and action plan for the 
elimination of the practice of excision. 
</p>
<p>50. In response to the question on what the transitional authorities had done to prevent 
the arbitrary arrests, attacks and unlawful killings of Tuaregs by soldiers and pro-
Government militias in the southern part of Mali and to investigate, prosecute and punish 
the perpetrators of such acts, the delegation replied that the Government was educating the 
population in general and the security forces in particular to prevent them from equating 
terrorists with the entire population of that area. The delegation emphasized that Mali is not 
at war with any religion, race or ethnic group, but rather with its attackers. 
</p>
<p>51. As to what assistance had been given by the transitional authorities to the 
International Criminal Court and whether the authorities would undertake to investigate 
crimes committed both in the north and the south of the country, the delegation recalled that 
it was the transitional authorities themselves that had officially appealed to the Court and 
that the Government&#8217;s willingness to investigate or have investigated the crimes committed 
both in the north and in the south is readily apparent. For example, the Government had set 
up a commission of inquiry into the events at Diabaly which was open to the participation 
of investigators from Mauritania, international organizations and civil society.  
</p>
<p>52. As to whether the National Programme to Fight Excision had been successful in 
raising public awareness of the harmful effects of FGM and whether there are further plans 
to curb that practice, the delegation replied in the affirmative. 
</p>
<p>53. In response to the question on what measures have been taken to improve the 
functioning of the educational system in Mali, the delegation explained that the gross rate 
of enrolment in the first educational cycle has risen from 82 per cent in 2009 to 83.4 per 
cent in 2010. Thanks to the assistance of development partners, resources have been 
invested in teacher training and pedagogical materials. The Ministry of Education has 
worked out a number of strategies that have helped to improve the enrolment rate. 
</p>
<p>54. Concerning legal protection of children from all corporal punishment, the delegation 
listed the law prohibiting torture, the provisions of the Criminal Code on combating 
trafficking in persons, the Child Protection Code and a number of decrees and texts. 
</p>
<p>55. Concerning juvenile courts and alternative forms of deprivation of liberty for 
children, the delegation stated that the Malian prison system made specific provision for 
children in conflict with the law. Juvenile courts had been created throughout the country 
and judges had been specially appointed to handle cases involving minors. In addition, 
there were apprenticeship centres in which children could be placed to facilitate their 
rehabilitation. </p>


<p>GE.13-11815 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>56. In response to the question about the chief obstacles to the implementation of the 
agreement to abandon the practice of excision in the communities that had signed it, the 
delegation said that the sole obstacles were cultural in nature and that many communities 
had abandoned the practice even without having signed the agreement. 
</p>
<p>57. Concerning the efficacy of the measures adopted to raise public awareness and 
educate the public on FGM, the measures that the Government would be taking in the 
future and its point of view on enacting legislation prohibiting all forms of FGM, the 
delegation stated that the implementation of programmes and policies needed to be pursued 
and strengthened. While the development of a legislative text might be indicative of 
political will, it would not in itself put an end to the practice. 
</p>
<p>58. As to the lack of concordance of the Personal and Family Code with Mali&#8217;s 
international obligations, the delegation explained that the authorities intended to 
harmonize domestic legislation with the international legal instruments signed by Mali. The 
national policy for the promotion and protection of human rights that was soon to be 
adopted would certainly set out options in that regard. 
</p>
<p>59. To the question of whether the Government had taken any action against people 
involved in obstructing freedom of the press, the delegation replied that the Government 
was committed to fighting any obstacles to press freedom. There had been some 
unfortunate and damaging instances of excesses committed against journalists in the wake 
of the events, at a time of extreme weakness, even non-existence, of the State. Such 
instances had greatly diminished, and any aggression against journalists was now the 
subject of investigation. 
</p><p>60. Portugal condemned the attacks committed by terrorist groups and maintained that 
all those responsible for human rights violations must be held accountable. It hoped that 
further efforts would be made by the Malian authorities to address challenges regarding 
human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. The Republic of Korea emphasized the importance of the international community&#8217;s 
support for Mali. It expected Mali to make considerable efforts to ensure the fundamental 
principle of the rule of law, freedom of expression and the right to property for foreign 
nationals. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. Romania expressed gratitude that Mali was meeting with the Council, particularly 
given the situation in the country. It expressed its solidarity; the Ministry for Foreign 
Affairs had made a statement to that end, highlighting his country&#8217;s support of the territorial 
integrity of the country. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. The Russian Federation noted that events in Mali threatened the stability of the 
entire region and strongly condemned the actions of extremists and separatists. It 
considered that the military operation to restore the territorial integrity of Mali would be 
carried out in strict compliance with Security Council resolution 2085 (2012). It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Rwanda noted with satisfaction that Mali had ratified the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and its Optional Protocol. It also congratulated Mali 
on establishing its national programme against excision. It made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>65. Senegal noted that, in the current situation prevailing in Mali, respect for human 
rights remained an imperative. It pleaded in favour of common concerted action to recover 
the territorial integrity of the country and a permanent return to peace and security. 
</p>
<p>66. Singapore expressed concern about the deteriorating situation in Mali. It noted the 
recent legislative changes, including the strengthening of the domestic legal framework. It </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.13-11815 
</p>
<p>noted also the efforts of the Government to improve access to education and highlighted the 
need for education and training. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>67. Slovakia acknowledged the country&#8217;s commitment to the follow-up of the 
recommendations received in its first review. It welcomed inter alia the signature of the 
third Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the ratification of 
CRPD and its Optional Protocol. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>68. Slovenia noted the establishment of ministries to address the issue of gender 
perspective in the universal periodic review. It called on the Government to ensure respect 
for the human rights of its people and to investigate all human rights violations and hold 
accountable those responsible. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>69. Spain hoped that the Government would be consistent in its efforts to respect human 
rights in accordance with resolution 21/25 of the Human Rights Council. It highlighted the 
risk of the breakdown of national cohesion if existing ethnic tensions were used for political 
ends, thus engendering further human rights violations. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>70. Sudan applauded the efforts by Mali to promote human rights, which included work 
undertaken to implement previously accepted recommendations. It welcomed the signing of 
several international and regional instruments, particularly regarding the promotion of 
development and the fight against poverty, and praised efforts to develop national plans in 
those areas.  
</p>
<p>71. Sri Lanka welcomed efforts in the areas of education, health, nutrition and housing, 
and the adoption of a strategic framework for the reduction of poverty in 2011. It 
commended the development of a national policy to protect children&#8217;s rights and the 
adoption of the Family Code. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. Sweden noted that women in Mali faced domestic violence and that FGM was 
condoned. Men were favoured in divorce and gender equality concerns had been 
aggravated by the internal crisis. It was concerned about stoning and amputations in the 
north and excessive detentions. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Switzerland noted that human rights violations had increased throughout Mali and 
called upon the transitional Government to ensure that alleged human rights and 
international humanitarian law violations were impartially investigated and did not remain 
unpunished. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. Thailand commended Mali for its legislative and institutional reforms promoting and 
protecting human rights. It was concerned that the conflict in the north had caused serious 
violations, given reports of rape, sexual violence and alleged inhumane punishment. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>75. Togo expressed its support for the Government and people of Mali in their 
commitment to safeguard the country&#8217;s integrity, and restore political stability, social peace 
and democracy. It strongly condemned the attacks by armed groups of terrorists and 
criminals in northern Mali. 
</p>
<p>76. Tunisia noted the forward strides made by Mali since the 2008 review, specifically 
its ratification of five instruments and creation of two institutions for human rights. It also 
noted the country&#8217;s initiatives in terms of sexual equality and protection of women and 
children. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>77. Morocco commended the Malian authorities&#8217; commitment to pursuing their 
cooperation with United Nations bodies, the accreditation of its national human rights 
commission, and its advances in constitutional revision and school attendance. It asked 
what progress had been achieved in setting up the judicial transparency programme 
(PREGOT). </p>


<p>GE.13-11815 <b>11 
</b></p>
