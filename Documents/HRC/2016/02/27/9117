<p><b>  Report of the United Nations Development Fund for  
Women on the activities of the United Nations Trust Fund in 
Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p>1. The United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence 
against Women (United Nations Trust Fund) is a multilateral mechanism supporting 
the local, national and regional efforts of Governments and non-governmental 
organizations to end violence against women and girls. Established in 1996 by the 
General Assembly in its resolution 50/166, the United Nations Trust Fund is 
administered by the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) on 
behalf of the United Nations system. By the end of 2008, it had supported 
291 initiatives in 119 countries and territories with more than $44 million. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report to the fifty-third session of the Commission on the Status of 
Women and the tenth session of the Human Rights Council describes progress 
according to the strategic directions of the United Nations Trust Fund in 2008, as 
well as the programming of UNIFEM on violence against women.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Background and context 
</b> 
</p>
<p>3. The normative environment for strengthening efforts to address violence 
against women and girls has improved considerably in recent years. An increasing 
number of Governments have passed national laws, policies and plans of action and 
States Members of the United Nations have repeatedly issued resolutions. In 2006, 
the General Assembly, in its resolution 61/143, recommended that Member States 
pursue systematic, multisectoral and sustained approaches to eliminating all forms 
of violence against women and back those with appropriate institutional and 
financial support, including to the United Nations Trust Fund. In 2007, the 
Assembly, in its resolution 62/133, called on the international community to deepen 
its support for national efforts to eliminate violence against women and girls. In its 
resolution 63/155 on that issue, adopted at its sixty-third session, the Assembly 
stressed the importance of new and increased contributions from all States to the 
Fund in order to achieve the target set by the United Nations Development Fund for 
Women. 
</p>
<p>4. Also in 2008, the Human Rights Council, in its resolution 7/24, encouraged the 
allocation of adequate resources to initiatives at national, regional and international 
levels to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls. And specifically 
on the issue of sexual violence, the Security Council adopted resolution 1820 
(2008), in which it demanded the cessation by all parties to armed conflict of all acts 
of sexual violence against civilians and noted that rape and other forms of sexual 
violence could constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
</p>
<p>5. United Nations reform and the emphasis on &#8220;delivering as one&#8221; are also 
galvanizing an increasing number of United Nations agencies, funds and 
programmes to intensify their contributions to eliminating violence against women 
and girls, both collectively and within their own mandates. In 2006, the in-depth 
study of the Secretary-General on all forms of violence against women 
(A/61/122/Add.7) offered a ground-breaking synthesis of global knowledge, good 
practices and obstacles to ending violence against women and girls. In February 
2008, at the opening of the fifty-second session of the Commission of the Status of 
Women, the Secretary-General launched the UNite to End Violence against Women </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2009/10
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3 </b>08-66140 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>Campaign. The multi-year initiative aims at mobilizing public opinion and securing 
political will and increased resources in order to make existing commitments to 
ending violence against women a reality by 2015, the target date for achieving the 
Millennium Development Goals.  
</p>
<p>6. At the midpoint for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, 
and with gender equality and women&#8217;s empowerment as one of the goals and also 
central to achieving all the others, increased focus on tracking and responding to the 
pandemic is crucial. 
</p>
<p><b>  United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence  
against Women 
</b> 
</p>
<p>7. Since its inception, the United Nations Trust Fund has been a key global 
mechanism for catalysing change and supporting model strategies to end violence 
against women and girls. Grantees benefit from the technical assistance, synergies 
and opportunities available through the work of UNIFEM and the broader work of 
the United Nations to eliminate violence against women and girls. The United 
Nations Trust Fund is the only global grant-making mechanism to bring together so 
many United Nations agencies at the global and subregional levels to review 
strategies for addressing violence against women and girls. 
</p>
<p>8. The 2005-2008 Trust Fund strategy introduced measures to enhance the 
effectiveness of the Fund. It is in line with current national needs and with the 
recommendations contained in the in-depth study of the Secretary-General on all 
forms of violence against women (A/61/122/Add.1), which called for greater 
attention to implementing existing human rights standards, multisectoral 
approaches, strengthened monitoring and evaluation and effective institutional 
mechanisms at all levels to ensure coordination, action and accountability. The 
strategy also took into account the findings of a comprehensive assessment 
UNIFEM had carried out in 2002 and 2003, entitled &#8220;Not a minute more&#8221;, which 
reviewed the contributions of the United Nations Trust Fund and featured a scan of 
leading initiatives in different regions. 
</p>
<p>9. Paragraphs 10 to 22 below discuss progress in implementing the United 
Nations Trust Fund strategy in 2008, according to its five pillars: impact, 
involvement, efficiency, knowledge management and capacity development, and 
resource mobilization. 
 
</p>
<p><i>  Enhancing impact 
</i> 
</p>
<p>10. In order to address the serious gaps in the realization of national and 
international commitments to end violence against women and girls, United Nations 
Trust Fund grant-making has strategically focused on supporting the implementation 
of national laws, policies and action plans. Selected grantee initiatives in 2008 
include increasing the capacity of the judiciary, law enforcement and health service 
providers, creating and strengthening data collection systems and indicators, 
building multisectoral partnerships and increasing attention to the links between 
violence against women and the spread of HIV and AIDS, as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Strengthening judicial systems is essential to ensuring the enforcement of 
laws that address violence against women and guaranteeing women&#8217;s human rights 
and access to justice, with a view to ending impunity. A United Nations Trust Fund 
grant in India supported a lawyers&#8217; collective to develop a bench manual to assist </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/10/43 
E/CN.6/2009/10 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>08-66140 <b>4 
 
</b></p>
<p>the judiciary in uniformly interpreting and upholding the 2005 Protection of Women 
From Domestic Violence Act. The National Judicial Academy, India&#8217;s premier 
judicial training institute, was closely involved in preparing the manual, along with 
high court judges with established track records in rendering judgments under the 
new law. In Bhutan, a United Nations Trust Fund-supported initiative followed up 
recommendations from the 2006 national consultations on women and child-friendly 
judicial procedures. The National Commission for Women and Children 
collaborated with the police and the Royal Court of Justice to institute in camera 
trials and investigations, in order to protect the privacy of survivors and encourage 
them to report crimes. Police and judges from 20 districts have undergone training 
on gender equality and ending violence against women. Central Government 
officials have now made ending violence against women a critical area for action in 
their tenth five-year plan;  
</p>
<p> (b) Holistic service models support the implementation of laws by 
responding to the multiple needs of women survivors of violence. In Albania, 
Refleksione Association, supported by the United Nations Trust Fund, has convened 
local authorities, the police and judicial officials in five municipalities to create 
local councils to address domestic violence. These are piloting a community-based 
integrated referral model, ensuring a multisectoral response in line with the national 
law against domestic violence. Local facilitators, supported by the Ministry of 
Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, are engaged in public outreach, 
partnership-building, and the development of local capacities to monitor the 
issuance of protection orders and provide a spectrum of social, health and legal 
services. The Prime Minister has announced a comprehensive national public 
awareness-raising campaign that will further boost the project&#8217;s impact and 
visibility;  
</p>
<p> (c) Standardized data collection provides the basis for policy and programme 
development and enables monitoring of progress towards implementing national 
commitments to ending violence against women. A United Nations Trust Fund 
initiative in Algeria is supporting the Information and Documentation Centre on 
Women&#8217;s and Children&#8217;s Rights to bring together six institutions in different 
localities to establish a common information system on violence against women. 
The system is helping to shape a national initiative by the ministry in charge of the 
family and women&#8217;s condition. In the spirit of South-South cooperation, a United 
Nations Trust Fund-supported initiative in Southern Africa has drawn on Latin 
American experiences to develop indicators on violence against women. Gender 
Links is working with local partners in six countries and the Southern African 
Development Community to devise a composite index of targets and indicators for 
measuring violence against women in the region. The South African Police Service 
has agreed, as part of a pilot study on baseline data, to share statistics that were 
previously not available. In the Colombian municipality of Soacha, United Nations 
Trust Fund-assisted activities by Corporaci&#243;n Centro de Apoyo Popular have 
mapped high-risk areas for sexual and street violence against women. Advocates 
used this information to push successfully for changes in the new municipal 
development plan. These include the creation of a police station specifically for 
family issues and gender-sensitization training for public employees, particularly to 
increase police capacities to use a gender perspective in assessing the risks of 
violence. Women&#8217;s groups are now monitoring public planning and budgeting 
sessions to ensure these commitments are fulfilled;  </p>

</b></p>
<p> (d) Partnerships and political will extend the reach and increase the 
sustainability of United Nations Trust Fund grants, offering critical support for 
immediate actions to end violence against women and girls, while fostering the 
longer-term transformation of discriminatory attitudes and practices. Since Rozrada 
and the Kiev School of Equality, United Nations Trust Fund grantees in Ukraine, 
successfully advocated for improvements in laws to eliminate intra-family violence, 
2,000 central and local service providers have been trained on issues such as 
identifying women survivors of violence and providing psychological support. The 
initiative has helped broker collaboration among the Ministry of Family, Youth and 
Sport, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, service providers and non-governmental 
organizations to coordinate anti-violence efforts and build on the sharing of joint 
resources. In Cameroon, the United Nations Trust Fund has supported an initiative 
by the Centre for Human Rights and Peace Advocacy that reached an agreement 
with the General Delegation for National Security to create separate police units for 
investigating cases of violence against women. The initiative has also created three 
networks comprised of journalists, women leaders and traditional authorities to 
address and raise awareness on violence against women. The latter has already 
proved successful in reducing harmful practices such as widowhood rites, as 
reported by project beneficiaries;  
</p>
<p> (e) In Puntland State, Somalia, where sustained conflict has fanned violence 
against women and other human rights violations, public recognition of the severity 
of the problems has been low. With United Nations Trust Fund support, the Ministry 
of Women, Development and Family Affairs has been equipped with new capacities 
to collect data and monitor violence against women. It has produced information 
that prompted the President of the Puntland State to call explicitly for greater rigour 
from security forces in upholding existing laws, request parliamentarians to consider 
drafting stronger legislation and place ending violence against women on the 
Cabinet agenda. Through its network of sub-offices, the Ministry is also reaching 
out to religious and community leaders, police officers and community 
organizations to raise awareness and build consensus that all parts of society must 
assume responsibility for ending violence against women. Senior religious leaders 
are coming together to determine how customary laws can be aligned with 
international human rights norms. Clan elders have agreed to discuss their role in 
ending violence against women as part of national reconciliation talks. The Ministry 
has formulated a national plan of action to guide future steps, including the adoption 
of standard operating procedures to be applied by all individuals and groups 
involved in responding to and preventing violence against women. 
</p>
<p>11. Grantees under the special window to address the intersection of violence 
against women and HIV and AIDS are providing the following targeted services and 
empowerment to women who face those twin pandemics:  
</p>
<p> (a) In the Russian Federation, the United Nations Trust Fund has supported 
Doctors to Children to survey gaps in the system of assistance to HIV-positive 
women who are victims of violence, especially those who are pregnant or have 
young children. Representatives from the departments for social protection, health 
and internal affairs of the Kalininsky District of St. Petersburg subsequently 
convened to develop an intersectoral protocol for regulating services to women 
victims of violence and create an interdisciplinary training programme for staff. An 
intersectoral team is now piloting service provision under the protocol, from early 
identification procedures to referrals; </p>

</b></p>
<p> (b) To ensure the effectiveness of its mass communication campaigns, 
Breakthrough, in India, is working in the States of Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar 
Pradesh, where there is a high prevalence of HIV and AIDS, to survey public 
knowledge about the pandemic and its connections to violence against women. For 
example, it found that only 3.3 per cent of respondents knew about the Protection of 
Women From Domestic Violence Act, and that a man&#8217;s unwillingness to use a 
condom was among the reasons least acceptable to men for women to refuse sex. 
The grantee recruited leading advertising agency Ogilvy and Mather to produce, pro 
bono, the Ring the Bell multimedia campaign, which urges men to take a stand 
against domestic violence. The campaign was launched during the XVII 
International AIDS Conference, in August 2008, and it is expected to reach over 
50 million people in the three States. The central Ministry of Women and Child 
Development has picked up campaign materials for its national campaigns to end 
violence against women, and is disseminating them in the media in 23 languages;  
</p>
<p> (c) Many United Nations Trust Fund-supported initiatives focus their 
activities on the rights and needs of especially excluded groups, effectively building 
bridges to greater resources, opportunities and awareness. An initiative in Nepal to 
uphold the rights of migrant women workers facing the risk of violence and HIV 
infection established a partnership with the Skills for Employment Project, funded 
by the Government and the Asian Development Bank. SAMANATA Institute for 
Social and Gender Equality, drawing on its extensive experience with migrant 
women, held train-the-trainer sessions on links between violence against women and 
HIV and AIDS for staff of the Skills for Employment Project. They subsequently 
designed a module for their own curriculum, which offers technical and vocational 
training to 80,000 men and women. The United Nations Trust Fund grantee also 
conducted orientation trainings for 1,500 migrant workers in five cities in the first 
half of 2008 and has supported the formation of a national network for safe 
migration to continue work in that area. In Peru, the Minga Per&#250; Association backs a 
group with extensive experience in intercultural communication in reaching poor, 
indigenous, rural communities, which are not only vulnerable to violence against 
women and HIV but also the most neglected by previous outreach efforts. Training 
for students and teachers in 24 rural schools in the department of Loreto has been 
coupled with new programming on a popular radio show. It invites community 
participation through letters that are read on the air or used to guide programme 
topics; nearly 5,000 letters arrived over the course of the project. The show now 
reaches 89 per cent of rural students in Loreto, helping to reduce wide information 
gaps. Students report that they are more aware of the quality of their relationships, 
the need to use condoms and the right to live free from violence. 
 
</p>
<p><i>  Deepening involvement 
</i> 
</p>
<p>12. Eliminating violence against women and girls rests on mobilizing broad-based 
partnerships and multi-stakeholder alliances and garnering the commitment of an 
ever-growing range of actors. As reported in paragraphs 10 and 11, above, grantees 
play central roles in mobilizing local and national stakeholders around the issue of 
ending violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>13. States Members of the United Nations are essential United Nations Trust Fund 
partners through their role as key stakeholders, providing high-level policy direction 
and support at the national and international levels. Representatives of Member 
States also participate in public information initiatives to raise awareness on the </p>

</p>
<p><b>7 </b>08-66140

</b></p>
<p>United Nations Trust Fund and on emerging issues and effective strategies to end 
violence against women and girls. For example, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President 
of the United Republic of Tanzania, and Abdoulaye Wade, President of Senegal,1 
were the first Heads of State to sign on to the UNIFEM Say NO to Violence against 
Women Campaign, part of the UNite to End Violence against Women Campaign, 
which appeals for public support and increased resources for the United Nations 
Trust Fund. An additional 28 presidents and prime ministers have also signed on to 
the campaigns.2 The Minister for Development Cooperation of the Netherlands 
publicly reiterated his pledge of support to the United Nations Trust Fund upon 
receiving the MDG3 Champion Torch, an initiative of the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs of Denmark to galvanize commitment to gender equality and women&#8217;s 
empowerment.3 Member States are also the main donors to the United Nations Trust 
Fund. In 2008, the Governments of Australia, Austria, Brazil, Finland, Ireland, 
Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Slovenia, Spain, 
Trinidad and Tobago and the United States of America made their contributions. 
</p>
<p>14. The private sector has an important role to play in ending violence against 
women and girls, not only in terms of philanthropy but also through employee 
policies, high-visibility marketing outlets for awareness-raising, or in-kind 
contributions of expertise. Since 2005, Johnson &amp; Johnson has been supporting the 
special window on links between violence against women and HIV and AIDS with 
$700,000 a year. In 2008, Avon Products announced a public-private partnership to 
promote women&#8217;s empowerment and end violence against women, which committed 
$1 million to the United Nations Trust Fund, the largest single annual private sector 
contribution ever. Also Tag Heuer, non-profit organization Zonta International, 
UNIFEM National Committees,4 Cinema for Peace Foundation, and the United 
Nations Foundation made contributions in 2008.  
</p>
<p>15. The United Nations Trust Fund is built on the notion of United Nations 
partnerships, which are assured through the coordinating role of over 20 United 
Nations agency members of the global and subregional inter-agency programme 
appraisal committees. In 2008, in addition to UNIFEM, programme appraisal 
committee members at global and subregional levels included the Division for the 
Advancement of Women; the Economic Commission for Africa; the Economic and 
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific; the Food and Agriculture Organization 
of the United Nations; the International Labour Organization; the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); the Joint United 
Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS; the United Nations Convention to Combat 
Desertification; the United Nations Development Programme; the United Nations

Programme; the World Health Organization; the World Bank; and United Nations 
Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict. Programme appraisal committee 
members also include leading non-governmental organization representatives and 
other experts.5 
</p>
<p>16. In recent years, the United Nations Trust Fund has worked to deepen the 
participation of United Nations agencies in decision-making processes, in order to 
foster increased ownership across the United Nations system. Previously, decisions 
were made only at the global level, through the inter-agency programme appraisal 
committees convened by UNIFEM headquarters. Beginning in 2005, the process 
was decentralized to actively engage subregional inter-agency programme appraisal 
committees convened by UNIFEM. In 2008, subregional inter-agency programme 
appraisal committees met in Barbados, Brazil, Ecuador, Fiji, Ghana, Jordan, Kenya, 
Mexico, Morocco, Nepal, Rwanda, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, South Africa 
and Thailand. Three United Nations resident coordinators6 also took part in the 
appraisal process. As the United Nations Trust Fund administrator, UNIFEM 
continues to explore further opportunities for expanded United Nations and United 
Nations country team roles in enhancing the effectiveness and impact of the United 
Nations Trust Fund, especially at the country level. 
 
</p>
<p><i>  Ensuring efficiency 
</i> 
</p>
<p>17. As a United Nations inter-agency mechanism, the United Nations Trust Fund 
fosters coherence in programme strategies to end violence against women and girls, 
helps to pool and track global resources and strengthens monitoring and 
accountability. All of these functions are in accordance with the principles of 
alignment, harmonization, managing for results and mutual accountability set out in 
the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>18. Across its operations, the United Nations Trust Fund relies on minimal 
infrastructure and lean staffing so that maximum resources are directed to country-
level grant-making. In addition, resources are directly channelled to local 
government and civil society organization partners. The United Nations Trust Fund 
grant appraisal process, which actively engages United Nations agencies at 
subregional and global levels, also enables linkages to existing United Nations 
efforts and national priorities. This decentralized and broadly participatory structure 
helps ensure that funding allocation conforms closely to the capacities and needs of 
diverse countries and regions.  
</p>
<p>19. As United Nations Trust Fund resources continue to grow, a shift to larger and 
longer-term grants allows the more efficient use of resources in the administration 
of the fund. While in previous years the average grant was $50,000 for two years, 
grants starting in 2007 have been issued in the range of $100,000 to $300,000 for

<p>two to three years. In 2008, some grants were as high as $1 million for two to three 
years. The time and labour required to review, approve, monitor and support 
grantees is therefore more cost-effective in relation to the results and impacts 
expected of larger-scale initiatives. 
 
</p>
<p><i>  Generating knowledge and developing capacities 
</i> 
</p>
<p>20. Though replicable strategies to end violence against women and girls have 
begun to emerge, a major challenge has been the lack of systematic and accessible 
evidence of what works. The United Nations Trust Fund has therefore concentrated 
on its role in expanding the global knowledge base of effective approaches to ending 
violence against women and girls. In 2008, the United Nations Trust Fund adopted a 
monitoring, evaluation and knowledge management framework to enhance its 
systems to generate, capture and disseminate knowledge through increased 
investments in monitoring and evaluation.  
</p>
<p>21. The United Nations Trust Fund has been investing in generating new 
knowledge and capturing lessons that can promote replication and upscaling of 
successful models of intervention. For example, under the HIV and AIDS window, 
particular emphasis has been placed on ensuring a rigorous monitoring and 
evaluation plan. The United Nations Trust Fund will support the process for three 
years and ensure that lessons learned are widely available and shared. At the end of 
the pilot experience, the United Nations Trust Fund aims to have produced a tool for 
cross-country evidence-based learning and programming to effectively deploy 
strategies to respond to the linkages between violence against women and HIV and 
AIDS. 
 
</p>
<p><i>  Mobilizing resources 
</i> 
</p>
<p>22. Overall funding for initiatives to address violence against women is on the 
rise, evidenced by the rapid growth of the United Nations Trust Fund resource base 
over the past few years. Between 1996 and 2004, the United Nations Trust Fund 
received just under $10 million in total contributions. For the period 2005-2008, 
total contributions, including pledges, have amounted to a total of $40 million. In 
2008, the United Nations Trust Fund had $22 million to offer for grant-making. The 
increase in annual contributions, however, still lags behind the vast needs and 
demands at country levels. In 2008, the United Nations Trust Fund was still only 
able to meet four per cent of the $525 million in requests received. In order to meet 
the increasing demand, the United Nations Trust Fund seeks broad-based support in 
order to achieve its annual target of a minimum of $100 million by 2015, in the

<p><b>  2008 United Nations Trust Fund grant-making cycle 
</b> 
</p>
<p>23. Calls for proposals for United Nations Trust Fund grants are issued annually 
through an open and competitive selection process. Initiatives should be grounded in 
human rights and responsive to gender equality goals, including by addressing 
inequitable gender norms that cause violence against women and girls. They should 
be holistic and focus on reaching particularly excluded or disadvantaged groups 
through approaches tailored to diverse needs. They should pursue multisectoral 
partnerships, and generate and share knowledge. To optimize the use of resources, 
they should apply evidence of what works and invest in systematic and </p>

<p>comprehensive documentation and evaluation. The United Nations Trust Fund 
emphasizes innovation and investment at the local level, where they are needed 
most. It also underscores the potential for scaling up and replicating successful and 
sustainable initiatives and the need to link community initiatives with national 
priorities. 
</p>
<p>24. In 2008, the United Nations Trust Fund issued its thirteenth call for proposals 
to support the implementation of laws, policies and action plans on ending violence 
against women. Proposals were received under two categories: &#8220;Meeting the 
implementation and upscaling challenge&#8221; and &#8220;Catalytic, innovative and learning 
initiatives&#8221;. For the first time, United Nations country teams working in close 
coordination with national stakeholders7 have been invited to apply for United 
Nations Trust Fund grants, a further expression of the commitment to strengthen 
United Nations collaboration to end violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>25. A total of 1,068 concept notes were received. Programme appraisal committees 
awarded an historic $22 million to 28 initiatives in 38 countries and territories. 
Grantees included Governments (8 per cent), non-governmental organizations 
(65 per cent) and United Nations country teams working in partnership with 
Governments and non-governmental organizations (27 per cent).  
</p>
<p>26. Under the &#8220;Meeting the implementation and upscaling challenge&#8221; category, the 
United Nations Trust Fund awarded $14 million in grants to 16 initiatives in 
26 countries and territories;8 and $8 million to 12 initiatives spanning 14 countries9 
under the &#8220;catalytic, innovative and learning initiatives&#8221; category. The following 
examples highlight select grantee initiatives:  
</p>
<p> (a) In Serbia, the Provincial secretariat for labour, employment and gender 
equality will work towards improving prevention, protection and support services by 
scaling up successful cooperation initiatives that knit together the efforts of social 
service providers, the police, legal professionals, local authorities and 
non-governmental organizations. Through action-oriented research, capacity 
development and coalition-building, the secretariat will enhance capacities and 
strengthen intersectoral and multidisciplinary links to ensure that assistance is 
effective and readily available. It will also cover women at risk of violence as well 
as women already experiencing violence and will include specific actions to reach 
women and girls in poor and marginalized communities, such as rural, refugee, 
Roma and disabled women; 
</p>
<p> (b) In China, the United Nations country team will build upon previous 
pilots to scale up responses to domestic violence in the Hunan, Gansu and Sichuan 
provinces, with a special focus on ethnic minorities and persons displaced by the 
recent earthquake. A joint programme will support the development of a 
multisectoral model to respond systematically to domestic violence and ensure 
increased access to support services, such as legal aid and enhanced referral

<p>systems. By working in close partnership with the All-China Women&#8217;s Federation, 
the Public Security Bureau and the Ministries of Health, Justice and Civil Affairs, 
the United Nations country team will encourage high-level political commitment to 
adopting national policy and legislation on domestic violence. The country team 
will also monitor and document the process as a basis for China&#8217;s further rollout of, 
and advocacy for, policy and legal reforms; 
</p>
<p> (c) In Brazil, Chile, India and Rwanda, Instituto Promundo and partner 
organizations will embark on an innovative cross-regional initiative that will use 
rigorous evaluation to identify effective strategies for engaging men in stopping 
violence against women. Educational workshops and campaign activities tailored to 
requirements in each country will centre on deconstructing traditional notions of 
masculinity and manhood, promoting gender-equitable and non-violent alternatives 
and encouraging positive changes in attitudes and behaviours. By focusing on 
evaluation methods to assess actual changes in attitudes and behaviour, as reported 
by men and their partners, Promundo will compile valuable lessons and make a 
much needed contribution to the global knowledge base in this critical area. 
Evaluation results will be widely disseminated through the MenEngage Alliance, a 
network of more than 400 organizations. Instituto Promundo&#8217;s partners in the four 
regions include the International Center for Research on Women (India), Men&#8217;s 
Resources International (United States of America), Cultura Salud/EME (Chile), 
Sahayog (India), the Rwanda&#8217;s Men&#8217;s Resource Centre, Men Engage Network 
(Rwanda) and Men&#8217;s Resources International (Rwanda); 
</p>
<p> (d) In Morocco, the National Institute for Solidarity with Women will 
expand its pioneering work in defending the rights and promoting the social 
reintegration of single mothers and young girls exploited as domestic labourers, in a 
context where both groups suffer exclusion and face multiple forms of violence. The 
organization will seek to improve legal protections for those two groups and reduce 
social stigma through advocacy campaigns. It will also work directly with single 
mothers and girls engaged in domestic work to support their social reintegration, 
through employment and training for the first group, and the return to school and 
family for the second. A model unit for the orientation and professional reinsertion 
of single mothers will be piloted at the organization and replicated in five other 
organizations working to end violence against women. Partnerships with private 
sector associations will help determine training needs and foster the notion of 
corporate social responsibility within the business community; 
</p>
<p> (e) In Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania, Delhi, India; Rosario, 
Argentina, and Petrozavodsk, Russian Federation, Women in Cities International 
will respond to the challenges posed by the rapid pace and nature of urbanization 
taking place throughout the world. With crime and violence on the rise, women 
increasingly face the fear of sexual violence as a constant threat to their mobility 
and well-being. Building on existing knowledge and using a variety of tools, 
Women in Cities International will map the geography of public gender inequality 
and exclusion and its intersection with race, caste, religion and migrant status in 
four cities on four continents. It will also identify effective policies and programmes 
that work for greater equality. These will contribute to pilot interventions in 
partnership with Governments and non-governmental organizations, which seek to 
create cities that are inclusive and respect the right of all people to live, work and 
move around without fear and barriers; </p>

<p> (f) Common strategies across countries in which partners received grants are 
emerging. In Cambodia, Cameroon, Ecuador, Jordan, the Republic of Moldova and 
Tajikistan, grantees will scale up model centres for survivors of gender-based 
violence. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, India, Nepal and the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, grantees will scale up models of multisectoral responses for 
survivors of gender-based violence. In the Pacific region (Cook Islands, Kiribati, 
Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and others), and in Panama and Peru, 
grantees will create and strengthen government and civil society partnerships to 
address violence against women. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo and 
Zambia, grantees will address impunity through raising awareness and developing 
the capacities of the judiciary. In Ecuador, Lebanon and Liberia, grantees will 
address prevention either by working with men and boys or promoting women&#8217;s 
economic empowerment. In Jamaica and Nicaragua, grantees will harness the power 
of the mass media and the arts to promote equitable and non-violent behaviours and 
attitudes. In Cameroon, a grantee will address violence against girls in schools. In 
Ethiopia, a grantee will mobilize communities against harmful practices. In 
Suriname, a grantee will develop a model to address sexual harassment in the 
workplace. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  The way forward 
</b> 
</p>
<p>27. As the United Nations Trust Fund approaches the end of its 2005-2008 
strategy, an external evaluation is under way to assess its implementation at global 
and country levels. The evaluation will identify strengths, weaknesses, challenges 
and current trends and provide forward-looking recommendations for enhancing the 
effectiveness of the role of the United Nations Trust Fund in ending violence against 
women and girls. A new strategy for the United Nations Trust Fund will be 
developed in 2009, based in part on the findings of the external evaluation.  
</p>
<p>28. The United Nations Trust Fund will continue to invest in strengthening its 
systems for capacity development, monitoring and evaluation, and knowledge 
management. United Nations Trust Fund grantees will be provided guidance and 
skills-building to develop their capacities in evidence-based programme design, 
monitoring and evaluation. Further, the United Nations Trust Fund will provide 
adequate technical and financial support to grantees to systematically monitor and 
evaluate initiatives, also fostering targeted learning and multi-country learning 
initiatives. 
</p>
<p>29. The United Nations Trust Fund is investing in a robust online database system 
that will serve both to collect and systematize findings, facilitating results-based 
reporting and analysis across grants. By capturing, disseminating and making 
learning from grantee reports and evaluations widely available, the United Nations 
Trust Fund contributes to the global knowledge base on effective programme 
approaches to ending violence against women and girls, generating and nurturing 
new theories and practices, as well as lessons learned and models for scaling up. In 
this way, the United Nations Trust Fund is uniquely placed to function as a global 
observatory of emerging good practices, contributing to programming excellence, 
maximization of results and efficient use of resources. 
</p>
<p>30. With a strong and bold strategy, greater political commitment and increased 
resources, the United Nations Trust Fund will continue to work to make the vision </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2009/10

</p>
<p><b>13 </b>08-66140 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>of ending violence against women and girls, and achieving the Millennium 
Development Goals, a reality. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Programming of UNIFEM from the multi-year funding framework, 2004-2007, to 
the strategic plan, 2008-2011 
</b> 
</p>
<p>31. In addition to administering the Trust Fund on behalf of the United Nations 
system, UNIFEM continues to invest in advocacy efforts, brokering partnerships, 
inter-agency collaboration and pioneering approaches to prevent and respond to 
violence against women and girls. These efforts are supported through core and 
cost-sharing funds secured by UNIFEM. Building on its partnerships and 
programming experience under the multi-year funding framework 2004-2007 and 
seizing on the unprecedented historic momentum exemplified at international and 
national levels to end violence against women and girls, UNIFEM has developed a 
strategy on the theme &#8220;A life free of violence: unleashing the power of women&#8217;s 
empowerment and gender equality,&#8221; in line with its strategic plan 2008-2011, which 
elaborates the institutional direction and priority areas to accelerate progress 
towards the implementation and upscaling challenge.  
</p>
<p>32. The strategy outlines a deepening of the ongoing work of UNIFEM in 
advocacy and awareness-raising; policy and legal reform; addressing the linkages 
between violence against women and HIV and AIDS; and developing capacities to 
increase access to services and justice for survivors. UNIFEM has also identified 
emerging areas for intensified future programming, such as incorporating the issue 
of violence against women and girls into leading policy and funding frameworks; 
aligning informal and formal justice systems with international human rights 
standards; addressing sexual violence in conflict and post-conflict situations; and 
developing targeted prevention approaches, especially with key groups, such as men 
and adolescents.  
 
</p>
<p><i>  Programming for effective laws and policies on violence against women and girls, 
including adequate budget allocations for implementation 
</i> 
</p>
<p>33. UNIFEM has continued to support the development, reform, adoption and 
implementation of legislation and policies to address domestic violence, sexual 
assault and rape, and harmful practices, among other forms of violence against 
women at global, regional and national levels. For example, in Fiji and Vanuatu, 
UNIFEM supported the regional rights training team and the United Nations 
Development Programme in advocating for the passage of sexual and gender-based 
violence bills. In Thailand, UNIFEM provided technical inputs to the amended 
Penal Code, which now criminalizes marital rape, and has given legislative reform 
support to the Alliance on the Elimination of Violence against Women in Pakistan. 
At the regional level, the sustained collaboration of UNIFEM with the Southern 
African Development Community Gender Unit and with the NGO Alliance 
contributed to the adoption of the Southern African Development Community 
Protocol on Gender and Development. In South-East Asia, UNIFEM, in 
collaboration with the Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs of Viet Nam 
and the National Committee for the Advancement of Vietnamese Women convened a 
workshop funded by the Canadian International Development Agency and the 
secretariat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations for representatives of 
10 member States, Japan and Timor-Leste on domestic violence legislation reform 
and implementation. In the Great Lakes region, UNIFEM supported the Protocol on </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/10/43 
E/CN.6/2009/10 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>08-66140 <b>14 
 
</b></p>
<p>the Prevention and Suppression of Sexual Violence Against Women and Children 
and, at the global level engaged in avid advocacy efforts that contributed to the 
adoption of Security Council resolution 1820 (2008), which recognizes sexual 
violence in conflict as a security issue. 
</p>
<p>34. Developing workable policies and programmes depends on reliable data, 
information and knowledge. UNIFEM, in cooperation with Governments, civil 
society and other partners, works to strengthen qualitative and quantitative data 
collection and analysis. In Rwanda, UNIFEM, along with the National University, 
developed baseline data on sexual and gender-based violence, and in Timor-Leste, 
mapped sexual and gender-based violence incidences, services and access to justice 
in two districts with the National Statistics Office. In Burundi, UNIFEM 
collaborated with UNDP, UNESCO and UNICEF to conduct training for civil 
society organizations and police on statistics and data collection. UNIFEM 
supported the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Information in Mexico 
to produce a full classification and analysis by State of crimes against women. In 
collaboration with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific 
(ESCAP), UNIFEM conducted a gender analysis of the studies on sexual violence 
against the girl child, undertaken by UNICEF, ESCAP and End Child Prostitution, 
Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes, in seven 
Pacific countries and commissioned baseline surveys of cross-border traders in 
different African subregions to obtain initial data on violence experienced by 
women traders.  
</p>
<p>35. Integrating the issue of violence against women into national development and 
funding frameworks and strengthening national action plans on violence against 
women and girls, in particular, can serve as valuable ways of setting in place the 
institutional, technical and financial resources required for effective coordinated 
responses. UNIFEM has supported those processes in a number of countries, for 
example, with its contribution to the development of a national strategy and plan on 
gender-based violence in Afghanistan. In Georgia, UNIFEM supported national 
partners to mainstream gender in an economic recovery and poverty reduction 
paper, which, as adopted in the political statement of the Parliament, contains a 
commitment to reduce harmful practices against women, including family violence. 
UNIFEM regional efforts have included the convening of a high-level regional 
consultation towards the creation of the first regional action plan to eradicate sexual 
violence and end impunity in the Great Lakes region in cooperation with UNICEF, 
OHCHR, UNFPA and the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo. In West Africa, a UNIFEM-supported workshop with 
Christian and Muslim religious leaders resulted in the adoption of an action plan 
that includes tackling violence against women. 
</p>
<p>36. Implementation of laws and policies requires adequate resource allocation by 
Government. Through gender-responsive budgeting programme efforts of UNIFEM 
in South-Eastern Europe, increases to the 2008 regional and municipal budgets of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina were made for civil society-run domestic violence shelters 
with ensured and sustained co-financing of shelter operations by amendments to the 
domestic violence law. In Bolivia, UNIFEM-supported advocacy by the Instituto de 
Formaci&#243;n Femenina Integral led to municipal budget guidelines that mandate 
resource allocations to programmes that promote gender equality and provide 
services for women survivors of violence.

<p><i>  Programming to develop the capacity of key policy, service delivery and media 
institutions to address violence against women and girls  
</i> 
</p>
<p>37. UNIFEM has a long-standing history of support to and partnership with 
Governments to enhance capacities in prevention and response to violence against 
women. In Rwanda, the UNIFEM-led, UNDP-supported programme on enhancing 
protection from gender-based violence expanded its work with the Rwanda Defence 
Forces to train military officers and established a gender coordinating desk within 
the Defence Forces, with focal points attached at brigade and battalion levels, an 
intervention replicated by Burundi and the Sudan. In Liberia, UNIFEM worked 
within the security sector to obtain commitments towards ensuring integration of 
women-friendly practices into their operations with respect to the prevention and 
response to sex and gender-based violence cases. In Burundi, UNIFEM worked with 
the police and judiciary to improve protection mechanisms for survivors, and in 
Uganda, supported the Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development to 
institutionalize training on sex and gender-based violence for all police recruits in 
the northern region. 
</p>
<p>38. In the justice sector, UNIFEM, in collaboration with the non-governmental 
organization Pro-Femmes, trained Gacaca judges in Rwanda in dealing with sex and 
gender-based violence cases, which led to the transfer of such cases to the formal 
justice system. UNIFEM also established a partnership with the Supreme Court of 
Rwanda, training judges and prosecutors and highlighting the need to review court 
procedures in order to facilitate access to justice for sex and gender-based violence 
survivors. In Liberia, UNIFEM worked with the police, prison authorities, judges 
and law court officials to apply gender justice principles to sex and gender-based 
violence cases. In Haiti, UNIFEM supported the Minist&#232;re &#224; la condition f&#233;minine et 
aux droits des femmes to develop training modules and train justices of the peace on 
gender-based violence, including methods of prosecuting sex and gender-based 
violence cases in select communities across two provinces. In Viet Nam, UNIFEM 
provided assistance for a two-day training course for 100 National Assembly 
deputies on the supervision of the implementation of gender equality laws, including 
the Family Violence Prevention Law.  
</p>
<p>39. UNIFEM has also supported the efforts of its partners in the media, such as the 
Association of Women Journalists in Burundi, which conducted training sessions, 
held events and disseminated information on the Penal Code and rape. Partners in 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda were also given support to 
implement radio programmes on care for sex and gender-based violence survivors, 
with awareness-raising radio messages informing communities of available services.  
</p>
<p>40. UNIFEM continues to develop critical global partnerships with groups and 
networks that are vital allies in expanding the reach of violence prevention efforts. 
At the institutional level, UNIFEM has joined forces with the MenEngage Alliance, 
which represents over 450 organizations working with men and boys to promote 
gender equality and end violence against women and girls. In November, UNIFEM 
solidified collaboration with Religions for Peace, the world&#8217;s largest and most 
representative multireligious coalition, to harness the power of communities of faith 
around the world to help end violence against women and girls.  
</p>
<p>41. UNIFEM also continues to play a key role in large-scale inter-agency 
initiatives on violence against women, including as a founding and active member 
of United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict, the Inter-Agency </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/10/43 
E/CN.6/2009/10 </b> 
 
</p>
<p>08-66140 <b>16 
 
</b></p>
<p>Standing Committee Sub-Working Group on Gender and Humanitarian Action, the 
Task Force on Violence against Women established within the Inter-Agency 
Network on Women and Gender Equality, the Inter-Agency Task Force on 
Adolescent Girls, and as a member of the six United Nations entities on the high-
level steering committee of the UNite to End Violence Against Women campaign. 
UNIFEM serves as a lead or partner agency on several joint United Nations 
initiatives on violence against women, including programmes sponsored by the 
Millennium Development Goals Achievement Fund of the Government of Spain in 
Bangladesh, Colombia and Morocco; the Asia Pacific regional joint programme 
entitled &#8220;Partners for prevention: working with boys and men to prevent gender-
based violence&#8221;; and the One United Nations pilots in Albania, Rwanda and 
Uruguay.  
 
</p>
<p><b>  Programming to strengthen community-level initiatives that address violence 
against women and girls  
</b> 
</p>
<p>42. Community-level initiatives to end violence against women and girls are 
fundamental to effecting sustained change. UNIFEM is strengthening promising 
initiatives while supporting innovative and emerging areas of programming. For 
example, in Afghanistan, UNIFEM launched a special fund for the elimination of 
violence against women and the girl child, providing 10 initial grants to community-
led initiatives that are addressing violence against women. Other local initiatives 
have been supported through the two-year UNIFEM programme funded by the 
Department for International Development of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland, which focuses on community-led responses to peacebuilding 
and preventing sexual violence in conflict in Afghanistan, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, 
Timor-Leste and Uganda. Building on the promising Safe Cities programme carried 
out in Latin America in partnership with sister agencies and with the support of the 
Government of Spain, UNIFEM is launching a pilot Global Safe Cities initiative 
spanning 8 to 10 geographically representative sites, which will participate in 
developing a rigorously evaluated global model.  
 
</p>
<p><i>  Programming to support excluded women, gender equality experts, advocates and 
their organizations or networks working to end violence against women and girls 
</i> 
</p>
<p>43. UNIFEM has consistently maintained strong ties to women&#8217;s groups, gender 
equality experts, human rights organizations and women&#8217;s ministries, leveraging 
their capacities and political influence to sustain public and policy attention on 
violence against women and to promote implementation and accountability among 
Government counterparts, civil society organizations and United Nations partners. 
In Burkina Faso, UNIFEM partnered with the Minister of Women&#8217;s Affairs on the 
conference of First Ladies on cross-border aspects of female genital mutilation, 
which shared the results of a UNIFEM-sponsored study on the cross-border nature 
of the practice in six West African countries. UNIFEM has supported a number of 
initiatives surrounding the post-election violence in Kenya, including collaboration 
with other United Nations and non-governmental organization partners to produce a 
rapid assessment of gender-based violence; enhance the ability of the Kenyan 
Women Lawyers group to respond to rape cases and to develop guidelines for 
women&#8217;s testimony. In select areas of India, UNIFEM has supported the formation 
of adolescent groups to empower survivors and vulnerable persons to protect 
themselves against trafficking and violence. In Rwanda, UNIFEM supported the </p>


<p><b>E/CN.6/2009/10
</b> 
</p>
<p><b>17 </b>08-66140 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>establishment of a gender-based violence committee that has trained and sensitized 
residents in the Rutsiro District on the prevention of sexual violence against women 
and children.  
</p>
<p>44. UNIFEM facilitates a number of opportunities for information-sharing, 
exchange of knowledge and learning to bolster the advocacy and implementation 
efforts of partners. A UNIFEM-supported regional workshop convened by the 
Bulgarian Gender Research Foundation brought together United Nations Trust Fund 
grantees, local authorities and service delivery organizations from Albania, Bosnia 
and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Montenegro, Serbia, the former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia, Turkey, Ukraine and Uzbekistan to impart their experiences 
and knowledge in implementing coordinated community responses to domestic 
violence. At the International AIDS Conference in Mexico City, UNIFEM 
organized, in collaboration with UNFPA and UNDP, a satellite session on the 
intersections between violence against women and HIV and AIDS, which 
highlighted programmatic learning for evidence-based advocacy and strategic policy 
interventions towards improved implementation and scale-up. In the Caribbean, 
UNIFEM supported the development of a violence against women and HIV training 
course addressing prevention, treatment and care, as well as responses to emerging 
policy issues. As part of the UNIFEM and Red M&#365;jer y H&#225;bitat Safe Cities 
Programme, supported by the Government of Spain, an online learning course was 
created on urban violence, insecurity and discrimination. At the global level, 
UNIFEM is developing an online site that will provide country-level implementers 
with step-by-step programming guidance, promising practices and lead tools on 
ending violence against women and girls.   
</p>
<p>45. UNIFEM plays a key role in promoting the implementation of Security 
Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008) in partnership with various 
stakeholders. These efforts include the UNIFEM-facilitated Wilton Park conference, 
undertaken in collaboration with United Nations Action Against Sexual Violence in 
Conflict, the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and troop-contributing 
Governments, including Canada and the United Kingdom, on the role of military 
peacekeepers in addressing sexual violence during armed conflict; the Arria 
Formula, hosted by the United Kingdom, which fed into background discussion 
material for the Security Council debate on the theme &#8220;Women, peace and security: 
sexual violence in situations of armed conflict&#8221;; and the UNIFEM and Joan B. Kroc 
Center for Peace and Justice co-sponsored conference on crafting human security in 
an insecure world, where the policy and operational aspects of implementing 
Security Council resolution 1820 (2008) were addressed. UNIFEM also collaborated 
with the French Presidency of the European Union to hold a conference on the 
implementation of Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) and 1820 (2008), 
aiming to ensure that European Union security, police and justice missions are 
equipped to respond to women&#8217;s security and justice needs.  
</p>
<p>46. UNIFEM sustains awareness-raising initiatives and campaigns of its own and 
through support to its partners to build public consciousness on violence against 
women and girls. Every year across the globe, UNIFEM avidly participates in the 
16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign. In collaboration with 
UNFPA and other partners, UNIFEM supported a BBC seven-part series entitled 
Women on the Frontline, which profiled issues of rape, femicide and trafficking in 
various countries. In one of the largest and most renowned campaigns of UNIFEM, 
Say NO to Violence against Women, over 5 million signatures, including from </p>

</p>
<p>08-66140 <b>18 
 
</b></p>
<p>Heads of State and ministers representing 60 Governments and from more than 
600 parliamentarians from over 70 countries were gathered and delivered to the 
Secretary-General on 25 November 2008 in support of the campaign. 
 
</p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b> 
</p>
<p>47. UNIFEM will continue its efforts to bridge the implementation and 
accountability gap by supporting intensified country-level action, as called for by 
the campaign of the Secretary-General, through ongoing lead technical assistance; 
intensified capacity development; broadened advocacy and awareness-raising 
endeavours; strengthened partnerships within and outside of the United Nations 
system, including through key inputs to inter-agency initiatives; improved 
monitoring and evaluation of programming interventions; intensified mobilization 
of resources for this immensely underfunded human rights and development 
priority; and provision of new and innovative learning and knowledge-sharing 
opportunities and products.
