<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 22/19, 
adopted on 21 March 2013, in which the Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) &#8220;to prepare a written report, for 
submission to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-fifth session, reflecting human rights 
regarding the technical support and capacity-building needs of Libya, with a view to 
strengthening the promotion and protection of, and respect for, human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and exploring ways of cooperation to overcome the challenges in the 
areas of security, respect for the rule of law, transitional justice and human rights&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>2. Libya is undergoing a difficult transitional period, as it emerges from four decades 
of large-scale human rights violations and an intensive armed conflict in 2011 which 
overthrew the regime of Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, coupled with the collapse of security 
structures and State institutions. Security has continued to be a predominant concern against 
a backdrop of substantial political and criminal violence. The armed brigades which 
emerged during the conflict have increased in size since the end of the conflict in 2011 and 
exert considerable political and military power. The majority of the brigades are nominally 
affiliated to the Government but operate with effective autonomy. Despite the efforts of the 
Government to establish stability and the  rule of law, unrest continues with targeted 
assassinations of State officials, particularly in Benghazi, and further incidents of violence 
in Tripoli and other parts of the country, reflecting an ongoing power struggle among the 
brigades and illustrating the major difficulties the Government faces in asserting its control 
and authority over the whole country.  
</p>
<p>3. On 25 February 2011, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution S-15/1, in 
which it decided to dispatch urgently an independent, international commission of inquiry 
to Libya to investigate all alleged violations of international human rights law. The 
International Commission of Inquiry presented its first report to the Council on 1 June 
20111 and its final report on 8 March 2012.2 In its resolution 22/19, the Human Rights 
Council took note of the final report and encouraged the Government of Libya to 
implement fully the recommendations contained therein.  
</p>
<p>4. On 16 September 2011, in resolution 2009 (2011) the Security Council established 
the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL)  On 14 March 2013, the Security 
Council adopted resolution 2095 (2013), in which it decided that the mandate of UNSMIL, 
in full accordance with the principles of national ownership, should be to support Libyan 
efforts in a number of areas, including to &#8220;promote the rule of law and monitor and protect 
human rights, in accordance with Libya&#8217;s international legal obligations, particularly those 
of women and people belonging to vulnerable groups, such as children, minorities and 
migrants, including through assisting the Libyan Government to ensure the humane 
treatment of and due process for detainees and to reform and build transparent and 
accountable justice and correctional systems, supporting the development and 
implementation of a comprehensive transitional justice strategy, and providing assistance 
towards national reconciliation as well as support to ensure the continued identification, 
separation and reintegration of children affected by armed conflict&#8221;. In fulfilment of the

 A/HRC/17/44. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 A/HRC/19/68, advance unedited version only. </p>


<p>human rights mandate of UNSMIL, its Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law 
Division was established from the outset. The Director of the Division represents the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Libya.  
</p>
<p>5. In February 2013, an international ministerial meeting on support to Libya in the 
areas of security, justice and rule of law was convened in Paris. The meeting was preceded 
by a senior officials meeting held in London in December 2012. During the meeting in 
Paris, the Government of Libya presented its priorities for the development and reform of 
the security, rule of law and justice sectors. The participants issued a communiqu&#233; and 
adopted the National Security Development Plan and the Justice and Rule of Law 
Development Plan, to be implemented by the Government of Libya with the assistance of 
the international community. The meeting welcomed the coordination role and the technical 
support provided by UNSMIL. 
</p>
<p>6. In early 2014, the country is expected to elect a 60-member Constitution Drafting 
Assembly. The new constitution, drafted by the Assembly, is due to be adopted by a 
referendum, which is to be followed by general elections in the same year.  
</p>
<p>7. Despite positive developments, such as the establishment of a national human rights 
institution, the National Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights, and the 
establishment of a Human Rights Committee within the General National Congress, the 
criminal justice system is not yet fully functional and the security sector requires major 
reform.  
</p>
<p>8. Libya is a party to the core international human rights treaties, including the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination Against Women, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the Rights of Child and the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and 
Members of their Families. It has also ratified the first Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention on the Rights of Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. Libya 
is also a party to the African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights,  but has not yet 
ratified, inter alia, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, or the 1951 Convention 
relating to the Status of Refugees and its Optional Protocol. In 2013, Libya ratified the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, although it has not yet deposited the 
instrument of ratification. 
</p>
<p>9. Libya will undergo its second review by the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review in 2015. Under the Qadhafi regime, special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council were denied access to the country. Since the transition, visits by the 
Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and the Working Group on the 
use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of the 
rights of peoples to self-determination were planned for May 2013 but had to be postponed 
for security reasons. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division of 
UNSMIL has provided technical advice to the human rights section of the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs on engagement with, and reporting to, the human rights treaty bodies, the 
universal periodic review and the special procedures of the Human Rights Council. The 
High Commissioner has been invited by the Government to conduct an official visit to 
Libya. </p>


<p><b> III. Human rights priorities and technical support 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Groups in focus  
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Women 
</b></p>
<p>10. Women in Libya are facing challenges in ensuring their fair participation in public, 
constitutional, and transitional justice processes. Six seats out of 60 have been assigned to 
women in the Constitution Drafting Assembly, which is due to be elected in 2014 and 
women may stand for election for the remainder of the seats. The capacity of national 
institutions and civil society to contribute to the protection of women&#8217;s rights is limited.  
</p>
<p>11. In May 2013, the Minister of Justice submitted a draft law on the care of women 
victims of rape and violence to the General National Congress, as current legislation does 
not ensure adequate protection in this regard. It foresees the provision of reparations, 
including compensation, health care, psychosocial support and shelter. It also provides for 
legal aid to enable victims to bring the perpetrators of crimes to court. The law would also 
apply to male victims. 
</p>
<p>12. In association with the Women&#8217;s Empowerment Section of UNSMIL, the Human 
Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has provided advice to the General 
National Congress and the Ministry of Justice on the above-mentioned draft legislation and 
on the promotion and protection of the rights of women in other draft legislation. The 
Division has also developed awareness-raising initiatives to support efforts to ensure, inter 
alia, women&#8217;s right to equal access to justice, in which a number of civil society actors and 
other stakeholders actively participated.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Amazigh, Tabu and Tuareg communities 
</b></p>
<p>13. In the context of ensuring inclusion and attention to all segments of Libyan society, 
the rights of the Amazigh, Tabu and Tuareg communities have been prominent in the 
political debate and reform initiatives since the conflict. According to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the three communities represent less than 4 
per cent of the population, although estimates provided by these communities are higher. 
Many among these communities also consider themselves indigenous peoples. In July 
2013, the General National Congress adopted Law 18 in response to concerns raised by 
these communities. Law 18 recognizes the languages of the three communities as 
&#8220;linguistic and cultural components of Libyan society&#8221; and requires the State to support, 
promote and protect their cultural and linguistic heritage. In addition, the electoral law for 
the 60-member Constitution Drafting Assembly was adopted by the Congress in July 2013 
and provided for equal representation from the three historical regions of Libya; namely 
Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. Two seats were reserved for each of the Amazigh, 
Tabu and Tuareg communities However, at the time of writing, groups from these 
communities objected to the law on the grounds that it did not offer sufficient guarantees to 
protect their rights.  
</p>
<p>14. Staff ofthe  Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division have been 
meeting regularly with representatives of the Amazigh Supreme Council, the National Tabu 
Gathering and the Tuareg Supreme Council, in addition to non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs), human rights defenders and representatives of the General National Congress. The 
Division has also advocated for the formation of an inclusive Constitution Drafting 
Assembly, reflecting the fair participation of all communities, and provided advice and 
training on international human rights law to ensure it is applied to all communities without 
discrimination. </p>


<p><b> 3. Children 
</b></p>
<p>15. Hundreds of children were directly or indirectly exposed to violence, and some 
directly involved, in the conflict in 2011. Limited efforts have been made thus far to 
respond to significant psychosocial needs. While UNSMIL has not received credible 
reports of the recent participation of children in armed brigades, it has documented a 
number of other grave violations committed against children, including the killing of 
children during political and other violence and also violations related to the detention of 
national or migrant minors with adults without due process.  
</p>
<p>16. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division works closely 
with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) in monitoring violations of the rights 
of children. It contributes to the annual report of the Secretary-General on Children and 
Armed Conflict3 and reports relevant violations to the Security Council by way of the 
global horizontal note coordinated by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General 
for Children and Armed Conflict.4 The Division has provided advice on the formulation of 
model constitutional articles related to the protection of children for submission to the 
Constitution Drafting Assembly. The Division and UNICEF have also closely cooperated 
on initiatives seeking to further build the capacity of Libyan NGOs working on child 
protection issues and have supported Government initiatives related to child protection. In 
addition, UNSMIL, with UNICEF and the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), convened a United Nations-Government task force 
to improve coordination in addressing, inter alia, the protection of children, especially those 
affected by conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Internally displaced persons  
</b></p>
<p>17. As a result of the conflict in 2011, almost 60,000 persons from a number of groups, 
such as the Tawergha, Mashashiya and Gualish, the Jaramla in Dirj, the S&#8217;ian in Zigzaw, 
the Tabu in al-Kufra and the Tuareg in Ghadames, remain internally displaced.5 The 
inhabitants of the town of Tawergha are the largest group, totalling about 30,000.6 They 
were forcibly displaced from their town in August 2011 by armed brigades from Misrata, 
following allegations of grave human rights abuses committed in Misrata by pro-Qadhafi 
forces from Tawergha. Members of armed brigades from Misrata have carried out raids 
against camps for internally displaced persons from Tawergha, resulting in unlawful 
killings and arbitrary arrests. The local council of Tawergha decided not to proceed with a 
unilateral return to the town originally scheduled for June 2013, following a commitment 
by the Government to develop a plan for their return and to improve their living conditions 
in the meantime. An overall strategy to ensure the return of the Tawergha communities and 
all other displaced communities to their homes is not yet in place.  
</p>
<p>18. UNSMIL has provided capacity support to the Office of the Prime Minister on 
issues related to internally displaced persons, including humanitarian relief to vulnerable 
groups. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has advocated 
for an overall strategy to ensure the return of the displaced in dignity and safety, which

<p> 
</p>
<p>4
  The mandate of the Special Representative addresses six grave violations, specifically the killing or 
</p>
<p>maiming of children, the recruitment or use of children as soldiers, sexual violence against children, 
attacks against schools and hospitals, denial of humanitarian access for children and abduction of 
children. For more information see http://childrenandarmedconflict.un.

<p>would include transitional justice measures addressing, inter alia, the need to establish the 
facts on the events relating to Misrata and Tawergha as a necessary step towards the 
resolution of the dispute between the two communities. The Division has also provided 
advice for a proposed national conference on internal displacement in Libya organized by 
the Government, which has not yet taken place. The Division will provide further support 
to the Government in addressing the situation in accordance with the Guiding Principles on 
Internal Displacement.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers 
</b></p>
<p>19. The situation of migrants remains a major concern. According to the Ministry of the 
Interior, as of November 2013 there were 4,775 persons held under Law 19 of 2010 in 
detention centres throughout Libya, including in Ajdabiya, Brak al-Shati&#8217;, al-Hamra 
(Gheryan), al-Khoms, Sabratha and Surman. Law 19 of 2010 states that &#8220;[t]he foreigner, 
who is an illegal migrant, is punished by imprisonment with labour or a penalty not 
exceeding 1,000 [Libyan] dinars.  In all cases, the foreigner convicted of one of the crimes 
enumerated in this law shall be deported &#8230; once the punishment is completed.&#8221; Conditions 
in the detention centres are extremely poor, with chronic overcrowding, reports of ill-
treatment and forced labour and a lack of basic sanitary and hygiene standards. Moreover, 
the Libyan authorities have not established a screening mechanism to guarantee the 
protection of vulnerable individuals, such as children, and limited efforts have been made to 
address the situation.<b> </b>The Libyan authorities have noted that further resources are required, 
as well as further international and regional cooperation.  
</p>
<p>20. UNSMIL is working closely with UNHCR, the International Organization for 
Migration and other international agencies in advocating for the rights of migrants, refugees 
and asylum seekers and participating in joint monitoring visits to the detention centres. 
UNSMIL has also worked closely with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime 
(UNODC) in providing training for police officers which covered, inter alia, the protection 
of the rights of smuggled migrants and the importance of not conflating migration issues 
with the fight against the trafficking of persons and transnational criminal networks. The 
Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division will continue to follow the 
situation and provide advice to the authorities on addressing issues relating to the 
promotion and protection of the rights of migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Administration of justice 
 1. Detention related to the 2011 conflict 
</b></p>
<p>21. The situation of conflict-related detainees remains a critical concern in urgent need 
of resolution. According to the Ministry of Justice, as of the end of December 2013, fewer 
than 7,000 such detainees were held across the country, mostly by armed brigades, without 
any proper judicial process. Since 2012, the Government has sought to bring armed 
brigades involved in detentions under the official authority of the State by affiliating them 
to specific ministries, even though in many cases the armed brigades have retained actual 
control of the detention centres.  
</p>
<p>22. On 1 October 2013, OHCHR and UNSMIL issued a joint report describing the 
treatment of detainees in Libya.7 The reports sets out how prolonged detention and 
interrogation at the hands of armed brigades without experience or training in the handling 
of detainees, as well as the lack of effective judicial oversight or accountability, has created 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7

<p>an environment conducive to torture or other ill-treatment. In contrast, when detention 
facilities have been handed over to trained officers of the Judicial Police (the prison service 
of Libya), there have been marked improvements in the condition and treatment of 
detainees. The report found that torture is widespread and most frequent immediately after 
arrest and during the first days of interrogation to extract confessions and other information. 
Detainees are usually held without access to lawyers and with only occasional, if any, 
access to families. The report recorded 27 cases of death in custody since 2011, of which 11 
took place in 2013, for which significant information suggests that torture was the cause of 
death. The report also noted the measures taken by the Libyan authorities to address 
arbitrary detentions and torture, such as the adoption of a law in April 2013, criminalizing 
torture, enforced disappearances and discrimination, which provided for terms of 
imprisonment ranging from five years to life depending on the harm caused. 
</p>
<p>23. The  Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has paid 
particular attention to the situation of female detainees and knew of approximately 80 
female inmates held in five prisons or detention facilities as of November 2013. The 
majority were detained without due process in connection with the conflict. Female 
detainees have raised a number of concerns relating to the lack of female guards, the access 
of male guards to their cells and the lack of specialized health care. Several female 
detainees stated that they had been sexually harassed during detention in their cells or 
during interrogation.  
</p>
<p>24. The screening process and the investigation of conflict-related detainees have been a 
major challenge for the public prosecution. Despite progress made in this regard in Misrata 
and Zawiya, thousands of detainees are still awaiting judicial process. The recently 
promulgated Law on Transitional Justice provides for a deadline of 90 days from its 
promulgation to complete the screening process, whereby detainees would be either 
charged or released. However, given the lack of State control of the majority of detention 
facilities, in conjunction with security issues and capacity constraints, the judicial system 
faces a significant challenge in successfully meeting such a deadline.  
</p>
<p>25. In August 2013, a new State prison, the al-Jawwiyah Institution for Correction and 
Rehabilitation, was inaugurated in Misrata. Conditions at the prison are a marked 
improvement on many other detention facilities in Libya. The opening of the prison is an 
important step forward in enabling the handover of detainees to a prison under full control 
of the authorities.  
</p>
<p>26. During the course of 2013, staff of the Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule 
of Law Division visited over 30 detention centres, mostly in western Libya, where the 
largest concentration of detainees is found. Through this monitoring work, the Division 
notified the Libyan authorities of relevant issues and specific cases requiring attention. It 
also made a number of recommendations, which led to interventions by the Ministry of 
Justice and an improvement of the human rights situation in specific detention centres. For 
example the situation in the Majer Correction and Rehabilitation Institution in Zlitan was 
considerably improved following such an intervention in July 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. The judiciary 
</b>27. Under the Qadhafi regime, a parallel judicial system was used as a tool of political 
repression, most often through the State security courts, where the rights of the accused 
were routinely violated, even in instances where these rights were guaranteed in Libyan 
law. In addition, judges, prosecutors, State lawyers and members of the legal department in 
the Government constituted one single corps and the practice of appointing judges to other 
non-judicial legal positions within the corps was often used by the regime to punish or 
intimidate judges known for their integrity and independence. This practice was in violation 
of the principle of independence and irremovability of judges. Accordingly, the Human </p>


<p>Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has called for the independence and 
competence of the judiciary to be strengthened through reform of the composition of the 
Supreme Judicial Council and enhanced integrity and accountability, as laid out in the 
Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct. 
</p>
<p>28. After the revolution, the Supreme Judicial Council abolished the State security 
courts and the Constitutional Declaration issued by the National Transitional Council in 
2011 forbade the establishment of special courts and provided for the right of appeal for 
administrative decisions. The Government has also carried out a number of important 
initiatives to reform the judiciary and enhance its independence. In May 2013, the General 
National Congress amended the law on the status of the judiciary to allow for the election 
by peers of 11 out of 13 members of the Supreme Judicial Council. The law also provides 
for the Prosecutor General and the head of the Judicial Inspection to be ex officio members 
of the Supreme Judicial Council. In June 2013, the Supreme Judicial Council elected its 
President and is now considering proposals to further advance judicial reform.  
</p><p>29. In a further welcome step, the Congress adopted a law abolishing the jurisdiction of 
military courts over civilians in April 2013. In addition, a law establishing a specialized 
administrative justice order and a constitutional court is being prepared. This reform aims 
to increase the ability of citizens to challenge administrative decisions and laws. 
</p>
<p>30. Ensuring a safe environment for judges and prosecutors is a fundamental necessity 
for the effective administration of justice. The security apparatus of the Government and 
the Judicial Police in particular does not yet have sufficient capacity, training or equipment 
to ensure the security of judicial officials. Prosecutors and judges are frequently subjected 
to intimidation and assaults. Prosecutors ordering the release of former regime members or 
the arrest of members of armed brigades are the primary target of such attacks and threats. 
On 6 December 2012, the Prosecutor General was assaulted by members of an armed 
brigade in his office for having issued an arrest warrant against one of its members. In 
2013, a number of senior judges were assassinated. The most senior judge and prosecutor 
of the Green Mountain region were both assassinated in Derna in 2013. The bombing of the 
North Benghazi Court in August 2013, which followed several similar bombings in Derna 
and Sirt, further highlighted the vulnerability of the judiciary. In addition, armed brigades 
besieged the Ministry of Justice on two separate occasions in 2013. In response, judges 
organized a series of strikes to protest against the lack of security. This lack of security has 
impeded the effective investigation of human rights abuses, such as widespread torture in 
detention and other grave incidents, including the series of assassinations continuing in 
Benghazi and the violence against peaceful protesters which took place on 15 November 
2013 in Tripoli. 
</p>
<p>31. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has been working 
closely with the High Judicial Institute, which leads on the training of judges and 
prosecutors. The Institute had already worked with the United Nations Development 
Programme (UNDP) and UNODC on updating the training curricula before the revolution 
and has since intensified its programme with the assistance of the Division. In association 
with the institute and in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice, the Division organized 
five training workshops for judges and prosecutors in 2012 and 2013 on the screening of 
detainees, the preparation of prosecutorial strategies, the investigation of conflict-related 
and post-conflict crimes and the application of international human rights and rule of law 
standards. Each workshop was attended by between 25 and 30 judges and prosecutors from 
different regions of Libya. The Division raised awareness of international human rights 
instruments and facilitated the sharing of comparative experiences, contributing to 
enhancing the capacity of Libyan judges and prosecutors. 
</p><p>32. The Division has also worked closely with the Office of Human Rights and 
Humanitarian Law of the Ministry of Defence by providing advice and organizing two </p>


<p>workshops in April and September 2013 on the reform of the military justice system, with a 
view to harmonizing governing principles with international human rights and rule of law 
standards and identifying capacity-building needs.  
</p>
<p>33. In addition, it has participated in a number of seminars organized by the Libyan Bar 
Association, the Libyan Judges Association and the Libyan Lawyers Association through 
delivering presentations and distributing awareness-raising booklets on human rights issues. 
The seminars discussed international best practices on, and comparative experiences of, 
enhancing access to justice for citizens.  
</p><p>34. In advance of the national elections in 2012, the Division organized four workshops 
in April and May 2012 involving over 100 judges assigned to settle election disputes. Over 
40 such disputes were adjudicated in a manner generally considered to be in line with 
international standards. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. The Judicial Police 
</b>35. Operating under the authority of the Ministry of Justice, the Judicial Police have 
broad responsibilities, including managing prisons, enforcing court decisions, securing 
courts and apprehending fugitives. The Government is in the process of integrating 10,000 
members of the armed brigades into the ranks of the Judicial Police but significant 
obstacles remain, including the lack of a robust vetting process and an ongoing need to 
streamline the decision-making process within the department.  
</p>
<p>36. Recurrent cases of prison riots and escapes have underlined existing capacity gaps 
and a shortage of equipment. Break-outs took place from Sabha prison in March, April, 
June and November 2013, resulting in the escape of approximately 200 prisoners. In July 
2013, armed men attacked al-Kweifiya prison in Benghazi. According to the Ministry of 
Justice, 1,169 prisoners escaped, including approximately 500 prisoners charged with 
murder and other serious crimes. However, the authorities succeeded in capturing a number 
of the escapees.  
</p>
<p>37. The leadership of the Judicial Police is keen to establish a professional corrections 
service with specialized officers, including in the areas of registry and data management, 
physical and mental health care and vocational training. To achieve this, a plan has been 
formulated to provide training to all officers upon recruitment and throughout their careers, 
through an independent Libyan training institute based in Tripoli and Gernadah, al-Baida.  
</p>
<p>38. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has provided 
advice and training to the Judicial Police on its structure, management and operational 
standards and meets regularly with its senior management to follow up on continuing 
technical support. Since October 2012, the Division has been working closely with the 
planning department of the Judicial Police on the preparation of a comprehensive prison 
reform strategy. In December 2012, it organized a high-level seminar which brought 
together the Ministries of Justice, Interior and Health, as well as the Judicial Police and the 
Prosecutor General, to discuss interministerial support for prison reform. In December 2013 
in Tripoli, the Division, jointly with the Judicial Police, organized a meeting of all prison 
directors in Libya, providing them with an opportunity to share information and discuss 
with each other ways to overcome existing challenges. The meeting adopted 
recommendations aimed at strengthening the Judicial Police and harmonizing management 
approaches in Libyan prisons. 
</p>
<p>39. In June 2013, the Division submitted a proposal for the organizational restructuring 
of the Judicial Police after close consultation with relevant officials. During these 
consultations, the Division conducted assessments and capacity-building visits to several 
correction and rehabilitation institutions. In August 2013, it provided advice to the Ministry 
of Justice on its plan to develop a new security and operations unit for prisons and courts.  </p>


<p>40. The Division is also working with the Judicial Police on reviewing internal 
regulations to ensure respect for international human rights standards and is providing 
technical assistance on enhancing prison security. Between January and April 2013, it 
delivered three training workshops for approximately 60 Judicial Police officers based in 
prisons in Tripoli and for 20 Judicial Police officers in a prison in al-Zawiya. It also visited 
the Gernadah training centre in February 2013 to deliver a number of &#8220;train the trainer&#8221; 
courses and provide advice on the organizational structure and training programme of the 
centre. This support significantly contributed to improving the knowledge of human rights 
standards of Judicial Police officers. In March 2013, the Division also proposed a draft 
training strategy for the Judicial Police.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Transitional justice 
 1. Law on Transitional Justice 
</b></p>
<p>41. On 2 December 2013, the General National Congress promulgated Law 29 of 2013 
on Transitional Justice, repealing a previous law on transitional justice. The new law 
represents the most important development in this field in Libya thus far. 
</p>
<p>42. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division provided advice 
to the Libyan authorities8 and held expert workshops and events in several cities, including 
in Misrata, Benghazi and Sabha,9 as part of its work to assist with the development of a 
comprehensive transitional justice strategy. It also provided extensive comments on the 
draft law, including comments which were incorporated into it, such as those relating to the 
establishment and functioning of a new truth commission and of a separate reparations 
body. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Truth-seeking 
</b></p>
<p>43. The Law on Transitional Justice provides for the establishment of the Fact-Finding 
and Reconciliation Commission, which will address human rights violations committed 
under the former regime and since its fall. The Commission succeeds its predecessor 
established under the previous law, which has remained largely inactive. The Commission 
is mandated to, inter alia, set out a complete picture of the nature, reason and scope of the 
human rights violations committed; address the situation of displaced persons, missing 
persons, and detainees; and decide upon reparations for victims. It will be headed by a 
board of nine members appointed by the General National Congress. It will operate for four 
years, with the possibility of a one-year extension, and will submit to the Congress a final 
report with recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. In June 2013, the Congress ordered the establishment of a committee to investigate 
the killings in the Abu Salim prison in 1996. The proposed decree was revised and adopted 
as Law 31 of 2013 in December 2013. The Congress also passed a decree establishing a 
committee to identify the causes of a land conflict in the western mountains.

<p><b> 3. Reparations 
</b></p>
<p>45. The Law on Transitional Justice also establishes the Victims&#8217; Compensation Fund 
and provides for reparations, including compensation for material damage, 
memorialization, treatment and rehabilitation. Since the revolution, a number of reparations 
programmes have been established, such as the provision for compensation to former 
political prisoners under Law 50 of 2012. Under this law, all former political prisoners will 
be provided with 8,000 Libyan dinars for each month spent in prison between 1 September 
1969 and 12 February 2011. Other forms of reparation which have been established by 
decree or law include the provision of pensions to the families of the missing and killed and 
compensation for the families of those killed in the Abu Salim prison. There are also 
legislative and other proposals for compensation and rehabilitation for victims of sexual 
and gender-based violence and further reparations for victims of the killings in the Abu 
Salim prison in 1996 and other groups of victims. Finally, a draft law to redress property 
grievances arising from the policies of the Qadhafi regime is under discussion.  
</p><p>46. Given the grave human rights abuses which took place over the previous four 
decades and the legacy of selective subsidies and compensation schemes put in place during 
the Qadhafi regime, crafting viable reparations programmes will be a challenging task for 
the authorities. In addition, the risk of inconsistent approaches to, or discrimination 
between, different categories of victims remains.  
</p>
<p>47. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has been working 
closely with the Ministry of Justice, the General National Congress, other Libyan 
authorities and victims&#8217; groups to ensure the adoption of a comprehensive approach to 
reparations. In this regard, the Division will pay particular attention to the situation of 
women, especially those who have suffered sexual violence, and minority groups.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Criminal justice 
</b>48. A number of trials of senior former regime officials are currently taking place 
against a backdrop of security issues affecting the safety of prosecutors and judges and 
courts which are not fully functioning. In May 2013, former Prime Minister al-Baghdadi al-
Mahmoudi was charged with incitement to kill and corruption. Saif al-Islam Qadhafi is 
currently being tried in Zintan for national security offences relating to his alleged escape 
attempt during a visit by officials of the International Criminal Court in 2012. Two other 
former Qadhafi officials on trial in connection with the misuse of public funds relating to 
the Lockerbie compensation awards were acquitted in Tripoli in June. The former Minister 
of Education and Information and five other former regime officials were sentenced to 
death by the criminal court (<i>Cour d&#8217;Assises</i>) in Misrata in July 2013 for inciting violence 
and the killing of demonstrators. Concerns have been raised with respect to the conduct of 
the trials in compliance with international human rights standards, including in relation to 
access to defence counsel. There are no reports of death sentences being carried out since 
the revolution.  
</p>
<p>49. In October 2013, the Chamber of Accusation of the South Tripoli Court endorsed 
the indictment of 37 high-level figures of the former regime, including Saif al-Islam 
Qadhafi and former chief of intelligence Abdullah al-Senussi. They are charged with crimes 
relating to the 2011 conflict and their trial is expected to take place during 2014.  
</p>
<p>50. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has advised the 
Prosecutor General on the need to adopt a prosecutorial strategy for dealing with the crimes 
of former regime members as well as those committed during the conflict. In this regard, 
the Division has focused some of the above-mentioned workshops organized with the High 
Judicial Institute on the development of prosecutorial strategies and on raising awareness of 
international human rights and rule of law standards.  </p>


<p>51. The Division will work further with Libyan judges to provide advice and capacity-
building support to increase their understanding of the international human rights 
instruments ratified by Libya and their direct application in the national legal system. In 
addition UNSMIL intends to observe selected trials in order to provide advice and 
recommendations on further reforms and training required. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Processes of the International Criminal Court 
</b></p>
<p>52. On 26 February 2011, the Security Council adopted resolution 1970 (2011) in which 
it decided to refer the situation in Libya to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal 
Court and further decided that the Libyan authorities should cooperate fully and provide 
any necessary assistance to the Court and the Prosecutor. On 27 June 2011, the Court issued 
arrest warrants and requested the transfer of Abdullah al-Senussi and Saif al-Islam Qadhafi, 
as well as the late Muammar Qadhafi, to The Hague.10 The Libyan authorities have 
challenged the admissibility of the cases.  
</p>
<p>53. In May 2013, the Pre-Trial Chamber of the Court rejected the admissibility 
challenge by Libya in the case of Saif al-Islam Qadhafi.11 Libya subsequently appealed this 
decision. With regard to the admissibility challenge filed by Libya in the case of Abdullah 
al-Senussi, the Pre-Trial Chamber decided that the case was inadmissible before the court 
under Article 17(1) (a) of the Statute.12 Abdullah al-Senussi&#8217;s defence counsel has appealed 
against this decision.  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Institutional reform 
</b></p>
<p>54. The approach of the Libyan authorities to vetting and institutional reform is an area 
of concern. There has been very limited vetting of new members of institutions, such as the 
armed forces, police, judiciary and Judicial Police. In contrast, strong exclusionary 
measures have been taken against those who served under the Qadhafi regime and they are 
not compliant with international human rights standards in a number of aspects.  
</p>
<p>55. One such measure is the Law on Political and Administrative Isolation which was 
adopted by the General National Congress in May 2013. The law, which is applicable for 
10 years, lists a wide range of political, administrative and other positions, as well as types 
of affiliation and conduct, as a basis for excluding individuals from public life. While the 
law provides for certain due process guarantees, including the right to appeal to 
administrative courts and the Supreme Court, it contains criteria which are vague, far-
reaching and disproportionate and therefore likely to violate the human rights of the 
individuals concerned. Exceptions to the law were considered but ultimately rejected. One 
example of the shortcomings of the law relates to Mohammad El-Magariaf who decided to 
resign as President of the Congress in anticipation of the application of the law to him. He 
had previously been the Libyan Ambassador to India &#8211; one of the positions affected by the 
law &#8211; before leaving the country and engaging in over three decades of active opposition to 
the Qadhafi regime.  
</p><p>56. A number of challenges to the constitutionality of the law were submitted to the 
Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court, including one by the National Council for 
Civil Liberties and Human Rights. The Supreme Judicial Council, charged with the

<p>application of the law to the judiciary, has proposed amendments to the law to mitigate its 
impact on the judiciary. Judges and prosecutors took strike action in June 2013, anticipating 
that the law would further undermine an already weak judiciary. It should be noted that the 
Libyan armed forces are also subject to another stringent vetting process implemented by 
the Integrity and Army Reform Commission. 
</p>
<p>57. Before the adoption of the Law on Political and Administrative Isolation, the  
Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division had advised the General 
National Congress on international standards for vetting State institutions and the risks of 
exclusionary measures. This advice was largely not taken into account.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. Missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>58. Thousands of persons remain missing following the 2011 conflict, in addition to 
those forcibly disappeared under the Qadhafi regime. As at December 2013, 2,644 missing 
persons were registered with the Ministry of the Affairs of the Families of Martyrs and 
Missing Persons. In June 2013, the Ministry prepared a draft law to address the issue of 
missing persons and enforced disappearances. On 22 December 2013, the General National 
Congress adopted a law for the families of those killed or missing during the revolution. 
The law, which provides pensions and benefits such as medical care, government 
employment and symbolic reparation to the families of those killed or missing in this 
context, explicitly excludes those who opposed the revolution. It also establishes a 
commission affiliated with the Council of Ministers to search for and identify the missing. 
</p>
<p>59. In order to address the issue of missing persons, the Human Rights, Transitional 
Justice and Rule of Law Division has provided advice to the technical committee 
responsible for drafting the law. It has also provided advice to support an assessment 
conducted by Physicians for Human Rights13 and endorsed the resulting recommendation to 
create an independent commission to address comprehensively the issue of missing 
persons. A commission such as this was in place before the creation of the Ministry of the 
Affairs of the Families of Martyrs and Missing Persons. In addition the Division has 
provided advice and support to the association of families of the victims of the killings in 
the Abu Salim Prison in 1996. 
</p>
<p><b> D. National human rights bodies 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The National Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>60. In December 2011, the National Transitional Council established the National 
Council for Civil Liberties and Human Rights as the national human rights institution of 
Libya. However, due to a lack of allocated staffing and financial resources, the Council 
only effectively began operating in January 2013. It is encouraging to note that it is now 
fully staffed and space has been secured for its ongoing operations. The Human Rights, 
Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division has provided advice, training and technical 
resources to the Council and referred several cases to it. Upon request, the Division has also 
recruited a dedicated adviser who is providing technical support to the Council to facilitate 
its conformity with the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris 
Principles).

<p><b> 2. The standing committees of the General National Congress 
</b></p>
<p>61. The General National Congress has a number of standing committees, including a 
Legislative and Constitutional Committee charged with elaborating legislative drafts and a 
Human Rights Committee. The  Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law 
Division has engaged with the committees on issues relating to legislation, transitional 
justice, capacity-building, raising human rights awareness and strengthening engagement 
with civil society. It has also provided advice on international human rights mechanisms 
and obligations and coordinated meetings between the Human Rights Committee of the 
Congress and relevant United Nations agencies such as UNICEF. The Division has also 
provided technical advice to support, and participated in, the first forum for human rights 
organizations in Libya organized by the Human Rights Committee of the Congress in April 
2013; it is currently supporting the committee in planning a media campaign to raise 
awareness of human rights amongst the Libyan public.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>62. Civil society was repressed during the Qadhafi era and is now slowly beginning to 
be established. In this regard, the Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law 
Division has engaged with civil society organizations and human rights defenders through 
providing training courses and advice on engaging with international human rights 
mechanisms and the role of the media in the protection of human rights. The Division has 
organized workshops in several locations throughout the country, such as Tripoli, al-Khoms 
and al-Zawiya, on themes including the obligations of Libya under international human 
rights law and has distributed human rights education literature to the civil society 
community across the country. It has also provided substantive advice and support to the 
organization of a major two-day human rights conference held in al-Baida in May 2013. A 
number of civil society representatives and high-level officials attended the conference to 
discuss the protection and promotion of human rights in Libya.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Legal reform 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Libyan penal code and the code of criminal procedure, in addition to other 
legislation, include gaps and provisions that are not in line with international human rights 
standards. For example, Libyan legislation does not criminalize genocide, war crimes or 
crimes against humanity. The death penalty is prescribed for a broad range of offences, 
including offences which do not meet the threshold of &#8220;most serious crimes&#8221; under 
international human rights law.14  
</p>
<p>64. The Human Rights, Transitional Justice and Rule of Law Division continues to 
provide advice to the General National Congress on laws adopted or under discussion since 
the conflict and is supporting the review of the Libyan penal code and code of criminal 
procedure with respect to their compliance with international human rights standards. This 
review was identified by the Government of Libya as a priority at the ministerial meeting in 
Paris in February 2013, however progress has been limited to date. The Division is 
coordinating closely with UNDP, UNODC, the Ministry of Justice, the High Judicial 
Institute, the Congress, academics and civil society to support the review, ensure national 
ownership of it and strengthen national capacity to conduct similar reviews in the future.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 Article 6, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights prescribes that in 
</p>
<p>States that have not abolished it, the death penalty may only be imposed for the &#8220;most serious 
crimes&#8221;. This term has been interpreted to mean that the death penalty should only be applied to the 
crimes of murder or intentional killing. See A/HRC/24/18, para. 24. </p>


<p>65. The Division will also continue to monitor the constitution-making process and will 
seek to provide advice and drafting assistance, in association with other entities of the 
United Nations, to the Constitution Drafting Assembly once it is elected and operational. In 
December 2013, the Division organized two workshops to facilitate discussion of human 
rights and the constitution: the first jointly with the National Council for Civil Liberties and 
Human Rights and the Office of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law at the 
Ministry of Defence and the second with the Human Rights Committee of the General 
National Congress. The Division will continue to organize workshops and training sessions 
to further build the capacity and aid the participation of civil society organizations 
representing all segments of Libyan society, including women, minorities and displaced 
persons, in the constitution-making process. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The</b> <b>United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights recommends that 
the Government of Libya, through capacity-building and technical assistance support: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Comprehensively review and strengthen protections in law and policy to 
guarantee the rights of women, minorities, migrants, refugees and children. All 
necessary measures should be taken to facilitate greater access to justice for these 
groups. In addition, legislation should be adopted and operational policies and 
procedures put in place to combat sexual violence and provide effective redress to 
victims;</b>15<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Develop a comprehensive strategy to address the issue of all persons 
displaced since 2011, ensuring that their right to return to their homes in safety and 
with dignity is guaranteed, whilst providing them with protection and humanitarian 
assistance in the interim, in accordance with the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Urgently address the situation of persons deprived of their liberty, with 
due regard to the situation of female detainees through, inter alia, accelerating the 
process of handing over all detention facilities from the armed brigades to the effective 
control of State authorities and investigating allegations of torture or other ill-
treatment, including sexual harassment, and bringing to justice those responsible. 
Safeguards against torture and other ill-treatment should be put in place in all prisons 
and detention facilities in line with Libyan law, the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
Treatment of Prisoners and other relevant international human rights standards. 
Persons deprived of their liberty should be allowed to receive regular visits from their 
families and visits from their lawyers in full confidentiality. The National Council for 
Civil Liberties and Human Rights and relevant international organizations should 
also be afforded access in accordance with their mandates; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Strengthen the capacity of State institutions, such as the judicial system 
and the Judicial Police, to uphold the rule of law through, inter alia, enhancing the 
security for prosecutors, judges and the courts through close cooperation between the 
Ministries of Justice, Interior and Defence. A prosecutorial strategy should be 
developed to address crimes committed under the former regime, as well as those 
committed since the revolution, and the capacity of prosecutors and judges to handle 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15
 Such procedures and policies would include telephone hotlines, provision of psychological support, 
</p>
<p>establishment of victim rehabilitation centres and implementation of awareness-raising programmes 
to combat discrimination against victims. </p>


<p><b>complex crime investigations should be enhanced. A fair vetting and recruitment 
process for the Judicial Police and other detaining agencies should be established. 
Proper resources and training to ensure the effective management of prisons in line 
with international human rights standards should also be provided; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Implement a comprehensive approach to transitional justice through, 
inter alia, ensuring the appointment of qualified and independent members of the 
Fact-Finding and Reconciliation Commission, taking into account gender issues and 
ensuring the coordination of all truth-seeking initiatives. Full and effective 
reparations should be provided in a fair, consistent and gender-sensitive manner and 
without discrimination. The Law on Political and Administrative Isolation and related 
vetting legislation and policies should be reviewed to ensure that vetting criteria and 
the process for their application are precise, proportionate and fair. Any commission 
for missing persons should be independent and impartial, with the resources and 
authority to search for and identify all missing persons, regardless of affiliation, and 
take the necessary measures to support their families. All necessary measures should 
be taken to ensure a safe environment, free of intimidation, for the trials of members 
of the former regime and members of the armed brigades, whilst ensuring accordance 
with internationally recognized fair trial standards;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Develop a robust legal framework for the promotion and protection of 
human rights by ensuring that the constitution and national legislation are fully 
compliant with international human rights standards, including by completing the 
comprehensive review of the penal code, the code of criminal procedure and other 
legislation. An inclusive, consultative and transparent constitution drafting process 
should be carried out, with the full participation of all sections of Libyan society, 
including those representing women, indigenous peoples and minorities, with the aim 
of adopting a constitution that safeguards dignity, non-discrimination, equality and 
human rights for all;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Take all necessary steps to ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearances, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and 
its Optional Protocol and the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and withdraw all of its reservations to the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, aiming to 
abolish it. Pending abolition, ensure full compliance with the restrictions prescribed in 
particular in article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
including by limiting the use of the death penalty only to the most serious crimes and 
by ensuring scrupulous respect of due process guarantees, including fair trial 
guarantees in capital cases. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights further encourages 
the implementation of the recommendations set out in the report of the International 
Commission of Inquiry on Libya.</b>
