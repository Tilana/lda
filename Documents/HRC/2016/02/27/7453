<p><b>  Note by the Secretariat 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 9/8, the Human Rights Council requested the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>report annually to the Council on measures taken to implement the resolution and on 
</p>
<p>obstacles to its implementation, including recommendations for further improving the 
</p>
<p>effectiveness of harmonizing and reforming the treaty body system, and to seek the views 
</p>
<p>of States and other stakeholders in this regard.  
</p>
<p>2. In its resolution 68/268, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to 
</p>
<p>present to the Assembly, on a biennial basis, a comprehensive report on the status of the 
</p>
<p>treaty body system and the progress achieved by the treaty bodies in achieving greater 
</p>
<p>efficiency and effectiveness in their work, including the number of reports submitted and 
</p>
<p>reviewed per Committee, the visits undertaken where applicable, the individual 
</p>
<p>communications received and reviewed per Committee, the state of the backlog, capacity-
</p>
<p>building efforts and results achieved, as well as the situation in terms of ratifications, 
</p>
<p>increased reporting and the allocation of meeting time and proposals, including on the basis 
</p>
<p>of information and observations from Member States, on measures to enhance the 
</p>
<p>engagement of all State parties in the dialogue with the treaty bodies. The first report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General prepared pursuant to resolution 68/268 will be submitted to the 
</p>
<p>Assembly in 2016. 
</p>

</p>
<p>3. In the light of the current overlapping reporting obligations, the report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General to be prepared pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 9/8 has 
</p>
<p>been postponed and will be submitted to the Council at its twenty-ninth session. The 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General has requested the Secretariat to bring these circumstances to the attention 
</p>
<p>of the Council.
