  the comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to

</b></p>
<p> The Human Rights Council, recalling its resolution 1/5 of 30 June 2006, all resolutions 
of the General Assembly and of the Commission on Human Rights, in particular Assembly 
resolutions 57/195 of 18 December 2002 and 60/144 of 16 December 2005 and Commission 
resolution 2002/68 of 25 April 2002, on the subject, decides: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To heed the decision and instruction of the 2001 World Conference against 
Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance by establishing an 
open-ended working group with the mandate to elaborate, as a matter of priority and necessity, 
complementary standards in the form of either a convention or additional protocol(s) to the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, filling the 
existing gaps in the Convention and also providing new normative standards aimed at combating 
all forms of contemporary racism, including incitement to racial and religious hatred; 
</p>
<p>GE.06-15104  (E)    241106 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To reaffirm its earlier request, contained in its resolution 1/5 of 30 June 2006, to 
the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to appoint five experts, in consultation 
with regional groups, with the mandate to produce a document outlining the substantive gaps in 
the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To reaffirm that the five experts should be appointed in accordance with the 
principle of equitable geographic representation and also ensuring a balanced representation of 
the different civilizations, religions, cultures and legal systems; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To determine that the working group on the elaboration of complementary 
standards shall convene annual sessions of 10 working days commencing after the fourth session 
of the Human Rights Council and also that the working group shall report regularly to the 
Council on progress in this regard; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To request the five experts to report to the working group on the elaboration of 
complementary standards, and that these experts should serve as resource persons for the 
working group, through the development of relevant documents as well as conducting further 
research and studies, as may be required by the working group towards the achievement of its 
mandate; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To recommend to the General Assembly that it decide, at its sixty-first session, in 
compliance with its resolution 60/144, to convene a Durban Review Conference on the 
implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in 2009 with clear, 
attainable objectives which would focus on the realities of present-day racism, racial 
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.  To this end the Council also recommends 
that in the preparatory processes to the proposed review the Assembly should ensure that all 
States and regions demonstrate their resolve and determination to move significantly from 
rhetoric to reality in their actions against all the scourges of racism; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To request the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to give 
visibility and a high profile to the Anti-Discrimination Unit within her Office and to provide it 
with all the necessary and additional resources to ensure its effectiveness, particularly in view of </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the current global challenges of racial and religious discrimination.  The Unit would ensure that 
the High Commissioner makes a positive contribution and plays a leadership role in the global 
efforts to combat all the resurgent scourges of racism. 
</p>
<p> The Council also decides to recommend to the General Assembly the following draft 
decision for adoption: 
</p>
<p> &#8220;The General Assembly, taking note of decision 2/&#8230; of &#8230; November 2006 of 
the Human Rights Council, in particular subparagraph (<i>f</i>) relating to the convening of a 
Durban Review Conference on the implementation of the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action in 2009, decides to endorse the decision of the Council.&#8221;
