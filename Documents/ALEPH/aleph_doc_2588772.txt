Legacy Reserves LP Announces Second Quarter 2016 Results and Provides Operational
and Financial Update
MIDLAND, Texas, Aug. 03, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Legacy Reserves LP ("Legacy")
(NASDAQ:LGCY) today announced second quarter results for 2016 including the following Q2
highlights:
Reduced lease operating expenses, excluding ad valorem taxes, to $41.5 million
representing an 11% decrease compared to Q1 2016 and a 14% decrease compared to Q4
2015
Maintained production of 44,615 Boe/d, a 2% reduction compared to both Q1 2016 and Q4
2015 (without adjusting prior periods for recent asset sales)
Closed an additional $19.0 million of asset sales
Further reduced debt outstanding by $67.6 million including a $37.0 million reduction in
borrowings under our credit facility and $30.6 million of repurchases and exchanges of
senior notes
Operational Update
Through Q2 2016, we spent $11.7 million of our $37 million 2016 capital budget representing a
year to date spend of 32% of the budgeted total. Approximately 22% was spent on recompletions
and workovers in our East Texas region. The majority of the balance was deployed in the
Permian on workovers and on horizontal development under our development agreement with
an affiliate of TPG Special Situations Partners (“TSSP”) under which we operate all wells and
fund 5% of the parties' development capital. Since September 2015 we have drilled and
completed 12 horizontal wells under the program: 5 in Lea County, NM, 1 in Southern Reagan
County, TX and 6 in Howard County, TX. After 6 months of inactivity, we recently resumed
horizontal development and currently have two rigs running, one in Lea County, NM and one in
Howard County, TX. Based on current strip pricing, we anticipate spending our $37 million
capital budget but may deviate from such plans based on market conditions.
2016 Asset Sales Update
Through Q2 2016, we closed 18 divestitures generating net proceeds of $87.5 million. Below are

Near-Term Outlook and Commentary
Paul T. Horne, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Legacy's general partner
commented, “I am proud of the progress we made in Q2 and over the past several quarters. The
difficult macro environment remains challenging but our team continues to make meaningful
operational improvements. LOE was down 11% from last quarter and down 3% relative to Q2
2015, which is very impressive, given the significant increase in our property base from our
acquisition of East Texas properties. We remain incredibly disciplined with our capital spending.
Under our horizontal development program with TSSP, we have funded $4.1 million of capital to
date and averaged approximately 850 Boe/d of net production in the quarter. With great asset-
level results in that program, we recently resumed drilling under the first tranche with a rig
running in both Lea County, NM and Howard County, TX.
Consistent with our view last quarter, we continue to focus on maintaining liquidity and reducing
debt outstanding and therefore we have no near-term plans to resume our distributions on either
our preferred units or common units. As always, we will continue to closely watch the market and
respond with business objectives that match accordingly.”
Dan Westcott, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Legacy's general partner
commented, “We again improved our balance sheet this quarter. Year-to-date, our internally
generated free cash flow and $92 million of asset sales has enhanced our liquidity, reduced
future plugging obligations, and improved our leverage statistics. We've reduced total debt by
$272.4 million and currently have over $100 million of availability under our $630 million
borrowing base. Given the volatility of the macro environment, we continue to review alternatives
for the business including, among others, additional asset sales and new sources of capital. As
noted in the included tables, we've recently added commodity hedges to mitigate some of the
impact of the market volatility. In the past few months, we increased our 2H 2016 oil hedges from
29% to 63% of current production and increased 2017 from 10% to 46%. We also increased our
2H 2016 gas hedges from 52% to 82% of current production and increased 2017 from 49% to
54%. We continue to monitor further hedge opportunities, and would have hedged additional
volumes, but unfortunately, our banks have been unwilling to act as counterparty for additional
hedges, which we believe is based on our credit profile and their desire to reduce exposure to
the oil and gas sector. Commodity prices have improved since our last quarterly report and our
internally projected cash flow has correspondingly increased, but we remain largely exposed to
commodity price volatility. Our plans remain flexible to the environment in which we operate, and
as Paul mentioned, we will adjust accordingly to position Legacy for success.”

Financial and Operating Results - Three-Month Period Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to
Three-Month Period Ended June 30, 2015
Production increased 33% to 44,615 Boe/d from 33,571 Boe/d primarily due to our
acquisitions in the second half of 2015 including our acquisitions of East Texas properties.
Average realized price, excluding net cash settlements from commodity derivatives,
decreased 37% to $18.07 per Boe in 2016 from $28.74 per Boe in 2015 driven by the
significant decline in commodity prices as well as the increase of natural gas production as
a percentage of total production. Average realized oil price decreased 21% to $39.72 in
2016 from $50.48 in 2015 driven by a decrease in the average West Texas Intermediate
("WTI") crude oil price of $12.39 per Bbl partially offset by an improvement in realized
regional differentials. Average realized natural gas price decreased 29% to $1.68 per Mcf in
2016 from $2.38 per Mcf in 2015. This decrease is primarily a result of the decrease in the
average Henry Hub natural gas index price of $0.62 per Mcf. Finally, our average realized
NGL price decreased 18% to $0.41 per gallon in 2016 from $0.50 per gallon in 2015.
Production expenses, excluding ad valorem taxes, decreased 3% to $41.5 million in 2016
from $42.8 million in 2015, primarily due to cost reduction efforts on historical properties,
partially offset by production expenses related to our acquisition of East Texas properties
($7.5 million). On an average cost per Boe basis, production expenses excluding ad
valorem taxes decreased 27% to $10.23 per Boe in 2016 from $14.02 per Boe in 2015,
driven primarily by the inclusion of lower cost production from our acquired East Texas
properties as well as cost reduction efforts in our historical properties.
General and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based Long-Term Incentive Plan
compensation expense increased to $8.5 million in 2016 from $8.2 million in 2015,
reflecting cost reduction efforts partially offsetting increases in salaries and wages
commensurate with a larger asset base following our acquisition of East Texas properties.
Cash settlements received on our commodity derivatives during 2016 were $22.1 million
compared to $37.2 million in 2015. While commodity prices were lower in 2016, the decline
in cash settlements received is a result of the reduced nominal volumes hedges in Q2 2016
compared to Q2 2015.
Total development capital expenditures decreased to $6.9 million in 2016 from $8.4 million
in 2015. The 2016 activity was comprised mainly of the drilling and completion of joint
development agreement wells and capital costs related to CO2 properties.
Financial and Operating Results - Six-Month Period Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to
Six-Month Period Ended June 30, 2015
Production increased 34% to 45,066 Boe/d from 33,674 Boe/d primarily due to acquisitions
in the second half of 2015 including the acquisition of East Texas properties.
Average realized price, excluding net cash settlements from commodity derivatives,
decreased 39% to $16.97 per Boe in 2016 from $27.78 per Boe in 2015 driven by the
significant decline in commodity prices as well as the increase in NGL and natural gas
production as a percentage of total production. Average realized oil price decreased 26% to
$33.96 in 2016 from $46.14 in 2015 driven by a decrease in the average WTI crude oil
price of $13.70 per Bbl partially offset by an improvement in realized regional differentials.
Average realized natural gas price decreased 31% to $1.80 per Mcf in 2016 from $2.59 per
Mcf in 2015. This decrease is a result of the decrease in the average Henry Hub natural
gas index price of approximately $0.75 per Mcf. Finally, our average realized NGL price
decreased 23% to $0.36 per gallon in 2016 from $0.47 per gallon in 2015. This decrease is
due to lower commodity prices.
Despite additional expenses from our acquisition of East Texas properties of approximately
$16.2 million, our production expenses, excluding ad valorem taxes, decreased 1% to
$88.2 million in 2016 from $88.8 million in 2015. On an average cost per Boe basis,
production expenses decreased 26% to $10.75 per Boe in 2016 from $14.56 per Boe in
2015. These significant savings were driven primarily by expense reduction efforts across
our historical property set ($16.8 million) as well as the inclusion of lower cost natural gas
properties acquired in East Texas.
Non-cash impairment expense totaled $15.4 million driven by the continued decline in
commodities futures prices during the first quarter of 2016.
General and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based LTIP compensation expense
totaled $16.3 million in 2016 compared to $16.0 million in 2015, reflecting cost reduction
efforts partially offsetting increases in salaries and wages commensurate with a larger
asset base following our acquisition of East Texas properties.
Cash settlements received on our commodity derivatives during 2016 were $44.9 million
compared to receipts of $77.5 million in 2015. While commodity prices were lower in 2016,
the decline in cash settlements received is a result of the reduced nominal volumes hedges
in Q2 2016 compared to Q2 2015.
Total development capital expenditures decreased to $11.7 million in 2016 from $21.8
million in 2015. The 2016 activity was comprised mainly of the drilling and completion of
joint development agreement wells and capital costs related to CO2 properties.

Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
Financial results contained herein are preliminary and subject to the final, unaudited financial
statements and related footnotes included in Legacy's Form 10-Q which will be filed on or about
August 3, 2016.
Conference Call
As announced on July 12, 2016, Legacy will host an investor conference call to discuss Legacy's
results on Thursday, August 4, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. (Central Time). Those wishing to participate in

Thursday, August 11, 2016, by dialing 855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406 and entering replay code
49069846. Those wishing to listen to the live or archived web cast via the Internet should go to
the Investor Relations tab of our website at www.LegacyLP.com. Following our prepared
remarks, we will be pleased to answer questions from securities analysts and institutional

listen-only basis.
Additional Information for Holders of Legacy Units
Although Legacy has suspended distributions to both the 8% Series A and Series B Fixed-to-
Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units (the "Preferred Units"), such
distributions continue to accrue. Pursuant to the terms of Legacy's partnership agreement,
Legacy is required to pay or set aside for payment all accrued but unpaid distributions with
respect to the Preferred Units prior to or contemporaneously with making any distribution with
respect to Legacy's units. Accruals of distributions on the Preferred Units are treated for tax
purposes as guaranteed payments for the use of capital that will generally be taxable to the
holders of such Preferred Units as ordinary income even in the absence of contemporaneous
distributions.
In addition, Legacy’s unitholders, just like unitholders of other master limited partnerships, are
allocated taxable income irrespective of cash distributions paid. Because Legacy’s unitholders
are treated as partners that are allocated a share of Legacy’s taxable income irrespective of the
amount of cash, if any, distributed by Legacy, unitholders will be required to pay federal income
taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of Legacy’s taxable
income, including its taxable income associated with cancellation of debt ("COD income") or a
disposition of property by Legacy, even if they receive no cash distributions from Legacy. As of
January 21, 2016, Legacy has suspended all cash distributions to unitholders and holders of the
Preferred Units. Legacy may engage in transactions to de-lever the Partnership and manage its
liquidity that may result in the allocation of income and gain to its unitholders without a
corresponding cash distribution. For example, during the six month period ended June 30, 2016,
Legacy closed 18 divestitures generating net proceeds of $87.5 million, and Legacy may sell
additional assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditure, in
which case Legacy’s unitholders may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the
sale, all or a portion of which may be subject to recapture rules and taxed as ordinary income
rather than capital gain, without receiving a cash distribution. Further, Legacy may pursue other
opportunities to reduce its existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or
modifications that would result in COD income being allocated to its unitholders as ordinary
taxable income. The ultimate effect of any income allocations will depend on the unitholder's
individual tax position with respect to its units, including the availability of any current or
suspended passive losses that may offset some portion of the COD income allocable to a
unitholder. Unitholders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors with respect to the
consequences of potential transactions that may result in income and gain to unitholders.
Additionally, if Legacy’s unitholders, just like unitholders of other master limited partnerships, sell
any of their units, they will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized and their tax basis in those units. Prior distributions to unitholders that  in the aggregate
exceeded the cumulative net taxable income they were allocated for a unit decreased the tax
basis in that unit, and will, in effect, become taxable income to Legacy’s unitholders if the unit is
sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that unit, even if the price received is less than
original cost. A substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may
be ordinary income to Legacy’s unitholders due to the potential recapture items, including
depreciation, depletion and intangible drilling.

This press release, the financial tables and other supplemental information include "Adjusted
EBITDA" and "Distributable Cash Flow", both of which are non-generally accepted accounting
principles ("non-GAAP") measures which may be used periodically by management when
discussing our financial results with investors and analysts. The following presents a
reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest comparable
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") measure.
Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are presented as management believes they
provide additional information concerning the performance of our business and are used by
investors and financial analysts to analyze and compare our current operating and financial
performance relative to past performance and such performances relative to that of other publicly
traded partnerships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other publicly traded limited partnerships or limited
liability companies because all companies may not calculate such measures in the same
manner.
Distributable Cash Flow is one of the factors used by the board of directors of our general partner
(the “Board”) to help determine the amount of Available Cash as defined in our partnership
agreement, that is to be distributed to our unitholders for such period. Under our partnership
agreement, Available Cash is defined generally to mean, cash on hand at the end of each
quarter, plus working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter, less cash reserves
determined by our general partner. The Board determines whether to increase, maintain or
decrease the current level of distributions in accordance with the provisions of our partnership
agreement based on a variety of factors, including without limitation, Distributable Cash Flow,
cash reserves established in prior periods, reserves established for future periods, borrowing
capacity for working capital, temporary, one-time or uncharacteristic historical results, and
forecasts of future period results including the impact of pending acquisitions. Management and
the Board consider the long-term view of expected results in determining the amount of its
distributions. Certain factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may be
viewed as temporary, one-time in nature, or being offset by reserves from past performance or
near-term future performance. Financial results are also driven by various factors that do not
typically occur evenly throughout the year that are difficult to predict, including rig availability,
weather, well performance, the timing of drilling and completions and near-term commodity price
changes. Consistent with practices common to publicly traded partnerships, the Board
historically has not varied the distribution it declares based on such timing effects.
"Adjusted EBITDA" and "Distributable Cash Flow" should not be considered as alternatives to
GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, cash flow from operating activities, or
any other GAAP measure of financial performance.
The following table presents a reconciliation of our consolidated net income (loss) to Adjusted
EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow:

(1) Minimum payments received in excess of overriding royalties earned under a contractual
agreement expiring December 31, 2019. The remaining amount of the minimum payments is
recognized in net income.
(2) Equity in EBITDA of equity method investee is defined as the equity method investee's net
income or loss plus interest expense and depreciation. We divested our interest in this investee
in May of 2015.
(3) Estimated maintenance capital expenditures are intended to represent the amount of capital
required to fully offset declines in production, but do not target specific levels of proved reserves
to be achieved.  Estimated maintenance capital expenditures do not include the cost of new oil
and natural gas reserve acquisitions, but rather the costs associated with converting proved
developed non-producing, proved undeveloped and unproved reserves to proved developed
producing reserves.  These costs, which are incorporated in our annual capital budget as
approved by the Board, include development drilling, recompletions, workovers and various
other procedures to generate new or improve existing production on both operated and non-
operated properties.  Estimated maintenance capital expenditures are based on management's
judgment of various factors including the long-term (generally 5-10 years) decline rate of our
current production and the projected productivity of our total development capital expenditures. 
Actual production decline rates and capital efficiency may materially differ from our projections
and such estimated maintenance capital expenditures may not maintain our production.  Further,
because estimated maintenance capital expenditures are not intended to target specific levels of
reserves, if we do not acquire new proved or unproved reserves, our total reserves will decrease
over time and we would be unable to sustain production at current levels, which could adversely
affect our ability to pay a distribution at the current level or at all.
(4)  Represents total capital expenditures for the development of oil and natural gas properties as
presented on an accrual basis. For 2016, we intend to fund our total oil and natural gas
development program from net cash provided by operating activities.
