<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twelfth session from 3 
to 14 October 2011. The review of Togo was held at the 8th meeting on 6 October 2011. 
The delegation of Togo was headed by Ms. L&#233;onardina Rita Doris Wilson-de Souza, 
Minister of Human Rights, Consolidation of Democracy, and Civic Education. At its 12th 
meeting held on 10 October 2011, the Working Group adopted the report on Togo. 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 June 2011, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Togo: Botswana, Kuwait, Poland. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Togo: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted and a written presentation made in accordance 
with paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/12/TGO/1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TGO/2); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/12/TGO/3).  
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Togo through the troika. 
These questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Ms. Wilson-de Souza, Minister for Human Rights, Consolidation of Democracy and 
Civic Education, said that the universal periodic review process had provided Togo with the 
opportunity to reaffirm its commitment to human rights and to take stock of its continuing 
efforts to promote and protect human rights.  
</p>
<p>6. The process of drafting the national report had been both participatory and inclusive; 
it had been accompanied by a wide range of awareness-raising and educational activities 
involving all civil society organizations and had received support in various forms from 
international partners.  
</p>
<p>7. The delegation focused on three of the eight points mentioned in the national report. 
Firstly, the Government gave priority to the promotion and protection of human rights on 
the ground and based the implementation of all its strategic policies and development 
programmes on human rights principles. The Government&#8217;s endeavours enjoyed the 
support of civil society organizations and development partners.  
</p>
<p>8. Togo had ratified the majority of international human rights instruments and 
incorporated them into its fundamental law. It had recently ratified the Optional Protocol to 
the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment and had abolished the death penalty in 2009. It was preparing to ratify the 
Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.11-17383 
</p>
<p>International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
and the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance.  
</p>
<p>9. Togo had taken steps to align its legislation with the provisions of the international 
instruments to which it was a party.  
</p>
<p>10. The Constitution of Togo guaranteed the right to life, security, physical integrity and 
privacy, and prohibited torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment. Those rights were also the subject of specific legislation. 
</p><p>11. The country&#8217;s National Human Rights Commission had been set up in 1987 and had 
enjoyed &#8220;A&#8221; status since becoming a constitutional body in 1992. The independence of the 
Commission was guaranteed by the method used to appoint its members, its 
multidisciplinary composition and its financial autonomy. The National Assembly voted on 
the operational budget of the Commission each year. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to the fight against impunity, the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation 
Commission had finished gathering statements and concluded its inquiries, and was 
currently at the public hearing stage. Once that stage was completed, the Commission 
would formulate its recommendations. Establishing the Court of Audit had also made a 
significant contribution to the fight against impunity for bad governance.  
</p>
<p>13. The Constitution also guaranteed freedom of conscience, religion, opinion, 
expression and association. The exercise of those freedoms was governed by legislation and 
regulations, in particular the Press Code, the Act of 1901 and the decree laying down the 
conditions for cooperation between the Government and NGOs.  
</p>
<p>14. Freedom of access to the courts and the guarantee of a fair trial were recognized in 
the Constitution. Furthermore, through its national programme to modernize the justice 
system, the Government, in collaboration with its development partners, was working to 
strengthen the independence and capacity of the judiciary. The programme also provided 
for the construction of courts and detention centres that met international standards.  
</p>
<p>15. Environmental protection was a major concern of the Government, which had 
adopted several laws to avert biotechnological risks. Togo had adopted the law establishing 
the Water Code in 2010 and the population&#8217;s access to drinking water in rural, semi-urban 
and urban areas had been improved.  
</p>
<p>16. A national strategy to provide decent housing for all had been adopted, together with 
a sectoral investment schedule that included the National Housing Programme for the 
period 2009&#8211;2013.  
</p>
<p>17. In addition, the agricultural recovery strategy implemented by Togo since 2008 had 
generated a surplus of crops in 2010. The National Food Security Agency had been set up 
to regulate the price of basic foodstuffs. 
</p>
<p>18. Togo had ratified 18 International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, 
including the 8 core conventions, and had just adopted several bills authorizing the 
ratification of conventions Nos. 102, 187, 122, 81, 129 and 150.  
</p>
<p>19. The country was firmly committed to combating poverty by promoting employment, 
providing social protection for workers and strengthening the institutions responsible for 
employment. A new labour code had been adopted in 2006 and the civil service was in the 
process of being modernized. Laws establishing the Social Security Code and introducing 
compulsory health insurance for public servants had been adopted in 2011.  
</p>
<p>20. A ministry had been established to better promote social and professional integration 
and inclusion, particularly of young people, and to reduce regional inequalities. Several 
other initiatives, including the national volunteers&#8217; programme and the Integration and </p>


<p>GE.11-17383 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Employment Support Programme, were being implemented. Support was also provided for 
certain income-generating activities, particularly those of women&#8217;s groups.  
</p>
<p>21. Freedom of association was guaranteed through the country&#8217;s six trade union 
confederations and one employers&#8217; organization.  
</p>
<p>22.  The Constitution set out the principle of free and compulsory primary education for 
children up to the age of 15. The first stage of providing free education had begun in 2008 
and had led to a rise in school enrolment rates. In order to meet the challenge of achieving 
universal primary education by 2015, Togo had adopted a plan and the associated budget 
for the education sector for 2010&#8211;2020. Despite all those efforts, the effective exercise of 
the right to education was curtailed by certain sociocultural constraints, insufficient 
funding, inadequate infrastructure and a shortage of qualified teaching staff.  
</p>
<p>23. Togo had adopted the law establishing the Health Code and was committed to the 
Millennium Development Goal for health. It had drawn up a health development plan for 
the period 2009&#8211;2013 and theme-based strategies on malaria and HIV/AIDS had been 
implemented. Moreover, Togo had carried out high-impact interventions in an attempt to 
reduce maternal, neonatal, infant and child mortality.  
</p>
<p>24. An expanded programme of immunization was in operation across the country. 
Antiretroviral treatment had been provided free of charge since 2008, leading to a marked 
increase in the number of people receiving the treatment. Various measures aimed at 
preventing the transmission of HIV/AIDS from mother to child had been taken, such as 
increasing the number of dedicated care centres.  
</p>
<p>25. Notwithstanding the financial difficulties arising from the suspension of 
international cooperation for nearly 15 years, Togo had launched numerous initiatives 
aimed at protecting the rights of specific groups. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to women&#8217;s rights, in addition to establishing a ministry dealing 
specifically with women&#8217;s affairs in 2010, Togo had adopted a law on female genital 
mutilation in 1998, and a national policy on gender equality and equity and the related plan 
of action in 2011. It was expected that a bill to amend the Individuals and Family Code 
would be adopted in 2011. Furthermore, a national strategy paper on gender mainstreaming 
in policies and programmes had been drawn up in 2006.  
</p>
<p>27. With regard to the rights of the child, Togo had adopted a law on the organization of 
civil registration in Togo and installed a child protection telephone helpline. The 2007 law 
establishing the Children&#8217;s Code incorporated all the provisions of the relevant international 
instruments to which Togo was a party.  
</p>
<p>28. With regard to persons with disabilities, Togo had ratified the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto in March 2011. The 
2004 law on the social protection of persons with disabilities was currently being revised to 
bring it into line with the Convention.  
</p>
<p>29. With regard to refugees, Togo had adopted a law on refugee status in 2000 and set 
up a national office to coordinate assistance to refugees in 1994. Togo was a safe haven for 
refugees fleeing the political situation in the subregion but required the assistance of the 
international community to take care of them.  
</p>
<p>30. With regard to achievements, best practices, challenges and constraints, Togo had 
taken action in the political, economic and social spheres to improve the living conditions 
of its citizens. However, the impact of such action was often dependent on the limited 
means at the State&#8217;s disposal.  
</p>
<p>31. Lastly, as to what Togo hoped to get out of the process, the delegation had chosen to 
focus on only a few of many possible items. They included capacity-building to ensure </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.11-17383 
</p>
<p>equal access to justice; support for the establishment of a follow-up mechanism for the 
recommendations of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; support for the 
implementation of a programme similar to the emergency programme to support the prison 
sector; support for the Inter-ministerial Commission for the Preparation of Initial and 
Periodic Reports; support for the harmonization of domestic legislation with international 
instruments; and support for the inclusion of human rights in school curricula.  
</p>
<p>32. Togo thanked all its bilateral and multilateral partners for continuing to support its 
efforts to protect and promote human rights. Togo was aware of the great challenges facing 
it; of the obligations flowing from its human rights commitments; and of the expectations to 
which those commitments had given rise, and the difficulties it would face in fulfilling 
them. However, Togo would do all in its power to ensure that human rights were at the 
heart of the new vision and direction taken by the Government. Togo therefore renewed its 
appeal to the international community to match its determination and help create the 
conditions for true national reconciliation.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>33. During the interactive dialogue, 43 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>34. Cuba highlighted that the protection and promotion of human rights was a priority 
for Togo, despite the difficulties that it faced. Cuba acknowledged the fact that the right to a 
healthy environment reached constitutional rank; the several initiatives implemented 
regarding the right to food; the positive developments regarding education; the plan on 
sanitation; and the strategy to reduce HIV/AIDS and child and maternal mortality. Cuba 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Algeria noted with appreciation the adoption of policies on access to safe water, 
food, housing, education, and health and justice reform, as well as the particular attention 
devoted to vulnerable groups in that regard. It also noted ongoing challenges, such as 
violence against women, prison overcrowding, poverty, illiteracy and women&#8217;s 
underrepresentation in decision-making bodies, and urged the international community to 
lend the necessary support to the country. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. France asked Togo whether the National Human Rights Commission had presented 
any conclusions with regard to the examination of torture claims. Furthermore, it expressed 
concern with regard to the lack of independence of the judiciary and the lack of respect for 
rules concerning custody, which was in contradiction with the State&#8217;s international 
commitments and its constitution. France also expressed concern at bad detention 
conditions, arbitrary detention and prolonged detention without judgment. France made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela welcomed the efforts deployed by Togo 
regarding economic, social and cultural rights, despite the economic difficulties it faced. It 
acknowledged the fact that Togo had increased the school enrolment rate, as well as the 
budget allocated to education. It noted that the international community should provide 
Togo with assistance and cooperation to face the current infrastructure needs in the area of 
education. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>38. Canada welcomed the decriminalization of press crimes, abolishment of the death 
penalty, law on rape, decreased education fees, awareness-raising on sexual and 
reproductive health, and the establishment of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation 
Commission, recently mandated to investigate allegations of torture. Concern was 
expressed at domestic violence, the criminalization of consensual sexual relations between 
adults of the same sex, the limited representation of minorities in civil service, the conduct </p>


<p>GE.11-17383 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>of law enforcement personnel, violence against children and child abuse. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Spain acknowledged the legal steps taken by Togo to reach a greater equality 
through the 2005 Law on Equal Treatment. It expressed its belief that the standing 
invitation to all special procedures would help Togo in improving the protection of human 
rights. It asked what measures Togo had taken to combat the increasing levels of trafficking 
in women. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. The Republic of Moldova commended the adoption of a national human rights 
action plan and programme and the creation of the National Human Rights Commission, as 
well as the accession by Togo to several important human rights instruments. However, it 
expressed concern about discrimination and violence against women owing to cultural or 
traditional customs, and also urged Togo to step up measures against trafficking. The 
Republic of Moldova made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Chad noted with satisfaction that Togo was party to most international and regional 
human rights instruments and had integrated such instruments into domestic legislation. It 
thanked Togo for the support provided to overcome the internal tensions of Chad. Chad 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>42. Viet Nam acknowledged the remarkable efforts undertaken by Togo in maintaining 
social stability and security and noted with satisfaction the development in the fields of 
poverty reduction, education, health care and environmental protection. Viet Nam 
welcomed the efforts of Togo towards building a State based on the rule of law, and 
expressed appreciation with regard to the State&#8217;s commitments to human rights instruments 
and its cooperation with United Nations mechanisms. Viet Nam made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Turkey welcomed that Togo was party to many international human rights 
instruments; the role of the National Human Rights Commission; the establishment of the 
Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission; the State&#8217;s efforts to enhance the rights of 
women; the 2007 Children&#8217;s Code; the measures taken to increase the enrolment rate; and 
the abolition of the death penalty. Turkey encouraged Togo to continue fighting against 
child trafficking and to improve equal access to education for children. Turkey made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Norway commended progress in key areas, while expressing concern at the 
discrimination faced by women in the education system, the infant and maternal mortality 
rates and the conditions of detention centres. Norway commended Togo for implementing 
the 2007 Children&#8217;s Code and for the provision of free primary school. It expressed its 
satisfaction with reports indicating a decrease in acts of torture, but remained concerned 
over the reported lack of independent investigations into alleged torture and violence 
related to the 2005 elections. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. China was appreciative of the constructive attitude adopted by Togo for the review, 
and noted with satisfaction that Togo had acceded to most major human rights conventions. 
China commended the prioritizing by Togo of the advancement of women&#8217;s rights and 
noted with satisfaction the accomplishment in poverty alleviation. China acknowledged the 
numerous challenges faced by Togo in the protection and promotion of human rights and 
urged the international community to provide support. 
</p>

<p><b>8</b> GE.11-17383 
</p>

welcomed recent initiatives aimed at protecting child&#8217;s rights, but expressed concern at 
continued reports of sexual abuse and trafficking. Australia urged Togo to decriminalize 
homosexuality. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. The United States of America commended Togo for the establishment of the Truth,

The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Slovenia commended Togo for establishing the National Human Rights 
Commission, accredited with &#8220;A&#8221; status, and for the ratification of the Convention on the

that children with disabilities continued to face exclusion and that few of them had access 
to education. Slovenia welcomed the abolishment of the death penalty. It asked how Togo 
intended to address the problem of low birth registration rates. Slovenia made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>50. Uruguay commended measures adopted to reach Millennium Development Goal 7

child victims of trafficking. Uruguay recognized that Togo was party to a large number of 
international human rights instruments. Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>51. Chile acknowledged the challenges of Togo and the past political instability, which 
had had a negative impact on human rights. It welcomed the 2006 General Political 
Agreement and congratulated Togo for its commitments set out in paragraph 110 of its

unemployment rate, and to promote good governance. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>52. Argentina applauded the abolition of the death penalty and the adoption of a national 
human rights action plan. Argentina made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>53. Hungary commended the abolition of the death penalty and the accreditation of the 
National Commission for Human Rights by the International Coordinating Committee of 
National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights. With regard to 
discrimination against girls, Hungary noted that Togo had yet to ratify the United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Convention against 
Discrimination in Education. While welcoming the adoption of the 2007 Children&#8217;s Code, 
Hungary noted that a national committee on child&#8217;s rights had yet to be realized. Hungary 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. The United Kingdom urged Togo to take all necessary steps to implement as soon as 
possible the outstanding recommendations of the 2005 fact-finding mission report and of 
treaty bodies related to the General Peace Agreement, as well as to consolidate democratic 
institutions, ensuring that human rights were in line with corresponding international 
obligations, in particular with regard to the rights to freedom of expression and assembly. 
The United Kingdom made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Latvia commended Togo for the inclusive approach taken during the preparation of 
its national report. Latvia welcomed the recent cooperation of Togo with special procedures 
by receiving visits from the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or </p>


<p>GE.11-17383 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>degrading treatment or punishment in 2007 and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights defenders in 2008. Latvia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. The delegation of Togo said that the country had taken steps to modernize its justice 
system, notably by training justice officials and drafting modern legislation to afford those 
officials the best possible working conditions and to improve their performance.  
</p>
<p>57. A department had been set up to ensure access to legal assistance in order to make it 
easier to file a complaint. There were plans to submit a proposal on legal aid to the Council 
of Ministers in the near future. Togo had also taken steps to strengthen the independence of 
the justice system, including by providing magistrates with training in professional ethics. 
A bill intended to guarantee them better financial conditions was currently being finalized.  
</p>
<p>58. Togo had ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and its Criminal Code was currently being revised 
with a view to making torture a criminal offence. The delegation refuted the claim that 
torture was practised systematically in Togo, citing the small number of complaints of 
alleged torture. Nevertheless, the allegations brought before the Supreme Court had 
prompted the Government to refer the matter to the National Human Rights Commission 
for an inquiry to be conducted. The Commission had heard all the individuals concerned. 
Togo would take all measures necessary to ensure compliance with the Commission&#8217;s 
recommendations and urged everyone who witnessed a case of torture to report it.  
</p>
<p>59. Togo had taken steps to shorten the duration of pretrial detention. Decisions were 
handed down as soon as the accused confessed to the acts in question, so as to relieve 
congestion in prisons. A programme aimed at improving conditions in prisons and a prison 
renovation project were currently being implemented. Women, men and minors were held 
separately. There were plans to open a remand prison in the near future.  
</p>
<p>60. The conditions governing police custody were well respected on the whole. In 
November 2010, Togo had called on all justice officials to undertake publicly to improve 
the quality of justice. Togo was prepared to act on reports of any act that had not been 
brought to the attention of the authorities, so that the situation could be remedied.  
</p>
<p>61. With regard to the ratification of new instruments, Togo was making an effort to 
incorporate their provisions into domestic law even before it ratified them, which explained 
why the ratification process was slow. That had been the case in 2009 when the death 
penalty &#8212; now a distant memory &#8212; had been abolished.  
</p>
<p>62. It was the exercise of freedom of expression that had given rise to the democratic 
process in Togo. Therefore, that freedom was respected. Furthermore, the State supported 
the private media and would continue to do so in order to protect that freedom. A law to 
protect the right to demonstrate had been adopted.  
</p>
<p>63. The National Intelligence Agency did not serve as a detention centre. Individuals 
were only detained there under exceptional circumstances. Every effort was being made to 
shed light on allegations that the Agency used torture. 
</p>
<p>64. Togo was not prepared to legislate on the question of homosexuality, given that 
homosexuals were not subject to any form of discrimination. Such legislation might in fact 
be counterproductive, given the attitude of the population.  
</p>
<p>65. Much had been done to improve access to the army, which was now free.  
</p>
<p>66. With regard to the fight against impunity, it was important to strengthen the national 
courts.  
</p>
<p>67. Togo had carried out a study on female genital mutilation. A law adopted in 1998 
penalized the perpetrators of such mutilations. Awareness-raising activities were being </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.11-17383 
</p>
<p>carried out and the practice had become less widespread. A number of women who 
performed excisions had found new occupations thanks to the financial assistance they had 
received.  
</p>
<p>68. A law was currently being revised with a view to combating gender-based violence. 
In addition, the national strategy had paved the way for a nationwide study on gender and 
the establishment of a centre offering psychological, social and legal support. Training 
sessions had been organized for judges, police officers and teachers. The State was also 
cooperating with civil society in that area.  
</p>
<p>69. With regard to the protection of children with disabilities, the Children&#8217;s Code 
protected all children, including those with disabilities. The Act of 2004, which was 
currently being revised, would incorporate the provisions of the Convention. The 
Government, with the support of civil society organizations, was taking steps to improve 
the care provided to that group of children. Togo called on the international community to 
support it in that endeavour.  
</p>
<p>70. Togo was in the process of finalizing a preliminary bill on gender-based quotas, and 
a consensus was emerging in favour of submitting the document to the Council of 
Ministers. 
</p>
<p>71. Sweden welcomed the abolition of the death penalty and the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to reduce child marriages. It was concerned about arbitrary arrests and 
detention, long-term detentions without trial, credible allegations of inhuman and degrading 
treatment in prisons, and the lack of independence of the judiciary. Sweden made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>72. Morocco expressed satisfaction with the ongoing transitional justice process and the 
fight against impunity, commending the efforts of Togo to protect the rights of refugees 
despite its scarce resources. Morocco wished to have further information on the outcome of 
the work of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission and whether the new 
Economic and Social Council would duplicate the work of the National Development 
Commission. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>73. Mexico congratulated Togo for its efforts and achievements, such as the enactment 
of the law abolishing the death penalty and other laws related to social security; the care 
and attention provided to around 20,000 refugees; the approval of the Education Sector 
Plan for 2010-2020, as well as the creation of institutions such as the National Commission 
on Sustainable Development and the National Commission for Refugees. Mexico made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>74. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted that Togo had taken concrete steps in the 
promotion and protection of human rights. The Islamic Republic of Iran made
