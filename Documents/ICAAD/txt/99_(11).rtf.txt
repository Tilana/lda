Pw-1 identified the taxi registration as LT3595 and that the vehicle was driven by Charles Danford and pointed him out as the accused in the accused box. 

In cross examination PW-1 told the court that there was an accident. The Taxi was in front and the other vehicle at the back. He did not know who was at fault. The other driver was taken to the Police Station. He though the accident as investigated. He had no idea if anyone was charged.

The Defence Case 

The material evidence of the accused that he blew in the breathalyzer 3 times nothing showed and then they locked him up. They charged him for refusing to blow and later amended to fail to undergo. 

In cross-examination the accused's evidence was that he was the driver of LT 3959, a taxi and hold licence. On 13/09/09 was bumped from behind. Had no liquor that day. I was tested on the breathalyzer. 2 police tested me. I did not refuse the breathalyzer test. I blew 3 times. 

There was no re-examination of the accused. The accused also did not have any other witnesses. 

Analysis of the Evidence

Section 103 of the Land Transport Act 1998 reads as follows: 

"103. - (1) A person who 

(a) drives or attempts to drive a motor vehicle or is in charge of a motor vehicle while more than the prescribed concentration of alcohol is present in his blood; or

(b) fails or refuses to undergo a breath test or breath analysis when required to do so by a police officer,

commits an offence."

The accused is charged with breach of Section 103 (1) (b) of the Act. "a person who fails or refuses to undergo a breath test or breath analysis when required to do so by a police officer, commits an offence."

The evidence of Pw-1 is that "he questioned accused 3 times to undergo test. Accused failed to supply and a printout was obtained. There was insufficient sample. Accused blew three times. Insufficient sample means not enough sample."

The Section which the accused has been charged with provides for where a person fails to undergo a breath test or refuses to undergo a breath test. 

From the evidence it is clear that the accused did not refuse to undergo a breath test and neither had he failed to undergo a breath test. The accused blew three times and the result of Drager 7110 shows insufficient sample. The Court finds that failing to undergo a breath test is different from failing a breath test. The accused blew three times and at no point he refused or failed to undergo breath test. This element of the offence is not proven by the prosecution.

The Court acquits the accused. 

28 days to Appeal.
