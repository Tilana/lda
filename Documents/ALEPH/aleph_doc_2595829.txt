1.  The Sao Chico Mine was only declared to be in Commercial Production with effect from 1
January 2016 and all costs and revenues relating to this mine were capitalised prior to this
date.  The Income Statements for 2015 therefore only reflect the revenues and costs arising
from the gold produced from the Palito Mine and the Cash Cost and AISC for the 2015
comparative period therefore also only reflect the activities from the Palito Mine.
2.  Excludes gold production of 783 ounces from the Sao Chico Mine which was not in
commercial production during 2015.

Post tax profit of US$1.00 million compared with US$0.01 million for the same six month
period in 2015.
Earnings per share of 0.15 cents for the first six months of 2016.
Cash holdings of US$4.8 million at 30 June 2016.
Average gold price of US$1,216 received on gold sales in the first six months of 2016.
2016 Guidance
Forecast gold production for 2016 expected to exceed 37,000 ounces. 
Reflecting the strengthening of the Brazilian Real against the US Dollar, the Group has
revised its cost guidance and anticipates that All-In Sustaining Cost for 2016 will be between
US$950 to US$985 per ounce.
The Brazilian Real has strengthened by 21.7% since the start of March 2016.
Operational Highlights
9,896 ounces of gold produced for the second quarter of 2016 (Q1 2016 - 9,771 ounces) for
total gold production of 19,667 in the first half of 2016 (H1 2015 : 15,626 ounces)
Mine production totalled 33,606 tonnes.
25,198 tonnes at a grade of 10.48 grammes per tonne (g/t) of gold from Palito.
 8,408 tonnes at 6.81 g/t of gold from Sao Chico.
39,402 tonnes of ore processed through the plant for the combined mining operations.
2,941 metres of horizontal mine development completed in the quarter with 1,910 metres
completed at Palito and 1,031 metres at Sao Chico.
Installation of the third ball mill was completed during the quarter, with a second flotation line
and enhancements in the CIP completed subsequent to the quarter end.  The carbon
regeneration kiln acquired earlier in the year is now being installed and will be
commissioned during the current quarter.  The kiln will regenerate 'fouled' carbon and
enhance gold recoveries.
Daily plant throughput can now be increased from 380-400 tonnes per day (tpd) to over 500
tpd, which is in excess of mined production allowing surface stocks to be depleted in the
second half of the year.
Sao Chico is now being developed on the 156mRL, 140mRL, 128mRL and 116mRL levels,
with production ore being mined from the 156mRL level. The ramp continues to be deepened
from levels 116mRL to 100mRL, the next planned development level. 
During the second quarter, underground exploration drilling has commenced at Sao Chico. 
A programme of approximately 6,000 metres is planned to test the down dip continuity of the
central ore zone. The first hole, completed within the last seven days, reported an
intersection of 46.2 g/t of gold over a drilled width of 2.32 metre, approximately 240 metres
from surface and 100 metres down-dip from the current lowest developed level.
At the end of the second quarter, the combined surface stockpiles at Palito and Sao Chico
totalled 12,000 tonnes at an average grade of 5.0 g/t of gold.
The following link can be used to access a short review of the results by Clive Line CFO and
an update from Palito provided by Mike Hodgson, CEO
https://www.brrmedia.co.uk/broadcasts-embed/5788afc6a7593e3c7bbf7af5/event/?popup=true
Clive Line, CFO of Serabi commented,
 
"In most respects this has been another good financial quarter.  Revenue has increased by 39%
year-on year, with gross profit over the same period up by 130%.  The improvement in the gold
price has also contributed to a 22% improvement in revenue compared with the first quarter of this
year.  We have met our debt repayment obligations and ended the quarter with a cash position of
almost US$4.8 million.  With only a small level of outstanding bank debt, which it is scheduled to
be repaid by the end of 2016, our balance sheet is looking strong.
 
"On  the  cost  side  these  remain  in-line  with  our  internal  forecasts  although  the  Group  has
experienced  higher  levels  of  costs  on  maintenance  and  power  than  originally  estimated,
attributable to a higher level of reliance on diesel powered generators. In Brazilian Real terms, the
operating cost per ounce shows an increase of approximately 4% in the second quarter compared
with the first quarter of 2016.   In dollar terms, however, this cost variation translates to 16%.  The
effects  of  an  unforeseen  strengthening  of  the  Brazilian  Real  during  the  last  few  months  have
slightly  clouded  what  would  otherwise  have  been  another  excellent  quarter,  operationally  and
financially. 
 
"Our financing costs have also shown a significant increase quarter on quarter but a large part of
this increase relates to an accounting entry to reflect the revaluation of a derivative considered, for
accounting  purposes,  to  be  within  the  US$2  million  convertible  loan  that  the  Group  has
outstanding.    As  and  when  this  convertible  loan  is  settled  this  revaluation  provision  will  be
released.  The provision attributed to this derivative at the end of June 2016 was being carried at
US$1.01 million.
 
"In the light of what we now expect will be a period of relative strength for the Brazilian Real and
with over 80% of the Group's expenditure being incurred in Brazilian Reais, this exchange effect
directly impacts on the Group's operating costs.  We therefore have to amend our cost guidance to
reflect this and estimate that the Group's AISC for 2016 will be between US$950 and US$985 per
ounce.
 
"Nonetheless  we  are  continuing  to  achieve  a  good  margin  on  our  production  and  with  gold
production  to  date  running  slightly  ahead  of  our  guidance  and  with  current  gold  prices,  we
anticipate reporting strong results for the second half of the year."
 
The Real/US$ exchange rate
 
At the start of 2016, against a backdrop of an uncertain political climate, with economic growth in
decline, high unemployment and the country possibly entering recession, forecasters considered
that an exchange rate of BrR$4.50 to US$1.00 by the end of 2016 could be expected.
Notwithstanding  the  economic  issues  that  continue  to  prevail,  the  currency  has,  contrary  to
expectations  and  many  other  currencies,  strengthened  significantly  against  the  United  States
Dollar  since  the  start  of  March  2016.    By  early  August  the  currency  had  strengthened  by
approximately  22%  from  its  average  level  for  January  and  February  2016.    "Forecasters,  whilst
currently  predicting  a  possible  weakening  of  the  Real  later  this  year,  now  consider  that  the
exchange  rate  will  remain  artificially  high  supported  by  strong  inward  flows  from  "carry  trade"
investments  attracted  by  Brazil's  high  interest  rates.    Assuming  that  exchange  rates  for  the
remainder of 2016 remain in the range of recent levels of approximately Brr$3.25 to US$1.00, the
Company calculates the effect of exchange rates add between US$110 to US$116 to its original
projected AISC.

1.             General Information
The financial information set out above does not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section
434 of the Companies Act 2006. Whilst the financial information included in this announcement
has been compiled in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS") this
announcement itself does not contain sufficient financial information to comply with IFRS. A copy
of  the  statutory  accounts  for  2015  will  be  filed  with  the  Registrar  of  Companies  following  their
adoption  by  shareholders  at  the  next  Annual  General  Meeting.    The  full  audited  financial
statements for the years end 31 December 2015 do comply with IFRS.
2.             Basis of Preparation
These interim accounts are for the three and six month periods ended 30 June 2016. Comparative
information has been provided for the unaudited three and six month periods ended 30 June 2015
and,  where  applicable,  the  audited  twelve  month  period  from  1  January  2015  to  31  December
2015. 
The  accounts  for  the  periods  have  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  International  Accounting
Standard 34 "Interim Financial Reporting" and the accounting policies are consistent with those of
the annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015 and those envisaged for the
financial  statements  for  the  year  ending  31  December  2016.  The  Group  has  not  adopted  any
standards or interpretation in advance of the required implementation dates.  It is not anticipated
that the adoption in the future of the new or revised standards or interpretations that have been
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board will have a material impact on the Group's
earnings or shareholders' funds. 
These financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in Section 434 of the
Companies Act 2006.
Going concern and availability of project finance
Having commenced initial development activities for the Sao Chico Mine at the end of 2014, this
mine has been in development during 2015.  On 1 February 2016, the Group announced that, with
effect from 1 January 2016, the Sao Chico Mine had achieved Commercial Production.  The Palito
Mine has been in Commercial Production since 1 July 2014.
On  30  December  2015,  the  Group  entered  into  an  agreement  with  Fratelli  Investments  Ltd
("Fratelli"),  its  major  shareholder,  whereby  Fratelli  agreed  to  provide  an  unsecured  short  term
working  capital  convertible  loan  facility  of  US$5  million  ("the  Facility")  to  provide  additional
working  capital  facilities  which  could  be  drawn  down  at  any  time  up  to  30  June  2016.    On  6
January 2016, the Group announced that it had made an initial draw down of US$2 million against
the Facility and there were no further draw-downs against the Facility prior to 30 June 2016. The
Facility is to be repaid by 31 January 2017.
The Group has an additional secured loan facility which is repayable by 31 December 2016.  At 30
June 2016, the amount outstanding under this facility was US$2.67 million.
The Directors anticipate the Group now has access to sufficient funding for its immediate projected
needs.  The Group expects to have sufficient cash flow from its forecast production to finance its
on-going  operational  requirements  to  repay  its  secured  and  unsecured  loan  facilities  and  to,  at
least in part, fund exploration and development activity on its other gold properties. 
However,  the  forecasted  cash  flow  projections  for  the  remainder  of  2016  include  a  continuing
significant increase in production from the Sao Chico Mine compared with the preceding calendar
year.  Whilst the Group has declared  Commercial  Production  at  the  Sao  Chico  Mine,  there  are
risks  associated  with  the  commencement  of  any  new  mining    operation  whereby  unforeseen
technical and logistical events result in additional costs needing to be incurred, giving rise to the
possibility that additional working capital may be required. Additionally the Group is exposed to
changes in gold price and currency exchange rates. Should additional working capital be required
the  Directors  consider  that  further  sources  of  finance  could  be  secured  within  the  required
timescale.  
On this basis, the Directors have therefore concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial
statements  on  a  going  concern  basis.  However,  there  is  no  certainty  that  such  additional  funds
either  for  working  capital  or  for  future  development  will  be  forthcoming  and  these  conditions
indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt over the Group's
ability to continue as a going concern and, therefore, that it may be unable to realise its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.  The financial statements do not include
the adjustments that would result if the Group was unable to continue as a going concern.
