<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report was prepared pursuant to Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions 4 (XXXI), 4 (XXXII) and 1987/50, as well as to Human Rights Council 
decision 2/102. The report covers the period from 1 December 2012 to 30 November 2013. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights highlights the concerns voiced by various United Nations treaty bodies and 
special procedures at the factors and difficulties impeding the implementation of 
international human rights standards on the whole island in view of the protracted conflict 
in Cyprus. It gives an overview of specific human rights concerns in Cyprus, including with 
regard to the right to life and the question of missing persons, the principle of non-
discrimination, freedom of movement, property rights, freedom of religion and cultural 
rights, freedom of opinion and expression, and the right to education. Moreover, it provides 
an update on activities in Cyprus to promote the implementation of Security Council 
resolution 1325 (2000), in which the Council called on all actors involved, when 
negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a gender perspective. 
</p>
<p> The Office concludes that human rights do not have borders and that all 
stakeholders are thus obliged to uphold the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all 
people. It furthermore stresses the importance of addressing all human rights protection 
gaps and the underlying human rights issues in situations of protracted conflicts.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report was prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to Commission on Human Rights 
resolutions 4 (XXXI), 4 (XXXII) and 1987/50, and Human Rights Council decision 2/102.1<b> 
</b>2. As at 30 November 2013, Cyprus remained divided, with a buffer zone maintained 
by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).2 In its resolution 2114 
(2013), the Security Council welcomed the progress to date and the work that the parties 
were putting into preparing for productive negotiations in October 2013.The Council also 
noted, however, that the move towards a more intensive phase of negotiations had not yet 
resulted in an enduring, comprehensive and just settlement based on a bicommunal, bizonal 
federation with political equality, as set out in relevant Council resolutions. It therefore 
encouraged the sides to proceed with the substantive negotiations on the core issues, 
stressing that the status quo was unsustainable.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>3. In the period from 1 December 2012 until the presidential elections held in the 
Republic of Cyprus (on 17 and 24 February 2013), the sides focused their work on 
confidence-building measures through the seven technical committees established in 2008 
(on crime and criminal matters, economic and commercial matters, cultural heritage, crisis 
management, humanitarian matters, health and the environment) and two additional 
committees established in 2010 (on broadcasting and new crossings), which convene on an 
ad hoc basis. During the period under review, from 1 December 2012 to 30 November 
2013, the sides maintained their participation in these committees. The meetings and 
activities of the committees are facilitated by the United Nations, primarily by the Office of 
the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus with support from UNFICYP and 
the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The confidence-building measures 
taken in 2013 included a joint Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot firefighting exercise in 
the United Nations Protected Area conducted by the Crisis Management Technical 
Committee and the successful activation of a cross-community crisis communication 
mechanism to address the identification of livestock disease through the Technical 
Committee on Health and its Joint Committee on Veterinary Matters. In addition, 
significant progress was made in projects relating to the conservation of cultural heritage 
sites implemented by the Technical Committee on Cultural Heritage. 
</p>
<p>4. The presidential elections held in the Republic of Cyprus in February 2013 brought 
Nicos Anastasiades to office, together with renewed hope for the resumption of 
negotiations. Immediately following the elections, however, a severe economic crisis struck 
the Republic of Cyprus. As a result, during his initial months in office, Mr. Anastasiades 
focused on facing the economic crisis and negotiating a financial bail-out package with the 
European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. 
On 30 May 2013, the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders met face-to-face at an

</p>
<p>2
  UNFICYP was established pursuant to Security Council resolution 186 (1964) to prevent a recurrence 
</p>
<p>of fighting between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island and bring 
about a return to normal conditions. Its responsibilities were expanded in 1974 following a coup 
d&#8217;&#233;tat by elements favouring union with Greece and a subsequent military intervention by Turkey, 
whose troops established control over the northern part of the island. Since the de facto ceasefire in 
August 1974, UNFICYP has supervised the ceasefire lines, provided humanitarian assistance, and 
maintained a buffer zone between the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot forces in the north and the 
Greek Cypriot forces in the south (see also www.unficyp.org/nqcontent.cfm?a_id=778). </p>


<p>informal dinner hosted by the United Nations. The sides began engaging directly again on 
12 September 2013, at the level of the representatives of the leaders, to prepare the ground 
for a resumption of full-fledged negotiations. Throughout 2013 and since July 2013 in 
particular, the Office of the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Cyprus meets 
regularly with the parties and relevant national, regional and international actors to maintain 
momentum in the peace process, keep attention focused on a resumption of talks at the 
earliest opportunity, and prepare for a new round of talks. From April 2012 to April 2013, 
the Office of the Special Adviser also worked on cataloguing all the agreements and 
convergences reached during the period 2008-2012 and on developing new approaches for 
addressing remaining divergences in a more results-oriented process. According to 
information received from the Office, since September 2013, the two representatives of the 
leaders have been intensively discussing the drafting of a joint communiqu&#233;, which would 
be issued after the first leaders&#8217; meeting to officially mark the resumptions of negotiations. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Challenges for the implementation of international human 
rights standards in a protracted conflict  
</b></p>
<p>5. During the period under review, various United Nations treaty bodies and special 
procedures mandate holders voiced their concern at factors and difficulties impeding the 
implementation of international human rights standards on the whole island in view of the 
protracted conflict in Cyprus. In this context, treaty bodies and special procedures 
addressed their recommendations and questions to Cyprus, Turkey or the de facto 
authorities in the northern part of the island, respectively.  
</p>
<p>6. Following consideration of the periodic reports of Cyprus on 15 February 2013, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women observed that, while it 
was aware that the State party did not exercise control over all of its territory and was thus 
unable to ensure the practical realization of women&#8217;s rights in areas not under its control, it 
remained concerned that the political situation continued to hinder the implementation of 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in the 
region outside its effective control, and regretted that no information or data on the situation 
of women living in this region could be provided.3 
</p>
<p>7. Similarly, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted in its 
concluding observations, adopted on 30 August 2013, that Cyprus did not exercise control 
over all of its territory and was thus unable to ensure full application of the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The Committee 
remained concerned that the current political situation hindered the efforts to protect 
vulnerable groups covered by the Convention in the territory of the Republic of Cyprus.4 
The Committee also supported the recommendations of OHCHR with regard to addressing 
the underlying human rights issues and causes, including for those groups and communities 
whose rights are guaranteed by the Convention.5 
</p>
<p>8. In its list of issues prior to the submission of the fourth periodic report of Turkey, 
the Committee against Torture requested information from the State party on measures 
taken to ensure effective, transparent and independent investigations into all outstanding 
cases of alleged disappearances, including the large number still outstanding from the 1974

<p>conflict in Cyprus, which the European Court of Human Rights has held to constitute a 
continuing violation.6  
</p>
<p>9. In preparation for the eighteenth session of the Working Group on the Universal 
Periodic Review, the reports of OHCHR compiling information in United Nations 
documents7 and summarizing stakeholders&#8217; submissions for the universal periodic review 
of Cyprus in 2014 during the second cycle8 contain chapters on the situation in, or in 
relation to, specific regions or territories, namely, the northern part of the island. 
</p>
<p>10. In a press release concerning interfaith communication in Cyprus, issued on 22 
October 2013, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief reiterated the 
importance of ensuring that there are no human rights protection gaps and that all persons 
can effectively enjoy their fundamental rights, including freedom of religion or belief, 
wherever they live.9 In his a report on his mission to Cyprus submitted to the Human Rights 
Council at its twenty-second session, the Special Rapporteur referred to the existing 
frustration about the protracted conflict in Cyprus and many unsettled issues. He also noted, 
however, that the vast majority of his interlocutors agreed that the political situation had 
improved in recent years.10 He furthermore addressed a number of practical 
recommendations to the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, the de facto authorities in 
the northern part of the island and other stakeholders.11 
</p>
<p>11. Protracted conflicts may involve a number of duty-bearers, including States and 
non-State actors. On the one hand, States parties must respect and ensure the rights laid 
down in international human rights treaties to anyone within the State party&#8217;s power or 
effective control, even if not situated within the territory of that State party.12 On the other 
hand, non-State actors that exercise government-like functions and control over a territory 
are obliged to respect human rights norms when their conduct affects the human rights of 
the individuals under their control.13 As the norms contained in the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights constitute customary international law, they should be enjoyed by all, 
including those residing in regions of protracted conflict. In turn, these rights need to be 
guaranteed by the authority that has effective control of the territory, regardless of its 
international recognition and international political status. Human rights do not have any 
borders; all stakeholders must ensure that the human rights needs of affected people are 
addressed as swiftly and effectively as possible.14 In order to facilitate access to human 
rights protection mechanisms and effective legal remedies, it is imperative that OHCHR 
and other relevant actors have access and are able to work with non-State actors that 
exercise government-like functions and control over a territory.15

<p><b> III. Specific human rights concerns  
</b>12. The persisting division of Cyprus continues to have consequences for a number of 
human rights issues on the whole island, including (a) the right to life and the question of 
missing persons; (b) the principle of non-discrimination; (c) freedom of movement; (d) 
property rights; (e) freedom of religion and cultural rights; (f) freedom of opinion and 
expression; and (g) the right to education. In addition, it is important that a gender 
perspective be adopted when negotiating and implementing peace agreements (see 
paragraphs 52 &#8211; 57 below). 
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to life and the question of missing persons 
</b></p>
<p>13. According to article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to life, liberty and security of person. Furthermore, article 1 of the Declaration on 
the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance provides that any act of 
enforced disappearance is an offence to human dignity, placing the persons subjected 
thereto outside the protection of the law and inflicting severe suffering on them and their 
families; any act of enforced disappearance also violates or constitutes a grave threat to the 
right to life.  
</p>
<p>14. As a result of the inter-communal fighting in 1963 and 1964, and of the events of 
July 1974 and afterwards, a total of 1,493 Greek Cypriots and 502 Turkish Cypriots have 
been officially reported as missing by both communities to the Committee on Missing 
Persons in Cyprus. During the period under review, the Committee continued its 
bicommunal project on the exhumation, identification and return of the remains of missing 
persons. As at 22 November 2013, the remains of 1,000 individuals had been exhumed on 
both sides of the buffer zone by the Committee&#8217;s bicommunal teams of archaeologists; the 
remains of 818 missing persons had been analysed in the initial phase at the Committee&#8217;s 
bicommunal anthropological laboratory; and the remains of 456 missing individuals (359 
Greek Cypriots and 97 Turkish Cypriots) had been identified and returned to their 
respective families, including 124 since 1 December 2012. In comparison with previous 
years, this represents a sharp rise in the return of remains, which is largely attributable to 
the doubling of the Committee&#8217;s anthropological laboratory, the successful transition to the 
genetic laboratory of the International Commission of Missing Persons in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina for the extraction of DNA from bone samples, and in-house final 
identifications made by the Committee&#8217;s own recently created genetic unit.  
</p>
<p>15. From 19 to 21 December 2012, a delegation of the Committee on Civil Liberties, 
Justice and Home Affairs of the European Parliament visited Cyprus to gather information 
concerning developments in the work of the Committee on Missing Persons in Cyprus. In 
its mission report, the delegation called for immediate and unrestricted access of the 
Committee to all military areas in the northern part of Cyprus, underlining that the right to 
know the fate of missing relatives is a fundamental right of the families concerned and must 
be guaranteed. Furthermore, the delegation reaffirmed that the humanitarian issue of the 
missing persons in Cyprus is a stand-alone issue and must not be linked to or influenced by 
any other political considerations.16 
</p>
<p>16. The Security Council, in its resolution 2114 (2013), welcomed all efforts to 
accommodate the exhumation requirements of the Committee on Missing Persons in 
Cyprus, and called upon all parties to provide full access to Committee teams. With regard

<p>to access to unfenced military areas in the north, by the end of 2012, a total of 22 access 
requests made by the Committee in the past seven years had been granted by the Turkish 
forces. In 2013, the Committee also requested, for the first time, access to a fenced military 
area in the north, and was granted permission.17 
</p>
<p>17. On 6 March 2013, the Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies of the Council of Europe 
recalled the need to adopt a proactive approach with regard to effective investigations into 
the fate of persons still missing, and called upon Turkey to continue to provide the 
Committee on Missing Persons with all relevant information and access to all relevant 
places. In this respect, it welcomed the permissions granted so far and the assurance of the 
Turkish authorities that they will continue granting the Committee on Missing Persons 
access to other relevant military zones. With regard to identified persons, while underlining 
once again the urgency to effectively investigate the deaths of these persons, the Committee 
of Ministers&#8217; Deputies welcomed the additional concrete investigative steps taken by the 
Turkish authorities, and underlined the crucial importance of investigators having access to 
forensic data and evidence kept by the Committee on Missing Persons, calling upon the 
Turkish authorities to continue to grant them access to relevant Turkish archives and 
reports.18 
</p>
<p>18. In its list of issues prior to the submission of the fourth periodic report of Turkey, 
the Committee against Torture invited Turkey to describe measures taken to comply with 
outstanding judgements of the European Court of Human Rights concerning 
disappearances, including the judgements in <i>Cyprus</i> v. <i>Turkey </i>and <i>Varnava and Others</i> v. 
<i>Turkey</i>.19 With regard to the execution of the <i>Varnava </i>judgement, the Committee of 
Ministers of the Council of Europe, in an interim resolution of 26 September 2013, 
exhorted Turkey to pay, without further delay, the sums awarded by the European Court of 
Human Rights (&#8364;12,000 per application in respect of non-pecuniary damage and &#8364;8,000 per 
application in respect of costs and expenses), as well as the default interest due.20 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>19. According to article 7 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all are equal 
before the law and are entitled without any discrimination to equal protection of the law.21 
Furthermore, all are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of 
the Declaration and against any incitement to such discrimination. 
</p>
<p>20. By the end of 2012, there were up to 210,000 internally displaced persons in the area 
under the control of the Government of the Republic of Cyprus, , including around 90,000 
children born in displacement.22 When compared with previous years, the number of 
internally displaced persons rose slightly, as displaced children were still eligible to register 
as such.

<p>21. In February 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women noted with concern that the legislation of Cyprus continued to discriminate against 
children of women with internally displaced status by preventing them from benefiting 
from the same status awarded to children of internally displaced men, which includes 
access to voting rights, social benefits and housing assistance. The Committee urged 
Cyprus to amend its legislation without delay to ensure that children of women with 
internally displaced status are able to benefit from the same status as children of internally 
displaced men.23 In June 2013, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus reportedly took a 
preliminary decision that children of women with internally displaced status were to be 
given the same status and benefits as children of internally displaced men, namely, by 
allocating the funds available equally among all those with internally displaced status.24 
</p>
<p>22. In its concluding observations of 30 August 2013, the Committee on the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination recommended that Cyprus respect the right to nationality without 
discrimination and ensure that no particular groups of non-citizens are discriminated against 
with regard to access to naturalization. The Committee also requested the State party to 
include in its next periodic report information on how nationality laws and regulations were 
applied to those in the occupied territories.25 It also expressed its concern at the rise in the 
incidence of racially motivated verbal abuse and physical attacks by right-wing extremists 
and neo-Nazi groups against persons of foreign origin, human rights defenders and Turkish 
Cypriots.26 
</p>
<p>23. During the period under review, UNFICYP continued to address day-to-day 
humanitarian and welfare issues faced by Greek Cypriots and Maronites residing in the 
north, and by Turkish Cypriots residing in the south, including through home visits. Despite 
the repeated voicing of concerns at the deteriorating health of elderly Greek Cypriots and 
Maronites in the north, the requests for Greek-speaking doctors to treat these patients and to 
transfer a defibrillator to assist one of them continued to be denied.27  The Turkish Cypriot 
authorities however argue that the regional health centre is fully equipped, including with a 
defibrillator, and also has a Turkish Cypriot doctor who fluently speaks Greek.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Freedom of movement 
</b></p>
<p>24. According to article 13 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each State, as well as 
the right to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his country.28 
</p>
<p>25. In Cyprus, however, crossings between the northern and the southern parts of the 
island are still possible only through (currently seven) official crossing points, a situation 
that obviously limits freedom of movement. The Committee on Crossings, which was 
tasked by the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders in December 2010 to reach an 
agreement on new crossing points, did not meet during the period under review; despite

<p>UNFICYP engagement with both sides, their positions on the location of any new crossing 
points remained irreconcilable. In addition, a request made by a Greek Cypriot woman to 
return to the Karpas region was pending; another request &#8211; for the reunification of a Greek 
Cypriot family, including three children, with their grandparents in Rizokarpaso &#8211; that was 
submitted on 31 August 2012 has to date received no positive response.29 
</p>
<p>26. In its ninth report on the implementation of the &#8220;Green Line&#8221; Regulation (EC) No. 
866/2004, the European Commission noted a visible decrease in the number of both Greek 
Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots crossing the Green Line in 2012, with the number of 
crossings by non-Cypriot European Union citizens and third-country nationals also 
decreasing significantly when compared with previous years. While the vast majority of the 
crossings took place smoothly, in its report, the Commission also referred to a few incidents 
that had been a source of concern for the Turkish Cypriot community.30  
</p>
<p>27. On 30 August 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
expressed its concern that, in spite of the opening of several crossing points since 2003 and 
the resulting increase in contact between the Greek Cypriot and the Turkish Cypriot 
communities, the protracted conflict in Cyprus and the continued division of the island 
maintain tension between the two communities.31 During the consideration of the State 
party&#8217;s seventeenth to twenty-second periodic reports, the Committee&#8217;s Country Rapporteur 
noted that demographics in Cyprus had been largely shaped by population movements since 
the partial occupation of the island by Turkey in 1974 and the State party&#8217;s accession to the 
European Union in 2004.32 
</p>
<p>28. In a press release of 22 October 2013, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion 
or belief hailed a key breakthrough in interfaith communication and an agreement that 
allowed Greek Orthodox and Muslim religious leaders to cross the Green Line. On 16 
October 2013, Bishop Christoforos of Karpasia, who had been prevented during the 
previous 18 months from visiting the northern part of Cyprus and his diocese, was allowed 
to visit and worship at the monastery Apostolos Andreas on the Karpas peninsula in the 
north-east of Cyprus. On 18 October 2013, the Grand Mufti of Cyprus crossed the Green 
Line and held a service at Hala Sultan Tekke Mosque near Larnaca for the first time. This 
was made possible by an agreement reached with the Greek Orthodox Archbishop 
Chrysostomos II, who personally facilitated the Grand Mufti&#8217;s access to the areas 
controlled by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus.33 On 30 November 2013, Bishop 
Christoforos of Karpasia also officiated at a church service with reportedly more than 5,000 
worshipers on the name day of the monastery Apostolos Andreas.

<p><b> D. Property rights 
</b></p>
<p>29. According to article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to own property alone as well as in association with others, and no one is to be 
arbitrarily deprived of his property.

<p>30. With regard to property claims in the southern part of the island, on 12 March 2013, 
the European Court of Human Rights rejected the applications of four Turkish Cypriot 
property owners in the case of <i>Ali Kamil Karamano</i>&#287;<i>lu and Others </i>v.<i> Cyprus </i>on the 
grounds that they had not yet raised the matter of contention in the appropriate forum.34 
Thus the European Court of Human Rights confirmed its approach in the admissibility 
decision in the case of <i>Kazali and Others</i> v. <i>Cyprus</i>, in which it could not exclude that the 
amended Turkish-Cypriot Properties Law 139/1991 provides an accessible and effective 
framework of redress in respect of complaints about interference with the property owned 
by Turkish Cypriots.35  
</p>
<p>31. With regard to property claims in the northern part of the island, as at 30 November 
2013, a total of 5,587 applications had been lodged with the Immovable Property 
Commission, of which 452 were concluded through friendly settlements and 11 through a 
formal hearing.36 The Commission paid a total of &#163;140,940,671 to the applicants as 
compensation. Moreover, the Commission ruled for exchange and compensation in two 
cases, for restitution in one case, and for restitution and compensation in five. In one case, 
the Commission delivered a decision for restitution after the settlement of the Cyprus issue, 
and in another case it ruled for partial restitution. On 25 November 2013, the Turkish 
Cypriot authorities extended the deadline for the submission of applications to the 
Commission for an additional term of two years, ending on 31 December 2015.  
</p>
<p>32. With regard to the complaints made by four Greek Cypriots about the length of the 
proceedings before the Immovable Property Commission, the European Court of Human 
Rights, in its admissibility decision in the case of <i>Eleni Meleagrou and Others</i> v. <i>Turkey</i>, 
noted that a period of some four years and eight months at two levels (including appeals 
against the decisions of the Commission) was deemed &#8220;not unreasonable given the newness 
of the procedure, the nature of the proceedings which incorporated a specific settlement 
procedure, the number of claims raised and the technical nature of property disputes&#8221;.37 
</p>
<p>33. Following a decision by the Higher Regional Court of Munich in Germany of 18 
March 2013, more than 170 religious artefacts, including icons, pieces of church art and 
early historical objects, were returned to the Republic of Cyprus in July 2013. An appeal 
against an earlier decision of the district court of Munich, which had ruled in favour of the 
plaintiffs (namely, the Republic of Cyprus, the Autocephalous Greek-Orthodox Church of 
Cyprus, the Bishopric of the Armenians of Cyprus and the Archbishop of the Maronites of 
Cyprus), was thus partially rejected by the Higher Regional Court of Munich.38 The latter 
also confirmed that the plaintiffs could invoke their ownership rights with regard to these 
objects, which had been located in monasteries, museums and churches in the northern part 
of Cyprus before their removal. The Higher Regional Court of Munich noted that the 
Republic of Cyprus had not exercised control over the northern part of the island since the 
occupation of that territory by Turkish troops in 1974; however, the court stressed that, de 
jure, this part still belonged to the Republic of Cyprus, explicitly referring to Security 
Council resolution 541 (1983).39

<p>34. On 6 June 2013, the Committee of Ministers&#8217; Deputies of the Council of Europe, 
which supervises the execution of judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, 
took note of the assessment of the questions regarding the property rights of enclaved 
persons and their heirs, as presented in an information document by the Secretariat of the 
Council of Europe,40 and decided to resume consideration of the matter at the latest at the 
Committee&#8217;s meeting in June 2014.41 
</p>
<p><b> E. Freedom of religion and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>35. According to article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, which includes freedom to change 
his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public 
or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.42 
Furthermore, according to article 27, everyone has the right freely to participate in the 
cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts as well as to share in scientific 
advancement and its benefits.43 
</p>
<p>36. During the period under review, UNFICYP facilitated 51 religious and 
commemorative events involving more than 12,000 individuals, which were either held in 
or required crossing of the buffer zone. It welcomed the decision made by the Greek 
Cypriot side in April 2013 to allow the transfer of new carpets from the north to the Hala 
Sultan Tekke Mosque in Larnaca, although some restrictions to religious worship in the 
Mosque remained in place. The Greek Cypriot, Maronite and Armenian communities 
continued to conduct religious services in the north according to the practice of previous 
years, but no new sites were opened for worship.44 During the period under review, the 
Turkish Cypriot authorities did not approve several requests to hold religious services, for 
example at the Church of Saint George in Kyrenia, the Church of Ayia Marina in Kythrea, 
the Church of Saint George in Vatyli village, the Church of Panayia Pergaminiotissa in 
Akanthou and the Church of Panagia Chrysopolitissa in Acheritou. 
</p>
<p>37. During the interactive dialogue with the Human Rights Council on 5 March 2013, 
the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief noted that the overall situation had 
clearly improved after the opening of the checkpoints in 2003, with positive implications 
also for the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief throughout the entire island. At the 
same time, he identified existing challenges for Christian minorities in the northern part, for 
Muslim minorities in the southern part and for other religious minorities outside the ambit 
of bicommunalism. He had been encouraged by recent initiatives towards enhancing 
interreligious communication with a view to cultivating relationships of trust and peaceful 
coexistence.  
</p>
<p>38. As a follow-up to his official visit to Cyprus in 2012, the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief took part in the first interreligious round table in the United

<p>Nations buffer zone in Nicosia, organized on 12 September 2013 by the Office of the 
Religious Track of the Cyprus Peace Process, under the auspices of the Embassy of Sweden 
and in cooperation with OHCHR. As all cooperation between the religious leaders had 
stopped when the bicommunal conflict between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots 
escalated 50 years earlier, the Special Rapporteur hailed these positive developments and 
the improved climate of interreligious communication in Cyprus as a breakthrough for 
religious freedom on the whole island.45 It also implements one of the recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur in his report to the Human Rights Council, in which he 
called for the promotion of interreligious communication at both the level of religious 
leaders and the grass-roots level.46 Such cooperation on the whole island indeed creates 
solid ground on which to address the underlying human rights issues, which could also 
have a positive impact on the reconciliation process as a whole. 
</p>
<p>39. The bicommunal Technical Committee on Cultural Heritage made important 
progress in the implementation of emergency measures for the protection of cultural 
heritage sites on both sides of the island. In February 2013, a multi-donor partnership was 
established for the restoration of the Apostolos Andreas monastery under the auspices of 
UNDP, and two contribution agreements worth &#8364;2.5 million each were signed on 17 
September 2013 with the Church of Cyprus and the Evkaf Administration.47 In addition, 
emergency works were carried out on, inter alia, the Mosque in Deneia/Denya despite some 
damage to the restoration works shortly after their commencement in January 2013, and 
further emergency measures were taken to preserve and safeguard the Hamam (Medieval 
Turkish Bath) in Paphos.48 
</p><p>40. In the context of the implementation of the aid programme for the Turkish Cypriot 
community, the European Commission continued its work aimed at protecting cultural 
heritage of the entire island, with a &#8364;2 million contribution agreement signed in April 2013 
with UNDP for emergency stabilization on sites chosen by the bicommunal Technical 
Committee on Cultural Heritage, including the Othello Tower in Famagusta.49  
</p>
<p><b> F. Freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>41. According to article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions 
without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any 
media and regardless of frontiers. 
</p>
<p>42. With regard to the safety of journalists, the United Nations Educational, Scientific 
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) indicated in its written contribution to the universal 
periodic review of Cyprus during the second cycle50 that it had recorded no killings of 
journalists in Cyprus from 2008 to 2012.

<p>43. The Law on the Procedure for the Standardization of Geographical Names of the 
Republic of Cyprus was amended in July 2013, thus criminalizing the use of unrecognized 
names of regions, cities and villages. Pursuant to its article 6(1), any person who publishes, 
imports, circulates, offers, distributes or sells in the Republic of Cyprus maps, books or 
other documents, conventionally or digitally printed, in which geographical names and 
toponyms of areas of the Republic are printed differently from those designated in 
accordance with the procedures provided for in this Law or of those in the Toponyms 
Dictionary commits an offence and, if convicted, is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 
three years or a fine not exceeding &#8364;50,000, or both penalties, and all related documents are 
liable to seizure and destruction. 
</p>
<p>44. Concerning freedom of expression in the northern part of the island, it was reported 
that journalists may be arrested, put on trial and sentenced under the unjust actions section 
of the &#8220;Criminal Code&#8221;, and that many journalists working in the northern part are subject 
to regular press freedom violations, although reportedly there were fewer such incidents in 
2012 than in the previous year.51  
</p>
<p>45. In May 2013, the Cyprus Community Media Centre, which is located in the United 
Nations buffer zone, launched the island&#8217;s first bicommunal Internet broadcasting facility. 
The multimedia studio aims at providing Cypriots with a neutral source of news and 
information on issues concerning peace and reconciliation, and developments in the two 
communities. The studio has already helped to create two multimedia and Internet radio 
websites: &#8220;BufferBuzz&#8221;, funded by UNDP &#8211; Action for Cooperation and Trust in Cyprus, 
and &#8220;MYCYradio&#8221;, funded by the European Commission.52 In September 2013, the 
European Commission launched a &#8364;2.5 million grant scheme for civil society applicants 
from the northern part of Cyprus, aimed at strengthening dialogue and active citizenship, 
and also to promote reconciliation with the Greek Cypriot community. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>46. According to article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has 
the right to education.53 Education should be directed to the full development of the human 
personality and the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms; it 
should promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or 
religious groups, and it should further the activities of the United Nations for the 
maintenance of peace. Furthermore, parents have a prior right to choose the kind of 
education that is given to their children. 
</p>
<p>47. Turkish Cypriot students still face limited access to European Union exchange and 
educational programmes owing to the non-recognition by Cyprus of the universities in the 
northern part of the island. A scholarship scheme for the Turkish Cypriot community was 
set up by the European Commission under European Union Council Regulation (EC) No. 
389/2006 in order to compensate for this lack of mobility. The scheme allows Turkish 
Cypriot students and professionals to spend up to one year abroad at a university or other 
host institution in the European Union. The purpose is both academic attainment and 
bringing Turkish Cypriots closer to the culture and values of the European Union. In the

<p>academic year 2012/13, a total of 28 students and teachers participated in the scheme; in 
2013/14, 181 undergraduate and postgraduate students, researchers and professionals were 
awarded a scholarship. Under the scholarship programme, in the academic year 2013/14, 
Turkish Cypriots were, for the first time ever, offered the option of studying at a university 
in the southern part of the island. OHCHR was informed by the Task Force for the Turkish 
Cypriot Community, Directorate-General for Enlargement of the European Commission, 
that the Commission also launched a grant scheme in November 2012 for Turkish Cypriot 
schools to benefit from modern teaching and management methods and to promote 
collaboration with Greek Cypriot schools. 
</p>
<p>48. In February 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women expressed its concern about the economic, linguistic and cultural challenges that 
girls belonging to ethnic minorities experience and that affect their academic performance 
and, ultimately, their transition to the labour market. The Committee therefore 
recommended that Cyprus intensify its efforts to remove economic, linguistic and cultural 
barriers faced by girls belonging to ethnic minorities, including Turkish Cypriot girls, in 
attaining a standard of performance that would facilitate their successful transition to 
further studies or the labour market.54 Furthermore, according to the reports of the 
Secretary-General submitted in 2013, there were no new developments regarding the 
establishment of a Turkish language school in Limassol.55 
</p>
<p>49. In August 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
requested Cyprus to include in its next periodic report information on intercommunal 
initiatives undertaken by the State party and by civil society organizations to restore mutual 
confidence and improve relations between ethnic and/or religious communities as well as 
raise awareness through the impartial teaching of the history of Cyprus in schools and other 
State institutions.56 
</p>
<p>50. The Government of the Republic of Cyprus protested in October 2013 that the 
appointment of three educators at the high school and the nursery school in Rizokarpaso for 
the school year 2013/14 had been rejected without any reason given. In addition, it 
complained that seven textbooks used in public schools in government-controlled areas had 
been banned in the northern part of the island. The Turkish Cypriot authorities indicated, 
however, that the seven textbooks contained paragraphs that were totally unacceptable, as 
they promoted enmity against Turkish Cypriots.57 
</p>
<p>51. In July 2013, the Association for Historical Dialogue and Research, a non-
governmental organization that includes members from various ethnic, linguistic and 
professional backgrounds working at various educational levels in Cyprus, launched a 
policy paper on &#8220;Rethinking Education in Cyprus&#8221;. In the paper, it proposed a holistic view 
to education, in which the goals of peace education, human rights education, intercultural 
education, critical education and environmental education are integrated, in order to prepare 
school leaders, teachers, parents, children and young people to live in a multicultural, 
multilingual and multi-faith society in Cyprus. It also envisioned democratic education, free 
of any kind of discrimination, that involves students, teachers and parents of all cultural 
groups in Cyprus as active members of society in democratic processes of decision-making 
in schools.58

<p><b> H. Gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>52. In its resolution 1325 (2000), the Security Council called upon all actors involved, 
when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a gender perspective, 
including, inter alia (a) the special needs of women and girls during repatriation and 
resettlement and for rehabilitation, reintegration and post-conflict reconstruction; (b) 
measures that support local women&#8217;s peace initiatives and indigenous processes for conflict 
resolution, and that involve women in all of the implementation mechanisms of the peace 
agreements; and (c) measures that ensure the protection of and respect for human rights of 
women and girls, particularly as they relate to the constitution, the electoral system, the 
police and the judiciary. In addition, in its resolution 2122 (2013), the Council focused 
specifically on increasing women&#8217;s participation and the consideration of gender-related 
issues in all discussions pertinent to the prevention and resolution of armed conflict, the 
maintenance of peace and security, and post-conflict peacebuilding,  
</p>
<p>53. With regard to Cyprus, the Security Council reiterated in its resolutions 2089 (2013) 
and 2114 (2013) that the active participation of civil society groups, including women&#8217;s 
groups, is essential to the political process and can contribute to making any future 
settlement sustainable, recalled that women play an important role in peace processes, and 
welcomed all efforts to promote bicommunal contacts and events, including by all United 
Nations bodies on the island.  
</p>
<p>54. In February 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women, while noting that women were actively involved in the promotion of reconciliation 
and peace through bicommunal activities, also observed with concern the insufficient 
information provided by Cyprus on the participation of women in the peace process, 
including at the decision-making levels, and expressed its concern that the peace process 
currently under way could lack a gender perspective as called for by the Gender Advisory 
Team in its recommendations. The Committee called on Cyprus (a) to strengthen its 
dialogue with non-governmental and women&#8217;s organizations to promote and encourage 
civil society and community-level participation in the peace process; (b) to increase its 
efforts to incorporate a gender perspective into the peace process by ensuring the protection 
of and respect for women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; human rights, and by addressing their specific needs; 
and (c) to involve women fully in all stages of the peace process, including in decision-
making, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000).59  
</p><p>55. In its general recommendation No. 30, adopted on 18 October 2013, the Committee 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women noted that women&#8217;s rights in conflict 
prevention, conflict and post-conflict processes are affected by various actors, including 
States (such as the State within whose borders the conflict arises or neighbouring States 
involved in the regional dimensions of the conflict) and non-State actors. Given that State 
institutions in conflict and post-conflict contexts are often weakened, or that certain 
government functions may be performed by other Governments, intergovernmental 
organizations or even non-State groups, the Committee stressed that, in such cases, there 
could be simultaneous and complementary sets of obligations for a range of the actors 
involved. Thus, under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, State responsibility also arises if a non-State actor&#8217;s acts or omission may 
be attributed to the State under international law. Furthermore, although non-State actors 
cannot become parties to the Convention, the Committee noted that, under certain 
circumstances, in particular where an armed group with an identifiable political structure

<p>exercised significant control over territory and population, non-State actors were obliged to 
respect international human rights.60 
</p>
<p>56. In its general recommendation No. 30, the Committee also noted that the full 
participation and involvement of women in formal peacemaking and post-conflict 
reconstruction and socioeconomic development were often not realized on account of 
deeply entrenched stereotypes, reflected in the traditionally male leadership of State and 
non-State groups, which excluded women from all aspects of decision-making, in addition 
to gender-based violence and other forms of discrimination against women. In this context, 
the Committee recommended that States parties ensure that women, civil society 
organizations focused on women&#8217;s issues and representatives of civil society were included 
equally in all peace negotiations and post-conflict rebuilding and reconstruction efforts.61 
</p>
<p>57. The Gender Advisory Team, a group of academics and civil society activists from 
both sides of the divide working on issues of gender equality from a peace-building 
perspective, launched a report on 6 December 2012 entitled &#8220;Women&#8217;s Peace in Cyprus&#8221;. 
The report comprised an overview of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) and the 
contributions made by the Gender Advisory Team since 2009, including recommendations 
and explanatory notes on the issues of governance and power-sharing, citizenship rights, 
property rights, and economic rights. Of these recommendations, the first three have 
already been presented to the negotiators and the Office of the Special Adviser to the 
Secretary-General on Cyprus. The Gender Advisory Team was encouraged by the efforts 
made by the negotiating teams to explore ways in which the work on mainstreaming gender 
equality could take effect.62

<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>During the period under review, there were some positive developments on the 
question of human rights in Cyprus, including measures taken to protect cultural 
heritage sites on both sides of the island, the launch of the first bicommunal Internet 
broadcasting facility, an improved climate of interreligious communication and steps 
to allow Greek Orthodox and Muslim religious leaders to cross the Green Line that 
divides the island.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The persisting division of the island continues, however, to be an obstacle to the 
full enjoyment in mutual confidence by the whole population of Cyprus of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms. These include the right to life and the question of 
missing persons, the principle of non-discrimination, freedom of movement, property 
rights, freedom of religion and cultural rights, freedom of opinion and expression, and 
the right to education.  
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Interreligious communication and</b> <b>cooperation on the whole island might, it is 
hoped, help to create solid ground on which to address the question of human rights in 
Cyprus, which could also have a positive impact on the reconciliation process as a 
whole. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>It is hoped that the efforts to negotiate and achieve a comprehensive settlement 
of the protracted conflict in Cyprus will ultimately open avenues to improve the 
human rights situation on the island. Addressing the underlying human rights issues 
and causes should be an increasingly important part of peacekeeping efforts, and also

<p><b>underpin the political dialogue aimed at achieving a comprehensive settlement of the 
Cyprus problem. Ensuring adequate women&#8217;s participation and the consideration of 
gender-related issues in these discussions is vital. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>In 2013, various United Nations treaty bodies and special procedures voiced 
their concern at factors and difficulties impeding the implementation of international 
human rights standards on the whole island. On a positive note, however, in 
September 2013, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief took part in 
the first interreligious round table discussion ever held in Cyprus, and subsequently 
hailed a key breakthrough for religious freedom on the island.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Following the first official visit by a special procedures mandate holder to 
Cyprus in 2012, further visits to the whole island with access to all relevant authorities 
are encouraged, in particular by the Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, 
the Independent Expert on minority issues, the Special Rapporteur on the human 
rights of internally displaced persons, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
Disappearances and the Special Rapporteur on the right to education. It is imperative 
that OHCHR and other relevant actors have access to the whole island, relevant 
authorities and affected people. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Human rights do not have any borders and all stakeholders are thus obliged to 
uphold the fundamental freedoms and human rights of all people. It is vital that all 
human rights protection gaps and underlying human rights issues in situations of 
protracted conflicts be addressed.</b> <b>
