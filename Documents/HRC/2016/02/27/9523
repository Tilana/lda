<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the context of his mandate, the Special Rapporteur on the right to food receives a large 
number of communications alleging violations of the right to food and related rights worldwide. 
Such communications are received from national, regional and international non-governmental 
organizations, as well as intergovernmental organizations and other United Nations procedures 
concerned with the protection of human rights. This addendum to the report of the Special 
Rapporteur contains, on a country-by-country basis, summaries of communications, including 
urgent appeals, allegation letters, government replies and follow-up relating to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate for the period 16 December 2005 to 1 December 2006. The Special 
Rapporteur urges all Governments and other actors who have not yet done so to respond 
promptly to his communications and, in appropriate cases, to investigate allegations of the 
violation of the right to food and related rights and to take all steps necessary to redress the 
situation. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur has sought to condense details of communications sent and 
received. To the extent that his resources permit, the Special Rapporteur continues to follow up 
on communications sent and monitors the situation where no reply has been received or where 
questions remain outstanding. 
</p>
<p>3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent a total of 46 communications 
concerning the right to food to 22 Member States as well as 7 communications to other actors 
including international and regional financial institutions (the World Bank and the Asian 
Development Bank), national development agencies (the Agence fran&#231;aise de d&#233;veloppement) 
and transnational corporations (the Coca Cola Company). Where appropriate, the Special 
Rapporteur has sent joint urgent appeals or letters with one or more special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council where the allegations raised relate to the right to food as well as to rights 
addressed under other mandates. Approximately half of the communications reflected in this 
report deal with cases related to allegations of violations of the obligation to respect the right to 
food on the part of State agents, such as, for example, forced land evictions that affected peoples&#8217; 
access to food. The remaining half of the communications related to allegations that relevant 
authorities failed to protect or fulfil the right to food. 
</p>
<p>4. Out of the 46 communications sent, 16 replies from 12 Governments were received along 
with 1 reply from the Coca Cola Company. The Special Rapporteur welcomes these replies as he 
considers them a useful way to engage in constructive dialogues in relation to specific cases, 
issues or situations. The Special Rapporteur regrets, however, that almost half of the 
Governments he corresponded with have failed to respond at all. The Special Rapporteur 
considers these communications as still outstanding, and encourages Governments to respond to 
them and to address all concerns raised in each of them. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur has included a heading called &#8220;Follow-up&#8221; in which he provides 
further substantive comments to the Governments&#8217; replies. 
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur includes below some graphics to help in visualizing pattern and 
trends: </p>

<p>7. On 8 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government regarding allegations of 
violations and threats to the right to food of many asylum-seekers awaiting a decision on their 
applications for Protection Visas. According to the information received asylum-seekers are 
granted a Bridging Visa E (BVE) whilst they await the outcome of their Protection Visa 
application, a visa that requires the determination of the refugee status of the applicant under 
section 36 of the Migration Act 1958. BVEs do not provide for the asylum-seekers&#8217; right to work 
and access to sufficient financial means which would enable them to have access to 
quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food. The information brought to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s attention indicated that asylum-seekers often do not have access to 
adequate food nor to means of purchasing it and that they and particularly children suffered from </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>malnutrition and hunger-related illnesses for which they cannot seek medical assistance. For 
example, an asylum-seeker from Myanmar, in Australia on a BVE, was living in poor conditions 
with her 3-year-old daughter who had scabies as a result of the mother&#8217;s lack of income and 
financial resources to buy food and washing powder. A 6-year-old girl, whose mother is an 
asylum-seeker from Russia on a BVE, reportedly suffered chest and ear infections, was lethargic 
and underweight and her iron levels were borderline because her mother allegedly could not 
afford to buy sufficient food, including meat and fresh vegetables. A 10-year-old girl living with 
her parents and sister, all asylum-seekers from Sri Lanka on a BVE, reportedly suffered from 
stomach problems and had no appetite. She was reportedly underweight and had intestinal 
worms. Her family had no financial resources for worm treatment and could not purchase 
sufficient food and food of good quality, so the girl had to eat rice on most days. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Government replied on 29 May 2006 explaining the Bridging Visas (BV) system and 
that holders of BV who are also Protection Visa applicants are eligible to work if they have been 
in the country for less than 45 days in the 12 months before lodging their application. The 
Government added that financial and other supporting assistance is available under the Asylum 
Seeker Assistance Scheme which is administered by the Australian Red Cross. Direct funds 
payment is available to eligible Protection Visa applicants living in the community who are 
otherwise unable to meet their basic needs for food, accommodation and health care. This 
scheme supplements financial assistance with referral and counselling programmes and a range 
of humanitarian services. In 2004-2005, some 1,276 clients were assisted under this scheme at a 
cost of AUD 3.4 million. In addition, special payments can be authorized for persons otherwise 
not eligible for payments under this scheme. Special payments have been authorized, for 
example, for compelling cases being considered for ministerial intervention. The Government 
also stated that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs had begun a community 
care pilot project as part of a case management framework for people with complex immigration, 
health and welfare issues. The pilot aims to ensure that appropriate support is available to those 
people who are in particularly vulnerable circumstances, which may include some BV holders. 
The Department has also undertaken a review of Bridging Visa arrangements which was 
expected to be finalized in mid-2006. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur acknowledged the comprehensive reply prepared by the 
Government. However, whilst noting the financial and other supporting assistance available 
under the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme (ASAS) administered by the Australian Red Cross, 
on 17 July 2006 he wrote back to the Government concerning the significant gaps which remain 
in assisting people on Bridging Visas (BV). It appears that, on the one hand, those eligible under 
ASAS include mostly people who have a valid Protection Visa application to be finalized by the 
Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (DIMA). On the other hand, &#8220;some 
BVE holders may be Protection Visa applicants; however, the overwhelming majority of people 
holding BVEs are people who are in Australia without a visa and are making arrangements to 
depart Australia; are having a further visa application considered (including at judicial review); 
are seeking ministerial intervention after a decision to refuse a visa; are non-citizens in criminal 
detention or are seeking a review of a decision to cancel a visa or revoke Australian citizenship </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1

</p>
<p>other than on character grounds. These people have either never applied for protection or have 
been found conclusively not to be owed protection&#8221;. Whilst welcoming the intended goal of the 
&#8220;Community Care Pilot&#8221; currently being carried out in Melbourne and Sydney to assist people 
who have not applied for Protection Visas and are in need, the Special Rapporteur remains 
concerned that this project may be developing at a slow pace taking into consideration its 
one-year time frame. The Special Rapporteur further congratulated the Government on the 
initiative it has taken to undertake a review of Bridging Visa arrangements with a view to 
achieving a regime that is simpler and provides greater consistency and flexibility. The Special 
Rapporteur awaits the outcome of such review. 
</p>
<p><b>Austria 
</b></p>
<p><b>Communication sent 
</b></p>
<p>10. On 16 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government regarding allegations 
that the enterprise Andritz has submitted an application to the Austrian Control Bank for 
an export credit guarantee of around &#8364;200 million for the Ilisu Dam on the River Tigris in 
south-eastern Turkey. An international consortium led by this enterprise is in charge of carrying 
out the construction work for the dam. The information received claimed that in November 2005 
the consortium submitted a revised environmental impact assessment and a new resettlement 
plan. Nevertheless, it appears that the dam could displace between 50,000 and 80,000 people, 
mostly Kurds, affecting the human rights, including the right to food, of these populations and 
the environment. According to this information, the region has a large number of internally 
displaced persons (IDPs) and has been affected by widespread marginalization. Many families 
are already reported to lack access to food, clean and accessible water, sanitation and housing. 
The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the alleged facts could lead to a violation of the 
obligation to cooperate in respecting the right to food and water of the people who could be 
displaced by the dam construction if the authorities examining the export credit guarantee 
application do not cooperate with the Turkish authorities in providing appropriate safeguards to 
ensure that the displacement of these people without adequate resettlement and compensation 
plans does not interfere with their livelihoods and access to sufficient and adequate food.

<p>11. On 7 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people wrote to the 
Government concerning allegations of the violation of the right to food of the Tupinikim and 
Guarani indigenous communities in Aracruz County, State of Espirito Santo. The allegations 
received claim that Aracruz Cellulose Corporation, founded in the 1960s, has been illegally 
occupying indigenous land which it has been exploiting in order to establish eucalyptus 
plantations for the large-scale production of cellulose. It is alleged that the expansion of 
eucalyptus monoculture has destroyed the usual access to livelihoods, based on small-scale 
agriculture as well as hunting and fishing, of the above-mentioned indigenous communities and 
other communities, such as the descendants of African slaves and smallholders, in the area. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>According to the Brazilian Constitution, indigenous land should be allotted to the indigenous 
communities that have traditionally inhabited such land. To this end, 18,070 hectares of land in 
the area had reportedly been identified by the Government&#8217;s indigenous institute (FUNAI) as 
belonging to the indigenous communities. However, in 1998, the then Minister of Justice 
allocated only 7,061 hectares to the indigenous communities. As a result, in 2005, the 
Tupinikim and Guaranis indigenous communities self-demarcated the rest of the land and 
are still waiting for the regularization of this demarcation. The reports received also allege 
that on 20 January 2006, 120 troopers of the federal police, including a detachment of COT 
(Brazilian Command for Tactical Operations), entered the indigenous villages of 
Corrego D&#8217;Ouro and Olho D&#8217;Agua located on the land which the indigenous communities had 
demarcated as belonging to them (according to the Constitution and the assessment of FUNAI), 
with the purpose of forcibly evicting the indigenous communities. Some people were threatened, 
some were wounded, and tractors belonging to the Aracruz Cellulose Corporation destroyed 
houses. The Special Rapporteur believes that these facts appear to constitute a violation of the 
Government&#8217;s obligation to respect the right to food as actions have been taken to forcibly evict 
the indigenous communities (Tupinikim) from their villages and the land which they demarcated 
as belonging to them and to deprive them of their usual access to food and subsistence activities. 
In addition, these actions would appear to violate the obligation to protect the right to food as the 
authorities have failed to take all necessary measures to regulate the activities of third parties to 
prevent them from interfering with the right to food and water of the indigenous communities 
concerned. Federal police agents appear to have been complicit with the private corporation in 
this case. 
</p>
<p>12. On 14 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning 
allegations of threats against the livelihoods of 90 peasant families of the Lagoa Nova 
community in the State of Sergipe whose land ownership has been disputed since 1994. 
According to the allegations, these families have been living on this land for many generations. 
This land belonged to a large estate, SANAGRO (Santana Agroindustrial Ltda.). In 1994 an area 
of 2,812 ha was expropriated by the Brazilian State in order to transfer it to the families in 
accordance with the agrarian reform programme. However, SANAGRO continued to use 573 ha 
of the land for cultivating sugar cane and even after the decision on the expropriation was issued, 
it built an irrigation system which has reportedly contaminated a lake in this area. SANAGRO 
delayed the transfer of the land until the year 2000. When the transfer of the land took place, 
SANAGRO allegedly appealed in court against the measure and Judge Francisco Falc&#227;o of the 
Superior Court of Justice ruled in favour of the company. In the meantime, gunmen contracted 
by SANAGRO threatened the families of Lagoa Nova. The reports received claim that in 2005, 
the First Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice ruled twice against SANAGRO, confirming 
the decision on the expropriation. In November 2005, in contrast to the previous two rulings, 
Judge Falc&#227;o reportedly issued a temporary injunction in favour of SANAGRO. It appears that 
injunctions can be issued by judges without approval by the First Chamber of the Court. As a 
result of the impasse in the judicial proceedings, the families of Lagoa Nova stopped the pumps 
of SANAGRO&#8217;s irrigation system. This reportedly led to an agreement whereby SANAGRO 
could continue using water from the lake for irrigation purposes and in accordance with 
environmental protection standards, but would withdraw from the disputed land, abandon its 
sugar cane cultivation in the area and end all judicial proceedings. It appears, however, that 
SANAGRO has not yet fulfilled the terms of this agreement and has tried again to cultivate the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1

</p>
<p>land. This has been opposed by the peasant families, which have been taken to court by 
SANAGRO. It is alleged that Mario Jambo, the judge of the competent local court, has been 
under pressure to rule in favour of SANAGRO. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that in this 
case the authorities, including the judiciary, have failed to take the necessary measures to prevent 
third parties from interfering with the access to land, livelihood and food of the peasant families 
of Lagoa Nova.

mapuches condenados a m&#225;s de diez a&#241;os de prisi&#243;n bajo la acusaci&#243;n de &quot;incendio terrorista&quot;. 
Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, en agosto de 2004 Patricia Troncoso, Patricio Marileo Saravia, 
Jaime Marileo Saravia y Juan Carlos Huenulao Lienmil habr&#237;an sido condenados a penas de 
diez a&#241;os y un d&#237;a de prisi&#243;n despu&#233;s de haber sido acusados del delito de &quot;incendio terrorista&quot;, 
bajo la Ley antiterrorista N&#186; 18314, por un incendio causado en el predio conocido como 
Poluco Podenco. De acuerdo con la informaci&#243;n recibida, el juicio habr&#237;a presentado 
irregularidades y las declaraciones de los testigos habr&#237;an presentado contradicciones. 
Actualmente, Patricia Troncoso, Patricio Marileo Saravia, Jaime Marileo Saravia y Juan Carlos 
Huenulao Lienmil se encontrar&#237;an en la ciudad del Angol y desde el 13 de marzo de 2006 
mantendr&#237;an una huelga de hambre en protesta por las fuertes condenas recibidas y por la 
aplicaci&#243;n de la ley antiterrorista (que se utiliza con frecuencia en relaci&#243;n con las reclamaciones 
agrarias y las reclamaciones para pedir un nivel de vida adecuado de los mapuches), se habr&#237;a 
deteriorado gravemente su estado de salud tras m&#225;s de 55 d&#237;as de huelga de hambre. Se observa 
con mucha preocupaci&#243;n que los jueces habr&#237;an aplicado la ley de manera discriminatoria; 
mientras que por los delitos contra la propiedad se aplican generalmente multas o penas de 
prisi&#243;n muy cortas, en el caso de los mapuches los jueces calificar&#237;an estos mismos delitos como 
actos de terrorismo y aplicar&#237;an penas de prisi&#243;n muy severas, de por lo menos diez a&#241;os.

<p>14. El 23 de mayo de 2006 el Gobierno inform&#243; a la Alta Comisionada de las Naciones Unidas 
para los Derechos Humanos de que los afectados depusieron temporalmente la huelga de 
hambre, en cuanto los senadores Alejandro Navarro y Jaime Naranjo presentaron un proyecto de 
ley con el objeto de modificar el Decreto-ley N&#186; 321 sobre libertad condicional. El Gobierno 
hab&#237;a asignado &quot;suma urgencia&quot; a la tramitaci&#243;n de este proyecto de ley. El Gobierno tambi&#233;n 
indic&#243; que m&#225;s all&#225; del caso especifico de estas personas, esta situaci&#243;n no responde a una 
persecuci&#243;n pol&#237;tica hacia el movimiento ind&#237;gena mapuche. El Gobierno ha reconocido como 
legitima la demanda de los pueblos ind&#237;genas, en especial del mapuche, y estas demandas han 
sido encauzadas por mecanismos y canales institucionales. El Gobierno pidi&#243; a la Alta 
Comisionada que transmitiera esta informaci&#243;n a los Relatores Especiales que mandaron 
comunicaciones sobre este caso. </p>

<p>15. El 10 de febrero de 2006 el Relator Especial, junto con el Relator Especial sobre la 
situaci&#243;n de los derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas, se&#241;al&#243; al 
Gobierno la informaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con las fumigaciones llevadas a cabo en la zona fronteriza 
entre el Ecuador y Colombia en el contexto del Plan Colombia. Seg&#250;n las informaciones 
recibidas, a pesar de las informaciones sobre la suspensi&#243;n de estas fumigaciones, son 
preocupantes los efectos de las mismas en ambos pa&#237;ses. Como consecuencia de las 
fumigaciones efectuadas en el contexto del Plan Colombia se habr&#237;a producido, entre otras, la 
destrucci&#243;n de los cultivos de subsistencia, el empobrecimiento de la calidad del suelo y la 
reducci&#243;n de la capacidad de producci&#243;n de las poblaciones fronterizas mayoritariamente 
habitadas por poblaciones ind&#237;genas y campesinas. Estas poblaciones, en su mayor&#237;a de origen 
ind&#237;gena y campesino, habr&#237;an observado un gran deterioro en su ya de por s&#237; dif&#237;cil situaci&#243;n 
socioecon&#243;mica. Adem&#225;s, los informes afirman que los efectos de las fumigaciones han afectado 
gravemente a los incentivos privados de producci&#243;n y comercializaci&#243;n de alimentos como la 
f&#225;brica de harina de pl&#225;tano de Santa Marianita o el proyecto agroindustrial en Puerto Mestaza 
en el Ecuador. En varias comunidades se han dado p&#233;rdidas de ganado y se denuncia un 
incremento en las malformaciones y abortos del ganado cerca de la frontera durante las 
fumigaciones y despu&#233;s de ellas. Todo esto parece que haya ocasionado un fuerte estado de 
inseguridad alimentar&#237;a en las poblaciones fronterizas y, en consecuencia, ha desencadenado una 
ola de migraci&#243;n al interior del pa&#237;s. Seg&#250;n los informes, la desnutrici&#243;n, siendo una constante en 
comunidades empobrecidas, estar&#237;a alcanzando niveles preocupantes. En otras comunidades se 
observ&#243; como desaparec&#237;an los cultivos de ciclo corto en menos de 15 d&#237;as tras las fumigaciones. 
Se informa tambi&#233;n de que cuatro a&#241;os despu&#233;s del comienzo de las fumigaciones algunos 
cultivos de pl&#225;tanos, guineos, oritos, yuca, ma&#237;z, frutales y determinadas hierbas arom&#225;ticas 
habr&#237;an desaparecido o habr&#237;an sufrido un impacto negativo importante, al reducirse su calidad y 
cantidad en comparaci&#243;n con los periodos previos a las fumigaciones. Se alega que las 
fumigaciones han tenido adem&#225;s un efecto negativo en la salud de las poblaciones fronterizas al 
contaminar sus fuentes de agua y la vida acu&#225;tica. En muchos r&#237;os, entre ellos el r&#237;o Mira, que 
fluye dentro del territorio del Ecuador, se habr&#237;a observado un gran porcentaje de restos del 
producto qu&#237;mico utilizado en estas fumigaciones. El Relator Especial cree que los hechos 
alegados parecen indicar una violaci&#243;n del derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las poblaciones 
fronterizas entre el Ecuador y Colombia. Las fumigaciones parecen producir la destrucci&#243;n de 
los cultivos de subsistencia, el empobrecimiento de la calidad del suelo, y la reducci&#243;n de la 
capacidad productiva de las cosechas, lo cual no s&#243;lo repercute en las actividades econ&#243;micas de 
las comunidades sino tambi&#233;n en el acceso de la poblaci&#243;n a una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada. 
Adem&#225;s, los grupos m&#225;s vulnerables, y en particular, los derechos fundamentales de las 
poblaciones ind&#237;genas awas, han sido particularmente afectados por los efectos del 
desplazamiento que, sucesivamente, ha tenido consecuencias negativas sobre los medios de vida 
de estos grupos de la poblaci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s la contaminaci&#243;n del agua de los r&#237;os amenaza el 
derecho a la salud de las comunidades. </p>

las fumigaciones indicando que la erradicaci&#243;n de los cultivos il&#237;citos mediante la aspersi&#243;n 
a&#233;rea con glifosato no produce inseguridad alimentaria, no produce efectos nocivos sobre los 
cultivos, los animales ni agua, y tampoco produce riesgos para la salud de los pobladores de las 
zonas aleda&#241;as. El Gobierno en su respuesta habla de manera muy completa del funcionamiento 
del Programa de Erradicaci&#243;n de los Cultivos Il&#237;citos mediante aspersi&#243;n a&#233;rea con herbicida 
Glifosato (PECIG) incluso el manejo de las operaciones de aspersi&#243;n, la detecci&#243;n y la aspersi&#243;n. 
La carta del Gobierno tambi&#233;n explica muy en detalle las medidas especiales tomadas en 
relaci&#243;n con la erradicaci&#243;n des los cultivos il&#237;citos mediante la aspersi&#243;n a&#233;rea con glifosato, 
como las medidas legislativas, ejecutivas y reglamentarias.

<p>17. Los Relatores Especiales agradecen mucho los detalles que el Gobierno proporcion&#243;. 
Los Relatores Especiales reaccionaron el 20 de junio de 2006 diciendo que hasta el momento no 
hay claridad de cu&#225;l es la formulaci&#243;n con la que se producen las aspersiones a&#233;reas. Existen 
denuncias de que se han utilizado diferentes tipos de qu&#237;micos como el Fusarium Oxisporum, el 
Imazapir y el 2-4-D y el Paraquat. Adem&#225;s parece que no se sepa en qu&#233; proporci&#243;n el glifosato 
es usado y cu&#225;l es la composici&#243;n real del producto finalmente utilizado. Respecto al proceso de 
aspersi&#243;n, se alega que las aspersiones a&#233;reas se realizan a una altura tal (de 15 a 60 m) que se 
hacen incontrolables, y afectan a casas, escuelas, cultivos l&#237;citos, animales, selvas, fuentes de 
agua y r&#237;os. Esta imprecisi&#243;n ha permitido la contaminaci&#243;n de la frontera del Ecuador, 
afectando, como se alega, a las personas que viven en ella. En lo que respecta al derecho a la 
alimentaci&#243;n, la preocupaci&#243;n de los Relatores Especiales no se limita s&#243;lo al riesgo sobre la 
seguridad alimentar&#237;a sino tambi&#233;n al derecho a que los alimentos no contengan sustancias 
nocivas. Un informe de la polic&#237;a del Valle de Guamuez reconoce que tras las fumigaciones 
de enero y febrero de 2001 sobre 29.000 ha de coca, se produjeron afectaciones de m&#225;s 
de 4.430 ha de cultivos de alimentos, denuncias de m&#225;s de 1.791 personas afectadas y m&#225;s 
de 96.222 animales muertos o muy enfermos. Una denuncia presentada ante la Defensor&#237;a del 
Pueblo de Ecuador, en diciembre de 2001, recoge que tras las fumigaciones de principios de a&#241;o, 
fueron afectadas 2.560 ha de cultivos legales y m&#225;s de 11.828 animales resultaron enfermos o 
muertos por las fumigaciones. Se alega que la situaci&#243;n de hambruna que gener&#243; esta situaci&#243;n 
ha provocado que en el a&#241;o 2005 haya comunidades con niveles de migraci&#243;n del 50 al 80% del 
total de la poblaci&#243;n. Incluso la Cruz Roja Ecuatoriana reconoce que la segunda causa de 
desplazamiento de la poblaci&#243;n colombiana al Ecuador, en un 54%, se debe a las fumigaciones 
que afectan a sus productos. Las nacionalidades y pueblos ind&#237;genas han sido particularmente 
vulnerables, pues las fumigaciones afectan las bases de su cultura agr&#237;cola. La destrucci&#243;n de la 
yuca, por ejemplo, les ha impedido la elaboraci&#243;n de la chicha, alimento fundamental de su dieta. 
A pesar de la declarada suspensi&#243;n de estas fumigaciones, los Relatores Especiales tambi&#233;n 
se&#241;alaron informaciones sobre informaciones que el 20 de mayo de 2006 las comunidades de 
El Charco, Mataco y San Miguel del Ri&#243; fueran afectadas por fumigaciones desde 4 avionetas 
y 5 helic&#243;pteros que duraron aproximadamente una hora. Parece que estas fumigaciones 
afectaron tambi&#233;n importantes cultivos de pancoger como papachina, chivo, banano, yuca y 
pl&#225;tano. </p>

<p>18. El 21 de marzo 2006 el Relator Especial con el Relator Especial sobre la situaci&#243;n de los 
derechos humanos y las libertades fundamentales de los ind&#237;genas escribieron al Gobierno sobre 
la informaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n de varias comunidades ind&#237;genas asentadas en la 
cuenca del r&#237;o Atrato que se est&#225;n viendo afectadas por la lucha entre las Fuerzas Armadas 
colombianas y los grupos insurgentes y paramilitares. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, estas 
comunidades est&#225;n sufriendo un bloqueo econ&#243;mico por parte de la fuerza p&#250;blica colombiana 
con el fin de evitar que los alimentos comprados por los ind&#237;genas puedan ser utilizados por la 
guerrilla. Para ayudar a estas familias, se informa de que el ej&#233;rcito ha llevado a cabo algunas 
acciones encaminadas a abastecer de alimentos a algunas comunidades urbanas de la regi&#243;n, 
alimentos que, sin embargo, no llegan a las comunidades rurales m&#225;s alejadas. La escasez de 
alimentos estar&#237;a provocando el aumento de los precios de los productos de primera necesidad y 
hambrunas en ciertas localidades. Asimismo, se informa de que a esta precariedad se a&#241;ade el 
minado de campos de cultivo por parte de la guerrilla, lo que amenaza las vidas de los ind&#237;genas 
y les impide cultivar la tierra, obtener alimentos de su medio ambiente y moverse libremente por 
su territorio. A esta situaci&#243;n general de dificultad, se a&#241;aden las informaciones de que 
supuestamente el 12 de marzo se produjo un tiroteo en la comunidad ind&#237;gena de Conondo entre 
militares del Ej&#233;rcito Nacional y guerrilleros de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de 
Colombia (FARC) con el resultado de la muerte de un ni&#241;o (Wallington Arce Vitucay) y heridas 
a otros seis ind&#237;genas. El Relator Especial cree que los hechos alegados parecen indicar una 
violaci&#243;n de la obligaci&#243;n de respectar el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las comunidades 
ind&#237;genas como los bloqueos econ&#243;micos por parte de la fuerza p&#250;blica tienen el efecto de 
impedir el acceso de las comunidades a una alimentaci&#243;n adecuada. Tambi&#233;n el Relator Especial 
cree que los hechos alegados parecen indicar una violaci&#243;n de la obligaci&#243;n de proteger el 
derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de estas comunidades en cuanto las autoridades no han tomado todas 
las medidas necesarias para que la guerrilla no ponga minas en los campos utilizados para la 
cultivaci&#243;n.

<p>21. On 17 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea wrote to the 
Government concerning reports of recent governmental decisions to restrict emergency food 
assistance by international organizations, ban the private sale of grain and fully reinstate the 
Public Distribution System (PDS), which could lead to violations of the right to food particularly 
for the poor and destitute communities. The allegations received claim that in October 2005, the 
Government returned to banning the private buying and selling of grain, the main source of 
nutrition for most of the population. In addition, it was also reportedly announced that the PDS, 
which provided coupons for food and consumer goods to the population through their places of 
work or study, was to be fully reinstated. During the food crisis of the 1990s, a large number of 
people who depended on their PDS rations died from starvation and many suffered severe 
malnutrition and hunger as the system broke down. The Special Rapporteur believes that these 
facts indicate a possible violation of the obligation to respect the right to food as relevant 
authorities have not refrained from reverting to food policies which may impinge on people&#8217;s 
access to adequate and sufficient food, including banning the private sale of grain, reinstating the 
PDS and restricting international food assistance operations. In addition, the alleged facts would 
appear to indicate a violation of the obligation to fulfil the right to food as relevant authorities 
have failed to provide adequate access to food to the people who are unable to do so themselves.

<p>22. On 7 July 2006 the Government replied, rejecting the communication on the basis that it 
was another attempt to spread fabricated information to defame, disintegrate and overthrow the

Government, this communication has no relevance to genuine human rights.

atenci&#243;n del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n que hab&#237;an recibido en relaci&#243;n con las fumigaciones 
llevadas a cabo en la zona fronteriza del Ecuador con Colombia en el contexto del Plan 
Colombia. A pesar de las informaciones sobre la suspensi&#243;n de las fumigaciones en la zona, eran 
muy preocupantes las alegaciones sobre los efectos de las mismas. Seg&#250;n las informaciones </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>llevadas a su atenci&#243;n, como consecuencia de las fumigaciones efectuadas en el contexto del 
Plan Colombia, se habr&#237;a producido, entre otras, la destrucci&#243;n de los cultivos de subsistencia, el 
empobrecimiento de la calidad del suelo y la reducci&#243;n de la capacidad de producci&#243;n de las 
poblaciones fronterizas. Estas poblaciones, en su mayor&#237;a de origen ind&#237;gena y campesino, 
habr&#237;an observado un gran deterioro en su ya de por s&#237; dif&#237;cil situaci&#243;n socioecon&#243;mica. Adem&#225;s, 
los informes afirmaban que los efectos de las fumigaciones hab&#237;an afectado gravemente a las 
iniciativas privadas de producci&#243;n y comercializaci&#243;n de alimentos como la f&#225;brica de harina de 
pl&#225;tano de Santa Marianita o el proyecto agroindustrial en Puerto Mestaza. En varias 
comunidades se hab&#237;an dado p&#233;rdidas de ganado y se denunciaba un incremento en las 
malformaciones y abortos del ganado cerca de la frontera durante las fumigaciones y despu&#233;s de 
ellas. Todo esto parec&#237;a que hubiera ocasionado un fuerte estado de inseguridad alimentar&#237;a en 
las poblaciones fronterizas y, en consecuencia, hab&#237;a desencadenado una ola de migraci&#243;n al 
interior del pa&#237;s. Seg&#250;n los informes, la desnutrici&#243;n, que es una constante en comunidades 
empobrecidas, estar&#237;a alcanzando niveles preocupantes. En algunas de las comunidades de 
Sucumbios, como por ejemplo en Uni&#243;n Lojana, Chone II, Santa Marianita y Monterrey, se 
observ&#243; c&#243;mo desparec&#237;an los cultivos de ciclo corto en menos de 15 d&#237;as tras las fumigaciones. 
Varios estudios parecer&#237;an demostrar que la concentraci&#243;n de f&#243;sforo en las plantas a 3 km de la 
frontera es muy superior a la concentraci&#243;n en el suelo. Se informaba que cuatro a&#241;os despu&#233;s 
del comienzo de las fumigaciones algunos cultivos de pl&#225;tanos, guineos, oritos, yuca, ma&#237;z, 
frutales y determinadas hierbas arom&#225;ticas habr&#237;an desaparecido o habr&#237;an sufrido un impacto 
negativo importante reduci&#233;ndose su calidad y cantidad en comparaci&#243;n con los per&#237;odos previos 
a las fumigaciones. Se alegaba que las fumigaciones hab&#237;an tenido adem&#225;s un efecto negativo en 
la salud de las poblaciones fronterizas al contaminar sus fuentes de agua y la vida acu&#225;tica. 
En muchos r&#237;os, entre ellos el r&#237;o Mira, que fluye dentro del territorio del Ecuador, se habr&#237;a 
observado un gran porcentaje de restos del producto qu&#237;mico utilizado en las fumigaciones que 
se llevan a cabo en territorio de Colombia. La situaci&#243;n de las comunidades que se asientan en el 
r&#237;o Mira, en la provincia de Esmeraldas, parec&#237;a ser preocupante debido al hecho de que el r&#237;o es 
utilizado para el uso personal y dom&#233;stico de estas comunidades. En particular el Relator 
Especial llam&#243; la atenci&#243;n sobre la situaci&#243;n de vulnerabilidad de ciertas comunidades ind&#237;genas 
que viven en la zona como las comunidades awas que adem&#225;s de los impactos de las 
fumigaciones denunciaban ser objeto de un n&#250;mero de abusos contra sus derechos y libertades 
fundamentales. La reforma agraria presuntamente despoj&#243; de importantes territorios a los 
ind&#237;genas para el desarrollo de actividades petrol&#237;feras y extractivas en sus territorios. Como 
consecuencia sus derechos a la alimentaci&#243;n y a la salud se habr&#237;an visto afectados. Se hab&#237;a 
denunciado que tras las fumigaciones se produjo el desplazamiento de toda la comunidad de 
Sumac Pamba que no volvi&#243; a su lugar de origen. Se denunciaba tambi&#233;n que las empresas 
palmicultoras han causado grave contaminaci&#243;n del agua potable por el uso de 18 tipos de 
qu&#237;micos. En consecuencia, parec&#237;a que la biofauna, que serv&#237;a para el consumo diario, 
dom&#233;stico y de recreo, ha muerto. Diversas actividades se hab&#237;an visto afectadas por la 
imposibilidad de utilizar el agua contaminada que, adem&#225;s de presentar coloraci&#243;n y grasas que 
son detectables a simple vista, ten&#237;a olores que afectaban a la poblaci&#243;n. El Relator cree que 
estos hechos alegados parecen indicar una violaci&#243;n del derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las 
poblaciones fronterizas del Ecuador con Colombia. Las fumigaciones parecen producir la 
destrucci&#243;n de los cultivos de subsistencia, el empobrecimiento de la calidad del suelo, y la 
reducci&#243;n de la capacidad productiva de las cosechas lo cual no s&#243;lo repercute en las actividades 
econ&#243;micas de las comunidades sino tambi&#233;n en el acceso de la poblaci&#243;n a una alimentaci&#243;n </p>

<p>adecuada. Adem&#225;s, los grupos m&#225;s vulnerables, y en particular, los derechos fundamentales de 
las poblaciones ind&#237;genas awas, han sido particularmente afectados por los efectos del 
desplazamiento que, sucesivamente, ha tenido consecuencias negativas sobre los medios de vida 
de estos grupos de la poblaci&#243;n. A todo esto se debe agregar la falta de acceso a servicios 
p&#250;blicos y la constante militarizaci&#243;n de la zona fronteriza que acent&#250;an directa o indirectamente 
las violaciones del derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n. Adem&#225;s la contaminaci&#243;n del agua de los r&#237;os

<p>25. El 21 de julio de 2006 el Relator Especial junto con el Relator Especial sobre la vivienda 
adecuada se&#241;alaron a la atenci&#243;n del Gobierno la informaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con la situaci&#243;n de 
cerca de 120 familias campesinas, que fueron v&#237;ctimas de un desalojo en hechos ocurridos en 
La Yuca, en el cant&#243;n de Palenque. De acuerdo con esta informaci&#243;n, exist&#237;a seria preocupaci&#243;n 
por la situaci&#243;n general, en particular por la seguridad y la integridad f&#237;sica y psicol&#243;gica de estas 
familias que fueron desalojadas de manera violenta el 18 de junio de 2006, tras de una masiva 
operaci&#243;n policial en el Cant&#243;n de Palenque. Ese d&#237;a, la polic&#237;a oblig&#243; a hombres, mujeres y 
ni&#241;os a abandonar sus viviendas y a que se suspendieran abruptamente las clases en la escuela 
del recinto La Yuca, en Palenque y en Los R&#237;os, en donde la polic&#237;a tambi&#233;n oblig&#243; a decenas de 
ni&#241;os a desalojar las aulas. Adem&#225;s, seg&#250;n las denuncias, al menos 12 viviendas incluyendo la 
escuela habr&#237;an sido destruidas. Se afirma que la orden del desalojo fue dada por el intendente 
de polic&#237;a, Mario del Rosario Moreno, luego de que, seg&#250;n el Gobernador de Los R&#237;os, 
N&#233;stor Orlando Coello, la orden fuera emitida por el Director del Instituto Nacional de 
Desarrollo Agrario (INDA), Carlos Aguirre. Se alega tambi&#233;n que durante el desalojo la polic&#237;a 
utiliz&#243; excavadoras para destruir las viviendas, as&#237; como tanquetas antidisturbios y bombas 
lacrim&#243;genas para impedir cualquier concentraci&#243;n de los moradores. Adem&#225;s, no se permiti&#243; la 
entrada de personas, defensores o abogados que pudieran ser testigos de estas actuaciones 
policiales. Adem&#225;s, se afirma que las tierras en disputa involucran a decenas de familias 
asentadas en La Yuca, Artiller&#237;a, Los Mosquitos, La Victoria, Aguacatal y otros recintos. 
Actualmente unas 120 familias residen en la Yuca y poseen el t&#237;tulo de propiedad de las tierras 
otorgado por el antiguo Instituto de Reforma Agraria y Colonizaci&#243;n (IERAC) -instituci&#243;n ahora 
reemplazada por el INDA-, adem&#225;s de que pagan los respectivos impuestos en el municipio de 
Palenque. Los terrenos en litigio son reclamados por los herederos de una persona apellidada 
Pimentel Delgado, quienes han estado reclamando esas tierras, con el argumento que son una 
herencia de sus ancestros. Sin embargo, las familias desalojadas parece que tienen escrituras 
otorgadas por el IERAC, el cual no reconoce los documentos anteriores sobre esas tierras. Parece </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>que este conflicto de tierras se inici&#243; hace nueve a&#241;os cuando el IERAC fue sustituido por el 
INDA, el cual legaliz&#243; a favor de los herederos de Pimentel y de la Sra. Martha Delgado Coello, 
viuda de Pimentel, una extensi&#243;n de 4.600 ha de tierra que corresponde a los recintos La Yuca, 
Artiller&#237;a de Arriba, Artiller&#237;a de Abajo, Pampas de Arriba, Pampas de Maculillo, Bomb&#243;n, 
La Delia, parte de Los Mosquitos, y otros lugares cuyos moradores se encuentran en la misma 
situaci&#243;n que los de La Yuca. Seg&#250;n los agricultores esas tierras fueron denunciadas 
anteriormente ante el IERAC y ahora ante el INDA y les fueron adjudicadas en Quito. 
Los campesinos pagaron por ellas al banco y obtuvieron las escrituras que les han servido por 
a&#241;os para la obtenci&#243;n de cr&#233;ditos con el Banco Nacional de Fomento. El Relator Especial cree 
que los hechos alegados parecen indicar una posible violaci&#243;n del derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n y a 
la vivienda adecuada de estas familias que se quedan desalojadas, sin vivienda, sin tierra para el 
trabajo y de consecuencia sin acceso a sus recursos de subsistencia habituales.

informaci&#243;n en relaci&#243;n con los efectos negativos sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n y al agua 
que el proyecto Multiprop&#243;sito Quevedo-Vinces en la subcuenca del r&#237;o Vinces conformada por 
el sistema hidrogr&#225;fico de los r&#237;os Baba, Quevedo y Vinces podr&#237;a causar a las comunidades 
cercanas. Seg&#250;n estas informaciones, este proyecto, que ha sido declarado obra de prioridad 
nacional en un contexto de crisis energ&#233;tica, est&#225; compuesto por la presa Baba, la central 
hidroel&#233;ctrica de Baba y el trasvase Baba-Daule Peripe y tiene entre sus prop&#243;sitos regular 
sustancialmente los caudales, desarrollar un buen control de las inundaciones en el ciclo de la 
lluvia, almacenar el agua para proveerla en la estaci&#243;n seca con fines de consumo humano como 
agua potable y para riego, y generar energ&#237;a el&#233;ctrica. La cuenca hidrogr&#225;fica del r&#237;o Guayas 
donde se situar&#237;a el megaproyecto es por su extensi&#243;n y recursos naturales renovables la m&#225;s 
importante del oc&#233;ano Pac&#237;fico de Am&#233;rica del Sur y es considerada como la fuente m&#225;s 
importante de abastecimiento agr&#237;cola del Ecuador. Las autoridades competentes calculan que el 
cultivo del 50% de la superficie de esta regi&#243;n alimenta a m&#225;s de 10 millones de habitantes y que 
de cada 2,3 ha sembradas en el pa&#237;s, 1 ha pertenece a esta cuenca. Los informes recibidos 
afirman que la represa de Baba inundar&#237;a una superficie de 3.550 ha desplazando a 
aproximadamente 1.490 familias de 15 comunidades e inundando a otras 1.350 familias 
de 14 recintos de campesinos que incluyen comunidades afroecuatorianas. De llevarse a cabo 
este proyecto, estos informes denuncian que se destruir&#237;a no solamente la infraestructura de estas 
comunidades sino tambi&#233;n significar&#237;a la inundaci&#243;n de m&#225;s de 3.500 ha de tierra de alta

eutrofizaci&#243;n de los r&#237;os y debido a que la represa obstaculiz&#243; los medios tradicionales de 
subsistencia de las poblaciones como la agricultura y la pesca y condujo a una situaci&#243;n de 
pobreza en donde se reporta un alto riesgo de desnutrici&#243;n y mortalidad. Adem&#225;s se afirma que 
esta represa ha disminuido la calidad y disponibilidad de agua de los r&#237;os y pozos que las 
comunidades aleda&#241;as utilizan para su abastecimiento. En el cant&#243;n Pichincha en la provincia de 
Manab&#237;, aleda&#241;o a la represa, se observa que el color del agua es oscuro, su olor es f&#233;tido y su 
composici&#243;n ya no es apta ni para el consumo de los animales. A pesar de esto se sigue 
utilizando ese agua para consumo humano. Las informaciones recibidas indican tambi&#233;n que el 
relleno del embalse inund&#243; el r&#237;o y destruy&#243; la &#250;nica v&#237;a de comunicaci&#243;n que ten&#237;an los 
campesinos para transportar sus productos. Seg&#250;n los informes recibidos estos efectos podr&#237;an 
reproducirse en el caso del megaproyecto Quevedo-Vinces. El Relator Especial cree que, en 
relaci&#243;n con la represa Daule-Peripa, los hechos alegados parecen indicar una posible violaci&#243;n 
de la obligaci&#243;n de respetar el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las comunidades afectadas en cuanto 
las autoridades competentes llevaron a cabo este proyecto sin una compensaci&#243;n y 
indemnizaci&#243;n adecuadas, a consecuencia de lo cual, para la gran mayor&#237;a de los afectados no ha 
sido posible restaurar sus accesos anteriores a un abastecimiento de alimentaci&#243;n y agua 
suficiente y adecuado. En relaci&#243;n con el proyecto Quevedo-Vinces los hechos alegados podr&#237;an 
conducir a una posible violaci&#243;n de la obligaci&#243;n de respetar el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n de las 
comunidades aleda&#241;as si las autoridades competentes no realizan un plan para mitigar los 
posibles efectos negativos sobre el derecho a la alimentaci&#243;n y al agua de estas comunidades.

<p>28. On 16 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government regarding allegations 
that the Z&#252;blin company has submitted an application to the relevant authorities for an export 
risk guarantee of approximately &#8364;100 million for the Ilisu Dam on the River Tigris in 
south-eastern Turkey. According to this information, an international consortium led by the 
Austrian enterprise Andritz (see above), which has sought support from the Austrian Control 
Bank for an export credit guarantee of around &#8364;200 million, is in charge of carrying out 
construction work for the dam. The information received claims that in November 2005 the 
consortium submitted a revised environmental impact assessment and a new resettlement plan. 
Nevertheless, it appears that the dam could displace between 50,000 and 80,000 people, mostly 
Kurds, affecting the human rights, including the right to food, of these populations and the 
environment. According to this information, the region has a large number of IDPs and has been 
affected by widespread marginalization. Many families are already reported to lack access to 
food, clean and accessible water, sanitation and housing. The Special Rapporteur believes that 
the alleged facts could lead to a violation of the obligation to cooperate in respecting the right to 
food and water of the people who could be displaced by the dam construction if the authorities 
examining the export credit guarantee application do not cooperate with the Turkish authorities 
in providing appropriate safeguards to ensure that the displacement of these people without 
adequate resettlement and compensation plans does not interfere with their livelihoods and 
access to sufficient and adequate food. </p>

<p>29. On 7 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with a number of other special 
procedures of the Human Rights Council brought to the Government&#8217;s attention information 
received concerning environmental activists and human rights defenders involved with 
Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA - Save Narmada Movement) and in particular the NBA leader, 
Ms. Medha Patkar, and Jamsing Nargave (from Amlali village, Badwani District) and 
Bhagwatibai Jatpuria (from Nissarpur village, Dhar District). In addition to earlier concerns 
expressed regarding the impact of increasing water levels in the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the 
Narmada River, the special procedures expressed concerned about developments in this respect. 
According to information received on 8 March 2006, the Narmada Control Authority took a 
decision to raise the height of the Sardar Sarovar Dam from the present 110.64 metres to 
121.92 metres. The implementation of this decision, apart from contravening the judgement of 
the Supreme Court of India in 2000 according to which any further increase in the height of the 
dam was to be linked to the implementation of resettlement and rehabilitation measures, would 
allegedly result in the further violation of a range of human rights of those affected. They were 
aware of the indefinite sit-in (<i>dharna</i>) undertaken by the over 300 dam-affected persons and 
NBA activists in New Delhi since 17 March to demand a halt to construction of the dam, as well 
as of the situation of the three NBA activists who had begun an indefinite fast on 29 March 2006. 
According to information received, adequate rehabilitation has not been provided for those 
affected by the dam, many of whom are indigenous peoples and farmers. Furthermore, 
alternative agricultural land is not being provided and where land has been allotted, as in 
Maharashtra and Gujarat, it is allegedly uncultivable and inadequate. Official estimates say that 
an additional 24,421 families in 177 villages of Madhya Pradesh are to be displaced should the 
dam height be raised to 121.92 metres. According to estimates from civil society organizations, 
at least 10,000 families were affected when the height of dam water level was previously raised 
to 110 metres who are still awaiting rehabilitation. Women and children are the worst affected by 
displacement and the lack of adequate rehabilitation. 
</p>
<p>30. On 12 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people wrote to the 
Government about allegations of deaths from starvation. In particular, the information received 
claims that on 24 January 2006 Ms. Bisni Mal, and a few days later her husband, Joyram Mal, 
members of one of the 13 indigenous families from Pakurdiar village in Jalangi, Murshidabad, 
died due to ill-health resulting from lack of food. In addition, on 6 March 2006, 8-year-old 
Deepali Singh, daughter of Kalipada Singh and resident of the same village, died of starvation. 
Allegedly, her medical report indicates that she was suffering from anaemia and hepatomegalia. 
The allegations received claim that because of river erosion in the Jalangi area, most people have 
lost their homes and lands. In this area there are reportedly no industries and the usual means of 
livelihoods of local communities used to be agriculture. However, erosion has affected most of 
the cultivated land, thus depriving the local communities of their usual access to food. In Jalangi 
villagers were promised ration cards that would enable them to obtain access to food grains, 
sugar, kerosene, oil and other items at subsidized rates. Reportedly, the majority of the villagers 
have not been able to access these items as either the shops which sell the subsidized food are 
closed or shopkeepers refuse to sell to the cardholders, claiming that the cards are counterfeit. It </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>is claimed that local authorities have not yet adequately intervened to address these problems. In 
addition, Murshidabad District has been identified as one of the places where the National 
Employment Guarantee Act, 2005 will be implemented. This legislation stipulates that 100 days 
of work at the minimum wage should be provided to a majority of the residents. It is claimed that 
in Jalangi this welfare scheme has not yet been implemented and most of the villagers have not 
had access to jobs or alternative land to cultivate. Bisni Mal and Joyram Mal were not given 
ration cards and had been unable to eat for days before they died. Allegedly, when their son left 
the house in search of employment, he gave his parents some grain on which they managed to 
survive for a few days. The Special Rapporteur believes that these facts appear to indicate a 
violation of the Government&#8217;s obligation to respect the right to food, as omissions by the 
relevant authorities contributed to the violation of the right to life of Bisni Mal, Joyram Mal and 
Deepali Singh. In addition, the alleged facts would appear to violate the obligation to fulfil the 
right to food, as relevant authorities have failed to provide adequate food to Bisni Mal, 
Joyram Mal, Deepali Singh and the villagers in Jalangi, given their inability to do so themselves. 
</p>
<p>31. On 12 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people raised with the 
Government further allegations of deaths from starvation. In particular the information received 
by the Special Rapporteur claims that on 7 February 2006 Katraju Lakshmi, a Chenchu tribal 
woman working as a bonded labourer in the State of Meghalaya, died due to ill-health resulting 
from lack of food. The Chenchu tribe is mostly found in the Nallamalai hills of Andhra Pradesh 
and used to depend on the forest for their food. Forest products used to enable them to feed 
themselves and survive. This situation has reportedly changed in recent years due to the 
reduction in forest cover and the subsequent depletion of forest produce which has reportedly 
forced Chenchu to look for alternative employment opportunities. The allegations received claim 
that 600 Chenchu tribal people from Marredmandinne village in Pedakottapally Division, 
Mahabubnagar District, Andhra Pradesh, work as bonded labourers on construction sites in the 
State of Meghalaya. In addition, most of the Chenchu do not possess ration cards which would 
enable them to receive subsidized grain. It is reported that, following the tribe&#8217;s displacement 
from their original habitations to nearby villages, village heads and village secretaries could not 
refer their names to the local administration for issuing ration cards because they were not 
original residents of these villages. It also appears that the Chenchu are generally not aware of 
their entitlements and authorities have so far failed to inform and educate them. It is alleged that 
perennial drought, lack of alternative employment, abject poverty and the absolute absence of 
other means to feed their families forced the illiterate Chenchu to search for employment in 
far-off places. Taking advantage of their situation, middlemen allegedly promised to provide 
them with employment in nearby cities such as Warangal and Hyderabad, but instead took them 
to places as far away as Meghalaya, which is almost 1,700 km from their home. The Chenchu 
reportedly covered the costs of living and transport through loans from the labour contractors. 
Unable to pay back the loans, they were forced to become bonded labourers. It is also claimed 
that tribal women are doubly affected due to the wage discrimination they suffer and the threats 
to their physical security they receive. When food is scarce, tribal women are often the ones who 
suffer most from hunger and malnutrition. The allegations received claim that Katraju Lakshmi 
was among the group of Chenchu that migrated to Meghalaya in September 2005. She worked as 
a construction labourer for the Lekhya power plant near Shillong in the State of Meghalaya. She 
was reportedly paid an advance of 1,000 rupees by middlemen and then forced into bonded </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>labour. During pregnancy Katraju Lakshmi did not receive any assistance from the local 
Integrated Child Development Scheme Department, which is supposed to supply nutritious food 
to pregnant women. As a result she suffered from post-childbirth weakness and ill-health and 
faced acute poverty and lack of food. During her last days, Katraju Lakshmi survived on a small 
quantity of rice and mixed vegetable juice. As per agreement, middlemen have to provide 
cooked meals to all labourers during their stay at the workplace. However, it is alleged that the 
meals they supplied were insufficient and inadequate. Katraju Lakshmi&#8217;s health was already 
precarious when she started working at the site. This coupled with insufficient and inadequate 
food and hard labour led to further deterioration of her health, leading to her death. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that these facts appear to indicate a violation of the Government&#8217;s obligation 
to respect the right to food, as omissions by the relevant authorities contributed to the violation 
of the right to life of Katraju Lakshmi and to the violation of the right to food of the Chenchu 
tribe in their places of residence by displacing them and thus depriving them of their usual access 
to food. In addition, the alleged facts would appear to violate the obligation to<b> </b>protect<b> </b>the right to 
food of Katraju Lakshmi as the relevant authorities failed to take measures to ensure that 
companies and individuals did not deprive Katraju Lakshmi and the Chenchu of their access to 
adequate food. Finally, the alleged facts would appear to violate the obligation to fulfil the right 
to food, as relevant authorities have failed to provide adequate food to Katraju Lakshmi and the 
Chenchu tribe given their inability to do so themselves. 
</p>
<p>32. On 21 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government regarding the 
following: 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Allegations of the acute food crisis and failure of the Public Distribution System (PDS) 
in Nindura Block, Barabanki District, Uttar Pradesh. In particular, these allegations 
claim that on 5 May 2006, a group of nearly 200 villagers gathered at the district 
headquarters under the banner of the Rozi Roti Sammittee, a community-based 
organization which provides a forum for villagers to raise their concerns. The 
200 villagers from Nindura congregated in response to a promise made by local block 
officials to resolve the problems of the PDS shop and its functionality by 19 April 2006. 
The group reportedly also called on the local authorities not only to provide ration cards 
to those who had not received any assistance, but also to allot new ration shops in 
Dadera and Odoria villages (<i>gram panchayat</i>). It is also reported that the local village 
council leaders (<i>gram pradhan</i>) and secretary were demanding bribes for the 
distribution of Anntoyoda, Annapurna and Below Poverty Line ration cards in those 
villages, as well as in Munimpur, even though villagers are entitled to them. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that the relevant authorities have failed to provide ration cards to 
those who are entitled to them and adequate access to food and financial means to 
purchase it, including by failing to improve the functionality of existing ration card 
shops, open new ration card shops in the areas concerned and implement the relevant 
welfare schemes approved for this district; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Allegations of deaths by starvation. It is reported that 9-month-old Seema Musahar, 
daughter of Laxmi Musahar (35) and Chotelal Musahar (40), died as a result of lack of 
food on 28 July 2006; Laxmi&#8217;s father, Mr. Phoolchand, from Belwa village, Badagaon 
Block, Varanasi Distrcit, Uttar Pradesh, similarly died on 18 June 2006. It appears that 
Seema&#8217;s death occurred following attempts by her mother to receive help from a </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 20 
 
</p>
<p>primary health centre approximately 9 km from her village. The allegations received 
claim that Seema&#8217;s parents had worked for some time at a brick kiln for which they 
received small amounts of low-quality grain and chaff as payment. Since they left that 
job, they have been unemployed and unable to have access to adequate and sufficient 
food for themselves and their family. As a result, Laxmi Musahar was unable to 
produce sufficient milk for her child. Following Mr. Phoolchand&#8217;s death, the Musahar 
family met with the District Magistrate, Block Development Officer and Sub-Divisional 
Magistrate to request their support through relevant government welfare schemes. 
The District Magistrate gave them a note to admit them to the district hospital in 
Varanasi. Seema was reportedly admitted to hospital on 26 June 2006 but discharged 
on 1 July 2006, allegedly without receiving adequate treatment. In addition, on 
11 July 2006 Laxmi wrote to the District Magistrate requesting 1,000 rupees from 
emergency funds to help her family, but received no reply. The information received 
also reports the death on 29 May 2006 of Muneeb Musahar, a 3-year-old boy from 
Belwa village, allegedly due to lack of food. On 26 May 2006 the primary health centre 
at Baragaon reportedly recorded that he weighed 10 kg and was suffering from severe 
malnutrition. Muneeb was taken for medical attention just before his death and was 
found to be in a critical condition. The Special Rapporteur believes that omissions 
by the relevant authorities have contributed to the violation of the right to life of 
Seema Musahar, Mr. Phoolchand and Muneeb Musahar, while relevant authorities failed 
in their obligation to fulfil as they did not provide adequate food to Seema Musahar, 
Mr. Phoolchand and Muneeb Musahar, given their inability to do so themselves; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Allegations that the residents of Jai Bheem Nagar (JBN), in Meerut City, Uttar Pradesh, 
do not have access to safe drinking water and are therefore compelled to consume 
contaminated water. JBN is a slum located on the banks of the Kali Ganga River in 
Meerut City, which has a population of approximately 10,000 people, mostly Dalits. As 
there is no provision for municipal water available to JBN residents, they are compelled 
to consume water from private and government hand pumps. The water that comes from 
these pumps as well as from the river is polluted, discoloured and has a foul odour. In 
addition, this water appears to be contaminated with heavy metals like chromium, 
cadmium, lead, iron and mercury at levels many times over the accepted limits. The 
JBN residents claim that the consumption and use of the polluted drinking water has 
caused cases of diarrhoea and skin diseases, and that children are often subject to 
waterborne infections. In addition, it appears that women suffer the most as they have 
to travel several kilometres to fetch safe drinking water. It appears that there are several 
distilleries, paper and sugar mills, as well as chemical plants on the banks of the 
Kali Ganga River in Meerut City which have contaminated the river and the 
groundwater. This contamination is reportedly due to the discharge of hazardous 
effluents from the chemical industries, the leaching of pesticides from the nearby 
agricultural fields and biomedical waste. It is reported that these industries do not have 
operational Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CEPTs) and Sewage Treatment Plants 
(STPs) to control the pollutants, resulting in the contamination of the water. CEPTs are 
reportedly mandatory for hazardous industries and industries which pollute, whereas 
STPs are not. The Special Rapporteur believes that the facts in this case indicate a 
violation of the obligation to protect the right to water as the relevant authorities have </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>not taken the necessary measures to protect the access to safe drinking water by the 
JBN residents from interference by third parties, namely the industries contaminating 
the water. There appears also to be a violation of the obligation to fulfil the right to 
water as the authorities have not yet taken the necessary measures to provide access to 
safe drinking water to the JBN residents, considering their inability to do so themselves; 
</p>
<p>&#8722; Allegations of threats of imminent eviction for thousands of peasants and their families 
in West Bengal. In particular, these allegations claim that, in order to acquire the land 
from the peasants in Singur, Hooghly, to make way for a car manufacturing plant owned 
by Tata, the Government of West Bengal has ordered the peasants to immediately stop 
sowing paddy on their land and accept the Government&#8217;s decision to acquire the land 
and evict the peasants. It is reported that there have been no efforts by the authorities to 
identify other non-agricultural land for the car manufacturing plant and to protect the 
peasants&#8217; livelihoods and access to food. It appears that approximately 15,000 peasants, 
including agricultural labourers, unregistered sharecroppers, cottage industry workers 
and local small business people, who depend on the agricultural land for their 
livelihoods and access to food, will be directly and indirectly affected by the land 
acquisition. It is alleged that the compensation offered so far has been in terms of a 
one-time monetary payment which peasants do not consider adequate. In addition, 
reports indicate that the whole process for designing the compensation package has not 
been transparent and has not included meaningful participation of the affected groups. It 
is also feared that peasant women will be most severely affected by the eviction as in 
most cases land is not registered in their names. In the view of the Special Rapporteur 
the alleged facts could lead to a violation of the obligation to respect the right to food if 
the relevant authorities do not refrain from taking measures to evict the peasants and 
their families from their land, thereby interfering with their livelihoods and access to 
sufficient and adequate food.

<p>33. On 27 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on 
adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living brought to the 
Government&#8217;s attention allegations that Presidential Regulation 36/2005 on the Provision of 
Land for the Implementation of Public Interest Development threatened the access to land and 
livelihoods of more than 500,000 informal landowners in urban and rural areas in different parts 
of Indonesia, including in those areas affected by the East Jakarta Canal project, the Pluit Dam 
project in Muara Baru and the Manggarai-Jatinegara-Cakung-Bekasi project. According to 
information received the implementation of Presidential Regulation 36/2005 may lead to mass 
forced evictions in connection with these projects. The allegations claim that the Regulation 
widens the scope for revoking land titles and acquiring land for public projects. It also provides 
for compensatory programmes for those affected by these measures, but allegedly only for those 
landowners who possess land certificates, have complete documentation and agree to the 
proposed compensation package. The compensation offered by the authorities is based on the 
selling price of taxed properties, which is reportedly below the market price. In addition, 
according to this Regulation, landowners shall have the right to complain within a set time frame </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>if they do not agree to the proposed compensation. It appears, though, that whilst the case is 
pending in court, the relevant authorities retain the power to evict people immediately. The 
information received alleges that the implementation of the Regulation could result in eviction 
without compensation of those landowners without valid land titles, impacting on their access to 
a livelihood. The majority of landowners are said to be in this category, particularly in rural areas 
where access to land and natural resources is often regulated by customary law. The land of 
those people likely to be affected by the implementation of Regulation 36/2005 guarantees their 
access to an adequate standard of living as well as to a livelihood, as they use the land to grow 
products for personal consumption or for sale at markets. The potential negative impact of 
Regulation 36/2005 on the access to land and livelihood of more than 500,000 landowners in 
urban and rural areas could lead to a violation of the obligation of the Government to respect the 
right to food. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>34. On 4 May 2006 the Special Rapporteurs received a reply from the Government explaining 
that Presidential Regulation 36/2005, on &#8220;Land Acquisition for Public Interests&#8221;, was issued on 
3 May 2005 and listing 21 types of public development that fall into the category of &#8220;public 
interests&#8221;. It was issued to resolve the problems linked to the acquisition of land by the State, 
specifically for improving infrastructure. This Regulation has four main principles: certainty of 
the implementation of the process of development; openness of the process of development for 
the public interest; respect of the ownership of the land; justice in the surrendering of the land 
for the public interest. The new Regulation replaces former Presidential Decree 55/1993 on Land 
Procurement for Public Developments, which was deemed problematic, and to ensure that 
development projects, whether national or international, obtained government approval before 
they received authorization to proceed. The Government added that the new Regulation 36/2005 
only allows for the compulsory acquisition of land when certain criteria are met. Apart from the 
four principles already mentioned, there are several procedures that apply, which include the 
following: prior to the approval of any land appropriation, public consultation must take place, 
offering the owners and members of the community a chance to voice their concerns. In the same 
vein, it is important to note that before a plot of land can be acquired by the Government it must 
be included in its regional spatial planning and also must be approved by the administrator in 
charge of that region. Several steps must be taken before an official authorization for 
the appropriation and use of the land by the Government can be accepted. Generally, an 
appropriation cannot take place until a majority of the local residents approve. Compensation is 
normally offered to landowners when this appropriation is deemed necessary. Similarly, in 
acquiring land for these purposes, the land must be valued at its taxable rate and compensation 
offered on that basis. On the matter of the land owned by individuals who do not possess a valid 
land certificate or title being denied their rights, such persons are not officially recognized 
landowners but are regulated by the district head or mayor, whose authorization is needed. If 
there is to be a change in ownership, written permission from the district head/mayor or governor 
is required. Before this, the value of the land in question is determined by an independent Price 
Valuation Institution or team who will calculate the basic compensation. If owners do not agree 
with the proposal, they have the right to submit their objection to the local district head within 
90 days. If an agreement is not reached, the Government has the right to surrender the money 
intended as compensation for the appropriation of the land to the State court. The provisos of the 
new Regulation also leave room to protect the rights of the owners as they can appeal if they do </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>not agree with the development or the compensation. The Government assured the Special 
Rapporteur that the measures to develop the land and its corresponding infrastructure do not 
have an overarching priority over the fundamental human rights of the people that live on the 
land.

<p>35. On 19 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur brought to the Government&#8217;s attention 
allegations that approximately 340 peasant families in Ompo, Lapajung, Bila and Mattabulu 
villages, Lalabata Subregency, South Celebes, have been deprived of their access to a livelihood 
and sufficient and adequate food. According to these allegations the peasant families in these 
locations have been traditionally dependent on land and forest for their access to food. They 
planted rice and used the forest for hunting, fishing and collecting fruits. Although during 
colonial rule the vast majority of land was taken away from native communities, the peasants in 
Ompo, Lapujung, Bila and Mattabulu villages were reportedly allowed to cultivate their land 
following an agreement with the colonial rulers and the local officials. The allegations 
received claim that in 1982, Ministerial Decision No. 760/kpts/Um/10/1982 made an area of 
3,615,164 hectares in South Celebes Province a State Forest Zone. Following this decision, the 
peasants were reportedly banned from cultivating their land on the ground that it is located 
within the State Forest Zone and belongs to the State. It appears that many migrated to cities in 
search of other employment opportunities, while others stayed and eked out a living by planting 
food crops in their yard. The information received indicates that the peasants have attempted to 
claim their land back through the Matoa Peasants Alliance since 2000. Although in 2003 an 
agreement was reached between the peasants and the mayor of Soppeng whereby peasants were 
permitted to cultivate this land, in September/October 2004, 11 peasant leaders were reportedly 
arrested for illegal logging. Although they have now been released, it is claimed that whilst in 
detention the peasant leaders did not have prompt access to their lawyers, and had restricted and 
irregular access to family members and medical care. This information also claims that a new 
agreement concluded in August 2005 between the peasants and the new mayor allows only some 
of the peasant families to cultivate the land. Further, it is claimed that due to harassment by the 
police and local authorities, including the mayor and forestry officers, the peasants are afraid to 
cultivate their land. They reportedly go to the fields before sunrise, work for around two hours 
and sometimes go back at night. The Special Rapporteur believes that these facts appear to 
violate the obligation to respect the right to food as the relevant authorities have failed to refrain 
from taking measures to ban the peasants and their families from their land, thus interfering with 
their livelihoods and access to sufficient and adequate food.

that access to subsidized food for the residents of Camp Ashraf is no longer available, thus 
affecting people&#8217;s right to sufficient food and means for its procurement. According to these 
allegations, more than a year ago the relevant authorities introduced the practice of denying 
on a discriminatory basis to current and former family members and associates of the 
Mujahideen-e Khalq residing at Camp Ashraf food allocations at a level and price commensurate </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>with what is supplied to other citizens living in Diyala Province, to which they were formerly 
entitled. As a result, the people concerned have to buy at the market those food items which they 
cannot produce or grow locally, including sugar, which is very important in their diet, at prices 
which continue to increase due to inflation. In addition, when traders cannot reach Camp Ashraf 
to bring in the necessary food items, its residents have to go to Baghdad to buy food, a 
journey that carries great security risks despite being escorted by the Multinational Force. On 
17 July 2006 the water pipeline that stretches 26 km from the pumping station near the 
Tigris River to Camp Ashraf was damaged by a series of explosions. This allegedly affected the 
access of the residents and nearby villages to water for drinking, cooking and hygiene 
purposes for around two weeks. Irrigation was also reportedly disrupted by the explosions. On 
22 July 2006 the relevant authorities decided to suspend all fuel and oil supplies to Camp Ashraf, 
including hospitals, which could potentially affect the diet of its residents due to limited fuel for 
cooking and access to water. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, these facts could lead to a 
violation of the obligation to respect the right to food and water in a non-discriminatory manner 
if the relevant authorities do not take appropriate measures to restore the food and fuel 
allocations for the residents of Camp Ashraf.

<p>37. On 5 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning allegations 
of a looming humanitarian crisis which the Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip were facing as 
a result of the Israeli authorities&#8217; prolonged closure of the Karni/al Muntar crossing between the 
Gaza Strip and Israel, which is the commercial crossing for goods imported and exported from 
Israel. The information received claimed that the closure of the Karni crossing for most of the 
time since the beginning of 2006 has resulted in shortages of food and other necessities and 
required rationing of bread, and threatened to have serious effects on access to the right to food 
and a livelihood of the 1.3 million Palestinians who live in the Gaza Strip. The Karni crossing 
was partially opened for only eight days since 22 February 2006 and, despite the partial 
reopening of the crossing for imports on 20 March 2006, which allowed supplies of wheat, flour, 
oil, rice, dairy produce, cattle and certain types of fresh fruit to enter the Gaza Strip, there were 
increasing shortages of basic essential supplies, such as flour, and food reserves were gradually 
being depleted. It was reported that most of the bakeries across the Gaza Strip had to close down. 
As of 23 March 2006, the Karni crossing had been closed for 46 days since the beginning of the 
year. In addition, no Palestinian exports were permitted, which continued to have a detrimental 
impact on the local Palestinian economy. The inability to export local agricultural products at the 
height of the harvest season reportedly led to hundreds of tonnes of tomatoes, peppers, 
cucumbers and strawberries going to waste. The Palestine Economic Development Company 
operating the greenhouses in the former settlement areas estimated that the total amount of crops 
donated/destroyed due to the closures of the Karni crossing reached approximately 973 tonnes, 
with a value of some US$ 5.2 million. Total export losses for both agricultural and 
non-perishable items were estimated at US$ 500,000 per day, or more than US$ 23 million 
in 2006. Israeli producers were also negatively affected by the Karni closures, citing losses of 
NIS 15 million per day. Kerem Shalom had been declared open since 21 March 2006 for the 
receipt of humanitarian supplies from Egypt and six truckloads of humanitarian assistance had 
reportedly arrived in the Gaza Strip as of 23 March 2006. But the much smaller capacity of the </p>

  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>Kerem Shalom crossing gave rise to concerns that it would not be able to deal with the large 
quantities and volumes of relief supplies expected at the border. Notwithstanding the entitlement 
of the Government to take measures to protect the lives of its citizens, the Special Rapporteur 
believes that the protracted closures of the Karni crossing have contributed to depriving 
Palestinian residents of the Gaza Strip of their usual access to food and a livelihood, thus 
contributing to a violation of the governmental obligation to respect the right to food. In addition, 
as the relevant authorities have failed to facilitate the provision of that right directly by, 
inter alia, ensuring the passage and delivery of relief supplies, the Government appears to be in 
violation of its obligation to fulfil the right to food.

<p>38. On 17 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning 
allegations that the relevant provincial and regional authorities plan to privatize the management 
of the integrated water system (Servizio Idrico Integrato, SII) of Messina, Sicily, despite 
opposition from most of the affected municipalities and large sectors of civil society. These 
allegations claim that, in those provinces where the SII has been privatized, there has been a 
considerable price increase for clients and the provision of water to those who are unable to pay 
has been interrupted, thus affecting in particular vulnerable groups such as students, the elderly, 
migrant workers and their families, etc. It is also claimed that there have been shortcomings with 
respect to certain aspects of the process for contracting out the water provision services. The 
information brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur indicates that Act No. 36 of 
5 January 1994, the so-called Galli Act, aims at the structural reform of the water system in Italy. 
In Sicily this act was reportedly incorporated into regional law No. 10/99 and in May 2000 nine 
Optimal Territorial Zones (Ambito Territoriale Ottimale, ATO) were identified by presidential 
decree, one for each province. According to this information, ATOs are the framework for 
managing all phases of the SII, from collection to distribution, to sewage removal and 
purification. They are supposed to define the workplan for managing the SII, including 
determining the price of the water provision services and the modalities for contracting out the 
management of these services to a single provider. The organs of the ATO are the president, the 
technical secretariat and the Zonal Conference, also called the Mayors&#8217; Assembly. The reports 
received allege that ATO Messina (ATO No. 3), established in July 2002, is composed of 
108 municipalities and has its own workplan for managing the SII in the Messina area. Although 
at the outset this ATO opted to contract the water provision services to a private provider, on 
24 June 2005 the Mayors&#8217; Assembly decided by consensus to revert to &#8220;in-house provision&#8221; 
(<i>gestione pubblica</i>), which is allegedly permitted by the legislation. This decision was then 
reportedly ratified by 74 Municipal Councils, representing almost 80 per cent of the population 
of the province. The Councils also ratified the decision to establish a public company called 
Messina Acque S.p.A to manage the water provision services. A decision was also reportedly 
taken to purchase &#8220;provisionally&#8221; the shares of those municipalities that did not agree to the 
establishment of such a public company, for the amount of approximately &#8364;40,000. It is also 
alleged that the Presidency of Messina Province called for an urgent meeting of the Mayors&#8217; 
Assembly to propose the repeal of the decisions on the ground that the management of the water 
provision services by a public provider would prevent the province from accessing some 
&#8364;122 million in European funds. It appears that this proposal was rejected and as a result, the </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 26 
 
</p>
<p>President of the Sicily Region decided to nominate, by decree of 3 April 2006, a special 
administrator (<i>commissario ad acta</i>) to manage the Messina ATO; to repeal the 25 June 2005 
decision of the Mayors&#8217; Assembly; and to issue a call for bids for the management of the water 
provision services (as published on 1 June 2006) from outside contractors. The last appears to 
indicate that a decision will be taken even if only one bid is received. According to the Special 
Rapporteur, the alleged facts could lead to a violation of the obligation to protect the right to 
water if the relevant authorities do not take the necessary measures to protect the access to safe 
and affordable water of the residents of Messina Province. The alleged facts could also lead to a 
violation of the obligation to fulfil the right to water if the authorities do not take the necessary 
measures to facilitate access to safe and affordable water for the residents of the province in 
accordance with the wishes of those representing them at the local level.

<p>39. On 3 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people wrote to the 
Government concerning plans to build or to participate in building Nam Theun 2, a hydropower 
project which would be situated in Khammouane Province in central Laos, approximately 40 km 
upstream from the already completed Nam Theun Hinboun hydropower project. The information 
received claims that the Government signed a concession agreement with the Nam Theun 2 
Power Company Limited (NTPC) for the construction, operation and ownership of the power 
plant and its transfer back to the Government on the expiry date of the agreement. According to 
this information, in November 2003 the NTCP signed a power purchase agreement with the 
Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand, paving the way for the project&#8217;s development, and 
in June 2005 the World Bank announced its financial help in the form of grants and guarantees 
for the construction of Nam Theun 2. The reports received allege that the terms of the concession 
agreement may make it difficult for the relevant authorities to take an impartial position when it 
comes to balancing commercial returns against social concerns and protecting the rights of the 
affected communities. The allegations also claim that the construction of Nam Theun 2 could 
displace 6,200 indigenous people living on the Nakai Plateau and affect another 100,000 people 
living downstream of the project along the Xe Bang Fai and Nam Theun, who rely on these 
rivers for fish, drinking water and agriculture. The construction of this dam could allegedly 
affect the right to food of the affected communities whose members are subsistence farmers 
dependent upon natural resources for their livelihoods. It is reported that the villagers living 
downstream of the project rank their fishing and other aquaculture activities for income and food 
supply second or third in terms of household food security after rice and vegetable cultivation. 
The reports received indicate that the project developers have estimated that at least 
1,500 families living along the lower Nam Phao may experience 60 per cent declines in their fish 
catches as a result of the reduction in the river flow that could be expected from the project. In 
addition, experience from other hydropower projects and resettlement programmes in Laos has 
reportedly indicated that replacing subsistence livelihoods at a level which guarantees people&#8217;s 
right to an adequate standard of living may be difficult. There are plans for giving villagers on 
the Nakai Plateau small plots of land whose soil is not suited to crop production as it is allegedly 
heavily leached and infertile. It appears that high inputs of organic and inorganic fertilizer will 
be required to grow food, but the company reportedly plans to help pay for fertilizers for only </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 27 
 
</p>
<p>five years. In addition, there may not be sufficient land for grazing villagers&#8217; livestock, 
particularly their buffalo herds. According to the reported plans, villagers may be able to derive 
some income from logging in a community forestry area, but it appears that the high-quality 
timber has already been logged. There are plans to replace freshwater fisheries with aquaculture 
for downstream communities. Experiences in Laos to date suggest that the adoption of 
aquaculture has been a slow and gradual process and that the poorest people lack the necessary 
land and capital resources to switch to this type of livelihood. The information received also 
claims that there is not yet a resettlement site for two villages living closest to the dam site as the 
original site was found to be unsuitable due to water pollution upstream. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>40. On 15 May 2006 the Government replied, indicating that the Concession Agreement (CA) 
had been validated and endorsed by the multiple shareholders and lenders to the NTCP, 
including international financing institutions (IFIs), and aims at protecting the interests of local 
communities affected by the project. The Government stated that the implementation of the 
project is carefully monitored by a mix of project lenders&#8217; advisers and independent agencies. 
Non-compliance would trigger delays and impose a heavy financial burden on both parties. In 
particular, the project is monitored by an Independent Environmental and Social Panel of 
Experts who have the right to impose modifications under the CA in order to correct a situation 
on site, should it be necessary. In this context, the Government and NTPC, in cooperation with 
IFIs, have taken and will continue to take all measures necessary to both properly mitigate the 
physical impact of all construction activities on people&#8217;s current livelihoods and improve their 
conditions by offering them outstanding development opportunities in the region. The CA and 
the monitoring mechanisms are in place to ensure that NTCP and its contractors adequately 
implement the project, including its social development dimension. The Government attached 
additional background information on the project. 
<b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>41. On 3 November 2006 the Special Rapporteurs thanked the Government for its detailed and 
comprehensive reply, including the additional background information. Whilst noting the 
important monitoring mechanisms already in place for protecting the interests of the affected 
local communities, they added that, with regard to the CA between the Government and NTCP, 
they had not yet received any details concerning the mechanisms that would be responsible for 
investigating alleged human rights violations and violations of the CA provisions and for holding 
accountable those found to be responsible for such violations. They also remain concerned that 
the terms of the CA may make it difficult for the relevant authorities to take an impartial position 
when it came to balancing commercial returns against social concerns and protecting the rights 
of the affected communities. With regard to the additional background information on the 
possible impact of the dam construction on the affected population, the additional reports 
received indicate that provisional cash compensation for loss of rice fields and common property 
resources, such as fisheries, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, access to bamboo forests and 
non-timber forest products, paid to the villagers along the upper part of the downstream channel 
had been inconsistent and uneven and inadequate to compensate for the lost production values of 
their land. The lack of adequate compensation had reportedly led to rice shortages in some 
families. These reports also indicate that, although some villagers used to practise double </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 28 
 
</p>
<p>cropping on their rice fields, they were compensated for the lost production value of only one 
crop. The reports received claim that the communities living in the Xe Bang Fai river basin will 
be affected by increased water flows as a result of the dam construction. The Special 
Rapporteurs understood that a study on the measures to be taken during the downstream 
livelihood and asset restoration programme was due to be completed by early 2006 but had not 
yet been released; the Special Rapporteurs were interested in receiving a copy of this study when 
it became available. Concerning the Nakai Plateau resettlement, the information received alleges 
that the NTCP decided to transitionally resettle people at the beginning of the rainy season 
before the new infrastructure was in place. This may have resulted in impeded access to the 
transitional villages during the rainy season, making food and water deliveries difficult. In 
addition, the Special Rapporteurs had not yet received any information as to whether the 
villagers of Nakai Plateau will be able to keep their buffalo when they are resettled, due to a 
shortage of land and forage, and whether they will be able to grow rice in their new plots. It 
appears that the relevant authorities have experimented with varieties of rice and agroforestry 
systems and additional details in this regard would be appreciated. If villagers have to switch 
from rice cultivation to planting vegetables during the dry season, there should be markets for 
their produce. The information received claims that there are no markets nearby and the 
transportation costs at the moment are too high for the villagers to transport the goods 
themselves. Additional market options seem to be neighbouring Thailand and Viet Nam but the 
tariffs on vegetables and increased competition reportedly make these difficult. The reports 
received also indicate that if most of the biomass is not cleared from the reservoir before 
impoundment, the decomposing vegetation may cause water quality problems in the new 
reservoir, thus resulting in fish kills in both the reservoir area and downstream.

conocido como &#8220;La Parota&#8221; que consiste en construir una central hidroel&#233;ctrica en unas 
17.000 ha de bienes mayoritariamente comunales y ejidales. Seg&#250;n la informaci&#243;n recibida, este 
proyecto pretende explotar las aguas de los r&#237;os Papagayo y Omitl&#225;n y afecta a cinco municipios 
del Estado de Guerrero, inundando 21 territorios y desplazando a m&#225;s de 25.000 personas. 
La cortina de la presa est&#225; programada para ser de 162 m de altura, generando un promedio de 
1.349 gigawatios-hora al a&#241;o, con una capacidad para 6.790 millones de metros c&#250;bicos. Se

comunales y 1 es propiedad privada, implicando unas 17.000 ha. Las principales comunidades 
que ser&#237;an afectadas son Papagayo, Omitl&#225;n, Tlalchocohuite y Tejer&#237;a en el municipio de

Dichos estudios fueron actualizados en 1993 y 1994, y para el a&#241;o 2002 ya se contaba 
adicionalmente con el estudio de viabilidad econ&#243;mica y se estaban realizando estudios de 
preconstrucci&#243;n para concluir con el dise&#241;o de la obra. Se alega que el proyecto &#8220;La Parota&#8221;, si 
se llevara a cabo, causar&#237;a violaciones de los derechos econ&#243;micos y sociales de las 
comunidades. Se afirma que el proyecto privar&#237;a del uso del agua a las personas que 
hist&#243;ricamente han aprovechado los recursos del r&#237;o Papagayo y en su lugar se le dar&#237;a a las 
grandes ciudades. Adicionalmente se estar&#237;a contribuyendo a la p&#233;rdida a largo plazo del agua 
potable que proviene del r&#237;o, contraviniendo el derecho al agua no s&#243;lo de las personas que 
actualmente viven cercanas al r&#237;o, sino tambi&#233;n el de la poblaci&#243;n en general. Adem&#225;s, los 
informes recibidos afirman que el proyecto tendr&#237;a efectos negativos sobre el acceso a una 
alimentaci&#243;n adecuada a causa de la expropiaci&#243;n de la tierra de los afectados y especialmente de 
los que viven en las localidades rurales que se abastecen de aguas abajo de donde se construir&#225; la 
cortina de la presa. Parece que la Comisi&#243;n Federal de Electricidad, encargada de esta obra, no 
ha presentado todav&#237;a un plan de reubicaci&#243;n ni ha especificado el lugar de reasentamiento de los 
afectados, ni el n&#250;mero de personas considerados como tales ni los montos de indemnizaci&#243;n por 
las tierras que se pretende expropiar. Seg&#250;n los propios datos oficiales, el proyecto causar&#237;a 
tambi&#233;n un serio da&#241;o ambiental. La Comisi&#243;n Nacional de Biodiversidad (CONABIO) ha 
establecido que el proyecto est&#225; propuesto en la zona del Tr&#243;pico Seco de Guerrero, 
particularmente rica en biodiversidad, con predominio de selva baja caducifolia, poco 
representada en los programas de conservaci&#243;n <i>in situ</i> del pa&#237;s. La regi&#243;n es un &#225;rea de gran 
importancia para la conservaci&#243;n de su biodiversidad, al estar incluida en su totalidad dentro de

hay m&#225;s de 30 especies en la zona clasificadas como en peligro de extinci&#243;n, seg&#250;n la propia 
norma oficial mexicana. Se alega tambi&#233;n que el proceso para realizar el proyecto &#8220;La Parota&#8221; 
no ha respetado el derecho a la consulta, puesto que parece que muchas de las personas que 
ser&#237;an directamente afectadas no cuentan con informaci&#243;n esencial sobre el proyecto, tales como 
qu&#233; significa la expropiaci&#243;n, a d&#243;nde y bajo qu&#233; condiciones ser&#225;n movidos, cu&#225;nto se les 
indemnizar&#225; por la p&#233;rdida de sus tierras, o cu&#225;les ser&#225;n sus condiciones de subsistencia en el 
futuro. Se afirma que todas las asambleas se han realizado en medio de serias irregularidades que 
han incluido el pago por el voto en favor del proyecto. A pesar de una medida cautelar, emitida 
por el Tribunal Agrario, estableciendo que no se podr&#225;n llevar a cabo m&#225;s asambleas en el 
distrito de Cacahuatepec, uno de los principales ejidos afectados, en tanto no se d&#233; una sentencia 
definitiva sobre la primera impugnaci&#243;n de la primera asamblea, los Gobiernos federal y estatal 
han seguido convocando a asambleas con el fin de imponer el proyecto. La informaci&#243;n recibida 
menciona tambi&#233;n que durante los &#250;ltimos meses de 2005 el conflicto entre las comunidades 
afectadas y las autoridades se ha agudizado. Se afirma que el 16 de diciembre de 2005,

<p>44. On 10 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with other special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council brought to the Government&#8217;s attention information received concerning 
Vitalii Kolibaba, previously held at the remand centre (IVS) in Chisinau central police station 
and at the time of sending the communication held at the remand centre (IVS) at 6 Tighina Street 
in Chisinau. According to the information received Vitalii Kolibaba was arrested at his home 
early on 21 April 2006 and taken to Buiucani district police station. On 25 April 2006, at 
Buiucani police station, three police officers tied his arms to his legs, stuck a crowbar under his 
elbows and hung him in this position from the crowbar for 40 minutes, beating him on the head 
and neck with a stool while he was suspended until he passed out from the pain. This was 
allegedly done to force him to confess to having injured a policeman, an act which he denies. 
After he was taken back to his cell, Vitalii Kolibaba tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrists. 
An ambulance was called and his wounds were stitched, but the medics left him in the police 
station. On 27 April Vitalii Kolibaba was allowed to see a lawyer for the first time since his 
arrest. He told the lawyer that he had been tortured, following which the lawyer filed a complaint 
with the prosecutor&#8217;s office. When the police officers from Buiucani district police station who 
had tortured him found out that he had complained, they beat him again. This time the three 
police officers beat him on the head with a plastic bottle full of water, so as to leave no marks, 
and punched him in the kidney area. His lawyer is allowed to meet him only in the presence of 
the procurator or of the police officers. On 29 April 2006, Vitalii Kolibaba was taken for a 
forensic medical examination. The examination was carried out superficially in the presence of 
the three officers who had tortured him. The forensic expert reported that there was no evidence 
of torture. Vitalii Kolibaba was taken to Buiucani district police station every day for 
questioning. There are no facilities for providing food at Buiucani district police station, which 
means that he was forced to beg food from other prisoners. In the remand centre where he was 
held prisoners are provided with hot water and bread, but this food is inedible. The utensils are 
filthy and the bread is of very poor quality. All prisoners rely on packages brought by relatives. 
As he is not allowed to receive packages from his mother he does not have access to adequate 
and sufficient food. The Special Rapporteur believes that these facts indicate a violation of the 
obligation to fulfil the right to food to prisoners who are unable to have access to food by their 
own means. Follow-up information reported that Vitalii Kolibaba was released on bail on 
15 May 2006 by the appeal court in Chisinau and that the Procuracy was intending to conduct 
investigations into the allegations of torture. </p>

<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>45. On 26 June 2006 the Government replied that following careful examination of the 
applications submitted by Mr. Kolibaba&#8217;s lawyer in accordance with article 274 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, the procurators of the Buiucani district procurator&#8217;s office concluded that 
the arguments put forward were irrelevant, and declined to initiate criminal proceedings on the 
grounds that no offence had been committed by the police officers. The facts as established by 
the procurators are as follows: Mr. Kolibaba came to the attention of the authorities in 2002, 
when he was registered as an opium user. On 18 April 2006, at around 2.30 a.m., while being 
pursued by the police for having committed an offence, Mr. Kolibaba, acting out of contempt for 
law enforcement officials and endeavouring to escape arrest, unexpectedly struck police officer 
Dmitrii Bobeico with a sharp object on his face and neck causing him moderate bodily harm. 
Mr. Kolibaba thereupon disappeared from the scene of the incident, without providing any 
medical assistance or calling an ambulance. On the basis of this evidence, on 26 April 2006, 
criminal proceedings were initiated against Mr. Kolibaba under article 350, paragraph 1, of the 
Criminal Code for an attempt on the life of a police officer. On 21 April 2006, Mr. Kolibaba was 
arrested for an administrative offence committed prior to the criminal offence mentioned above 
and appeared before a judge, who sentenced him to five days&#8217; administrative detention. 
Subsequently, during the criminal proceedings against him, Mr. Kolibaba was held in preventive 
detention and was released on bail on 15 May 2006. It should be noted that when Mr. Kolibaba 
was examined by doctors in the emergency department at the hospital, and subsequently by the 
court medical expert, no internal or external injuries were found apart from a cut on his right 
forearm, which he had himself inflicted with a piece of metal while he was being held in custody 
in order to mislead the procurator and avoid criminal prosecution. The Buiucani district 
procurator&#8217;s office submitted a report to the chief of police concerning the breach of conduct by 
the officers responsible, who had allowed Mr. Kolibaba to get hold of a piece of metal while he 
was being held in custody. In view of the foregoing, the Office of the Procurator-General 
considers that the circumstances and manner in which the injuries were sustained were correctly 
established by the procurators in the Buiucani district procurator&#8217;s office, in Chisinau. No 
evidence was found of the use of torture or ill-treatment against Mr. Kolibaba. Spreading reports 
in this way of alleged gross violations of the human rights and freedoms of the citizens of the 
Republic of Moldova when there is no substance to these allegations harms the image of the 
country and of its law enforcement authorities in their efforts to fight crime. At the same time, 
the increasingly frequent use of such methods by the parties concerned, before the criminal cases 
in question have been dealt with by the national authorities, is a cause of concern. It is a 
dishonourable means of promoting private or collective interests, which entails the evasion of 
criminal responsibility and the exertion of influence on legal authorities, involving them in futile 
exercises and diverting them from their core functions. In the light of the problem, the Office of 
the Procurator-General has submitted a report to the Bar Association so as to ensure that such 
conduct will not be tolerated in future.

<p>46. On 6 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar wrote about allegations that the authorities continue to use </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 32 
 
</p>
<p>food and agricultural policies as a method of political control, thereby affecting the livelihoods 
of the people concerned. In particular, he received reports of how these policies have affected 
rice production in Mong Nai township, Shan State. The reports received claimed that many 
farmers in Mong Nai township have been prohibited from selling their rice and bran to anyone 
other than the military at depressed prices (about one quarter of the normal market price) based 
on the acreage of land they customarily tended and regardless of actual crop yields. This system 
allegedly disrupted farmers&#8217; access to their own rice harvests and drove many into debt. Despite 
the announcement of the abolishment of this system, it was reported that new practices ensured 
that the military maintains its own stores of rice at the expense of the local population&#8217;s 
livelihoods. The allegations received also claimed that an extensive relocation programme aimed 
at fighting insurgency in Shan State had a negative impact in Mong Nai township. Reports 
estimate that two thirds of villages in the hills have been relocated to lowland areas to date, 
starting in 1996, and as a consequence mountain rice production has decreased by 80 per cent. 
These reports also claim that restrictions on freedom of movement have prevented farmers from 
returning to fields at any distance from Mong Nai, further limiting agricultural activity. 
Restrictions have reportedly also impeded trade across township borders. It is alleged that, 
following a national army directive abolishing central food supplies for all foot soldiers and 
instructing them to find local food sources, land confiscation by two Light Infantry Battalions 
based in Mong Nai increased. Reportedly, nearly 10,000 acres have been confiscated to date 
without any compensation. It appears that in order to grow their own fields, farmers must now 
rent the land from the military for 3.5 baskets of rice per acre. It was reported that initiatives to 
promote the double cropping of rice have been implemented by the township authorities of 
Mong Nai since 2003. In this context, it appears that 155 acres of the most prime paddy fields 
have been designated by the military for summer paddy production. Under orders from the 
district office, all village headmen in the town of Mong Nai must organize work crews to plant, 
maintain and harvest the crop for the benefit of the military. It was alleged that summer paddy 
crops disrupt the traditional wet season crop cycle, thus rendering further acreage useless. The 
Special Rapporteur believes that forced sale of crops at reduced prices, forced displacement of 
the population, forcible confiscation of land and forced labour contribute to the violation by the 
Government of its obligation to respect the right to food. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Government replied to this communication on 7 July 2006 indicating that there is no 
Mong Nai township but rather Mo Nae township in Shan State where the alleged facts did not 
occur and the farmers are free to sell their rice without any restrictions. According to the 
Government&#8217;s investigations there was no forced relocation and no land was confiscated in this 
township.

<p>48. On 8 March 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar brought to the attention of the Government information 
regarding plans to build or to participate in building five dams along the Salween River to 
provide electricity. The Salween River, which originates in the Himalayas, is the longest river on 
mainland South-East Asia that flows freely and uninterrupted by dams, playing a vitally 
important role in sustaining the livelihoods of various local ethnic groups. It appears that at least </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 33 
 
</p>
<p>13 different groups live in and derive their livelihood from the valleys and floodplain areas along 
the river and its tributaries. The most populous section of the river basin seems to be the fertile 
floodplain in the delta where most people tend paddy fields in the rainy season and vegetable 
gardens on the riverbank in the dry season. In addition, the Salween River Basin area is 
reportedly ecologically and culturally rich. Local communities living along the river fish all year 
round. There are reportedly an estimated 100 species of fish that migrate upstream and to the 
Salween&#8217;s tributaries for spawning. The information received claimed that construction of dams 
on the Salween River could have a negative impact on agricultural practices and on fish 
migration which, in turn, could undermine the access of families who depend on the river to their 
usual livelihood. It is claimed that the construction of dams could affect in particular 35 species 
important to the local economy as these fish are caught and sold at local markets. These species 
include Pla Moo, Pla Kod Kang, Pla Kae, Pla Vien and Pla Sa Ngae or Borbeo Feather Back. 
The Special Rapporteur believes that the negative impact of the planned construction of dams on 
the Salween on livelihoods, including fishing, could potentially violate the obligation of the 
Government to respect the right to food. 
</p>
<p>49. On 16 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar brought to the Government&#8217;s attention allegations that the 
authorities continue to use food and agricultural policies as a method of political control which 
have been affecting the livelihoods of the people concerned. In particular, since the end of 2005, 
these policies have affected rice procurement in various townships across Shan State. The reports 
received claim that, although the authorities no longer set up governmental rice purchasing 
centres at different locations every year following rice harvest, farmers are required to sell their 
rice at fixed quotas to certain teams of traders before they can sell the remainder elsewhere, 
should they have any rice left. It is reported that these traders pay prices that are lower than the 
market rate and the measuring equipment used varies according to whether rice is being bought 
from the farmers or sold to the authorities. For example, in Kaeng-Tung township farmers were 
allegedly required to sell 13 baskets of rice for each acre of land they cultivated at the rate of 
2,000 kyat per basket, whereas the market rate at that time was 3,500/4,000 kyat per basket. 
Reportedly, farmers who did not have enough rice to fill their quotas had to borrow or buy rice 
from other farmers and sell it to the traders. It is reported that failing to meet the quotas could 
result in land confiscation. In addition, it is claimed that during the rice procurement period, 
farmers who had not yet sold their full quota of rice to the traders were not allowed to sell or take 
the rice elsewhere. The information received indicates that similarly in Murng-Yawng township 
farmers were required to sell to the traders 13 baskets of rice for each acre of land they grew at 
1,100 kyat per basket whereas the market value at that time was 2,000 kyat per basket. Also in 
Murng-Khark township farmers were allegedly forced to sell seven baskets of rice for each acre 
of the land on which they had grown rice. They received payment of a mere 800 kyat per basket 
when the market price at that time was 3,500 kyat per basket. The allegations received also 
claim that in some places military troops themselves went to the villages and forcibly bought 
rice directly from the farmers at prices lower than the market rate. For example, farmers in 
Me Ken village tract in Murng-Ton township were allegedly forced to sell their rice to the troops 
of IB 277 at lower than the market price. It is reported that on 2 February 2006, a contingent of 
troops from Murng-Ton base IB 277 stationed at Me Ken village and headed by Major Mya Oo 
ordered farmers in the Me Ken village tract to sell them 200 baskets of rice. The military 
allegedly paid the farmers only 1,000 kyat per basket while the market price at that time was </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 34 
 
</p>
<p>2,500/3,000 kyat per basket. Similarly, in January 2006, farmers in Murng Naang and 
Murng Nawng village tracts in Kae-See township were allegedly required to sell overall 
400 baskets of their rice to the troops of IB 286 for 1,000 kyat per basket when the market price 
at that time was 2,500/3,000 kyat per basket. The information received also alleges that troops 
from IB 246 confiscated rice from farmers, asserting that they had to pay taxes for the land 
located on the slopes of a hill called Loi Kong, about one mile south of Kun-Hing town, where 
the farmers had grown their rice. The military reportedly designated the area as military property 
and as a result farmers were required to pay 30 per cent of their farm produce as taxes for using 
the land. The reports brought to the Special Rapporteurs&#8217; attention indicate that in 2005 farmers 
in Nawng Wawn village tract in Ho-Pong township were forced to buy a certain kind of rice 
grain known as &#8220;Shwe Pyi Aye&#8221; to be used as seeds and grown on their land. Allegedly, troops 
brought 80 baskets of this rice grain on a military truck and ordered farmers to buy them, 
claiming that the grain was of good quality and would provide a higher yield. Farmers claim that 
the rice grain was the same kind they had been requested to grow in previous years but with a 
new name. They were given strict instructions on how to grow it, including when to sow and 
plant. The Special Rapporteur believes that the policies of forced sale of rice at reduced prices, 
forced sale of rice grain, and forced collection of taxes for the use of land appear to violate the 
obligation to respect<b> </b>the right to food. 
</p>
<p>50. On 17 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar transmitted to the Government allegations that the right to 
food of people in northern Arakan State may be again at risk. The allegations claim that during 
the dry season forced labour for paddy cultivation in the military and NaSaKa fields, for brick 
baking, construction of roads and bridges, the transportation under guard of crops procured by 
compulsion, daily camp maintenance and portering continues at a time when farmers are busy 
with their own cultivation. This, combined with the high price of rice, may contribute to the 
increased food insecurity of villagers and could have the potential to trigger a new refugee 
outflow. During the 2005 monsoon season, increased forced labour, arbitrary taxation and high 
rice prices reportedly prompted a food crisis which was alleviated thanks to international 
emergency food relief. The reports brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteurs also claim 
that in January 2006 the authorities announced a new national project exhorting people 
throughout the country to grow physic nuts on a wide scale to produce an alternative to diesel 
fuel that could save money in foreign exchange in the wake of rising crude oil prices. The physic 
nut plant is a small tree often planted as fences to protect gardens or fields and can grow from 
seedlings or be propagated from cuttings. According to these reports, in northern Arakan State, 
authorities have started confiscating small plots of fertile land in every village tract in order to 
establish physic nut nurseries. Reportedly, villagers are made to provide cuttings for the 
nurseries or pay a fine. At the same time villagers have allegedly been forced to fence, plough 
and prepare the plot of land for the nurseries as well as to plant the cuttings, whereas others have 
been forced to water the seedlings, guard the nursery, repair the fence and report daily growth 
progress to the authorities. Further reports indicate that similarly, in other areas of the country 
such as Mudon and Thanbyuzayat townships, inhabitants were forced to plant physic nuts in 
May 2006. In addition the information indicates that some villagers, mainly from tribal 
communities, have already been facing food shortages in the border areas of Buthidaung 
township. According to this information, the tribal people in these areas did not receive 
permission from the local military authorities to cultivate rice on the hillsides early enough, </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 35 
 
</p>
<p>resulting in food shortages. In markets in Buthidaung township the price of rice has been 
increasing to a level which people cannot afford. Reports also indicate that hundreds of sacks of 
rice are being smuggled through the Bangladesh border and that the army authorities have 
prohibited the transport of rice from one township to another within Arakan State to control the 
price of rice and exact illegal taxes from rice traders. The information also alleges that farmers in 
northern Buthidaung township have been compelled to sell pulses to the Bagali Army camp at 
less than half the market price. Farmers usually grow pulses as a substitute crop to cope with rice 
shortages during the monsoon season. It is alleged that in March 2006, farmers were ordered to 
supply up to 80 kg of pulses each. Those with not enough pulses in reserve had to buy from other 
farmers or from the market at the full price. It also appears that many villagers were recruited as 
porters to collect the pulses from the farms, carry them to the local store, weigh them, carry the 
sacks to the riverbank and load them onto rafts for their transport to the army store in 
Buthidaung. The Special Rapporteur believes that the forced labour policies for various activities 
described above, which distract farmers from their occupation of tending the land, contribute to a 
violation of the obligation to respect the right to food. 
</p>
<p>51. On 19 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar transmitted to the Government allegations of confiscation 
of land in various parts of the country which was affecting the livelihoods of local communities 
and the realization of their right to food. According to these allegations, in northern Wekali, 
Thanphyzayart township, Mon State, the army has been confiscating rubber plantations 
belonging to the local people whose livelihoods have, as a result, been considerably affected. 
The information received also claims that more than 5,000 acres of paddy fields were confiscated 
by the local Pinma Arsenal Battalion from villagers of Thebyu, Myaukthabyepin, situated along 
the Pyinmana-Taungngyo highway, around 15 miles south-east of Taungdwingyi, 
Magwe Division, central Myanmar. It is reported that this battalion confiscated the paddy fields 
in order to have new army bases built. Similarly, 200 farmers from Hmawbi township, Rangoon 
Division, have reported that more than 2,000 acres of their farmlands have been confiscated. 
According to the reports received, 1,700 acres of paddy fields in Myaungtaka, Kankalay and 
Kalakone hamlets in Hmawbi township were confiscated by Master Major General Tin Hla 
without any compensation paid to the farmers. Reportedly, the land was confiscated to build a 
steel factory and parts of the land were subsequently sold to property developers. The Special 
Rapporteur is of the view that by continuing to confiscate land from farmers, authorities affect 
farmers&#8217; usual means of livelihood and the realization of their right to food. 
</p>
<p>52. On 30 August 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar wrote to the Government regarding further allegations of 
confiscation of land in various parts of the country, which affects the livelihoods of local 
communities and the realization of their right to food. According to these allegations, military 
authorities managing the cotton and textile factory in Meikhtila, Mandalay Division, have 
confiscated land from local residents with the complicity of local authorities. It was reported that 
the 40 households living on this land were ordered to move out by 25 August by the township 
chief administrator, Aung Myint. It appears that neither compensation nor new plots of land are 
foreseen for those evicted. There were claims that approximately 500 acres of agricultural land 
had been confiscated to make way for a new military camp near Myitkyina, Kachin State. It is 
reported that the camp, near Pa-La-Na village, approximately 16 km north of Myitkyina, plans to 
accommodate the newly formed Light Infantry Battalion 29. It appears that no compensation has </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
page 36 
 
</p>
<p>so far been paid following the confiscation. This information also claims that south of Myitkyina, 
a military unit, with the complicity with the authorities, has seized villagers&#8217; land in order to 
grow nuts and rubber, while villagers living along the road from Myitkyina to Sumpra Bum have 
reportedly been ordered to move out to make way for highway construction. A considerable 
number of farmers from several townships in Arakan State, including Kyauktaw, Mrauk U, 
Rathidaung, Buthidaung, Munbya, Ponna Kyunt, Ann and Tangup, have been forced to plough 
with their own cattle land confiscated by the army. Neither wages nor food has reportedly been 
provided by the military authorities. At a time when farmers are busy with their own cultivation, 
they are required to put aside their primary work to till army land, affecting their own livelihoods 
and access to sufficient and adequate food. The allegations received also indicate that yields were 
poor from the last cold-season harvest due to bad weather. As a result, the price of rice, the staple 
diet, has reportedly increased to unusual levels during the present rainy season. In addition, it is 
reported that, due to restrictions on the transportation of rice from one region to another and 
from rural to urban areas in some states, the sale of rice has slowed in rice-producing regions, 
such as Irrawaddy and Pegu Divisions, whilst consumers in other areas, such as Mandalay and 
Sagaing Divisions, face rice shortages and high prices. The Special Rapporteur finds that these 
facts represent violations of the obligation to respect the right to food, as authorities continue to 
confiscate land from farmers, thereby affecting their usual means of livelihood and the 
realization of their right to food. 
</p>
<p>53. On 12 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights in Myanmar drew the Government&#8217;s attention to further allegations of 
confiscation of land by military authorities in various parts of the country, including Kaeng-Ting, 
Mu-Se, Larng-Khur and Kun-Hing townships in Shan State, which contributes to depriving local 
communities of their livelihoods and the realization of their right to food and forces them to flee 
elsewhere. According to these allegations, land surrounding or in the vicinity of military bases is 
confiscated to ensure access for the troops to farm produce, wood, bamboo, firewood, etc., or 
merely for security reasons. It also appears that large areas of land continue to be confiscated for 
various State-run projects such as coal and mineral mines, road construction, rubber and physic 
nut plantations, etc. The information received also indicates grave violations of the right to food 
of IDPs in the eastern part of the country where over the past year most families had part or all of 
their food supply, including fields, rice and livestock, taken or destroyed by the military in an 
attempt to force villagers out of the hills and into areas and villages under the control of the 
military. The information received alleges that farmers&#8217; livelihoods in Saku township, 
Magwe Division, are at risk following the military order that they must harvest their crops before 
they prepare to grow monsoon rice. This will reportedly ruin the crops. In addition, the reports 
received indicate that the authorities have harassed and brought complaints against farmers who 
have complained about the impositions and the negative impact on their crops and livelihoods of 
State development projects. These reports claim, for example, that on 8 July 2006 local 
administration officials together with some workers destroyed irrigation embankments works in 
Set-hsan village, Bogalay tract, that had been in use since 1995. This reportedly resulted in the 
flooding of 86 acres of rainy-season paddy crops out of a total of 463 acres being cultivated by 
13 farmers. It was reported that on 30 June 2006 the fisheries department ordered the demolition 
of embankments to make use of the water for fisheries, where it would not cause damage to the 
paddy crops but without consulting the farmers concerned. According to the reports received, 
on 31 July 2006 farmer Ko Tin Aung, on behalf of himself and 12 other farmers, submitted </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 37 
 
</p>
<p>letters of complaint to the agriculture and fisheries departments. It is also reported that after 
Ko Tin Aung had repaired the embankments on his land and replanted the 30 acres which had 
been flooded due to the destruction, a team of officials took photographs and threatened to take 
him to court for submitting the complaint. Similarly, it is alleged that U Tin Kyi, a 65-year-old 
villager in Kyaung Gone township, was arrested for insulting officials who had been sent on 
10 April 2006 by the chairman of the Kyaungsu village area council to clear land to implement 
the castor oil agricultural policy. The Special Rapporteur believes that by continuing to 
confiscate land from farmers and destroying their crops and livestock, authorities continue to 
affect farmers&#8217; usual means of livelihood and the realization of their right to food.

<p>54. On 5 April 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning allegations 
of threats to evict several families from their land in San Andres, Quezon, thus depriving family 
members of their usual access to livelihoods. According to the information received, San Andres 
is a town on the Bondoc Peninsula, where vast tracts of land extending to the municipality of 
San Narciso are owned by the Uy family. In 1995 and 1996, parcels of the land were distributed 
under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP) to San Andres farmers. The 
allegations received claim that several families are being threatened with eviction from the land 
that they thus acquired. Marcela Mu&#241;oz, her husband, Juanito Mu&#241;oz, Sr., and their children are 
agrarian reform beneficiaries in Barangay Camflora, San Andres. Since 1971, brothers 
Juanito Mu&#241;oz and Osias Mu&#241;oz, along with their families, have been cultivating parcels of land 
previously owned by Manuel Uy Ek Liong, Sr. The Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) had 
declared that land to be covered by CARP. As a result, certificates of land ownership and 
transfer certificates of title were awarded to the Mu&#241;oz families. On 30 March 2003 an 
unidentified surveyor claiming that he was from the Department of Environment and Natural 
Resources surveyed the parcels of land belonging to Marcela Mu&#241;oz and her relatives. The 
survey allegedly revealed that the parcels were outside the boundaries of the property awarded to 
them by DAR. The Uy family apparently also claims that the farmers conspired to steal coconuts 
from the coconut plantation allegedly owned by the family. A series of charges have been filed 
against the Mu&#241;oz families by the Uy family. Charges of qualified theft have also been 
reportedly filed against the farmers and similar charges are filed every time they harvest 
coconuts from the coconut plantation whose ownership is claimed by the Uy family. Although 
the farmers are not currently being detained, as they have posted bail, some of these farmers 
have previously been arrested and detained. Their case files are reportedly still pending at the 
Regional Trial Court Branch 61 and 62 in Gumaca, Quezon. The Special Rapporteur believes 
that the Government may have violated its obligation to protect the right to food in this case as 
the relevant authorities have failed to adequately protect the Mu&#241;oz family from threats and 
harassment by third parties with the purpose of depriving them of their access to land to which 
they are officially entitled, and to their usual means of livelihood. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>55. On 31 May 2006 the Government replied that surveys were conducted again in 2006 by the 
authorities and the results showed that the contested land is within the boundaries of the property 
of the Uy family. The charges against the farmers for theft were still pending in court. </p>

<p>56. On 8 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning allegations of 
threats to the right to food of the people of the island of Rapu-Rapu, situated in Albay Province. 
The island of Rapu-Rapu has a total land area of 5,589 hectares. It reportedly has very rich 
fishing grounds and fishing is the primary source of livelihood for its inhabitants. According to 
the information received, mining has been carried out on Rapu-Rapu since the Second World 
War when the Japanese Imperial Army mined in Barangay village, Sta. Barbara. Republic Act 
No. 7942, also known as the Mining Act, adopted in 1995, reportedly opened up all public and 
private land to mining operations. It appears that this legislation also provides economic 
incentives and rights to foreign as well as national mining corporations, to the detriment of the 
local population. In addition, it is reported that the Mining Act encourages open-pit mining, 
which is allegedly more damaging to the environment than any other form of mining operation. 
The allegations received claim that in 1998 Lafayette Philippines Incorporated (LPI), a 
subsidiary of the Lafayette Mining Company of Australia, entered the area after its 
multimillion-dollar Polymetallic Project was approved on 18 November 1998. The project 
expects to yield around 50,000 ounces of gold, 60,000 ounces of silver, 10,000 metric tons of 
copper concentrate and 14,000 metric tons of zinc concentrate per year. The project was also 
reportedly granted an Environmental Compliance Certificate on 12 July 2001, which indicated 
that the project would not have an unacceptable environmental impact. LPI mining operations 
allegedly pose a threat to the right to food of the inhabitants of Rapu-Rapu and the island&#8217;s 
fragile ecosystem has also been affected. In October 2005, two tailing spills allegedly 
contaminated with cyanide, caused by heavy rains, occurred at the LPI mine. The spills allegedly 
reached the sea, resulting in the death of fish and other marine life in the affected areas. It is 
alleged that fish catches declined drastically after the spill, affecting the livelihoods of the local 
population. Many people reportedly refused to buy fish caught in Rapu-Rapu for fear of 
contamination, affecting the local economy and the ability of local people to buy food. It appears 
that the livelihoods of the local population in adjacent towns in the provinces of Albay and 
Sorsogon, mostly poor fisher families, have also been affected. It is reported that in response to 
the spills the Department of Environment and Natural Resources temporarily suspended the LPI 
mining operations and fined the company. Reports indicate, however, that LPI has continued its 
operations. The Special Rapporteur believes that the Government may have violated its 
obligation to protect the right to food in this case, as the relevant authorities have failed to 
protect the inhabitants of Rapu-Rapu adequately from the threats to which they have allegedly 
been subjected by a third party, the LPI mining project, which have resulted in depriving them of 
their usual means of livelihood. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>57. On 20 July 2006 the Government responded with some clarifications on issues related to 
the Mining Act and its provisions. The Government also informed the Special Rapporteur that 
with regard to the tailing spill incidents, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
(DENR) has made every effort to assure the affected people that there was no cyanide or 
mercury contamination of the marine waters in the area. In addition, a series of investigations 
conducted by DENR immediately after the incident led to the temporary suspension of LPI 
operations and to a fine of PHP 10.4 million as well as to the institution of remedial measures to 
prevent similar incidents in the future. The President has created the Rapu-Rapu Fact-Finding </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 39 
 
</p>
<p>Commission to investigate the effects of LPI mining operations on people&#8217;s health and on 
environmental safety. The Government also presented information on some recent 
developments, including the decision to approve the start of a 30-day test run of the LPI 
base metal plant at the Rapu-Rapu mine. The decision was based on the validation reports of 
DENR regional offices, the Multipartite Monitoring Team, the Mine Rehabilitation Fund 
Committee, the recommendations of third-party experts and the endorsement of local 
government and host communities. The Government&#8217;s reply also contained the DENR plan of 
action, a list of measures aimed at improving DENR monitoring and regulatory functions and at 
resolving pending issues vis-&#224;-vis the report of the Rapu-Rapu Fact-Finding Commission. 
</p>
<p><b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur warmly welcomes the comprehensive information sent by the 
Government. He replied on 23 October 2006, stating that, with regard to the presence of toxic 
substances in the water following the tailing spill incident, the reports received, including that of 
the Fact-Finding Commission on the Mining Operations in Rapu-Rapu Island of 19 May 2006, 
indicate that, due to lack of adequate capability to fully analyse the presence of toxic heavy 
metals, the tests have been inconclusive. This means that the presence of toxic substances and 
their effects on the marine system may become fully apparent only at a later stage. According to 
these reports, different studies have shown the presence of toxic heavy metals in the soil, water 
and sediment samples. It has also been reported that on 18 July 2006, fish deaths occurred in 
Mirikpitik Creek, leading out of the mine. It appears that lower stretches of the creek were found 
to be affected by acid mine drainage and the water to be acidic, with the presence of yellow solid 
precipitate. Concerning the alleged benefits of the LPI mining project to the host communities, 
the information that the Special Rapporteur continues to receive claims that, from 2000 to 2005, 
this project mobilized a workforce of 948 persons of whom only 32 per cent came from 
Rapu-Rapu. In addition, so far there have been no indications of increased demand for and 
supply of local goods and services in Rapu-Rapu. It appears that the mining facility is a 
self-contained facility to which goods and services are provided from the outside through 
contractors and suppliers. The total expected benefits to the island over seven years would be 
around PHP 176.6 million. This represents a total theoretical per capita benefit of PHP 2 per day, 
which appears insufficient to compensate for the permanent loss of resources and its effects on 
people&#8217;s livelihoods. It is reported that the inhabitants of Rapu-Rapu rely mainly on fishing and 
farming for their livelihoods and sources of income. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
details that the Government provided about the measures that DENR intends to adopt in order to 
improve its monitoring and regulatory functions and to resolve outstanding issues. In particular, 
he was pleased to note the important plan to conduct a feasibility study for the creation of a 
People&#8217;s Health and Environmental Protection Fund in every region, mandated to offer 
compensation for damage to health and livelihood brought about by tailing spills and other 
mine-related incidents. The Special Rapporteur hopes that such a fund can be established 
speedily so that victims can receive compensation for the losses they have suffered. The Special 
Rapporteur would be most grateful if the Government could keep him informed about 
developments to implement this and the other action points. </p>

<p>59. On 27 September 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government regarding 
allegations that union members on strike at Chong Won Fashion, Inc. in Rosario, Cavite, were 
being denied access to food. According to these allegations, the police of the Philippine 
Economic Zone Authority and Jantro security guards had set up checkpoints to isolate the picket 
line, thus preventing the entry of food and water. It appears that more than 70 union members 
were on the picket line. The police reportedly blocked the road leading to the picket line and 
striking workers who left the picket line to get food were prevented from going back. The police 
and guards also allegedly seized some of the identification passes of the striking workers in order 
to deny them entry into the area. It was reported that these actions followed attempts to violently 
disperse the workers on 25 and 27 September 2006 when at least 10 workers were injured. 
<b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>60. On 11 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur sent a follow-up communication on this case 
as, according to the information received, the food blockade remained in effect despite an 
agreement between the strikers, the company management and the officials of the Cavite Export 
Processing Zone to allow workers on strike to leave and return to the picket line in order to 
replenish their stocks of food and other supplies, and provided they had ID and zone passes. This 
agreement was reportedly not being implemented by the police and security guards who had 
previously withheld the IDs of the striking workers. The new information received also claimed 
that in the evening of 28 September eight workers, namely Gemma Lape, Lorna Reli, 
Ivy Villasan, Ana Lou Estrimos, Glaysa Layesi, Josephine Bahar, Pablito Sapata and 
Rodelito Amo, who had been supporting those on strike, were arrested and detained for 
facilitating entry of food supplies to the picket line. A sack of rice was allegedly confiscated 
from them. It was reported that on 29 September they were charged with trespass and sedition 
and whilst in detention at the Rosario Municipal Police Station for around eight days they were 
not provided with sufficient food, medicines or access to legal representation. According to 
additional reports, on 5 October 2006 security forces confiscated a donation of food which one 
of the workers hired by the management to replace the strikers had tried to bring in for those on 
strike. The Special Rapporteur believes that these facts indicate a violation of the obligation to 
respect the right to food and water, as the police had taken action that interfered with the striking 
workers&#8217; access to food and water.

<p>62. On 10 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning 
allegations of deliberate destruction of land, homes, communities and community structures, as 
well as the disruption of all means of sustaining livelihoods and procuring basic necessities of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 41 
 
</p>
<p>the civilian population of Darfur, and in particular of the African tribes, in and around Furawiya 
(North Darfur), Terbeba and Bendisi villages (West Darfur). These allegations indicated that the 
attacks were carried out as part of a plan to permanently expel the African tribes of Darfur from 
their homes. The allegations claim that over a period of almost two years (2004-2006) army and 
Janjaweed forces repeatedly swept into the above-mentioned villages and neighbouring ones 
early in the morning and either stole or killed thousands of camels, horses, cattle, donkeys, 
sheep, goats and chickens. The attackers also stole thousands of sacks of sorghum, millet, ground 
nuts and other food stocks, torched prime farmland, burned the villagers&#8217; compounds and looted 
personal documents, household items and basic farming and other agricultural equipment 
including hoes and flour mills. It was alleged that many villagers died during the attacks and 
many died afterwards of starvation, disease and exposure as people were forced to flee into 
inhospitable terrain. These attacks were part of a systematic attempt to subvert or dismantle the 
traditional land tenure system, known as the <i>hakura</i>, in order to destroy the livelihoods of 
villagers of Darfur. The <i>hakura</i> has reportedly long enabled villagers to have a stable and 
guaranteed livelihood. Livestock, the other primary source and measure of wealth in these 
villages, were also attacked and stolen. Villagers who were able to escape with some of their 
livestock often died of hunger, thirst or attack by Janjaweed during their flight. Local markets in 
Darfur were reportedly flooded with stolen animals being sold by the Janjaweed. Given the long 
dry season and the paucity of rainfall in much of the Darfur region, ensuring adequate access to 
water has long been an essential component of livelihood strategies. According to allegations 
received, aerial bombardments in Furawija targeted the wells and livestock gathered around 
them. Some wells were poisoned in Bendisi and Furawija. Community life in villages in Darfur 
revolves around the market, which serves as the economic engine of the local economy, whereas 
the mosque is the spiritual centre of village life. Reports indicated that markets and mosques in 
Furawiya and Terbeba were sacked, looted and burned by attacking forces. Food stocks, 
normally stored to ensure an adequate supply of grains, nuts and other produce throughout the 
year, were also looted. The dispersal of villagers and family members throughout different 
camps following the attacks resulted in the collapse of community networks and the traditional 
system of proving ownership, which is directly linked to securing livelihoods. Many of the 
village tribal leaders were killed or were replaced by other people elected to take their place 
within the camps. Moreover, there were numerous reports of incidents where humanitarian aid 
was obstructed, trucks carrying humanitarian supplies were attacked and humanitarian workers 
were harassed and at times themselves attacked. These incidents created a climate of fear and 
impunity which added to the life-threatening lack of food security suffered by a large part of the 
population. The Special Rapporteur believes that the destruction of land, homes, and community 
infrastructure and the disruption of means of sustaining livelihoods, including livestock and land, 
contribute to a violation of the Government&#8217;s obligation to respect the right to food, as these 
actions deprived villagers of their usual access to food. 
</p>
<p>63. On 5 July 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with other special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council wrote to the Government concerning reports that on 22 April 2006 
villagers gathered in Amri school in Marawi to discuss how the building of a dam in the area had 
affected their livelihood. At 11 a.m., while the villagers were having breakfast in the school yard, 
security forces armed with machine guns and heavy artillery fired into the crowd, killing 3 men 
and injuring over 50 persons. The persons killed were Atta Al Sayed Al Khidir Al Mahi, 
aged 30, a farmer from Abu Haraze Village; Yassin Mohamed Al Khair, aged 20, a farmer </p>

</p>
<p>from Al Sor village; and Salah Al Faky Al Kheder, aged 27, a farmer from Alsweage village. 
Moreover, following the attack, the security officers arrested and detained three of the villagers, 
charging them with waging war against the State, criminal mischief and assault. It is reported 
that the incident is related to the construction of a dam that has resulted in the displacement of 
thousands of people living along the riverbanks. Among the groups reportedly affected are the 
Amri people, who have been in negotiation with the Government for the past two years 
regarding resettlement sites. It is further reported that the dam project was carried out with no 
prior consultation with the communities, and that no provisions for compensation have been 
made for the loss of houses and livelihoods. The Government is reportedly insisting that the 
Amri people be relocated to Bayouda desert, which they refuse.

<p>64. On 18 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning 
allegations that the companies Alstom Schweiz, Va Tech Schweiz, Stucki and Colenco have 
submitted an application to the relevant authorities for an export credit guarantee of &#8364;100 million 
for the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the River Tigris, in south-eastern Turkey. An 
international consortium led by the Austrian enterprise Andritz is responsible for carrying out the 
construction of the dam (see above). The information received claims that in November 2005 the 
consortium submitted a revised environmental impact assessment and a new resettlement plan. 
Nevertheless, it appears that the dam could displace between 50,000 and 80,000 people, mostly 
Kurds, affecting their human rights, including the right to food, and the environment. According 
to this information, the region has a large number of IDPs and has been affected by widespread 
marginalization. Many families are already reported to lack access to food, clean and accessible 
water, sanitation and housing. The Special Rapporteur believes that the alleged facts could lead 
to a violation of the obligation to cooperate in respecting the right to food and water of the 
people who could be displaced by the dam if the authorities examining the export credit 
guarantee application do not cooperate with the Turkish authorities in providing appropriate 
safeguards to ensure that the displacement of the people concerned does not interfere with their 
livelihoods and access to sufficient and adequate food. 
</p>
<p><b>Communication received 
</b></p>
<p>65. On 1 December 2006<b> </b>the Government replied, stating that the three export risk guarantee 
offices have reviewed the environmental impact assessment reports and action plans submitted 
by the exporters and the buyer and have assessed the project against the OECD Recommendation 
on Common Approaches on Environment and Officially Supported Export Credits and the 
World Bank procedures and operational policies regarding environment, natural habitats, 
physical cultural resources, involuntary resettlement, safety of dams and international 
waterways. In addition, the export credit agencies have regularly insisted on those mitigation 
measures planned for quality of water, income restoration and forced resettlement that comply 
with the above-mentioned World Bank standards and guidelines. The Government stated that 
this project, if realized in the appropriate framework, will make a valuable contribution to 
employment in the three exporting countries as well as to economic and social development in </p>

conditions for meeting the World Bank standards are substantially fulfilled. The Government 
asserted that the participatory approach, the joint efforts of export credit agencies and the 
Turkish buyer, and the broad and deep mitigation measures planned for this project meet the

<p>66. On 11 October 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Government concerning 
allegations that the plan for constructing the Ilisu Dam on the River Tigris, 65 km upstream of 
the border with the Syrian Arab Republic and part of the South-East Anatolia Regional 
Development Project, could displace between 50,000 and 80,000 people, mostly Kurds, affecting 
their human rights, including the right to food, and the environment. According to these 
allegations, the region has a large number of IDPs and has been affected by widespread 
marginalization. Many families are already reported to lack access to food, clean and accessible 
water, sanitation and housing. The information received claims that, for example, in the town of 
Batman, emergency food parcels are given out regularly to ensure access to food. These parcels 
are reportedly private donations as local authorities do not receive sufficient resources from the 
central Government to provide the required support to IDPs. The influx of people displaced by 
the construction of the dam could exacerbate this situation. The allegations claim that the 
unemployment rate in this region stands at 50 per cent or higher in all major cities and that 
agrarian reform measures have not been adequately implemented in order to allow poor people 
access to productive resources. It appears that almost 80 per cent of the population live on small 
plots of land, which only allow them to feed themselves, or have no land at all. The land is 
reportedly largely owned by agas (landlords) who would be the main beneficiaries of the 
compensation for land expropriation to be paid as part of the dam project. The information 
received also indicates that those families that rely on the river for fishing may lose physical 
access to food, either through eviction from their homes or expected massive fish deaths from 
the expected deterioration of the water quality in the reservoir as a result of the construction of 
the dam. Despite the opposition of the affected population to the project and the withdrawal from 
the project of the international consortium in 2002, in 2004 a new agreement for the construction 
of the dam was reached with the Austrian company VA Tech, Alstom Switzerland and the 
German company Zublin. VA Tech in the meantime has been taken over by Andritz. It appears 
that applications for export credit guarantees have been filed with the Governments of Austria, 
Germany and Switzerland in order to reduce the financial and political risk associated with the 
project. It was also reported that on 5 August 2006 a ground-breaking ceremony was held to 
demonstrate determination to proceed with and support for the project. The Special Rapporteur 
believes that these facts could lead to a violation of the obligation to respect<b> </b>the right to food and 
water if the relevant authorities, central and local, do not take appropriate measures to prevent 
the displacement of thousands of people without adequate resettlement and compensation plans, 
thus interfering with their livelihoods and access to sufficient and adequate food. </p>

<p>67. On 28 February 2006 the Special Rapporteur together with the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people wrote to the 
Government concerning allegations which suggested that the lands of the indigenous peoples of 
Northern California, including the Pit River Tribe, and the indigenous peoples of Alaska, 
particularly the Yupik community of Gambell, St. Lawrence Island, have been polluted to such 
an extent that fishing, the traditional means of securing food and a livelihood for these 
communities, was being threatened. The reports claimed that abandoned gold and mercury 
mines, coupled with gold-mining activity, have polluted rivers and waterways, lakes and streams 
in Northern California with an estimated 3 to 8 million pounds of mercury released into the 
environment. The toxic substances have allegedly entered the food chain and are affecting the 
health of the Pit River and many other Northern California tribes. In addition, the impact on the 
traditional practice of fishing as a means of survival for the Pit River Tribe has also had negative 
consequences on the tribe&#8217;s livelihood, culture and identity. Fish is not only an important staple 
in the traditional diet of many California native peoples, it is also connected historically, 
spiritually and culturally to the identity of these peoples. It is claimed that the affected tribal 
communities have not had access to information related to the negative effects of mercury and 
about how to address health risks. Industrial mining and oil corporations have also contaminated 
the traditional lands, waters and food of the indigenous peoples of Alaska. As a result, their 
health has reportedly been affected by chemicals that have contaminated traditional sources of 
food such as fish, marine mammals and waterfowl. For example, the rate of hospitalization of 
indigenous children in the Yukon River delta for respiratory infections in their first year is 
reportedly 10 times the national average and the occurrence of cancer among indigenous peoples 
in Alaska has been rising at a rate that is 30 per cent higher than for other communities. The 
reports received claim that the Government&#8217;s response to some of these concerns has to date 
been inadequate. The Special Rapporteur believes that the contamination of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
land and water affecting their livelihood (traditional fishing) may contribute to a violation of the 
Government&#8217;s obligation to respect the right to food.

he had received reports indicating that provisional cash compensation for loss of rice fields and 
common property resources, such as fisheries, vegetable gardens, fruit trees, access to bamboo 
forests and non-timber forest products, paid to the villagers along the upper part of the

rice shortages in some families. The reports also indicate that although some villagers used to 
practise double cropping on their rice fields, they were compensated for the lost production value 
of only one crop. He also raised the issue of the Nakai Plateau resettlement which reportedly 
started at the beginning of the rainy season before the new infrastructure was in place, which 
may result in impeded access to the transitional villages during the rainy season making food and 
water deliveries difficult. In addition, he sought information about whether the villagers of 
Nakai Plateau will be able to keep their buffalo when they are resettled due to a shortage of land 
and forage, and whether they will be able to grow rice in their new plots. If villagers have to 
switch from rice cultivation to planting vegetables during the dry season, there should be markets 
for their produce. The reports claim that there are no markets nearby and that the transportation 
costs at the moment are too high for the villagers to transport the goods themselves. Additional 
market options seem to be neighbouring Thailand and Viet Nam, but the tariffs on vegetables 
and increased competition reportedly make these difficult. Finally, he expressed concern over the

<p>70. On 19 October 2006, following the approval on 31 January 2006 of loans for 
US$ 125 million by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for Newmont&#8217;s Afaho South 
gold-mining project in Ghana, the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Bank to express concern over 
the negative impact of this project on people&#8217;s right to food and access to livelihoods. Because of 
delays in the implementation of a land replacement programme, many farmers have been 
displaced as a result of the project and have missed this year&#8217;s main planting season. This has 
created food insecurity because of a shortage of cropland and social tensions in the affected 
communities. Newmont&#8217;s approach to the land issue fails to provide affected farmers with a 
long-term solution for the loss of arable land and livelihoods, offering instead only assistance to 
secure farmers&#8217; access to two acres of land for a period of two years. In addition, it appears that 
alternative livelihoods programmes have not so far been successful as no market studies were 
carried out and no credit is available for those who want to engage in alternative forms of 
employment. These reports also claim that the &#8220;vulnerable programme&#8221; in place since May 2006 
and aimed at providing targeted short-term support to the neediest for food security and health 
care has not been able to cover the income shortfalls of all those people whose livelihoods have 
not been restored to their pre-project level. It is also reported that the project has not so far 
created sufficient formal sector employment opportunities and has not brought perceptible 
benefits to the communities in the project area. During the construction phase, not only have 
people been displaced and lost their usual access to their livelihoods and their food security, but 
the local population has also suffered from reduced water quality and supply. When the Bank 
was considering the IFC progress report on this project and reviewing IFC compliance with the 
conditions identified by the Board at the time of approval, as well as with IFC operational 
policies, the Special Rapporteur urged that the IFC ensure that livelihoods are, at a minimum, 
restored to their pre-project levels as soon as possible and in a sustainable manner, and that an 
independent, external and participatory system is put in place to monitor the impact of this 
project on the affected communities. 
</p><p>71. On 27 October 2006, following the examination by the Inspection Panel of the alleged 
negative impact of the Left Bank Out-fall Drain (LBOD) project in Pakistan that was financed by 
the Bank and other financial institutions, the Special Rapporteur raised his concern over 
allegations that the faulty design of this project has brought devastation and loss of life and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/4/30/Add.1 
  page 47 
 
</p>
<p>livelihood to the nearby communities. According to allegations he received, whilst the LBOD 
system supported agricultural productivity, this system, combined with the partial destruction of 
the Tidal Link (the 26-mile-long and 92-foot-wide drainage canal that connects the system to the 
sea, cutting through the dhands (wetlands)), has heightened the risks to local people from 
flooding which seems to become particularly bad when heavy rainfall inland and high tides and 
storms at sea coincide. It is also reported that increased salinity due to the project has affected 
large tracts of agricultural lands and that the Tidal Link failure has led to major harm to the 
dhands ecosystem and fisheries upon which many people depend for their livelihood and access 
to food. People in these areas reportedly also face problems of drinking water, and have lost 
grazing lands. The reports received indicate that the project has induced displacement of people 
who had to leave the area because of loss of livelihoods and usual access to food due to 
increased salinity of the groundwater following the intrusion of seawater and the increased 
effluent brought by the LBOD. It appears that in some villages the land has become so barren 
that villagers can no longer plant anything of value and are forced to find alternative sources of 
income, including making charcoal from brush. In addition, it appears that the water in many 
villages is no longer fit to drink or grow crops and villagers have to walk several kilometres to 
find safe drinking water. According to these reports, a drastic decline in fish species and number 
has also been attributed to the failure of the Tidal Link and the intrusion of seawater much 
further inland.

<p>73. On 8 May 2006 the Special Rapporteur wrote to the Coca Cola Company about allegations 
of threats to access to water in some of the areas where the company has been operating, thus 
exacerbating water shortages in regions that already suffer from lack of water resources and 
rainfall and having a negative impact on the right to food of farmers and local communities. The 
allegations received indicate that Coca Cola&#8217;s operations rely on access to vast supplies of water, 
not only for the beverage itself but also for industrial cleaning and other purposes. In order to 
meet its operating needs for water, the company is allegedly exploiting aquifers which can hold 
water resources collected over many hundreds of years by communities around the world. The 
information received claims that, for example, Coca Cola&#8217;s arrival in the village of Kaladera in 
Rajasthan, India, in 1999 exacerbated an already precarious water situation as water levels 
allegedly fell dramatically once the plant began operating. This has allegedly left local farmers 
unable to irrigate their lands and sustain their crops, putting whole families at risk of losing their 
livelihoods. Rajasthan is well known as a desert state, and Kaladera is a small, impoverished 
village with semi-arid conditions. Farmers reportedly rely on groundwater for the cultivation of 
their crops. The rainwater-harvesting projects that the company has established in Kaladera 
appear to be insufficient or non-functioning. The allegations received also report that the 
company&#8217;s exploitation of water resources near Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, India, has taken a 
heavy toll on the local villagers&#8217; harvests and led to the drying up of wells. In addition, farmers 
in Varanasi have protested against having toxic sludge-like waste, which Coca Cola plants 
reportedly produce as a by-product, given out as &#8220;fertilizer&#8221; and dumped on their land, although 
the company maintains that this sludge is non-hazardous. In Plachimada, Kerala, India, 
contamination from this sludge-like waste allegedly spread to the water supply, with levels of 
lead recorded that are above those permitted by international standards.

wherein the company affirmed its genuine commitment to preserving the environment and 
promoting the economic and social development of local communities. It also stated that it has 
worked to reducing the amount of water used for its beverages and with local communities to

<p><b>Follow-up 
</b></p>
<p>75. On 20 November 2006 the Special Rapporteur, whilst welcoming the company&#8217;s reply, 
responded that further information received indicates that, for example, in the State of 
Tamil Nadu, India, the company management has made an arrangement with the sugar factory </p>

</p>
<p>Sakthi Sugars Limited whereby the Coca Cola Company can use the water of the Vagai River in 
the future. In addition, this information claims that the Coca Cola Company has started using the 
water of the Tamirabarani River, which is already scarce, thereby affecting the supply of 
drinking and irrigation water to surrounding villages. The Special Rapporteur also expressed his 
concern about reports alleging that soft drinks produced in India by Coca Cola and other 
companies contain pesticide residues at a higher level than permitted by the national standards. 
The Special Rapporteur also asked for additional details on the projects to restore aquifers 
through rainwater harvesting, including any assessment of the benefits they have brought to the 
local communities, which the company claims to have been carrying out with those 
communities.
