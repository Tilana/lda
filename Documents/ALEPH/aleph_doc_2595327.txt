EMERGE ENERGY SERVICES LP
WARRANT TO PURCHASE COMMON UNITS
Warrant No.: W-1
Date of Issuance: August 15, 2016, (“Issuance Date”)
Emerge Energy Services LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), hereby certifies that, for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, SIG Strategic Investments,
LLLP, the registered holder hereof or its permitted assigns (the “Holder”), is entitled, subject to the terms set forth
below, to purchase from the Partnership, at the Exercise Price (as defined below) then in effect, upon exercise of this
Warrant to Purchase Common Units (including any Warrants to Purchase Common Units issued in exchange, transfer
or replacement hereof, the “Warrant”), at any time or times on or after the Issuance Date, but not after 11:59 p.m.,
New York time, on the Expiration Date (as defined below), 887,099   (subject to adjustment as provided herein) fully
paid and non-assessable Common Units (as defined below) (the “Warrant Units”).  Except as otherwise defined
herein, capitalized terms in this Warrant shall have the meanings set forth in Section 17.  This Warrant is one of the
Warrants to Purchase Common Units (the “SPA Warrants”) issued pursuant to Section 1 of that certain Securities
Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 8, 2016 (the “Subscription Date”), by and among the Partnership and the
investors (the “Buyers”) referred to therein, as amended from time to time (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”).
1.                                      EXERCISE OF WARRANT.
(a)                                 Mechanics of Exercise.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof (including,
without limitation, the limitations set forth in Section 1(f)), this Warrant may be exercised by the
Holder on any day on or after the Issuance Date (an “Exercise Date”), in whole or in part, by
delivery (whether via facsimile or otherwise) of a written notice, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A (the “Exercise Notice”), of the Holder’s election to exercise this Warrant.  Within one
(1) Trading Day following an exercise of this Warrant as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver
payment to the Partnership of an amount equal to the Exercise Price in effect on the date of such
exercise multiplied by the number of Warrant Units as to which this Warrant was so exercised
(the “Aggregate Exercise Price”) in cash or via wire transfer of immediately available funds if
the Holder did not notify the Partnership in such Exercise Notice that such exercise was made
pursuant to a Cashless Exercise (as defined in Section 1(d)).  The Holder shall not be required to
deliver the original of this Warrant in order to effect an exercise hereunder.  Execution and
delivery of an Exercise Notice with respect to less than all of the Warrant Units shall have the
same effect as cancellation of the original of this Warrant and issuance of a new Warrant
evidencing the right to purchase the remaining number of Warrant Units.  Execution and delivery
of an Exercise Notice for all of the then-remaining Warrant Units shall have the same effect as
cancellation of the original of this Warrant after delivery of the Warrant Units in accordance with
the terms hereof.  On or before the first (1st) Trading Day following the date on which the
Partnership has received an Exercise Notice, the Partnership shall transmit by facsimile or
electronic mail an acknowledgment of confirmation of receipt of such Exercise Notice, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B, to the Holder and the Partnership’s transfer agent (the “Transfer
Agent”), which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer Agent to process such
Exercise Notice in accordance with the terms herein. On or before the third (3rd) Trading Day
following the date on which the Partnership has received such Exercise Notice (or such earlier
date as required pursuant to the 1934 Act or other applicable law, rule or regulation for the
settlement of a trade of such Warrant Units initiated on the applicable Exercise Date), the
Partnership shall (X) provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in The Depository Trust
Company (“DTC”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder,
credit such aggregate number of Common Units to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such
exercise to the Holder’s or its designee’s balance account with DTC through its
Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (Y) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the
DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, upon the request of the Holder, issue and
deliver (via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in the Exercise Notice, a
certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Common Units
to which the Holder shall be entitled pursuant to such exercise.  Upon delivery of an Exercise
Notice, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of
record of the Warrant Units with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of
the date such Warrant Units are credited to the Holder’s DTC account or the date of delivery of
the certificates evidencing such Warrant Units (as the case may be).  If this Warrant is submitted
in connection with any exercise pursuant to this Section 1(a) and the number of Warrant Units
represented by this Warrant submitted for exercise is greater than the number of Warrant Units
being acquired upon an exercise and upon surrender of this Warrant to the Partnership by the
Holder, then, at the request of the Holder, the Partnership shall as soon as practicable and in no
event later than three (3) Business Days after any exercise and at its own
2
expense, issue and deliver to the Holder (or its designee) a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d))
representing the right to purchase the number of Warrant Units purchasable immediately prior to such exercise under
this Warrant, less the number of Warrant Units with respect to which this Warrant is exercised.  No fractional Common
Units are to be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant, but rather the number of Common Units to be issued shall be
rounded up to the nearest whole number.  The Partnership shall pay any and all transfer, stamp, issuance and similar
taxes, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses of the Transfer Agent) that may be
payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Warrant Units upon exercise of this Warrant; provided, however,
that (i) the Partnership shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved
in the issuance or delivery of this Warrant or of the Warrant Units in a name other than that of the Holder at the time of
surrender, and until the payment of such tax the Partnership shall not be required to issue such Warrant Units, and
(ii) the Holder shall be responsible for any income tax due under federal, state or other law as a result of owning this
Warrant or any Warrant Units issued upon the exercise of this Warrant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except in the
case where an exercise of this Warrant is validly made pursuant to a Cashless Exercise, the Partnership’s failure to
deliver Warrant Units to the Holder on or prior to the later of (i) three (3) Trading Days after receipt of the applicable
Exercise Notice (or such earlier date as required pursuant to the 1934 Act or other applicable law, rule or regulation for
the settlement of a trade of such Warrant Units initiated on the applicable Exercise Date) and (ii) one (1) Trading Day
after the Partnership’s receipt of the Aggregate Exercise Price (or valid notice of a Cashless Exercise) (such later
date, the “Unit Delivery Deadline”) shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Warrant.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Warrant or the Registration Rights Agreement, after the
effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement)
and prior to the Holder’s receipt of the notice of a Grace Period (as defined in the Registration
Rights Agreement), the Partnership shall cause the Transfer Agent to deliver unlegended
Common Units to the Holder (or its designee) in connection with any sale of Registrable
Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with respect to which the Holder has
entered into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the prospectus included as part of the
particular Registration Statement to the extent applicable, and for which the Holder has not yet
settled.  From the Issuance Date through and including the Expiration Date, the Partnership shall
maintain a transfer agent that participates in the DTC’s Fast Automated Securities Transfer
Program.
(b)                                 Exercise Price.  For purposes of this Warrant, “Exercise Price” means $10.82,
subject to adjustment as provided herein.
(c)                                  Partnership’s Failure to Timely Deliver Securities.  If the Partnership shall fail,
for any reason or for no reason, on or prior to the Unit Delivery Deadline, either (I) if the Transfer
Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, to issue and
deliver to the Holder (or its designee) a certificate for the number of Warrant Units to which the
Holder is entitled and register such Warrant Units on the Partnership’s unit register or, if the
Transfer Agent is participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, to credit
the balance account of the Holder or the Holder’s designee with DTC for such number of Warrant
Units to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holder’s exercise of this Warrant (as the case may
be) or (II) if a Registration Statement covering the resale of the Warrant Units that are
3
the subject of the Exercise Notice (the “Unavailable Warrant Units”) is not available for the resale of such
Unavailable Warrant Units and the Partnership fails to promptly, but in no event later than as required pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement (x) so notify the Holder and (y) deliver the Warrant Units electronically without any
restrictive legend by crediting such aggregate number of Warrant Units to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such
exercise to the Holder’s or its designee’s balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian
system (the event described in the immediately foregoing clause (II) is hereinafter referred as a “Notice Failure” and
together with the event described in clause (I) above, a “Delivery Failure”), and if on or after such Unit Delivery
Deadline the Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) Common Units to deliver in satisfaction of
a sale by the Holder of all or any portion of the number of Common Units issuable upon such exercise that the Holder
is entitled to receive from the Partnership (a “Buy-In”), then, in addition to all other remedies available to the Holder,
the Partnership shall, within three (3) Business Days after the Holder’s request and in the Holder’s discretion, either
(i) pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions
and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the Common Units so purchased (including, without limitation, by any
other Person in respect, or on behalf, of the Holder) (the “Buy-In Price”), at which point the Partnership’s obligation to
so issue and deliver such certificate (and to issue such Common Units) or credit the balance account of such Holder
or such Holder’s designee, as applicable, with DTC for the number of Warrant Units to which the Holder is entitled
upon the Holder’s exercise hereunder (as the case may be) (and to issue such Warrant Units) shall terminate, or
(ii) promptly honor its obligation to so issue and deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing such
Warrant Units or credit the balance account of such Holder or such Holder’s designee, as applicable, with DTC for the
number of Warrant Units to which the Holder is entitled upon the Holder’s exercise hereunder (as the case may be)
and pay cash to the Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (A) such
number of Warrant Units multiplied by (B) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Units on any Trading Day
during the period commencing on the date of the applicable Exercise Notice and ending on the date of such issuance
and payment under this clause (ii) (the “Buy-In Payment Amount”).  Nothing shall limit the Holder’s right to pursue
any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Partnership’s failure to timely deliver certificates representing
Common Units (or to electronically deliver such Common Units) upon the exercise of this Warrant as required
pursuant to the terms hereof.
(d)                                 Cashless Exercise.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary
(other than Section 1(f) below), if at the time of exercise hereof a Registration Statement (as
defined in the Registration Rights Agreement (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement))
is not effective (or the prospectus contained therein is not available for use) for the resale by the
Holder of all of the Warrant Units, then the Holder may, in its sole discretion, exercise this
Warrant in whole or in part and, in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be
made to the Partnership upon such exercise in payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price, elect
instead to receive upon such exercise the “Net Number” of Warrant Units determined according
to the following formula (a “Cashless Exercise”):
Net Number = (A x B) - (A x C)
4
D
For purposes of the foregoing formula:
A= the total number of units with respect to which this Warrant is then being exercised.
B = the quotient of (x) the sum of the VWAP of the Common Units of each of the ten (10) Trading Days ending at the
close of business on the Principal Market immediately prior to the time of exercise as set forth in the applicable
Exercise Notice, divided by (y) ten (10).
C = the Exercise Price then in effect for the applicable Warrant Units at the time of such exercise.
D = the VWAP of the Common Units at the close of business on the Principal Market on the date of the delivery of
the applicable Exercise Notice.
For purposes of Rule 144(d) promulgated under the 1933 Act, as in effect on the Subscription Date, it is intended that
the Warrant Units issued in a Cashless Exercise shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and the
holding period for the Warrant Units shall be deemed to have commenced, on the date this Warrant was originally
issued pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement.
(e)                                  Disputes.  In the case of a dispute as to the determination of the Exercise Price
or the arithmetic calculation of the number of Warrant Units to be issued pursuant to the terms
hereof, the Partnership shall promptly issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Units that are
not disputed and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 13.
(f)                                   Limitations on Exercises.  The Partnership shall not effect the exercise of any
portion of this Warrant, and the Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this
Warrant, pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Warrant and any such exercise shall be null
and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, the
Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess of
4.99% (the “Maximum Percentage”) of the Common Units outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such exercise.  For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of
Common Units beneficially owned by the Holder and the other Attribution Parties shall include
the number of Common Units held by the Holder and all other Attribution Parties plus the number
of Common Units issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which the determination
of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude Common Units which would be issuable upon
(A) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the
Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or
unconverted portion of any other securities of the Partnership (including, without limitation, any
convertible notes or convertible preferred units or warrants, including other SPA Warrants)
beneficially owned by the Holder or any other Attribution Party subject to a limitation on
conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 1(f).  For purposes
5
of this Section 1(f)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act.  For
purposes of determining the number of outstanding Common Units the Holder may acquire upon the exercise of this
Warrant without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding Common
Units as reflected in (x) the Partnership’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public
announcement by the Partnership or (z) any other written notice by the Partnership or the Transfer Agent, if any,
setting forth the number of Common Units outstanding (the “Reported Outstanding Unit Number”).  If the
Partnership receives an Exercise Notice from the Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding Common
Units is less than the Reported Outstanding Unit Number, the Partnership shall (i) notify the Holder in writing of the
number of Common Units then outstanding and, to the extent that such Exercise Notice would otherwise cause the
Holder’s beneficial ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 1(f), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, the
Holder must notify the Partnership of a reduced number of Warrant Units to be acquired pursuant to such Exercise
Notice (the number of units by which such purchase is reduced, the “Reduction Units”) and (ii) as soon as reasonably
practicable, the Partnership shall return to the Holder any exercise price paid by the Holder for the Reduction Units. 
For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the Partnership shall within one
(1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to the Holder the number of Common Units then
outstanding.  In any case, the number of outstanding Common Units shall be determined after giving effect to the
conversion or exercise of securities of the Partnership, including this Warrant, by the Holder and any other Attribution
Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Unit Number was reported.  In the event that the issuance
of Common Units to the Holder upon exercise of this Warrant results in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties
being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding
Common Units (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of units so issued by which the
Holder’s and the other Attribution Parties’ aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the
“Excess Units”) shall be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and the Holder shall not have the
power to vote or to transfer the Excess Units.  As soon as reasonably practicable after the issuance of the Excess
Units has been deemed null and void, the Partnership shall return to the Holder the exercise price paid by the Holder
for the Excess Units.  Upon delivery of a written notice to the Partnership, the Holder may from time to time increase
(with such increase not effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the
Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice;
provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the
sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Partnership and (ii) any such increase or
decrease will apply only to the Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other
holder of SPA Warrants that is not an Attribution Party of the Holder.  For purposes of clarity, the
Common Units issuable pursuant to the terms of this Warrant in excess of the Maximum
Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by the Holder for any purpose
including for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act.  No prior inability to
exercise this Warrant pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the
provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of exercisability. The
provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section 1(f) to the extent necessary to correct this
6
paragraph or any portion of this paragraph which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial
ownership limitation contained in this Section 1(f) or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to
properly give effect to such limitation.  The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall apply to
a successor holder of this Warrant.
(g)                                  Taxes.  The Partnership and the Holder agree (a) the Warrant is properly
treated, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as a noncompensatory option (as defined in U.S.
Treasury regulation section 1.721-2(f)); (b) the Warrant will not be treated as exercised, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, upon issuance and, thus, the Holder will not receive any allocation
of income, gain, loss or deduction prior to the receipt of Common Units acquired upon exercise of
the Warrant; (c) to follow the U.S. Treasury regulations regarding the exercise of
noncompensatory options (as defined in U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.721-2(f)) with respect
to the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Warrant and the capital account treatment with
respect to the Common Units acquired upon exercise of the Warrant, including with respect to a
capital account reallocation in connection with the revaluation of property in accordance with
U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s) and (d) if, as a result of the exercise of a
Warrant, a capital account reallocation is required under U.S. Treasury regulation section 1.704-
1(b)(2)(iv)(s), the General Partner shall make corrective allocations pursuant to U.S. Treasury
regulation section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).
2.                                      ADJUSTMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE AND NUMBER OF WARRANT
UNITS.  The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Units issuable upon exercise of this Warrant
are subject to adjustment from time to time as set forth in this Section 2.
(a)                                 Unit Dividends and Splits.  Without limiting any provision of Section 2(b) or
Section 4, if the Partnership, but excluding any Distributions made to the Holder pursuant to
Section 3 below (or held in abeyance in accordance with Section 3 below), at any time on or after
the Subscription Date, (i) pays a unit dividend on one or more classes of its then outstanding
Common Units or otherwise makes a distribution on any class of units that is payable in Common
Units, (ii) subdivides (by any unit split, unit dividend, recapitalization or otherwise) one or more
classes of its then outstanding Common Units into a larger number of units or (iii) combines (by
combination, reverse unit split or otherwise) one or more classes of its then outstanding Common
Units into a smaller number of units, then in each such case the Exercise Price shall be
multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of Common Units outstanding
immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of Common
Units outstanding immediately after such event.  Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of
this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of
unitholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to
clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective date of
such subdivision or combination.  If any event requiring an adjustment under this paragraph
occurs during the period that an Exercise Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of
such Exercise Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event.
(b)                                 Adjustment Upon Issuance of Units of Common Units.  If and whenever on or
after the Subscription Date, the Partnership issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 2 is
7
deemed to have issued or sold, any Common Units (including the issuance or sale of Common Units owned or held by
or for the account of the Partnership, but excluding any Excluded Securities issued or sold or deemed to have been
issued or sold) for a consideration per unit (the “New Issuance Price”) less than a price equal to the Exercise Price in
effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale (such Exercise Price then in effect is
referred to herein as the “Applicable Price”) (the foregoing a “Dilutive Issuance”), then immediately after such
Dilutive Issuance, the Exercise Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to (x) if such Dilutive
Issuance occurs prior to the later of (1) the 90th calendar day after the Issuance Date and (2) the Effective
Date (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) of the initial Registration Statement filed
pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement (such later date, the “Trigger Date”), the New
Issuance Price or (y) and if on or prior to the Trigger Date the Partnership shall have failed to
consummate the transactions contemplated by that certain Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated
June 23, 2016, by and among the Partnership, Emerge Energy Services Operating LLC, Susser
Petroleum Operating Company LLC and Sunoco LP (collectively, the “Sale Transaction”), the
product of (A) the Applicable Price and (B) the quotient determined by dividing (1) the sum of
(I) the product derived by multiplying the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such
Dilutive Issuance and the number of Common Units Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to
such Dilutive Issuance plus (II) the consideration, if any, received by the Partnership upon such
Dilutive Issuance, by (2) the product derived by multiplying (I) the Applicable Price by (II) the
number of Common Units Deemed Outstanding immediately after such Dilutive Issuance.  For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Partnership shall have consummated the Sale Transaction on or
prior to the Trigger Date, from and after the Trigger Date no further adjustments to the Exercise
Price shall occur pursuant to this Section 2(b).  For all purposes of the foregoing (including,
without limitation, determining the adjusted Exercise Price and the New Issuance Price under
this Section 2(b)), the following shall be applicable:
(i)                                     Issuance of Options.  If the Partnership in any manner grants or sells any
Options and the lowest price per unit for which one Common Units is at any time issuable upon
the exercise of any such Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible
Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof
is less than the Applicable Price, then such Common Units shall be deemed to be outstanding
and to have been issued and sold by the Partnership at the time of the granting or sale of such
Option for such price per unit.  For purposes of this Section 2(b)(i), the “lowest price per unit for
which one Common Units is issuable upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion,
exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or
otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof”  shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the
lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Partnership with respect to
any one Common Units upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option
and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise
of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set
forth in such Option for which one Common Units is issuable upon the exercise of any such
Options or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon
exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all
amounts paid or payable to the holder of such
8
Option (or any other Person) upon the granting or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable by, or benefit conferred
on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person).  Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the
Exercise Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Units or of such Convertible Securities upon
the exercise of such Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms of or upon the actual issuance of such Common
Units upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities.
(ii)                                  Issuance of Convertible Securities.  If the Partnership in any manner issues or
sells any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per unit for which one Common Units is at
any time issuable upon the conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to
the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such Common Units shall be deemed to
be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Partnership at the time of the issuance
or sale of such Convertible Securities for such price per unit.  For the purposes of this
Section 2(b)(ii), the “lowest price per unit for which one Common Units is issuable upon the
conversion, exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof” shall be
equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or
receivable by the Partnership with respect to one Common Units upon the issuance or sale of the
Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Security or
otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such
Convertible Security for which one Common Units is issuable upon conversion, exercise or
exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts
paid or payable to the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) upon the
issuance or sale of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration received
or receivable by, or benefit conferred on, the holder of such Convertible Security (or any other
Person).  Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be
made upon the actual issuance of such Common Units upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of such Convertible Securities or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such
issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of any Options for which
adjustment of this Warrant has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this
Section 2(b), except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be
made by reason of such issuance or sale.
(iii)                               Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion.  If the purchase or exercise price
provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable upon the issue,
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any
Convertible Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Units
increases or decreases at any time (other than proportional changes in conversion or exercise
prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 2(a)), the Exercise Price
in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Exercise Price which
would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for
such increased or decreased purchase
9
price, additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate, as the case may be, at the time initially
granted, issued or sold.  For purposes of this Section 2(b)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security that
was outstanding as of the Subscription Date are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately
preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the Common Units deemed issuable upon exercise,
conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. 
No adjustment pursuant to this Section 2(b) shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the
Exercise Price then in effect.
(iv)                              Calculation of Consideration Received.  If any Option and/or Convertible Security
and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or
sale of any other securities of the Partnership (as determined by the Holder, the “Primary
Security”, and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the
“Secondary Securities”), together comprising one integrated transaction, (or one or more
transactions if such issuances or sales or deemed issuances or sales of securities of the
Partnership either (A) have at least one investor or purchaser in common, (B) are consummated
in reasonable proximity to each other and/or (C) are consummated under the same plan of
financing) the aggregate consideration per Common Units with respect to such Primary Security
shall be deemed to be equal to the difference of (x) the lowest price per unit for which one
Common Units was issued (or was deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 2(b)(i) or 2(b)
(ii) above, as applicable) in such integrated transaction solely with respect to such Primary
Security, minus (y) with respect to such Secondary Securities, the sum of (I) the Black Scholes
Consideration Value of each such Option, if any, (II) the fair market value (as determined by the
Holder in good faith) or the Black Scholes Consideration Value, as applicable, of such
Adjustment Right, if any, and (III) the fair market value (as determined by the Holder) of such
Convertible Security, if any, in each case, as determined on a per unit basis in accordance with
this Section 2(b)(iv).  If any Common Units, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold
or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor (for the
purpose of determining the consideration paid for such Common Units, Option or Convertible
Security, but not for the purpose of the calculation of the Black Scholes Consideration Value) will
be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Partnership therefor.  If any
Common Units, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other
than cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Partnership (for the purpose of
determining the consideration paid for such Common Units, Option or Convertible Security, but
not for the purpose of the calculation of the Black Scholes Consideration Value) will be the fair
value of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded
securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Partnership for such
securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the five
(5) Trading Days immediately preceding the date of receipt.  If any Common Units, Options or
Convertible Securities are issued to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any
merger in which the Partnership is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor (for
the purpose of determining the consideration paid for such Common Units, Option or Convertible
Security, but not for
10
the purpose of the calculation of the Black Scholes Consideration Value) will be deemed to be the fair value of such
portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such Common Units, Options or
Convertible Securities (as the case may be).  The fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded
securities will be determined jointly by the Partnership and the Holder.  If such parties are unable to reach agreement
within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the “Valuation Event”), the fair value of such
consideration will be determined within five (5) Trading Days after the tenth (10th) day following such Valuation
Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Partnership and the Holder. 
The determination of such appraiser shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest
error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Partnership.
(v)           Record Date.  If the Partnership takes a record of the holders of Common Units for the purpose of entitling
them (A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Units, Options or in Convertible Securities or
(B) to subscribe for or purchase Common Units, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be
deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale of the Common Units deemed to have been issued or sold upon the
declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of
subscription or purchase (as the case may be).
(c)           Number of Warrant Units.  Simultaneously with any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this
Section 2(a), the number of Warrant Units that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant
shall be increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the aggregate
Exercise Price payable hereunder for the adjusted number of Warrant Units shall be the same as
the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment (without regard to any
limitations on exercise contained herein).
(d)           Holder’s Right of Alternative Exercise Price Following Issuance of Certain Options or Convertible
Securities.  In addition to and not in limitation of the other provisions of this Section 2, if at any time the Series A
Preferred Units remain outstanding the Partnership in any manner issues or sells or enters into any agreement to
issue or sell, any Common Units, Options or Convertible Securities (any such securities, “Variable Price Securities”)
after the Subscription Date that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Units at a price which varies or may vary with the market price of the Common Units,
including by way of one or more reset(s) to a fixed price, but exclusive of such formulations reflecting customary anti-
dilution provisions (such as unit splits, unit combinations, unit dividends and similar transactions) (each of the
formulations for such variable price being herein referred to as, the “Variable Price”), the Partnership shall provide
written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Holder on the date of such agreement and the
issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options.  From and after the date the Partnership enters into such
agreement or issues any such Variable Price Securities until such time as no Series A Preferred Units remain
outstanding, the Holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to substitute the Variable Price
for the Exercise Price upon exercise of this Warrant by designating in the Exercise Notice delivered upon any
exercise of
11
this Warrant that solely for purposes of such exercise the Holder is relying on the Variable Price rather than the
Exercise Price then in effect.  The Holder’s election to rely on a Variable Price for a particular exercise of this Warrant
shall not obligate the Holder to rely on a Variable Price for any future exercises of this Warrant.
(e)           Other Events.  In the event that the Partnership (or any Subsidiary (as defined in the Securities Purchase
Agreement)) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not strictly applicable, or, if applicable, would not
operate to protect the Holder from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated by the provisions of this
Section 2 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the
granting of unit appreciation rights, phantom unit rights or other rights with equity features), then
the Partnership’s board of directors shall in good faith determine and implement an appropriate
adjustment in the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Units (if applicable) so as to protect
the rights of the Holder, provided that no such adjustment pursuant to this Section 2(e) will
increase the Exercise Price or decrease the number of Warrant Units as otherwise determined
pursuant to this Section 2, provided further that if the Holder does not accept such adjustments as
appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then the Partnership’s
board of directors and the Holder shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment
bank of nationally recognized standing to make such appropriate adjustments, whose
determination shall be final and binding absent manifest error and whose fees and expenses
shall be borne by the Partnership.
(f)            Calculations.  All calculations under this Section 2 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the
nearest 1/100th of a unit, as applicable.  The number of Common Units outstanding at any given
time shall not include units owned or held by or for the account of the Partnership, and the
disposition of any such units shall be considered an issuance or sale of Common Units.
(g)           Voluntary Adjustment By Partnership.  The Partnership may at any time during the term of this Warrant,
with the prior written consent of the Required Holders (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), reduce the
then current Exercise Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of
the Partnership.
3.             RIGHTS UPON DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS.  In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 2
above, if the Partnership shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or
rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Units, by way of return of capital or otherwise
(including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, units or other securities, property, options,
evidence of indebtedness or any other assets by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification,
corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction (a “Distribution”),
at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be
entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have
participated therein if the Holder had held the number of Common Units acquirable upon
complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations or restrictions on exercise of
this Warrant, including without limitation, the Maximum Percentage) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of
which the record holders of Common Units are to be determined for the participation in such
Distribution (provided, however, that to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such
Distribution would result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the
12
Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the extent of the
Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such Common Units as a result of such
Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to the extent of any such excess) and the portion of such Distribution shall be
held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time or times, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in
the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times the Holder
shall be granted such Distribution (and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any
subsequent Distribution held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).
4.             PURCHASE RIGHTS; FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTIONS.
(a)           Purchase Rights.  In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 2 above, if at any time the
Partnership grants, issues or sells any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase units,
warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Units
(the “Purchase Rights”), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to
such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if
the Holder had held the number of Common Units acquirable upon complete exercise of this
Warrant (without regard to any limitations or restrictions on exercise of this Warrant, including
without limitation, the Maximum Percentage) immediately before the date on which a record is
taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the
date as of which the record holders of Common Units are to be determined for the grant, issuance
or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, that to the extent that the Holder’s right to
participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder and the other Attribution
Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in
such Purchase Right to the extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to
beneficial ownership of such Common Units as a result of such Purchase Right (and beneficial
ownership) to the extent of any such excess) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be
held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time or times, if ever, as its right thereto
would not result in the Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum
Percentage, at which time or times the Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase
Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent Purchase
Right held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).
(b)           Fundamental Transaction.  If after the date hereof the Partnership shall enter into or become a party to a
Fundamental Transaction, then, and in the case of each such transaction, proper provision shall be made so that
upon the basis and the terms and in the manner provided in this Warrant, the Holder, upon the exercise hereof at any
time after the consummation of such transaction, shall be entitled to receive (after giving effect to the payment of the
aggregate Exercise Price in effect at the time of such consummation) for all Warrant Units issuable upon such
exercise immediately prior to such consummation), in lieu of the Warrant Units issuable upon such exercise prior to
such consummation, the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property to which such Holder would actually
have been entitled as an equity holder upon such consummation if such Holder had exercised the rights represented
by this Warrant immediately
13
prior thereto, subject to adjustments (subsequent to such consummation) as nearly equivalent as possible to the
adjustments provided for in Section 2.
(c)           Black Scholes Value.  Notwithstanding the foregoing and the provisions of Section 4(b) above, at the
request of the Holder delivered at any time commencing on the earliest to occur of (x) the public disclosure of any
Fundamental Transaction, (y) the consummation of any Fundamental Transaction and (z) the Holder first becoming
aware of any Fundamental Transaction through the date that is ninety (90) days after the public disclosure of the
consummation of such Fundamental Transaction by the Partnership pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC, the Partnership or the Successor Entity (as the case may be) shall purchase this Warrant from the
Holder on the date of such request by paying to the Holder cash in an amount equal to the Black Scholes Value. 
Payment of such amounts shall be made by the Partnership (or at the Partnership’s direction) to the Holder on or prior
to the later of (x) the second (2nd) Trading Day after the date of such request and (y) the date of
consummation of such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payments
made under this Section 4(c) shall not be duplicative of payments made under
Section 4(b) above.
(d)           Application.  The provisions of this Section 4 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental
Transactions and shall be applied as if this Warrant (and any such subsequent warrants) were fully exercisable and
without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant (provided that the Holder shall continue to
be entitled to the benefit of the Maximum Percentage, applied however with respect to units or
other securities registered under the 1934 Act and thereafter receivable upon exercise of this
Warrant (or any such other warrant)).
5.             NONCIRCUMVENTION.  The Partnership hereby covenants and agrees that the Partnership will not, by
amendment of its Limited Partnership Agreement or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issuance or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action,  avoid or
seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, and will at all times in good faith
carry out all the provisions of this Warrant and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder. 
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Partnership (a) shall not increase the par value of any Common
Units receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, and (b) shall take all such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Partnership may validly and legally issue fully paid and
non-assessable Common Units upon the exercise of this Warrant.
6.             WARRANT HOLDER NOT DEEMED A UNITHOLDER.  Except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
the Holder, solely in its capacity as a holder of this Warrant, shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be
deemed the holder of units of the Partnership for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Warrant be
construed to confer upon the Holder, solely in its capacity as the Holder of this Warrant, any of the rights of a
unitholder of the Partnership or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether any
reorganization, issue of units, reclassification of units, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise), receive
notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, prior to the issuance to the Holder of the
Warrant Units which it is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this Warrant.  In addition, nothing contained
in this Warrant shall be
14
construed as imposing any liabilities on the Holder to purchase any securities (upon exercise of this Warrant or
otherwise) or as a unitholder of the Partnership, whether such liabilities are asserted by the Partnership or by creditors
of the Partnership.  Notwithstanding this Section 6, the Partnership shall provide the Holder with copies of the same
notices and other information given to the unitholders of the Partnership generally, contemporaneously with the giving
thereof to the unitholders.
7.             REISSUANCE OF WARRANTS.
(a)           Transfer of Warrant.  If this Warrant is to be transferred, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the
Partnership, whereupon the Partnership will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Warrant (in
accordance with Section 7(d)), registered as the Holder may request, representing the right to purchase the number of
Warrant Units being transferred by the Holder and, if less than the total number of Warrant Units then underlying this
Warrant is being transferred, a new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d)) to the Holder representing the right to
purchase the number of Warrant Units not being transferred.
(b)           Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Warrant.  Upon receipt by the Partnership of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
the Partnership of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant (as to which a written certification and the
indemnification contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of
any indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Partnership in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of
mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Partnership shall execute and deliver to the Holder a
new Warrant (in accordance with Section 7(d)) representing the right to purchase the Warrant Units then underlying
this Warrant.
(c)           Exchangeable for Multiple Warrants.  This Warrant is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the
Holder at the principal office of the Partnership, for a new Warrant or Warrants (in accordance with Section 7(d))
representing in the aggregate the right to purchase the number of Warrant Units then underlying this Warrant, and
each such new Warrant will represent the right to purchase such portion of such Warrant Units as is designated by the
Holder at the time of such surrender; provided, however, no warrants for fractional Common Units shall be given.
(d)           Issuance of New Warrants.  Whenever the Partnership is required to issue a new Warrant pursuant to the
terms of this Warrant, such new Warrant (i) shall be of like tenor with this Warrant, (ii) shall represent, as indicated on
the face of such new Warrant, the right to purchase the Warrant Units then underlying this Warrant (or in the case of a
new Warrant being issued pursuant to Section 7(a) or Section 7(c), the Warrant Units designated by the Holder which,
when added to the number of Common Units underlying the other new Warrants issued in connection with such
issuance, does not exceed the number of Warrant Units then underlying this Warrant), (iii) shall have an issuance
date, as indicated on the face of such new Warrant which is the same as the Issuance Date, and (iv) shall have the
same rights and conditions as this Warrant.
8.             NOTICES.  Whenever notice is required to be given under this Warrant, unless otherwise provided herein,
such notice shall be given in accordance with Section 9(f) of the Securities
15
Purchase Agreement.  The Partnership shall provide the Holder with prompt written notice of all actions taken
pursuant to this Warrant (other than the issuance of Common Units upon exercise in accordance with the terms
hereof), including in reasonable detail a description of such action and the reason therefor.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Partnership will give written notice to the Holder (i) immediately upon each adjustment
of the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Units, setting forth in reasonable detail, and certifying, the
calculation of such adjustment(s), (ii) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the date on which the Partnership closes its
books or takes a record (A) with respect to any dividend or distribution upon the Common Units, (B) with respect to
any grants, issuances or sales of any Options, Convertible Securities or rights to purchase units, warrants, securities
or other property to holders of Common Units or (C) for determining rights to vote with respect to any Fundamental
Transaction, dissolution or liquidation, provided in each case that such information shall be made known to the public
prior to or in conjunction with such notice being provided to the Holder, and (iii) at least fifteen (15) Trading Days prior
to the consummation of any Fundamental Transaction.  To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes,
or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, the Partnership shall
simultaneously file such notice with the SEC (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) pursuant to a Current
Report on Form 8-K.  If the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries provides material non-public information to the
Holder that is not simultaneously filed in a Current Report on Form 8-K and the Holder has not agreed to receive such
material non-public information, the Partnership hereby covenants and agrees that the Holder shall not have any duty
of confidentiality to the Partnership, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
affiliates or agents with respect to, or a duty to any of the foregoing not to trade on the basis of, such material non-
public information. It is expressly understood and agreed that the time of execution specified by the Holder in each
Exercise Notice shall be definitive and may not be disputed or challenged by the Partnership.
9.             AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of this Warrant (other
than Section 1(f)) may be amended and the Partnership may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any
act herein required to be performed by it, only if the Partnership has obtained the written consent of the Holder.  No
waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
10.          SEVERABILITY.  If any provision of this Warrant is prohibited by law or otherwise determined to be invalid
or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the provision that would otherwise be prohibited, invalid or
unenforceable shall be deemed amended to apply to the broadest extent that it would be valid and enforceable, and
the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this
Warrant so long as this Warrant as so modified continues to express, without material change, the original intentions
of the parties as to the subject matter hereof and the prohibited nature, invalidity or unenforceability of the
provision(s) in question does not substantially impair the respective expectations or reciprocal obligations of the
parties or the practical realization of the benefits that would otherwise be conferred upon the parties.  The parties will
endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable provision(s) with a valid
provision(s), the effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the prohibited, invalid or unenforceable
provision(s).
16
11.          GOVERNING LAW.  This Warrant shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with,
and all questions concerning the construction, validity, interpretation and performance of this Warrant shall be
governed by, the internal laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the
laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware.  The Partnership and the Holder each hereby irrevocably
waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by
mailing a copy thereof to the Partnership or the Holder at the address set forth in Section 9(f) of the Securities
Purchase Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice
thereof.  The Partnership and the Holder each hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and
federal courts sitting in The City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or
in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein thereby (except for any
disputes arising under the Limited Partnership Agreement and the LP Amendment, which shall be adjudicated
exclusively in state court in the State of Delaware), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any
suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such
suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is
improper.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any manner
permitted by law.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or
taking other legal action against the Partnership in any other jurisdiction to collect on the Partnership’s obligations to
the Holder, to realize on any collateral or any other security for such obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other
court ruling in favor of the Holder.  THE PARTNERSHIP AND THE HOLDER EACH HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE
ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS
WARRANT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
12.          CONSTRUCTION; HEADINGS.  This Warrant shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by the Partnership and
the Holder and shall not be construed against any Person as the drafter hereof.  The headings of this Warrant are for
convenience of reference and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Warrant.  Terms used in this
Warrant but defined in the other Transaction Documents shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms on the
Closing Date (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) in such other Transaction Documents unless
otherwise consented to in writing by the Holder.
13.          DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
(a)           Submission to Dispute Resolution.
(i)            In the case of a dispute relating to the Exercise Price, the Closing Sale Price, Black Scholes Consideration
Value, Black Scholes Value or fair market value or the arithmetic calculation of the number of Warrant Units (as the
case may be) (including, without limitation, a dispute relating to the determination of any of the foregoing), the
Partnership or the Holder (as the case may be) shall submit the dispute to
17
the other party via facsimile (A) if by the Partnership, within two (2) Business Days after the occurrence of the
circumstances giving rise to such dispute or (B) if by the Holder, at any time after the Holder learned of the
circumstances giving rise to such dispute.  If the Holder and the Partnership are unable to promptly resolve such
dispute relating to such Exercise Price, such Closing Sale Price, such Black Scholes Consideration Value, Black
Scholes Value or such fair market value or such arithmetic calculation of the number of Warrant Units (as the case
may be), at any time after the second (2nd) Business Day following such initial notice by the Partnership
or the Holder (as the case may be) of such dispute to the Partnership or the Holder (as the case
may be), then the Holder may, at its sole option, select an independent, reputable investment
bank to resolve such dispute.
(ii)           The Holder and the Partnership shall each deliver to such investment bank (A) a copy of the initial dispute
submission so delivered in accordance with the first sentence of this Section 13 and (B) written documentation
supporting its position with respect to such dispute, in each case, no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York time) by the fifth
(5th) Business Day immediately following the date on which the Holder selected such investment
bank (the “Dispute Submission Deadline”) (the documents referred to in the immediately
preceding clauses (A) and (B) are collectively referred to herein as the “Required Dispute
Documentation”) (it being understood and agreed that if either the Holder or the Partnership fails
to so deliver all of the Required Dispute Documentation by the Dispute Submission Deadline,
then the party who fails to so submit all of the Required Dispute Documentation shall no longer
be entitled to (and hereby waives its right to) deliver or submit any written documentation or other
support to such investment bank with respect to such dispute and such investment bank shall
resolve such dispute based solely on the Required Dispute Documentation that was delivered to
such investment bank prior to the Dispute Submission Deadline). Unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by both the Partnership and the Holder or otherwise requested by such investment bank,
neither the Partnership nor the Holder shall be entitled to deliver or submit any written
documentation or other support to such investment bank in connection with such dispute (other
than the Required Dispute Documentation).
(iii)          The Partnership and the Holder shall cause such investment bank to determine the resolution of such
dispute and notify the Partnership and the Holder of such resolution no later than ten (10) Business Days immediately
following the Dispute Submission Deadline. The fees and expenses of such investment bank shall be borne solely by
the Partnership, and such investment bank’s resolution of such dispute shall be final and binding upon all parties
absent manifest error.
(b)           Miscellaneous.  The Partnership expressly acknowledges and agrees that (i) this Section 13 constitutes an
agreement to arbitrate between the Partnership and the Holder (and constitutes an arbitration agreement) under the
rules then in effect under § 7501, et seq. of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (“CPLR”) and that the Holder
is authorized to apply for an order to compel arbitration pursuant to CPLR § 7503(a) in order to compel compliance
with this Section 13, (ii) a dispute relating to the Exercise Price includes, without limitation, disputes as to (A) whether
an issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Common Units occurred under Section 2(b), (B) the consideration
per unit at which an issuance or deemed issuance of
18
Common Units occurred, (C) whether any issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Common Units was an
issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Excluded Securities, (D) whether an agreement, instrument, security
or the like constitutes and Option or Convertible Security and (E) whether a Dilutive Issuance occurred, (iii) the terms
of this Warrant and each other applicable Transaction Document shall serve as the basis for the selected investment
bank’s resolution of the applicable dispute, such investment bank shall be entitled (and is hereby expressly
authorized) to make all findings, determinations and the like that such investment bank determines are required to be
made by such investment bank in connection with its resolution of such dispute (including, without limitation,
determining (A) whether an issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Common Units occurred under
Section 2(b), (B) the consideration per unit at which an issuance or deemed issuance of Common Units occurred,
(C) whether any issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of Common Units was an issuance or sale or deemed
issuance or sale of Excluded Securities, (D) whether an agreement, instrument, security or the like constitutes and
Option or Convertible Security and (E) whether a Dilutive Issuance occurred) and in resolving such dispute such
investment bank shall apply such findings, determinations and the like to the terms of this Warrant and any other
applicable Transaction Documents, (iv) the Holder (and only the Holder), in its sole discretion, shall have the right to
submit any dispute described in this Section 13 to any state or federal court sitting in The City of New York, Borough
of Manhattan in lieu of utilizing the procedures set forth in this Section 13 and (v) nothing in this Section 13 shall limit
the Holder from obtaining any injunctive relief or other equitable remedies (including, without limitation, with respect to
any matters described in this Section 13).
14.          REMEDIES, CHARACTERIZATION, OTHER OBLIGATIONS, BREACHES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. 
The remedies provided in this Warrant shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this
Warrant and the other Transaction Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or
other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall limit the right of the Holder to pursue actual and consequential
damages for any failure by the Partnership to comply with the terms of this Warrant.  The Partnership covenants to
the Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein.
