CERTIFICATION
I, Stephen B. Millis, certify that:
1. I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-QSB of Vineyard Oil and Gas
   Company;
2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of
   a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
   statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements
   were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this
   report;
3. Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
   information included in this report, fairly present in all material
   respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of
   the small business issuer as of, and for, the periods presented in this
   report;
4. The small business issuer's other certifying officer(s) and I are
   responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
   procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and
   internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
   13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the small business issuer and have:
(a) Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
            disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
            supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the small
            business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
            known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
            period in which this report is being prepared;
(b) Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
            such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
            our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
            reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
            statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
            accounting principles;
(c) Evaluated the effectiveness of the small business issuer's disclosure
            controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
            about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as
            of the end of the period covered by this report based on such
            evaluation; and
1
(d) Disclosed in this report any change in the small business issuer's
            internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
            small business issuer's most recent fiscal quarter (the small business
issuer's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that
            has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
            the small business issuer's internal control over financial reporting;
5. The small business issuer's other certifying officer(s) and I have
   disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
   financial reporting, to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit
   committee of the small business issuer's board of directors (or persons
   performing the equivalent functions):
(a) All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
            operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
            reasonably likely to adversely affect the small business issuer's
            ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
            information; and
(b) Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
            employees who have a significant role in the small business issuer's
            internal control over financial reporting.
