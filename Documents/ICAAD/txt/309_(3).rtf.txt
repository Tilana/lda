This Action was in the General Callover on Friday 25 November to be allocated a hearing date. Ms Muir appeared for the Defendant. There was no appearance for the Plaintiff.

There is an associated matter apparently, Civil Action HBC0161.2003 in which the parties are the same but their roles are reversed. That matter originally had a hearing allocated on 23 June 2005 but the hearing was vacated by consent.

Counsel are asked to note that I have arranged a judicial conference to discuss the present state and future progress of these two actions. I invite Mr V P Mishra and Mr K. Kumar, or Counsel in their place fully informed and instructed, to attend the judicial conference to discuss the present and future progress of these two actions. The conference will be on Thursday 16 February 2006, at 9.30am.
