<p><i>Summary 
</i>The Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights conducted an official 
</p>
<p>visit to the Republic of Moldova from 8 to 14 September 2013. In the present report, the 
Special Rapporteur outlines the challenges facing the Republic of Moldova in 
implementing measures to tackle poverty and in ensuring the rights of those living in 
poverty in the country. 
</p>
<p>The Republic of Moldova ranks as one of the poorest countries in Europe at a time 
when the cost of essential goods and services is steadily on the rise. The Special Rapporteur

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to her mandate, contained in Human Rights Council resolution 17/13, and 
at the invitation of the Government, the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human 
rights, Magdalena Sep&#250;lveda Carmona, undertook a visit to the Republic of Moldova from 
8 to 14 September 2013. During the visit the Special Rapporteur collected first-hand 
information on the situation of people living in poverty in order to conduct a human rights-
based analysis of key public policies relating to poverty alleviation, development and social 
protection. 
</p>
<p>2. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Deputy Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and European Integration; the Deputy Minister of Education; the Deputy Minister 
of Health; the Deputy Minister of Labour, Social Protection and the Family; the Deputy 
Minister of Justice; and the Adviser to the Prime Minister on social protection. She also met 
with members of the de facto authorities of the Transnistrian region,1 namely the de facto ministers of foreign affairs and of social protection. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with the pilot Ombudsperson for Psychiatry and 
representatives of the Centre for Human Rights of Moldova, as well as with representatives 
of international organizations, donor agencies, financial institutions and a range of civil 
society organizations. In addition, she visited communities living in poverty and spoke with 
persons living in poverty in the Chisinau, Calarasi, Balti, Briceni and Drochia districts, as 
well as in Bender and Tiraspol on the left bank of the Nistru River. She visited several 
health-care facilities and residential institutions (<i>internats)</i>, including neuropsychiatric 
residential institutions in Balti and Bender districts, as well as the tuberculosis and 
narcopsychiatric units of the Balti Psychiatric Hospital in Pavlovca village, Briceni district. 
The Special Rapporteur also visited the Centre for Temporary Placement of Foreigners, in 
Chisinau.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of the Republic of 
Moldova for its excellent cooperation during her visit. She appreciated the spirit of 
openness which enabled her to engage in dialogue with the authorities. The Special 
Rapporteur is also grateful to the Office of the United Nations Resident Coordinator, in 
particular, the Human Rights Adviser delegated by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in Moldova, for support and assistance with 
the mission. She would like to express her sincere gratitude to everyone who took the time 
to meet with her as their contributions were invaluable to the success of her visit. The 
Special Rapporteur is especially grateful to all those who shared their personal experiences 
of struggling with the plight of poverty and social exclusion. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General context 
</b>5. Since independence in 1991, the Republic of Moldova has faced a number of 
political, economic and demographic challenges, including separatist conflicts, the global 
economic crisis and natural disasters, such as drought. Over the past decade, the Republic 
of Moldova achieved important economic growth, with reported average gross domestic 
product (GDP) growth of 5.05 per cent annually between 2000 and 2011.2 The country

</i></p>

</p>
<p>achieved a remarkable reduction in poverty, from 30.2 per cent in 2006 to 16.6 per cent in 
</p><p>2012. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, 1.5 per cent of the population, some 
38,000 persons, lived in extreme poverty in 2010.3 
</p>
<p>6. The Republic of Moldova still faces poverty issues across most of the country. 
Moreover, the benefits of economic growth have not been widely shared, in geographic and 
social terms.4 There is a widening gap between urban and rural areas and some groups 
remain at the margins  or are excluded from social, political and economic processes.5  
</p>
<p>7. It is estimated that around 600,000 Moldovans, one fourth of the country&#8217;s 
workforce, reside abroad.6 Many Moldovan families depend on remittances from family 
members working abroad, which, at their peak in 2008, accounted for 38.3 per cent of the 
GDP of the Republic of Moldova.7 Economic growth based on remittances is not only 
unsustainable but a non-inclusive development model, as individuals from the poorest 
families generally cannot afford to emigrate. Moreover, this approach hides the enormous 
sacrifices of those who are forced to leave to seek better opportunities and the dramatic 
impact on those left behind, particularly children and older persons. 
</p>
<p>8. Life expectancy in the Republic of Moldova is among the lowest in Europe, 
particularly for men, and in the past decade, the gap in life expectancy between rural and 
urban areas has reportedly more than doubled.8 The incidence of HIV/AIDS has increased 
since 2000; tuberculosis, in particular multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, is at very troubling 
levels and there has been a decline in enrolment rates in general mandatory education.9 In 
rural areas, children with disabilities and Roma children have a much lower enrolment rate 
in preschool education than the rest of the population and face very strong stigma leading to 
discrimination, which puts them in a disadvantaged position from an early age.10 Women 
continue to have limited economic opportunities compared with men, despite important 
recent progress towards equality in education. Gender-based violence and women&#8217;s 
representation in decision-making positions remain critical challenges. 
</p>
<p>9. The Republic of Moldova continues to rank at lower levels on the global Human 
Development Index, ranking 113th out of 187 countries in 2012.11 People living in poverty 
face severe hardship, at a time when the cost of essential goods and services has been 
steadily on the rise.12 Certain groups are disproportionately likely to live in poverty, 
including older persons, persons with disabilities, single- or child-headed households, the 
Roma community, those recently returned from work abroad or after being trafficked and 
persons living with HIV/AIDS, particularly in rural areas. Many Moldovans struggle to

<p>enjoy economic, social and cultural rights, such as the rights to adequate food, education 
and heath.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and institutional framework 
</b></p>
<p>10. Title II of the Moldovan Constitution adopted in 1994 contains detailed provisions 
on political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights. Article 16(2) declares that &#8220;all 
citizens of the Republic of Moldova shall be equal before the law and public authorities, 
regardless of race, nationality, ethnic origin, language, religion, sex, opinion, political 
affiliation, property or social origin&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>11. The Republic of Moldova has affirmed its commitment to the promotion and 
protection of human rights by ratifying seven major international human rights treaties, as 
well as several optional protocols. The 2010 ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities has provided an important context for potential reform in a 
number of areas. The Republic of Moldova successfully engaged with various United 
Nations human rights mechanisms, including the universal periodic review process in 2011, 
and extended a standing invitation to all special procedures mandate holders in 2010.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the Republic of Moldova has not ratified a 
number of complaints and inquiry mechanisms, including those provided for under the 
optional protocols to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and articles 21 and 22 of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment, and she calls on the State to do so as a matter of priority. The Special 
Rapporteur further encourages the State to ratify the Convention on the Protection of the 
Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p>13. The Republic of Moldova has adopted important legislation, including the 2012 Law 
on Ensuring Equality, the 2008 Law on Preventing and Combating Family Violence, the 
2006 Law on Ensuring Equal Opportunities for Men and Women and the 2012 Law on the 
Social Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>14. The Republic of Moldova has incorporated many relevant international 
recommendations into its National Human Rights Action Plan as well as into government 
action plans on Roma inclusion. It has also incorporated most of the recommendations 
made by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 2011 into a 
government action plan. 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur has noted the State&#8217;s efforts to reform the Centre for Human 
Rights of Moldova, its B-status national human rights institution. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the State to follow the guidance provided by the United Nations system, with a view 
to establishing an independent national human rights institution in compliance with the 
Paris Principles.   
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur also urges the Government to establish an independent 
monitoring body on the rights of persons with disabilities, as provided for in article 33, 
paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Special 
Rapporteur notes that the Government has instituted a pilot Ombudsperson for Psychiatry, 
who is empowered to ensure human rights oversight in institutions under the Ministry of 
Health. The Ombudsperson has not yet been budgeted for and is being financed during the 
pilot phase by the United Nations country team. The Special Rapporteur was favourably 
impressed by the positive changes and human rights scrutiny made possible by this 
arrangement.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p><b> IV. General challenges 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Gaps in policy implementation 
</b></p>
<p>17. The Republic of Moldova has a robust legal framework for combating poverty and 
promoting human rights, but there are severe implementation gaps in almost all social 
policies. Laws and policies lack systematic implementation and accountability mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>18. There is a general lack of monitoring and evaluation of the policies in place, limited 
impact assessment and a general lack of disaggregated data in a number of key areas.13 It is 
therefore difficult to properly evaluate the impact of several measures taken by the State.  
</p>
<p>19. Adequately informing the population about laws and plans of action is equally 
important to ensure their effective implementation. When speaking with persons and 
communities living in poverty, the Special Rapporteur noted that many did not have correct 
information about their rights and benefits under policies that directly affect their lives. 
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the importance of implementing a multisectoral 
strategy and the need to establish mechanisms to ensure coordination and accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Corruption 
</b></p>
<p>21. In 2012, the Republic of Moldova ranked 94 out of 176 countries globally on the 
Corruption Perceptions Index.14 Corruption is a major obstacle to reducing poverty as it 
impedes economic growth and discourages foreign investment. More importantly, 
corruption has a devastating impact on the poorest people in society because it distorts 
public policies and diverts resources that could be invested in public infrastructure and 
services that are essential elements of poverty eradication strategies.  
</p>
<p>22. The State must manage its resources in a transparent manner and be accountable for 
the management of public funds, as a sine qua non for democracy and the effective exercise 
of human rights and inclusive social development. In particular, social protection systems 
must be accompanied by independent and effective transparency, accountability and redress 
mechanisms, which will not only enhance protection for beneficiaries, but also improve the 
efficiency of social programmes, minimize waste and mismanagement and strengthen 
public support.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Situation of groups particularly vulnerable to poverty 
</b>23. The Special Rapporteur identified the following groups as being particularly 
vulnerable to poverty and requiring specific initiatives to overcome the impact of economic 
deprivation and social exclusion. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Women and girls 
</b></p>
<p>24. Although the Constitution and legal framework of the Republic of Moldova include 
extensive guarantees of women&#8217;s rights, many women face significant challenges,

<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>including lack of access to decent work, unequal remuneration, lack of representation at the 
political and decision-making levels, exposure to gender-based violence and trafficking. 
Women and girls with disabilities, Roma women and girls, lesbian, bisexual and 
transgender women, single mothers, older women and women living in rural areas face 
particular exclusion, stigmatization and discrimination, which often prevents them from 
lifting themselves out of poverty and impedes their access to public services.  
</p>
<p>25. A 2011 study found that 63.4 per cent of women aged 15 or older in the Republic of 
Moldova had experienced physical, psychological or sexual violence from an intimate 
partner during their lifetime.15 In recent years, the Republic of Moldova has been found in 
violation of the European Convention on Human Rights in cases concerning failure to 
protect women and girls from domestic violence, inadequate investigation of rape and 
coercive sterilization. In addition, in 2013, the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women was &#8220;particularly concerned&#8221; about reports of practices of 
coercive sterilization, affecting in particular women with disabilities, women in rural areas 
and Roma women.16 Indeed, the Ministry of Health has not yet made adequately clear to 
medical practitioners that, in accordance with international law, there are no legitimate 
grounds for contraceptive sterilization other than the free and informed consent of the 
women concerned.17 Women will remain exposed to a high risk of having these procedures 
performed on them until the Republic of Moldova develops clear public guidance in 
conformity with international law and widely publicizes the rules in force and provides 
guidance in this area. 
</p>
<p>26. Poverty pushes women to seek employment abroad, where, as migrant workers, they 
face increased vulnerability to trafficking, exploitation or other forms of abuse. Women 
emigrants face additional stigmatization, discrimination and abuse upon their return from 
working abroad, owing to prevalent assumptions that they were working as sex workers. It 
is a vicious cycle for women, given that up to 90 per cent of trafficked women have 
reported that they had also been victims of domestic violence.18 These and other factors, 
such as lack of adequate child-care facilities or care support for family members with 
disabilities, which usually falls on women&#8217;s shoulders, create conditions for the increasing 
feminization of poverty.  
</p>
<p>27. The Special Rapporteur commends the important legislative commitments made by 
the State, including the Law on Preventing and Combating Family Violence, the Law on 
Combating Trafficking, the Law on Ensuring Equality and the Law on Equal Opportunities 
for Men and Women. The Republic of Moldova has also adopted a policy framework to 
address human trafficking, including the National Action Plan for the Prevention and 
Combating of Trafficking in Human Beings and the National Referral System for the 
Assistance and Protection of Victims and Potential Victims of Trafficking. However, owing 
to lack of allocated financial resources, monitoring and evaluation, as well as clear 
accountability and redress mechanisms, the impact and effectiveness of those laws and 
policies is thus far questionable. In practice, few, if any, women have received remedies in 
accordance with international law standards for harm suffered due to gender discrimination

</p>
<p>and there is a high degree of scepticism among women about the possibilities of legal 
redress for gender-based discrimination or violence. 
</p>
<p>28. During 2010 and 2011, the Republic of Moldova made some progress towards 
achieving Millennium Development Goal 3 and women&#8217;s representation in local decision-
making positions increased. However, women comprised 19.2 per cent of the total number 
of Members of Parliament in 2012. At the central executive level, out of 16 ministers, only 
four are women.19 Women from stigmatized groups, in particular Roma women and women 
with disabilities, are almost completely absent from positions of elected representation at all 
levels. 
</p>
<p>29. In addition to the demonstrated lack of parity in political participation, women 
generally have lower status and occupy lower paid jobs than men. Furthermore, women of 
reproductive age are often denied employment, as employers are often reluctant to bear the 
costs associated with maternity leave. 
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to urgently tackle those barriers; 
gender equality is not only required by human rights standards, but is also a broad driver of 
economic growth and development.20  
</p>
<p><b> B. Children and youth 
</b></p>
<p>31. Under its human rights obligations, in particular the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child, the Republic of Moldova has the obligation to protect and promote the rights of all 
children in its territory, without discrimination of any kind and irrespective of the sex, race, 
national origin, ethnicity or other status of the child or his or her parents.  
</p>
<p>32. Some 28.2 per cent of Moldovan children live below the poverty line.21 Child 
poverty in rural areas, where two thirds of children live, is three times higher than in urban 
areas.22 In addition, in 2010, 45 per cent of families with children from the poorest quintile 
did not receive social transfers.23 
</p>
<p>33. Economic migration has left about 100,000 Moldovan children living without their 
parents. Their education and development are often entrusted to their grandparents or other 
relatives; in some cases, they have to fend for themselves and even head entire households. 
Those circumstances make children highly vulnerable to poverty. In addition, children 
living in poverty are very likely to skip school or drop out entirely, have difficulty 
accessing health care and nutritious food, may be subjected to marginalization, 
discrimination and trafficking, and lack effective and adequate care.  
</p>
<p>34. There have been improvements in children&#8217;s enjoyment of their right to health; for 
example, the under-five mortality rate fell by about 8.1 per cent between 2000 and 2009. 
However, the share of underweight newborn children actually increased from 4.3 per cent 
in 2000 to 5.3 per cent in 2008. Children&#8217;s right to health is also compromised. While all 
children are insured under the compulsory health insurance scheme, a quarter of households 
with children were still outside the health insurance system in 2009 and some socially

</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>excluded children are unlikely to receive health care. Those who require special and regular 
medical attention, including children with cystic fibrosis, spina bifida or other curable or 
manageable diseases, lack effective access to adequate services or medication, and their 
parents are required to make (often large) out-of-pocket payments to meet their children&#8217;s 
health-care needs. Indeed, out-of-pocket costs for children&#8217;s health and education are a 
major concern for many parents.24 
</p><p>35. Children with mental or physical disabilities are too often unnecessarily 
institutionalized, which harms their health and impedes the effective exercise of a range of 
fundamental human rights, including those covered by articles 3 and 9 of the Convention on 
the Rights of the Child, as well as their development and social integration. Approximately 
7,000 children live in residential institutions;25 studies consistently demonstrate that young 
people raised in institutions are at a much greater risk of unemployment and homelessness 
or adult institutionalization, sexual exploitation, trafficking and even suicide, than their 
peers raised in families.26  
</p>
<p>36. Despite a decrease of over 50 per cent in the overall number of children in 
residential institutions, since the start of the reform of the residential care system for 
children in 2007, the reform has had almost no impact on children with disabilities, who 
represent over 50 per cent of all children in residential care, or on children under 3 years. 
Family support and community-based services are still lacking.27 Concerted efforts in this 
regard are essential, as well as efforts to foster inclusion, acceptance and non-
discrimination in the receiving communities.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur calls on the State to fully involve young people in its 
development and poverty-reduction strategies, including through the development of a 
comprehensive and adequately funded national youth strategy that addresses all of the 
above-mentioned issues. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Older persons 
</b></p>
<p>38. Older persons constitute 14 per cent of the population of the Republic of Moldova.28 
As with children, older persons are often vulnerable as their well-being depends on their 
families and the social protection system. Furthermore, older persons are disproportionately 
affected by economic emigration as they often have to bear the burden of caring for their 
grandchildren or other relatives on an already overstretched minimal pension.  
</p>
<p>39. Pension levels in the Republic of Moldova are far below the minimum subsistence 
level. In 2013, the average retirement pension was reportedly MDL 1,049 (about US$ 75) 
per month, while the average disability pension was only MDL 826 (about US$ 60). This is 
manifestly insufficient to cover food, fuel and basic necessities. Pensions must allow for the 
enjoyment of the right to an adequate standard of living, as set forth in the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>40. Older persons have a high need for regular access to health services and costly 
medicines.29 The Special Rapporteur received reports that, on many occasions, medical

<p>facilities demand out-of-pocket payments, claiming that certain services and/or medicines 
are not covered by the Single Medical Insurance Scheme. The Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women has also expressed concern about the limited 
access by older women to health care.30 
</p>
<p>41. Many older persons living in rural areas do not have adequate access to water and 
sanitation, heating, flooring or roofing. Their daily hardships and isolation are further 
exacerbated in the cold season when roads are covered with snow and walking becomes 
difficult and dangerous. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to redouble its 
efforts to address those problems.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>42. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which the Republic of 
Moldova became a party in September 2012, necessitates a paradigm shift in the treatment 
of persons with disabilities in the Republic of Moldova.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur visited several neuropsychiatric residential institutions and 
psychiatric hospitals and was appalled at some of the conditions. She was extremely 
troubled by the fact that the system in place favours the exclusion of persons with 
disabilities from society, in particular persons with mental or intellectual disabilities, and 
that no serious efforts are made towards their integration and no direct support is provided 
to care-giving families or other trusted supporters. Although some coordination efforts have 
been made in line with article 33, paragraph 1, of the Convention, there is as yet no 
independent mechanism to promote, protect and monitor the implementation of the 
Convention, as specified in article 33, paragraph 2, thereof. 
</p>
<p>44. Article 19 of the Convention guarantees the right of persons with disabilities to live 
independently and be fully included in the community. Legislation, policies and practices 
that give rise to the institutionalization of persons with disabilities on the grounds of their 
disability must be abolished.31 As stated by the Special Rapporteur on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, there can be no therapeutic 
justification for the use of prolonged restraint of persons with disabilities in psychiatric 
institutions. Both prolonged seclusion and the use of restraints may constitute torture and 
ill-treatment32 and reinforce severe exclusion, leading to extreme poverty.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the impact of the plenary guardianship 
provisions in the Moldovan Civil Code and the recent increase in persons placed under 
guardianship.33 Placement under guardianship, which is generally linked with so-called 
&#8220;incapacitation&#8221; measures, involves placing a person in the formal legal care of another 
person or institution. A person placed under guardianship &#8212; frequently a person with 
mental or intellectual disabilities &#8212; loses all standing before the law and cannot engage in 
even the most basic social and legal acts, such as marriage, voting, claiming social benefits, 
consenting to or refusing medication. Persons placed under guardianship also have no 
standing to appeal the guardianship measure. Guardianship and incapacitation measures are

<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>incompatible with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in particular 
article 12.34 
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur understands that the State is examining its guardianship 
policy with a view to reforming it in the light of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities, as part of the National Human Rights Action Plan 2011-2014. A working 
group has reached a consensus on a draft law on supported decision-making, but this has 
not yet been circulated for formal consultation.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to immediately undertake reform in 
line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. She calls on the State 
to both adopt the draft law on supported decision-making and remove provisions on 
guardianship from the Civil Code. She welcomes the recent decision of a court in the 
southern Moldovan city of Cahul not to place a person under guardianship, citing 
obligations under article 12 of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the institution of the pilot Ombudsperson for 
Psychiatry as a first step in dealing with the often inhumane and unlawful treatment of 
persons living in institutions. She calls on the Government to swiftly formalize the post and 
ensure that the mandate is fully independent and provided with adequate resources. The 
Ombudsperson mandate should be extended to cover residential institutions under the 
Ministry of Labour, Social Protection and the Family, and access to the Ombudsperson 
should be ensured for all institutions under the mandate. The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned at reports of ongoing difficulties regarding effective access by the 
Ombudsperson to the Chisinau (Costujeni) Psychiatric Hospital. 
</p><p>49. The Special Rapporteur received reports that severe abuses, such as neglect, mental 
and physical abuse and sexual violence, continue to be committed against people with 
psychosocial and intellectual disabilities in residential institutions and psychiatric hospitals. 
She was concerned about the lack of sexual and reproductive health care in the institutions 
that she visited, as well as unsanitary and unhygienic conditions. In 2012, the Institutional 
Ombudsman of Psychiatric Hospitals reported that forced abortions in psychiatric and 
social care institutions were a common measure to prevent births which were deemed 
unwanted by institutional staff, in the absence of accessible information about reproductive 
and sexual health and contraception.35 The women concerned were victims of multiple 
forms of discrimination, in breach of both the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms 
of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. The Special Rapporteur is aware of ongoing criminal proceedings pursuant to 
the allegations of 19 women concerning serial sexual assault, including rape, over a period 
of years, at the Balti neuropsychiatric residential institution.36 She is concerned at the slow 
pace of the proceedings, which were initiated in March 2013. The Special Rapporteur is 
also very concerned at the decision of prosecutors not to open criminal proceedings in 
respect of allegations made in 2013 of sexual abuse of residents at the Cocieri 
neuropsychiatric residential institution, apparently on the grounds that, inter alia, their 
disability made them unreliable complainants. The Special Rapporteur notes that reports of 
sexual abuse by staff in neuropsychiatric residential institutions, including the Cocieri 
institution, had been brought to the attention of the Government since at least 2008, when

</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture first raised concerns.37 The 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to ensure that all perpetrators of sexual assault 
and other forms of abuse are brought swiftly to justice. 
</p><p>50. At the end of her mission to the Republic of Moldova in September 2013, the 
Special Rapporteur urged the Government to ensure the immediate closure of the 
tuberculosis and the narcopsychiatric units of the Balti Psychiatric Hospital in Pavlovca 
village, Briceni district, and the reintegration of the patients into their communities. She is 
concerned to learn that the Pavlovca institution has not been closed, but rather converted 
into another institution. Although the new institution is nominally for palliative care 
purposes, patients institutionalized there apparently include persons with dementia and/or 
no community support. It is unclear if anyone was actually de-institutionalized from the 
psychiatric hospital or whether the patients were merely transferred to other institutions. 
The Special Rapporteur again urges the Government to close the Pavlovca institution 
without delay and ensure that the persons institutionalized there are reintegrated into the life 
of their communities, in line with article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur understands that the State is currently developing a de-
institutionalization strategy for adults, including a law on the social inclusion of people 
with disabilities, which provides for the monitoring of the implementation of national 
policies and promotion of the social integration of persons with disabilities to be carried out 
by the National Council on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. She urges the 
Government to complete work on the strategy in the shortest possible time and to ensure 
that its provisions are implemented swiftly with a view to complying with the Convention 
on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Roma 
</b></p>
<p>52. Despite the provisions on equality and non-discrimination in the Moldovan 
Constitution and the Law on Ensuring Equality, the Roma are still stigmatized, 
discriminated against and marginalized. The Special Rapporteur visited Roma communities 
living in destitution and isolation, and was concerned at their general housing conditions, 
including the absence of running water, sanitation facilities, heating and, in some cases, 
even electricity.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur met with Roma women who were eager to take up jobs, but 
who were unable to do so because child care for preschool children was only available for a 
few hours a day, if at all, in their localities. In some cases, they were unable to send their 
children to school owing to a lack of shoes or inability to pay the informal costs requested 
by schools. Many of their husbands were working abroad, but were earning too little to 
send remittances home. These empirical findings were supported by a number of similar 
reports.  
</p>
<p>54. Despite some positive measures taken by the Government, the Special Rapporteur 
remains concerned about the lack of access to information by the Roma community, which  
seems to be hampering the exercise of their rights. It is the duty of the State to ensure that 
its population has access to information through channels that are physically accessible and 
culturally appropriate.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>55. Another concern is the lack of Roma participation in political life. The Special 
Rapporteur learned, for example, that there is not a single Roma woman in any position of 
elected representation in the Republic of Moldova. Although the Ministry of Justice has 
registered a Roma party which has participated in elections, due to stigma and exclusion, 
Roma have to date been excluded from electable positions in all of the mainstream parties. 
There is only a handful of Roma in elected positions anywhere in the Republic of Moldova, 
and few, if any, Roma civil servants. Critical challenges that impede Roma enjoyment of 
the rights to housing, education and work will persist unless they are given opportunities to 
participate in political life on equal terms. That should be a priority in the development of 
policies. 
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur commends the Republic of Moldova for introducing 
mediators in Roma communities throughout the country. While some mediators are already 
working, the target of 15 mediators by the end of 2013 has not  been met. The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that the complete planned network of 48 mediators will not be in 
place until the end of 2014. At least one locality has refused outright to engage a mediator. 
Insofar as the mediators are envisioned as a first step towards Roma inclusion, this 
beginning is inauspicious. The Special Rapporteur calls on the local authorities to engage 
mediators in full compliance with the principles of transparency, meaningful and effective 
participation of the relevant communities, access to information and accountability. Noting 
that 2014 and 2015 are election years in the Republic of Moldova, the Special Rapporteur 
also calls for strengthened efforts on the part of the Government to include Roma, in 
particular Roma women, in the election processes, including as candidates for electable 
positions on party lists. She further calls on the Government to provide adequate resources 
for the implementation and monitoring of all policies to ensure that the Roma can enjoy 
their rights on an equal basis with the rest of the population.  
</p>
<p>57. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur saw evidence of the segregation of Roma 
children in schools, which is illegal under international human rights law. Such segregation 
reflects the insufficient attention paid to barriers to inclusion in mainstream schools that is 
imposed by school management and non-Roma families. The Special Rapporteur calls on 
the Government to quickly integrate all schools, including those in Otaci, Tibirica, 
Stejareni/Lozova and Parcani/Racula, with the support of adjunct measures, so as to 
facilitate the effective inclusion of Roma children.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Population in the Transnistrian region 
</b></p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur observed that the dynamics of poverty did not differ 
significantly in the Transnistrian region. However, she noted that those living in poverty in 
the region faced additional challenges, especially with regard to isolation from international 
development assistance. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur notes that, pursuant to 
discussions with the Government of the Republic of Moldova and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights during her visit to the Republic in November 2011, a 
United Nations Senior Expert was appointed to study human rights issues in the 
Transnistrian region on the left bank of the Nistru River and to propose recommendations 
for action in that regard. His February 2013 report includes a broad range of 
recommendations for strengthening the human rights of persons living in poverty in the 
Transnistrian region.38

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>59. Women in the Transnistrian region face similar challenges to women elsewhere in 
the Republic of Moldova, including a high risk of domestic violence.39 The Special 
Rapporteur was informed that a draft law on combating domestic violence has been 
pending in the Supreme Soviet for months. She calls on the de facto authorities to act 
without further delay to bring the legal framework in effect in the Transnistrian region into 
conformity with international law in relation to domestic violence.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur also urges the de facto authorities to begin the de-
institutionalization of adults with disabilities and to remove provisions on guardianship 
from the Transnistrian legal framework.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur met with farmers who had lost the rights to their land in the 
process that ended collective farming in the 1990s and early 2000s. The farmers have been 
deprived of a subsistence income as a result of being dispossessed of their land and they 
have effectively been prevented from seeking justice owing to changes in the relevant 
regulations. The Special Rapporteur calls on the de facto authorities to take measures to 
restore land titles to farmers who were dispossessed of land in the changes that took place 
over the past two decades.  
</p>
<p>62. Finally, the Special Rapporteur calls on the de facto authorities of the Transnistrian 
region, the Government of the Republic of Moldova and the international community to 
address the recommendations contained in the Senior Expert&#8217;s report in a comprehensive 
manner and to act without delay towards their implementation. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Challenges to the enjoyment of specific rights by those living 
in poverty 
</b></p>
<p>63. While persons living in poverty face challenges in relation to a wide range of rights, 
in this section the Special Rapporteur addresses those rights that she perceives as being  
particularly challenging.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Right to health  
</b></p>
<p>64. Under article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, the Republic of Moldova has the obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right of 
everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. 
This includes the obligation to ensure that health facilities, goods and services are 
accessible to everyone, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the 
population, without discrimination.  
</p>
<p>65. In the Republic of Moldova, 50 per cent of all hospitals are located in Chisinau. 
Some rural primary health-care facilities reportedly do not meet national standards in terms 
of infrastructure and availability of equipment, essential medicines and specialists.40 The 
Special Rapporteur urges the Government to strengthen efforts to improve access to 
affordable good quality health-care services in rural areas. She also calls on the 
Government to take immediate measures to ensure that the right to free and informed 
consent for any intervention in the health field is fully respected at all levels.

<p><b>A/HRC/26/28/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>66. In general, Moldovans perceive that those living in poverty face the most 
discrimination in accessing their right to health, owing to their inability to pay, 
unemployment, lack of medical insurance and their inability to pay extra out-of-pocket 
costs.41 The Special Rapporteur is concerned that many parents from vulnerable groups are 
not aware that children are insured by the State, and they do not seek necessary medical 
attention for their children because they cannot afford to pay. 
</p>
<p>67. Persons living in poverty who suffer compound discrimination based on gender, 
ethnicity (in particular Roma), sexual orientation or gender identity, age or health status 
experience additional challenges. For example, women with HIV/AIDS have been denied 
prosthetic operations on apparently pretextual grounds, and there have been repeated 
reports of ambulances not coming, or arriving after undue delay, in Roma settlements or in 
response to calls from older persons. Abortion and contraception have only limited 
coverage in the basic health insurance package and a broad range of treatments are 
discretionary or rationed. The Special Rapporteur heard plausible reports of cases of 
discretionary allocation of limited health-care resources away from disfavoured or 
marginalized groups, in particular Roma.  
</p>
<p>68. The State should improve its compulsory health insurance coverage and ensure that 
financial cost is not a barrier for persons living in poverty to access good quality health care 
and necessary pharmaceutical care, including non-emergency care. The Government must 
collect data regularly in order to inform improved service provision.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Right to education 
</b></p>
<p>69. The economic and demographic challenges facing the Republic of Moldova directly 
affect children&#8217;s enjoyment of their right to education. Many parents and grandparents 
cannot send the children in their care to school for various reasons, including inaccessibility 
of schools in rural areas during winter and indirect and informal costs, for example for 
books, enrolment, food and clothing.  
</p>
<p>70. While preschool enrolment has recently improved, the gross enrolment rate in 
compulsory education dropped from 95.1 per cent in 2003 to 89.7 per cent in 2012.42 In 
addition, increased emigration of families with children, combined with reduced birth rates, 
has resulted in a decrease in the overall number of pupils. That, together with budget 
constraints, prompted the Government to adopt &#8220;school optimization&#8221; measures, which 
have resulted in the closure of dozens of schools across the country,43 posing a particular 
challenge for families in rural areas, especially those who cannot afford transportation 
costs. The enjoyment of the right to education has been further affected by the deteriorating 
quality of education, reportedly caused by the misallocation of funds in the education 
system and the emigration of qualified teaching staff. 
</p>
<p>71. Children with disabilities face challenges in exercising their right to education, due, 
inter alia, to the widespread lack of inclusive education provisions, lack of effective 
reasonable accommodation measures for children with disabilities to take part in 
mainstream education on an equal basis with other children, stigmatization, discrimination 
and lack of specialized transportation.

</p>
<p>72. Similarly, problematic practices in education have been documented for Roma 
children. Unchecked ethnic bullying and lack of effective inclusion measures have led to 
poor attendance rates in some communities, while some segments of the impoverished 
Roma community also expressed shame about sending children to school without proper 
clothing or school materials and also reported an inability to meet the demands for informal 
payments requested by some school officials. Racial segregation remains a problem in 
some school districts.  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made by the Ministry of Education to 
address the above-mentioned issues. She is encouraged by the ongoing development of the 
National Education 2020 Strategy, which would include measures to improve access to 
preschool, improve school access in remote areas, increase the number of child-care 
facilities and integrate de-institutionalized children with disabilities into mainstream 
schools. However, the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the impact of the &#8220;school 
optimization&#8221; measures, which have resulted in sudden school closures in a number of 
communities, without adequate prior consultation with the affected communities, in 
accordance with international standards, and which severely affect the enjoyment of the 
right to education of children, in particular those living in remote areas.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to social security  
</b></p>
<p>74. The right to social security is an international human right, as set out in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women. In its general comment No. 19 (2008) on the right to social security, the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considers that States should take 
measures to establish social protection systems under domestic law, ensure their 
sustainability, ensure that benefits are adequate in amount and duration, and that the level 
of benefits and the form in which they are provided are in compliance with the principles of 
human dignity and non-discrimination. States are obliged to establish social protection 
systems with both contributory and non-contributory branches; for persons living in 
poverty, the latter is especially important. 
</p>
<p>75. More than 1 million people, including 650,000 pensioners, benefit from the 
Moldovan social protection system.44 For the poorest families, social transfers often 
represent the only permanent income source, especially during winter months when income 
from agriculture is not available. In 2012, the compulsory health insurance system covered 
about 75 to 80 per cent of the population;45 however, 96.3 per cent of patients reported 
having to make out-of-pocket payments for medical services,46 and Roma were twice as 
likely as non-Roma to lack health insurance.47

<p>76. The 2008 Law on Social Assistance removed predefined categories of welfare 
beneficiaries (categorical targeting) and introduced a means-tested targeting mechanism.

<p>the topic of social protection,48 emphasizing that through universal programmes States are 
better able to satisfy their obligations under human rights law to ensure, to the greatest 
extent possible, the inclusion of all those in need, and to minimize any exclusion of those 
who must be reached and protected as a matter of priority, i.e. the poorest of the poor. 
When means-testing methods are used, active measures should be taken to ensure that the 
poorest of the poor are not excluded as a result of inaccurate targeting. When methods to 
identify the beneficiaries are complex and opaque, intended beneficiaries are unable to 
claim their entitlements or hold the administration of the programmes accountable for 
mistakes or errors.  
</p>
<p>77. According to information received, the Ajutor Social scheme only reaches 
approximately half of eligible households. The existing targeting and eligibility system 
creates unavoidable inequalities that are perceived as unfair by the population,49 who have 
difficulties in understanding the means-testing formulas.50 This results in some eligible 
households mistakenly believing that they are ineligible, as well as the reported 
disqualification of persons who evidently might need support. 
</p>
<p>78. Large rural families, for example, remain widely excluded under the means-tested 
targeting and are disadvantaged when it comes to the calculation of transfer amounts. The 
Roma also face problems in enrolling due to lack of identity documents and other factors. 
Application and enrolment entail opportunity and financial costs, due to time-consuming 
documentation requirements and the cost of transportation to regional centres to enrol, 
which discourages applications from the poorest families. In addition, families not 
receiving Ajutor Social cash transfers have experienced worsening poverty as coverage 
from other social transfers has been scaled back.51 This underlines the need for a more 
comprehensive social protection system in the Republic of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>79. In principle, human rights standards are not compromised by the use of targeted 
schemes as a form of prioritization of the most disadvantaged groups, as long as they are 
implemented through a long-term strategy of progressively ensuring universal protection. 
Implementing an income or poverty targeted system introduces exclusion errors, as well as 
the possibility of corruption and stigmatization, because the selection of beneficiaries is a 
complex and often controversial process. The exclusion of rightful beneficiaries constitutes 
a violation of their right to social security.  
</p>
<p>80. There is a general lack of reliable and disaggregated data on social protection needs 
and impacts.52 Indicators used to assess eligibility for social support seem to be unrelated to 
actual need. For example, the Special Rapporteur heard reports of persons disqualified from 
receiving social support as a result of owning arable land, even if they were obviously 
incapable of working the land, owing to age or infirmity.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Right to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>81. As recognized by the Human Rights Council, the human right to safe drinking water 
and sanitation is derived from the right to an adequate standard of living, as set out in 
article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and is

</p>
<p>82. In the Republic of Moldova, 62 per cent of the population enjoy access to safe 
drinking water and 56.6 per cent to improved sewage systems.54 There is a striking 
discrepancy in access to public sewerage between urban (75.4 per cent) and rural (1.6 per 
cent) areas. 
</p><p>83. The Special Rapporteur visited rural areas during her mission and witnessed a 
widespread lack of running water and sanitation facilities. Villagers rely largely on wells, 
which become less accessible in the winter. In one village, the Special Rapporteur 
witnessed a dispute between neighbours over the use of a well, which had a very negative 
impact on an older woman caring for her minor granddaughter. The Special Rapporteur 
also visited Schinoasa village, a Roma community on the margins of the town of Tibirica in 
Calarasi County, which was fortunate to have had a brand new water pump installed. 
However, owing to the lack of electricity and funds for system connections, the pump 
remained unconnected for half of the community and only functioned intermittently. The 
Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to take comprehensive measures to ensure 
water and sanitation facilities for all. She understands that discussions are ongoing as to the 
adoption of a new water and sanitation strategy.55 The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to undertake the new strategy on the basis of a human rights approach.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>84. Despite the fact that the Republic of Moldova enjoys middle-income country status, 
the Special Rapporteur stresses that international cooperation is crucial.  
</p>
<p>85. In order to avoid protection gaps and eliminate negative impacts on the poorest and 
socially excluded population in the Transnistrian region, the international community, 
including international organizations and key donors, should maintain its support through 
technical advice and flexible, targeted and strategic funding.56  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusion and recommendations 
</b>86. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the steps already taken by the Republic of 
Moldova to tackle poverty and inequality, to consider recommendations made by 
international human rights bodies and to improve the effectiveness of poverty 
reduction measures. However, as evidenced in the present report, considerable 
challenges remain, particularly with regard to increasing inequalities, ongoing large-
scale emigration, lack of implementation of legislation and poverty-reduction policies, 
and the ongoing risk of corruption. In order to ensure a future in which the Republic 
of Moldova ceases to be the poorest country in Europe, immediate action must be 
taken to implement poverty-reduction strategies effectively and align them with 
human rights.

<p><b>(d) Establish an independent monitoring body for the rights of persons with 
disabilities, as provided for in article 33, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities, within the national Ombuds institution. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>With regard to the situation of groups particularly vulnerable to poverty, the 
Special Rapporteur recommends that the Republic of Moldova:</b> 
</p>
<p><b>  Women and girls 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Ensure the effective implementation of gender equality policies and 
policies  protecting women&#8217;s rights, including the Law on Preventing and Combating

<p><b>  Children and youth 
</b></p>
<p><b> (i) Ensure the full implementation of the reform of the residential care 
system for children, paying particular attention to children with disabilities, and put
