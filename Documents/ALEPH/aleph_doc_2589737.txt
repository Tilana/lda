RANDGOLD DIGS DEEP AFTER TOUGH Q2 TO SUSTAIN 2016 PERFORMANCE
FORECAST
London, 4 August 2016 - Randgold Resources’ production and costs were hit in the quarter to
June by a long mill downtime at Tongon and the Kibali plant’s continuing transition to a mixed-ore
feed, but the company says the improvement expected in the second half of the year should boost
its 2016 results to within its market guidance.
The flagship Loulo-Gounkoto complex ended the quarter ahead of target but with one of Tongon’s
two milling circuits losing 46 days after a breakdown and Kibali still dealing with throughput,
recovery and dilution challenges presented by multiple ore feeds, group production was down 4%
quarter on quarter at 281 494oz while total cash cost per ounce rose 12% to $727/oz. With the
higher gold price only partly buffering the impact on the bottom line, profit was down 8% at $58.7
million.
Compared to 2015’s record interim results, however, profit for the six months to June was up 11%,
production was steady and total cash cost was 1% lower. Also on the positive side, net cash
generated increased by 6% quarter on quarter and cash holdings rose by 7% to $272.7 million.
Chief executive Mark Bristow described the quarter as one of the toughest in years but said in June
and July both Tongon and Kibali had made significant progress, with Tongon fixing the mill and
completing the commissioning of its new quaternary circuit, and the new Kombokolo satellite pit at
Kibali expected to improve its feed flexibility and grades. The development of Kibali as a complete
project remains ahead of schedule.
“Looking ahead at the rest of the year, all our teams have been reworking and optimising their mine
plans to ensure that we end 2016 within guidance. In addition, we’re intensifying our focus on
critical operational issues to ensure that we deliver a substantial second-half improvement,” he
said.
Bristow said in addition to another strong performance by the Loulo-Gounkoto complex, the
quarter’s highlight was the significant advances made by its exploration teams.
“The quality and scope of our exploration portfolio continue to grow and there is a solid pipeline of
projects being developed through our resource triangle, from grassroots and generative work to
resource definition. I believe we have at least three advanced targets, already scheduled for drill
test campaigns, with real potential to become important assets,” he said.
The advanced targets include Fonondara and Kassere on the Boundiali permit in northern Côte
d’Ivoire and Sofia in Senegal, which looks likely to provide a high grade, free-leaching satellite
resource for the feasibility study-stage Massawa project.
In Mali, the greenfields target Bakolobi is currently being drilled while drilling at Loulo’s Gara
underground mine has identified significant potential to extend its life and replace this year’s
depletion at Loulo. At neighbouring Gounkoto, the feasibility study on the superpit option will be
concluded by the end of this year. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the discovery and rapid
development of the Kombokolo satellite illustrates the continued prospectivity of the Kibali permit
area and augurs well for the Moku joint venture west of Kibali.
“While the more advanced work is ongoing, our greenfields team is also feeding the base of the
resource triangle with new ground. The Bambadji joint venture with Iamgold has recently been
renewed, we are applying for new permits in southern and western Mali as well as in southern
Côte d’Ivoire, where we are also negotiating a new joint venture,” Bristow says.
‘The rest of the gold mining industry continues to shy away from exploration and there is now a
consensus that new gold production will consequently continue to decline. This, in combination
with growing global geopolitical and economic jitters, must be good for the gold price, at least in
the long run. That’s where Randgold’s focus has always been fixed. We’re building a sustainably
profitable business on a very solid foundation, but considering the internal and external challenges
ahead, our teams will have to test and, if necessary, re-invent the way they operate on a
continuous basis.”

COMMENTS
Gold sales for the quarter of $354.4 million increased by 2% from $345.8 million in the previous
quarter. Group gold production for the quarter of 281 494oz was 4% below the previous quarter
due to a decrease in production at Tongon and Kibali. At the same time, the average gold price
received of $1 264/oz increased by 6% quarter on quarter (2016 Q1: $1 187/oz), which offset the
drop in production. Gold sales were in line with the corresponding quarter of 2015, reflecting the
higher average gold price received and lower gold production.
Total cash costs for the quarter of $203.8 million were up 8% from the previous quarter primarily
due to challenges at Kibali associated with variable ore feeds, as well as at the Loulo-Gounkoto
complex with higher underground costs. Total cash costs for the quarter were in line with the
corresponding quarter of 2015.
Total cash cost per ounce of $727/oz increased by 12% quarter on quarter, reflecting the lower
production during the quarter as well as increased costs. This was primarily the result of the lower
grade and recovery achieved at Kibali, as well as lower throughput at Tongon following extended
mill downtime relating to a damaged journal. Compared to the corresponding quarter of 2015, total
cash cost per ounce increased by 6%, driven by decreased production, most notably at Kibali and
Tongon, as a result of lower grade and recovery.
Profit from mining decreased by 4% to $150.6 million from the previous quarter’s $156.8 million,
and was in line with the corresponding quarter of 2015, largely as a result of the increase in total
cash costs, especially at Kibali, partially offset by the increase in the average gold price received.
Exploration and corporate expenditure of $13.0 million increased by 46% quarter on quarter,
principally due to increased exploration expenditure incurred during the quarter, in line with the
plan. Exploration and corporate costs were in line with the same quarter of the previous year.
Depreciation and amortisation of $35.9 million decreased by 5% from the previous quarter and by
16% from the corresponding 2015 quarter, primarily due to the decrease in throughput at Tongon.
Other income in the quarter of $2.3 million increased from $1.3 million in the previous quarter and
down from $3.8 million in the corresponding period of the prior year. The increase quarter on
quarter is the result of net operational foreign exchange gains incurred during the quarter,
compared to net exchange losses incurred in the prior quarter and lower foreign exchange gains
incurred in the current quarter compared to the corresponding quarter of 2015. These gains and
losses arise from the settlement of invoices in currencies other than the US dollar, as well as the
translation of balances denominated in currencies such as the CFA, euro and South African rand
to the US dollar rate and reflects the movements in these currencies during the respective quarter.
Other income also includes management fees from Kibali and Morila.
Share of profits from joint ventures decreased by 28% to $6.1 million from the previous quarter’s
$8.5 million. The decrease was the result of a weaker operational quarter from both Morila and
Kibali, as described above. Morila’s share of equity accounted joint venture profits decreased from
a profit of $1.1 million in Q1 2016 to a loss of $0.7 million in Q2 2016. Kibali’s share of equity
accounted joint venture profits decreased from $7.5 million in Q1 2016 to $6.7 million in the current
quarter. The share of profits from the Kibali joint ventures are stated after a deferred tax credit of
$3.7 million (attributable) for the quarter. Kibali’s equity accounted joint venture also includes
depreciation on a tonnes milled basis which was in line with the prior quarter. Compared to the
corresponding quarter of the previous year, profit from joint ventures was down 82% due to lower
gold sales and profits from both Morila and Kibali.
Income tax expense of $21.6 million was in line with the prior quarter. The income tax expense
increased by 69% from the corresponding quarter of the prior year, as a result of the increase in
profits at Loulo and Gounkoto.
Profit for the quarter was down 8% from the previous quarter and in line with the corresponding
quarter of 2015, reflecting the decrease in profit from mining, as well as increased exploration
expenditure during the quarter. Basic earnings per share decreased by 10% to $0.52 quarter on
quarter (Q1 2016: $0.58), reflecting the lower profits. Compared to Q2 2015, basic earnings per
share decreased by 10%, also reflecting the lower profits.
Net cash generated from operations for the quarter of $101.5 million increased by 6% from the
previous quarter and by 42% from the corresponding quarter in 2015, primarily reflecting
decreases in operating working capital.
OPERATIONS
LOULO-GOUNKOTO COMPLEX
The combined Q2 production for the Loulo-Gounkoto complex was 170 190oz (Loulo: 105 056oz
and Gounkoto: 65 134oz), almost in line with the previous quarter (Q1 2016: 172 554oz). The ratio
of production from Loulo and Gounkoto of 62:38 was in line with the long term plan of
approximately 60:40. Tonnes processed was in line with the previous quarter at 1 212kt (Q1 2016:
1 211kt) as a result of the sustained high plant run time while the head grade milled at 4.8g/t was
slightly lower than the prior quarter. Recoveries were slightly ahead of the previous quarter at
91.0% (Q1 2016: 90.9%), as the mine continued with ore blending and the enhancement of the
control system.
The gold stripping performance increased substantially following the successful commissioning of
the second elution circuit.
The total cash cost per ounce increased by 18% to $648/oz for the quarter (Q1 2016: $551/oz) as a
result of the increased unit cost and lower head grade milled. Unit costs were impacted by higher
underground mining costs, with proportionately more ore coming from development as opposed to
normal stoping, as well as a significant increase in the stripping ratio at Gounkoto. The increased
underground development is expected to provide additional flexibility for the remainder of the year.
Costs were also impacted by additional reagent usage, partially to offset the reduction in pre-
oxygenation following maintenance to the Aachen reactors and reduced residence time after the
replacement of agitators in the CIL tanks.
Sustainability
A notable improvement in the quality of education at the schools provided by the mine in the
surrounding villages was observed with results this year being almost twice the national average,
which was also significantly higher than the prior year. A bursary committee has been established
and will be effected in Q3. Similarly, 56 out of 57 students at the Loulo agricollege have passed the
final test and the next phase will start in Q3.
The mine also supported the government led vaccination campaign against polio and donated a
1 MW genset to Kenieba town to augment their power supply. A partnership with NGO WaterAid is
scheduled to start in Q3.

LOULO
There were two lost time injuries (LTIs) recorded during the quarter with a lost time injury frequency
rate (LTIFR) of 1.36 per million hours worked versus zero recorded in the previous quarter.
On a standalone basis, Loulo produced 105 056oz of gold (Q1 2016: 99 101oz) at a total cash cost
of $575/oz (Q1 2016: $523/oz). The increase in production was primarily due to a 9% increase in
head grade milled. Total cash cost per ounce increased to $575/oz on the back of the higher unit
cost, as described above.
Profit from mining of $71.6 million was 11% higher than the previous quarter’s $64.3 million
because of the increase in gold produced and sold and higher average gold price received,
partially offset by the increased cost of production.

Loulo underground
Loulo underground production was just ahead of the previous quarter, with the new owner mining
team bedding down, as it continued to work on further operational improvements.
The development in both Yalea and Gara has also been steady with the improved availability of
headings, jumbos and performance of operators. The focus has been on increasing mineable
reserves to overcome any delay or shortfall in paste filling, which has experienced some
blockages. A comprehensive review has resulted in a set of actions to remedy the issues and
optimise the design mix and reticulation.

Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for the quarter amounted to $24.6 million and included $16.0 million on the
development of the Yalea and Gara underground mines, mostly on the construction of refrigeration
plants, in line with the mine plans. Commissioning of the plants is expected to be completed by Q3
2016.
GOUNKOTO
There were zero LTIs recorded during the quarter with an LTIFR of zero per million hours worked
versus 1.88 recorded in the previous quarter.
On a standalone basis, Gounkoto produced 65 134oz of gold (Q1 2016: 73 453oz) at a total cash
cost per ounce of $762/oz (Q1 2016: $589/oz). The decrease in production was due to lower ore
tonnes mined and substituting feed with lower grade stockpiles, in line with plan to manage
working capital, resulting in a 14% decrease in head grade milled, partially offset by a
2% increase in tonnes processed. Total cash cost per ounce increased to $762/oz from $589/oz in
the previous quarter on the back of the lower production and increased unit costs, as described
above.
Profit from mining for the quarter of $33.1 million was lower than the previous quarter (Q1 2016:
$43.7 million), reflecting the lower gold production and gold sold at a higher cash cost of
production, partially offset by a higher average gold price received during the current quarter.

Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for the quarter amounted to $1.3 million, in line with the previous quarter,
mostly on the super pit feasibility drilling and exploration.
MORILA
No LTIs were recorded during the quarter compared to one in the previous quarter and the LTIFR
was nil (Q1 2016: 2.21).
Gold production for the quarter of 14 432oz was 11% below the previous quarter (Q1 2016:
16 191oz), mainly due to the lower head grade milled of 0.6g/t (Q1 2016: 0.7g/t) resulting from
feeding a combination of mineralised waste and some initial lower grade tailings. As a result, total
cash costs increased to $996/oz compared to $915/oz in the previous quarter, with unit costs in
line.
A 730kt @ 0.62g/t (15koz) extra stockpile of mineralised waste material was identified during the
quarter and is planned to be fed in Q3. Initial treatment of the Tailings Storage Facility (TSF)
material commenced in preparation for full treatment scheduled for after the completion of hard
rock mining. A trade off study is underway between the processing of mineralised waste and
tailings to determine the optimum timing to switch to full TSF retreatment. Management continued
to engage with the State and affected communities to obtain the necessary approvals for the
Domba project in order to proceed as soon as possible. If the necessary approvals are not
obtained in the next quarter, mine production is expected to be reduced to approximately 55koz for
the year. The mine continues to work on finding other satellite pits that could be processed through
the plant.
Sustainability
The agribusiness initiative, being developed as part of the mine’s closure plan, was restructured
during the quarter with the various initiatives being separated into business units - supply,
production, transformation/manufacturing and commercialisation. The mine team has been
engaging with a number of potential project developers, research institutions, financial institutions,
the Government and the Malian private sector to develop the initiative.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for the quarter was $0.6 million, mainly on the TSF retreatment project.

TONGON
Tongon mine recorded one LTI in Q2 2016. The LTIFR for the quarter was 0.84 compared to zero
in the previous quarter. No major environmental incidents or social grievances occurred during the
quarter.
Tongon produced 50 391oz of gold in Q2 2016, 7% down on the previous quarter, primarily as a
result of a 24% decrease in throughput. Lower throughput stemmed from 46 days of downtime on
one mill as a result of mechanical failures and the subsequent poor repairs to the mill journal and
associated replacement of the slipper pads. During this time, Tongon entered and completed the
final phase of its extensive crusher expansion and mill circuit upgrade. Both head grade and
recovery improved 19% and 2% respectively in Q2, compared to the previous quarter. Following
the lower production in the quarter, the mine has revised its 2016 business plan and is now
targeting to exceed 260 000oz for the year.
Total cash cost per ounce increased to $932/oz (Q1 2016: $900/oz) on the back of the reduced
gold production.
The grid to generated power ratio decreased to 82:18 for Q2 (Q1 2016: 88:12). Constructive
engagement with CIE power utility significantly improved in the quarter with Government positively
facilitating this engagement. The mine is working with the utility to find solutions to permanently
secure grid power supply and stability.
Total tonnes mined decreased by 7% compared to the previous quarter. Q2 ore tonnes mined
increased by 6%, in line with the mine’s strategy to ensure sufficient ore stocks for feeding during
Q2 and Q3, following the new quaternary crusher commissioning and production ramp-up.
Profit from mining activity increased by 7% to $16.4 million compared to the previous quarter,
mainly stemming from a 7% higher average gold price received of $1 270/oz, partially offset by the
decrease in gold produced. Tongon declared a maiden dividend of $21.5 million to shareholders,
including the State, at the end of the quarter.
Sustainability
The mine continued investing in the development of educational programmes, community health
and agricultural projects designed to provide post mining employment. Small scale projects have
been initiated in maize and livestock farming while the existing fish farming facilities are being
expanded.
Capital expenditure
The quaternary crusher and dewatering circuit was completed in the quarter. Capital expenditure
for the quarter amounted to $3.8 million, primarily on the quaternary crushing circuit and TSF
Phase II extension. Six new 3512B CAT generators have been ordered to boost the mine’s total
generated capacity to 24MW, providing back-up power to the total process plant and installation is
scheduled for Q4. Other power upgrade projects in progress include the reconfiguration of the
medium voltage distribution system to improve power usage flexibility and enable the mine to
better manage grid power supply instability. In consultation with CIE the mine is investigating the
conversion of the grid power supply from a medium voltage to a high voltage tariff to reduce the
cost of supply.

KIBALI
There were two LTIs recorded during the quarter at Kibali, compared to zero in the previous
quarter. No major environmental incidences occurred during the period.
Kibali produced 122 532oz in Q2, a 6% decrease on the prior quarter, at a total cash cost of
$823/oz (Q1 2016: $740/oz). As highlighted in the previous quarterly report, the KCD pit was
mined out in Q1 and consequently the mine’s reliance on the satellite pits for ore feed increased
during the quarter under review. The complexity of dealing with multiple ore types from different
sources affected throughput, recovery and grade, resulting in reduced production and a higher
cash cost per ounce. Management has taken measures to address the issues relating to the ore
feed and were able to deliver improved stability and operating performance towards the end of the
quarter and into July.
Focus is now on opening up new satellite pits in 2016 and 2017 to provide additional free milling
ore and to add flexibility to the mine feed schedule, with mining at the higher grade Kombokolo pit
scheduled to commence at the end of Q3 2016. As a result, management is still targeting to exceed
600 000oz of production for the year.
Profit from mining activity decreased by 8% to $54.4 million in the current quarter (Q1 2016: $58.9
million), reflecting the lower production and higher cash costs, partially offset by the higher average
gold price received.
Sustainability
Kibali’s work on its community development projects continued as planned during the quarter, with
a focus on local economic development initiatives, and a number of new business initiatives have
been started with the help of the microfinance project to provide alternative livelihoods in the
Kokiza community.

Construction of the metallurgical facility and infrastructure
Remedial work on last year’s breached berm at the Ambarau hydropower project is now complete.
The extension of the Ambarau permanent hardfill wall foundations was initiated during the quarter
and first power is still on schedule for Q4 2016. Construction on Azambi, the third new hydropower
station, progressed during the quarter in line with budget and plan.
As per design, Kibali will proceed with the extension of its concentrate handling facilities, including
the installation of additional ultra-fine grind capacity. This is necessary to enable the process plant
to optimise recovery during the treatment of twin sulphide streams.
Declines and underground production
The Q1 ramp-up of underground production was maintained in Q2, with the total ore produced from
underground at 368 896t. In addition, underground development has accelerated with the mine
completing 3.1km of underground development during the quarter.

Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure for the quarter amounted to $47.7 million (at 100%), increasing from the
previous quarter due to the increased activity at Ambarau and Azambi as well as the progression
of the off-shaft construction and development programme. The phase 2 capital estimate remains in
line with previous guidance.
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
MALI
Gara Far South underground extension
Drilling continued in the Gara Far South (GFS) conversion programme to convert the inferred
resource extension defined last year into an indicated resource. Rolling block model updates have
shown a large increase in the underground indicated mineral resource of 3.8Mt at 4.45g/t for
545koz as a result of the conversion drilling completed to date. Portions of inferred resources
surrounding this area continue to be drilled.
A scoping study has commenced to complete trade off decisions such as access, mining method
and direction together with ore handling, ventilation and scheduling constraints. A cost analysis
was performed to calculate the economic cut-off at a $1 000/oz gold price to identify only those
levels of area which add value, which will add the location of the access capital development.
Geotechnical logging is currently underway of all the resource drilling completed and will be used
to generate lithological and structural models which will be used together with geotechnical
fracture logging to generate a three dimensional mining rock mass model of the area. Metallurgical
bottle roll testwork of the area has confirmed an average recovery of 93%, confirming the area is
metallurgically similar to the area currently being mined. A prefeasibility and reserve update is
planned to be completed by the end of the year.
Gounkoto superpit feasibility
Geotechnical feasibility work was concluded and confirmed the competency of the superpit wall
material to allow the design of safe and economic slope parameters. A final number of resource
diamond holes are being drilled into certain parts of the deeper mineral resource to confirm the
grade variability at depth. Hydrological drilling and modelling is still underway together with design
and costing of the pump capacity and surface storm diversion infrastructure. Now that the
geotechnical design has been finalised, a final Whittle optimisation and mining study is underway
to determine the optimal mining fleet and stripping schedules. Metallurgical testwork of recent
resource drilling has confirmed good recoveries of 93%, similar to the current material being
processed. The open pit feasibility is expected to be completed in Q4 of this year. An investigation
is currently underway to review the option of mining the material below the superpit with a short
decline from the lower portion of the pit. There are approximately 200koz of gold contained in the
available material and a trade-off study is currently underway to determine whether it will be
economic to extract post the completion of the open pit.
SENEGAL
Massawa project
Feasibility work continued at Massawa and is currently focused on the geological and
metallurgical modelling of the Central Zone. Progressive close spaced trenching, RC and diamond
drilling over four separate orientation grids (Blocks A to D, from south to north) confirm the
continuity of two distinct phases of mineralisation, phase 1 (pyrite-arsenopyrite-Au) and phase 2
(quartz-stibnite-Au) ores. The phase 1 ore is characterised by a wide halo of low grade (typically
<2g/t) disseminated pyrite and arsenopyrite. The phase 2 ore is characterised by steeply dipping
quartz-stibnite veins which are associated with abundant coarse free-milling gold (up to 250g/t).
Approximately 80% of the ore in the Central Zone is related to the phase 2 mineralisation.
Metallurgical testwork from Block A has indicated that 70% recovery is achievable from gravity and
gravity tail leach. Further testwork is underway of the subsequent orientation blocks moving
progressively northwards to determine how the metallurgical response changes as the refractory
Northern Zone of the deposit is approached. It has been shown historically that the Northern Zone
will require the PoX or Biox process to recover the gold from the fresh ore of the Northern Zone.
The close spaced drilling on the orientation blocks has also confirmed that the geological
interpretation of the phase 2 ore lodes changes significantly with the close spaced RC drilling. If
the good gravity and leach metallurgical response of the entire Central Zone can be confirmed, it
will require a complete redrill of the Central Zone in 2017 with close spaced RC.
Environmental and social studies have recommenced in the area. There have been significant
social changes there since the completion of the Massawa prefeasibility and thus an updated
social impact assessment is underway and well as specialist fauna and flora studies. The
geochemical response to the residues of all metallurgical testwork is also underway to determine
the implications to the Tailings Storage Facility design depending on the process route chosen.
This work is running in parallel with the drilling of Sofia, 10km to the west of Massawa, where good
drill results are reported in the exploration section. The Sofia ore displayed leach recoveries of
plus 90% and thus, together with the Massawa Central Zone, is shifting the critical mass away from
the refractory nature of the Massawa Northern Zone, making the combined complex more
attractive.
EXPLORATION ACTIVITIES
During Q2, exploration progressed targets at all levels of the resource triangle in its drive to add to
the portfolio of quality targets with the potential to pass Randgold’s investment filters. Highlights
this quarter include the geological work on the Sofia (Senegal), Bakolobi (Mali), Fonondara,
Gbongogo and Kassere (Côte d’Ivoire) targets which all have significant resource potential, while
ongoing drilling on the extensions of the Gara deposit continues to highlight the potential to
replace mining depletion by adding to resources both underground and at surface. In the DRC,
work began on regional projects outside Kibali.
MALI
Loulo project
Brownfields activity in Q2 focused on further drilling in the Gara deep extension target, in parallel
with the completion of conversion infill drilling on the inferred resource delivered in 2015. Results
to date from exploration drilling support the continuity of the Gara System up to 325m south along
strike from the present limit of the inferred block model, hosting the potential for +400koz. At Yalea,
YDH278 testing the extensions to the intersection between the Yalea Shear and a moderately east
dipping carbonate shear structure returned a weak intercept over 9.35m (from 804m). The second,
deeper scout hole YDH279 has confirmed the geologic model and intersected the main zone of
mineralisation over 10.61m. Alteration and mineralisation are typical of the Yalea system.
However, it lacks the intense deformation associated with the very high grade ore required at these
depths. A full review of the Yalea orebody is being planned. Surface exploration at Loulo largely
focused on the Gara South target, with trenching, RC and diamond drilling confirming continuity of
a sinistral fold model for the mineralised system over 1.1km of strike. Results indicate potential for
+100koz @ +3g/t resource at surface, close to the plant. A further 500m of strike potential exists at
the southern limit of the target which will be drilled out after the wet season.
Gounkoto project
This quarter, drilling at P64W tested steeply plunging shoots developed along structural
intersections between NS striking chlorite-sericite altered shears that cross-cut NE striking
hematite-magnetite-chlorite sheared ‘ironstone’. P64DH008 (299m) targeting these shoots
returned intercepts of 14.3m @ 1.23g/t from 215.5m (TW = 9.08) and a secondary zone of weak
mineralisation with 1.95m @ 0.28g/t from 241.05m (TW = 1.40m). Despite being weak, the system
remains open close to the Gounkoto underground project and the team is evaluating options for
further drilling. At Faraba North, geological work continued through the quarter. High grade
mineralisation is related to several factors in varying combination, including increased shear strain,
intensity of silica carbonate alteration that overprints early silica albite alteration and quartz
carbonate vein development. Follow-up work is being planned to test if the silica-carbonate altered
shears that host higher grade mineralisation are part of the Faraba structure or a separate, NNE
trending cross cutting structure. After the wet season, a strategy of regional trench coverage along
the entire Gounkoto domain boundary addressing gaps in the existing trenching and drilling will be
implemented, to determine the location and nature of this major prospective structure across the
project.
Bakolobi (Taurus JV)
An intensive infill trenching programme was completed over the Dioula-Gamaye and Koliguinda
structures this quarter, aimed at gaining a better understanding of the controls and continuity of the
mineralisation along the structure and reducing the existing gap between the previous trenches
and RC lines. The programme has confirmed the consistence of the alteration system over 15m to
30m width, and over 5.5km of strike. At Dioula-Gamaye the mineralisation is hosted in a brecciated
and sheared sandstone with silica, carbonate, albite, sericite and local tourmaline alteration. The
corridor is controlled by NNE to NS trending shearing which dips to the west. 13 new trenches
were excavated this quarter and a selection of results include: BKTR014 - 26.93m @ 0.67g/t
including 3.78m @ 3.40g/t; BKTR016 - 28.20m @ 1.30g/t including 14.40m @ 2.09g/t; BKTR017 -
27.60m @ 0.54g/t (30.40m) including 1.70m @ 3.02g/t; and BKTR018 - 57.20m @ 0.56g/t (10.60m)
including 1.20m @ 3.17g/t (38.70m).
Regional work has also been completed over the historic target of Tintinba located to the south-
western limit of the permit and confirmed high grade altered saprolite (31.4g/t; 16.2g/t; 2.28g/t)
related to an EW striking structure that dips 20 to 30 degrees
to the NW. These targets represent two significantly mineralised systems with the potential to host
plunging shoots of high grade mineralisation as seen in other orebodies in the same district. Rigs
have been mobilised to drill test these targets ahead of the wet season shut down.
Alecto JV
Regional mapping and lithosampling and validation of soil anomalies was completed this quarter
over the two permits (137km² in two permits Kobokoto and Koussikoto) which comprise the Alecto
JV. Mapping has confirmed the NW-SE striking orientation of the lithologies in the area and has
also identified several major geological domains. These are interpreted to be basinal sediments
and clastic rocks intruded by a range of different plutonic rocks in the east, and a mélange of
volcano-sedimentary rocks in the west which are interpreted to be part of the Mako volcanic
system. Soil anomalies have been validated and numerous gold showings and artisanal workings
exist across the area. The project has now been put on hold because of accessibility issues during
the wet season.
SENEGAL
Sofia
The evaluation of the high grade Sofia satellite has continued through the quarter with more data
enabling the team to better define the controls on the model and the potential for additional
mineralisation.
Results for holes drilled in Q1 were received and confirmed the presence of a shallow plunging
40m wide high grade lode located on a west dipping thrust surface. SFDDH013 intersected
22.85m @ 6.81g/t from 117.5m including 8.75 @ 15.04g/t in strong pink to orange albite altered
intermediate intrusives and intercalated volcanoclastics. SFDDH014, drilled 45m below
SFDH013, returned 18.35m @ 0.43g/t from 190.5m within similar lithologies but only moderately
altered with albite, pervasive sericite and weak pyrite disseminations in a notably lower strain
zone.
This quarter, following an extensive trenching campaign to reduce the spacing at surface to 40m, a
combined RC and DDH drilling programme was initiated. RC and DDH was drilled within a 40 x
40 grid in the SW of the orebody where the mineralisation comes to surface and was expected to
be more tabular. Additionally, diamond drilling has been carried out on 200m spaced fences along
the high grade shoot to confirm its presence. The drilling confirmed the model and the shallow
plunging 40m wide high grade shoot (>5g/t). The high grade ore is hosted within a continuous
(>600m) NE striking dilatational rod developed at the sheared contact of a series of volcano-
sedimentary rocks in the hangingwall and a thick gabbroic package in the footwall. Significant
intercepts received so far from the drilling include: SFRC078 - 17m @ 7.5g/t; SFRC073 - 16m @
12.33g/t; SFRC075 - 21m @ 6.06g/t; SFRC074 - 11m @ 4.66g/t; SFRC071 - 11m @ 4.14g/t; and
SFDH016 - 16.3m @ 5.47g/t. 40% of the results had been received at the time of writing.
The mineralisation remains open along strike and at depth with the potential of additional
mineralised zones developed beneath the RL80 high grade shoot targeted this quarter. The Sofia
target has not yet been drilled below 150m. Recent work focused on the high grades in the
southern, NE striking section of Sofia. To the north of this, the anomalous structure changes
orientation to NS and historical drilling along that part of the structure confirmed its continuity but
with generally lower grades than seen to the SW. However, drilling was wide spaced and work in
Q3 will step out along the structure and aim to identify additional high grade shoots across the
whole target. Further afield, a number of targets exist along strike from Sofia and to its immediate
east and west. A new review of all historical exploration data and an updated prospectivity review
are being undertaken.
CÔTE D’IVOIRE
The exploration portfolio in Côte d’Ivoire contains a number of exciting targets at all levels of the
resource triangle with a number of them showing real potential of hosting significant resources.
In the Boundiali permit, recent work at Kassere identified significant mineralisation which extended
the target to 1.2km strike and infilled gaps in the existing work. The mineralisation intersected in
trench KT06, reported last quarter (19.70m @ 5.21g/t including 10.50m @ 6.54g/t and 4m @
8.05g/t; 23m @ 3.63g/t including 10m @ 5.82g/t; 16.60m @ 1.99g/t including 7.60m @ 3.73g/t),
was followed up with further trenches along strike to the north and south which intersected the
mineralised system with similar alteration and deformation. Results included: KT014 - 27m @
2.37g/t including 3.50m @ 3.38g/t and 4.20m @ 8.07g/t; and KT013 - 26m @ 0.91g/t including 4m
@ 3.93g/t. The main mineralisation at Kassere is controlled by multiple shear structures which
overprint fold axes within greywacke intruded by feldspar porphyries. High grades are associated
with strong silicification, chlorite and carbonate alteration and the structures remain largely
untested below the surface. A five hole diamond drilling programme to test the strike of the main
target at Kassere commenced in early July and results are awaited for the first two holes of the
programme.
At Fonondara, work this quarter consisted of infill trenching to better understand the controls of the
high grade mineralisation and improve the geological model for further drilling. A total of seven
trenches were excavated and have not only confirmed the current model but identified strong
zones of alteration and brecciation related to the intersection between NS and NE structures
(which may in turn control grade) and a potential to significantly extend the target both towards the
north and south
of the drilled area. The new intersection of 9.70m @ 4.70g/t including 5m @ 8g/t obtained from the
extension of FSTR006B (29.70m @ 2.69g/t) has extended the total intersection of FSTR006B to
39.20m @ 3.08g/t including 5.80m @ 3.20g/t, 5.80m @ 6.20g/t and 9.70m @ 4.70g/t. The new
trench FSTR023, located 90m south of FSTR006B, returned three zones of mineralisation: 8.30m
@ 2g/t including 4m @ 3.23g/t; 7.50m @ 2g/t including 2m @ 6.30g/t; and 4m @ 2.63g/t including
2m @ 4.60g/t. Although most of the results from the infill are pending, the geological observations
so far are concordant with the existing model and confirmed the structural continuity of the
Fonondara system. Significant alteration composed of silica-carbonate-graphite associated with
strong brecciation and stockworks is consistent in the trenches and increasing in areas where NE
and NS structures intersect. Along strike of the main area, an intensive pitting programme has
significantly extended the potential of the broader Fonondara system from 1.5km to 15km towards
the north with significant numbers from in-situ saprolite.
Both infill trenching and pitting are providing important lithological and structural data to extend the
strike length of the target and to provide a more accurate geological model scheduled for drill
testing in a phased programme with the first phase already in progress. The southern part of the
target is also open with structural flexures and continuous regional soil anomalies. An infill soil
programme is now in progress both to the north and south of the Fonondara target to better trace
the Fonondara structure and delineate new opportunities.
On the Mankono project, reconnaissance diamond drilling completed at Gbongogo last quarter
confirmed the mineralised system at depth with both quartz-tourmaline and pyrite hosted in a 100m
wide deformed and altered granitic intrusion. This quarter, further results continued to highlight the
potential of the target with: GBDDH006 - 26.50m @ 2.34g/t including 6m @ 5.26g/t, 24.10m @
1.18g/t and 7.70m @ 2.48g/t; and GBDDH005 - 41.80m @ 1.04g/t including 27.30m @ 1.28g/t and
5.10m @ 3.15g/t. These holes were drilled sub-parallel to the east-dipping veins to intersect the
west-dipping intrusive contacts. One hole, GBDDH007, was drilled perpendicular to the veins to
better appreciate their distribution and for a more accurate estimation of the grade and returned
130.20m @ 2.68g/t including 10.70m @ 15.02g/t and 8.10m @ 3.71g/t. The focus this quarter has
been on investigating the volume of the intrusive along strike and at depth through trenching and
an IP survey. Trenching is exposing similar material 1km north of the drilled area. However, the
immediate strike extension of the main intrusion appears to pinch out at surface. Induced
polarisation is being used in an attempt to map the resistive nature of the intrusion below the
surface and through transported material. However, it is also mapping coarse sediments which
have similar geophysical properties. Drilling along strike to test the extensions of the intrusion
show it to be pinching out and therefore more work is required to define Gbongogo’s potential to
pass Randgold’s strategic filters. At this stage, the mineralised intrusive at Gbongogo main zone
has been confirmed over a total strike length of 320m at an average width of 70m and average
grade of 1.8g/t.
At Tongon, the team continued the core review on both the Northern Zone and Southern Zone to
define opportunities below and along strike of the existing pits. Work on the Northern Zone
identified open high grade potential down dip over 400m strike where there is more structural
complexity and more intense silica alteration in the core of the deposit. A first phase of diamond
drilling has been motivated to test that opportunity at the base of the $1 000/oz pit, and began mid-
July.
Around Tongon, trenching has been conducted at Seydou South and Sekala to refine the
interpretations as part of the programme to bank the near mine satellites. Data obtained so far from
Seydou supports a steeply west dipping system of shears. First trench results include: SSTR003 -
17m @ 1.61g/t including 1.50m @ 10.40g/t; and SSTR002 - 14m @ 0.92g/t including 4m @
1.55g/t.
At Fapoha alteration is weak/moderate silica, chlorite, carbonate and a well expressed
kaolinitisation, possibly due to a weathered sulphidised horizon. The Fapoha system has proved
to be consistently anomalous but so far without significant grades, therefore the team has stepped
out with pitting on the Fanlankolo corridor to the NW which hosts an untested 18km long gold in
soil anomaly subparallel to the main corridor.
DRC
Kibali
Exploration at Kibali continues to focus on the identification of near mine satellite resources for
operational flexibility. The exploration team has been given a target to deliver 50 000oz of +3g/t
material by the end of the year. The targets currently being evaluated are Rhino and Sessenge SW
with Kombokolo being fast-tracked through development to enable mining to start in Q3.
At Sessenge SW, 24 close spaced reverse circulation holes were drilled to test the mineralisation
system observed in trenches STR0002 (22m at 4.01g/t from 146m) and STR0017 (28m at 3.18g/t
from 126m including 10m at 7.6g/t from 130m). Encouraging results have been received including:
SSRC0001 - 11m at 9.5g/t from 0m including 2m at 30.4g/t; SSRC0004 - 12m at 6.55g/t from 0m;
and SSRC0007 - 16m at 2.35g/t from 0m including 6m at 5.08g/t. These results support the current
model and show a continuity of mineralisation down plunge. The potential of the target based on
results of these first scout drill hole, historical reverse circulation holes and trenches, projected to
an average of 100m down plunge and 160m extension toward west, is estimated at 42 978oz @
2.6g/t. Drilling to test this potential is planned to start early in Q3.
Results of the three trenches excavated between Rhino and Agbarabo suggest a continuity of the
mineralisation from Rhino toward Agbarabo with intersections suggesting the presence of multiple
lenses. These results include: RHTR0007 - 4.4m @ 3.28g/t from 19.6m, and 18m @ 1.09g/t from
78m; RHTR0008 - 3.3m @ 3.12g/t from 54.7m, 11.7m @ 1.73g/t from 68m, 2.15m @ 1.34g/t; and
AGTR0017 - 76m @ 0.39g/t from 8m with a main mineralised zone of 22m @ 0.94g/t. The Rhino
area has the potential to host a small, high grade oxide and sulphide resource.
The Kombokolo deposit features a high grade plunging shoot in the hinge of an open fold. It is
1.6km from the plant, outcropping at surface, and has favourable metallurgy with average
recoveries of over 80% by straight cyanidation techniques. This quarter, drill results continued to
confirm its potential, with best intercepts recorded in: KKDD005 - 24.9m @ 4.09g/t from 51.5m
including 4m @ 11.99g/t from 53.3m; KKDD007 - 17.5m @ 4.78g/t from 27.5m; and KKDD008 -
37.6m @ 8.83g/t from 90.4m including 9.2m @ 32.48g/t from 100.3m. An update to the mineral
resource has been undertaken resulting in an in situ open pit resource at a $1 500/oz gold price of
2.5Mt @ 3.06g/t for 245koz, up 49% from the end of 2015 declaration. Following up on these
results, further drilling was completed and confirm the Kombokolo model. Most positively, the
deepest hole drilled in the high grade axis intersected (KKDD023) 16.9m @ 4.26g/t from 159.3m
including 7.78m @ 8.81g/t from 168m, illustrating that the deposit is open down plunge.
Kalimva-Ikamva
At Ikamva, recent mapping and sampling of the zones located up plunge of the Ikamva Belgium
pits returned encouraging results with lithosamples up to 27.1g/t and vertical channel samples of
3.5m @ 8.02g/t and 0.7m @ 6.61g/t, further confirming that the mineralisation could extend over
600m to the southwest. This mineralisation is located at the contact of the ironstone with meta-
sediments in the hinges of open folds. As at Kalimva, mineralisation occurs as north-northeast
plunging shoots parallel to stretching lineations and further work is planned for the coming quarter
to test this potential.
Moku
Work on the Moku project has begun. The team is based in the existing Moku camp and have been
mapping infrastructure across the project. A fly camp in the north of the project area is being
constructed to allow work to be completed there. Over 70 of the 310 planned samples of the stream
sediment programme had been taken by the end of the quarter and geological mapping on
regional traverses and around artisanal workings is in progress to update the new remote
interpretation for the project which, so far, is being confirmed. Mineralisation in old Belgian
workings is associated with veining around altered felsic intrusives within a wide volcanic
sequence.
Ngayu
The flying of the airborne VTEM survey over the Ngayu belt commenced in July. The survey flight
path design is north-south orientated lines at 400m spacing for a total of 10 000 line kilometres.
Flight line spacing will be reduced to 200m line spacing over potential targets identified during the
initial survey.
On completion of the VTEM B-Field, Horizontal Magnetic Gradiometer geophysical survey this
data will be integrated with the current airborne magnetic and radiometric geophysical data,
regional BLEG stream sediment and local soil geochemical results, surface and trench mapping as
well as historical drill hole data to define and prioritise targets within the licenses. On the ground
exploration is expected to begin in November 2016.

These results are presented as the second quarter and six months ended 30 June 2016. They
have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted
by the European Union (IFRS) on a basis that is consistent with the accounting policies applied by
the group in its audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2015,
and which will form the basis of the 2016 annual report. No new or amended accounting standards
effective for 2016 have had a significant impact on the group. This announcement has been
prepared in compliance with IAS 34 - Interim Financial Reporting. These results do not include all
the notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. Accordingly, this condensed
report is to be read in conjunction with the annual report for the year ended 31 December 2015,
and any public announcements made by the group during the reporting period. While the
information included in this announcement has been prepared in accordance with the recognition
and measurement criteria of IFRS, this announcement does not itself contain sufficient information
to comply with IFRS. The auditors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2015 was unqualified
and did not include references to any matters which the auditor drew attention to by way of
emphasis without qualifying their report.
Property, plant and equipment cost increased by $31.1 million for the three months ended 30 June
2016, and was mainly attributable to capital expenditure at the Loulo-Gounkoto complex of
$25.9 million. Of this amount, $16.0 million was spent on the development of the Yalea and Gara
underground mines, including the Gara and Yalea refrigeration plants, $8.5 million was spent on
ongoing capital, including elution and power plant upgrades, $1.3 million was incurred at
Gounkoto. Capital expenditure at Tongon amounts to $2.2 million for the three months, mainly
relating to the crusher upgrade and TSF projects.
The group’s capital commitments (including its share of equity accounted joint ventures) at 30 June
2016 amounted to $38.2 million, with the majority relating to the Loulo-Gounkoto complex
($24.6 million) and Kibali ($9.8 million).
The long term ore stockpiles balance of $159.6 million relates to the portion of ore stockpiles at
Loulo, Gounkoto and Tongon which are expected to be processed after more than one year, in line
with the respective mine plans. The 3% reduction from 31 March 2016 relates to decreases in the
stockpiles at Loulo and Gounkoto, in line with mine plans.
Investments in equity accounted joint ventures reflects the group’s share of its equity accounted
investments, mainly Kibali as well as Morila and the group’s asset leasing joint ventures. Other
investments in joint ventures reflect the group’s loans advanced to the group’s asset leasing joint
ventures.
The increase of $2.6 million in total investment in joint ventures for the quarter mainly reflects the
group’s profit share from equity accounted joint ventures ($6.1 million), partially offset by loan
repayments made by RAL during the quarter ($3.5 million attributable share). Investments in equity
accounted joint ventures further include capital expenditure of $21.5 million (attributable) at Kibali
during the quarter, which were funded by Kibali’s operating cash flows.
Current inventories and ore stockpiles of $133.5 million were in line with the balances at 31 March
2016.
Trade and other receivables (including the allocation of a portion to non-current) at 30 June 2016
increased by 4% from the balances at 31 March 2016. This mainly reflects increases in pre-
payments and payments to suppliers at Loulo.
The long term receivable balance of $11.3 million at 30 June 2016 decreased by 10% from the
balance at 31 March 2016. This reflects the decrease in VAT balances at Loulo during the quarter.
The total outstanding refundable VAT balances in Mali amount to $119.0 million (31 March 2016:
$122.0 million) (including 100% of the Loulo and Gounkoto VAT receivables and the attributable
portion of the Morila VAT receivable of $13.7 million). Morila, Loulo and Gounkoto have the legal
right under the terms of their respective mining conventions to offset other taxes payable to the
Malian State against these refundable VAT balances. Management continues to pursue the cash
settlement of these VAT balances.
The portion of the outstanding VAT balances which is not expected to be recovered within a one-
year time frame, amounts to $11.3 million, and is shown in the long term debtors (31 March 2016:
$12.6 million). The group’s share of the VAT balance at Kibali amounted to $71.6 million (31
March 2016: $64.5 million). The Morila and Kibali VAT balances are included in the group’s
investment in joint ventures line.
During the quarter, an International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes’ (ICSID)
arbitration tribunal issued its final and binding award in favour of Loulo, resulting in Loulo being
awarded $29.2 million in principal (together with an award for costs) against the State of Mali, for
taxes found by the tribunal to have been wrongfully collected by the government. The disputed
amounts are included in the trade and other receivables balance. The arbitration proceedings,
which commenced in 2013, were brought pursuant to the establishment convention Loulo has
entered into with the State of Mali which provides for fiscal stability, in relation to the exploration,
management and exploitation of the Loulo gold mine. Consequently, Randgold does not expect
any impact to its financial position following the award which is essentially in line with its
previously adopted accounting position. The arbitration however related to only a portion of the
various tax claims which have been received from the State of Mali (the balance totalling $231.0
million) in respect of its Malian operations. Having taken professional advice, the group considers
the claims to be without merit or foundation and is strongly defending its position in relation to
these claims and following the appropriate legal process for disputes within Mali. Accordingly, no
provision has been made for the material claims. Loulo, Gounkoto and Morila each have legally
binding establishment conventions which guarantee fiscal stability, govern the taxes applicable to
the companies and allow for international arbitration in the event a dispute cannot be amicably
resolved. Management continues to engage with the Malian authorities at the highest level to
resolve these outstanding fiscal issues.
The increase in cash of $18.9 million since 31 March 2016 largely reflects strong operational cash
flows from the Loulo-Gounkoto complex and Tongon mines ($101.5 million), partially offset by the
group’s continued investment in capital expenditure in its subsidiaries ($33.9 million), in particular
at Loulo in respect of the underground mines. The cash portion of the company’s annual dividend
payment of $52.1 million was also paid to shareholders during the quarter.
Trade and other payables of $142.7 million increased by 3% from the balances at 31 March 2016
and principally relate to increase in supplier balances at Loulo and Tongon due to the timing of
payments of invoices.
Current tax payable of $21.7 million increased by 28% compared to the 31 March 2016 balance, as
a result of the timing of the provisional tax payments.

NON-GAAP MEASURES
Randgold has identified certain measures that it believes will assist understanding of the
performance of the business. As the measures are not defined under IFRS they may not be directly
comparable with other companies’ adjusted measures. The non-GAAP measures are not intended
to be a substitute for, or superior to, any IFRS measures of performance but management has
included them as these are considered to be important comparables and key measures used
within the business for assessing performance.
These measures are explained further below:
Total cash costs and cash cost per ounce are non-GAAP measures. Total cash costs and total
cash cost per ounce are calculated using guidance issued by the Gold Institute. The Gold Institute
was a non-profit industry association comprising leading gold producers, refiners, bullion suppliers
and manufacturers. This institute has now been incorporated into the National Mining Association.
The guidance was first issued in 1996 and revised in November 1999. Total cash costs, as defined
in the Gold Institute’s guidance, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and
administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from
deferred stripping where relevant and royalties. Total cash costs and total cash cost per ounce also
include our share of our equity accounted joint ventures’ total cash costs and total cash cost per
ounce.
Total cash cost per ounce is calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the
Gold Institute guidance, by gold ounces sold for the periods presented. Total cash costs and total
cash cost per ounce are calculated on a consistent basis for the periods presented. Total cash
costs and total cash cost per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to
operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures
or an indicator of our performance. The data does not have a meaning prescribed by IFRS and
therefore amounts presented may not be comparable to data presented by gold producers who do
not follow the guidance provided by the Gold Institute. In
particular depreciation and amortisation would be included in a measure of total costs of producing
gold under IFRS, but are not included in total cash costs under the guidance provided by the Gold
Institute.
Furthermore, while the Gold Institute has provided a definition for the calculation of total cash costs
and total cash cost per ounce, the calculation of these numbers may vary from company to
company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, Randgold believes that total cash cost per ounce is a useful indicator to investors and
management of a mining company’s performance as it provides an indication of a company’s
profitability and efficiency, the trends in cash costs as the company’s operations mature, and a
benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
Cash operating costs and cash operating cost per ounce are calculated by deducting royalties
from total cash costs. Cash operating cost per ounce is calculated by dividing cash operating costs
by gold ounces sold for the periods presented.
Gold sales is a non-GAAP measure. It represents the sales of gold at spot and the gains/losses on
hedge contracts which have been delivered into at the designated maturity date. It excludes
gains/losses on hedge contracts which have been rolled forward to match future sales. This
adjustment is considered appropriate because no cash is received/paid in respect of these
contracts. Randgold currently does not have any hedge positions. Gold sales include our share of
our equity accounted joint ventures’ gold sales.
Profit from mining activity is calculated by subtracting total cash costs from gold sales for all
periods presented. Profit from mining includes our share of our equity accounted joint ventures.
Gold on hand represents gold in doré at the mines multiplied by the prevailing spot gold price at
the end of the period. Gold on hand includes our share of our equity accounted joint ventures’ gold
on hand.
The group non-GAAP measures presented in the ‘Summarised financial information’ in the
accompanying table include the group’s share of each operating mine, together with adjustments
to eliminate intergroup transactions.
The accompanying table reconciles gold sales, total cash costs and profit from mining activity as
non-GAAP measures, to the information provided in the statement of comprehensive income,
determined in accordance with IFRS, for each of the periods set out therein.

PRINCIPAL RISK FACTORS AND UNCERTAINTIES
The group is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties which are the result of not only the
business environment in which it operates but also of other factors over which it has little or no
control. The board, as part of its role in providing strategic oversight and stewardship of the
company, is responsible for the group’s systems of risk management and internal control as well
as reviewing their operational effectiveness on a regular basis. We are continually evaluating risks
to ensure the business achieves its strategic objectives; however the principal risks and
uncertainties which could impact the group’s long term performance remain those detailed in the
group’s 2015 annual report and financial statements, a copy of which is available on the group’s
website www.randgoldresources.com.
The group’s strategy takes into account known risks but there may be additional risks unknown to
the group and other risks, currently believed to be immaterial, which could develop into material
risks. It is recognised that the group is exposed to risks wider than those listed. However, we have
disclosed those we believe are likely to have the greatest impact on our business at this moment in
time and those that have been the subject of debate at recent board or audit committee meetings.
The principal risks and uncertainties may materialise individually, simultaneously or in
combination and should be considered in connection with any forward looking statements in this
document, the 2015 annual report and the information available on the group’s website.
EXTERNAL
RISKS
Gold price
volatility
NATURE AND IMPACT
Gold price volatility can result in material and adverse movement in the group’s
operating results, asset values, revenues and cash flows.  Sustained or significant
declines in the gold price will affect earnings and cash flow.  Group planning,
forecasting and long term financial strategy are subject to gold price assumptions
and therefore changes to the gold price may have an adverse effect the group’s
ability to fund its capital projects.
The group operates in jurisdictions where changes may occur to the political
environment and governments may seek a greater share of mineral
wealth.  Inadequate monitoring of in-country political instability and uncertainty or
failure to adapt to changes to terms applicable to the group’s operations may
impact the ability to sustain operations, prevent the group from making future
investments or result in increased costs for the group.
Some of the group’s current and potential operations are located near
communities that may regard these operations as being detrimental to them.  Poor
management of stakeholder communication and expectations with a lack of
community development activities or regard for environmental responsibility may
lead to the inability to sustain operations in the area and impact the group’s ability
to expand into other regions.  Failure to understand social and environmental
contexts can lead to insufficient planning, resourcing and costing of
projects.  Failure to comply with environmental regulations could lead to fines and,
in the extreme, loss of operating licence.
Due to the remote location of the operations the disruption of supply routes may
cause delays with construction and mine activities.  Supply chain failures,
disruptions or significantly increased costs within the supply chain could have an
adverse effect on the group’s operations.
NATURE AND IMPACT
Operating cost and capital cost control are a key factor in the group’s
profitability.  Failure to control operating cost of production or operational
objectives will result in reduced margins and profitability.  Failure or inability to
monitor capital expenditure and progress of capital projects may result in financial
losses, overspend on projects and cause returns to be eroded.  General cost
inflation in the mining sector could affect the operations and projects resulting in
significant pressure on operating and capital costs.
The group operates in jurisdictions which may change tax or fiscal regimes and
regulations and, failure to adapt to such issues may result in fines and financial
losses.  Inability to enforce legislation over tax or incorrectly applied legislation
may result in lengthy arbitration and loss of profits.
NATURE AND IMPACT
The group’s mining operations may yield less gold under actual production
conditions than indicated by its gold reserve figures, which are estimates based

on a number of assumptions, including mining and recovery factors, production
costs and gold price.  In such instances the group’s profitability may be affected
should actual production be lower than indicated reserves.  Should the prevailing
gold price not support or sustain the valuation the carrying value of assets may be
impaired.
The mining sector is subject extensive health, safety and environmental laws,
regulations and standards alongside stakeholder expectations.  Failure to maintain
environmental, health and safety standards’ may result in significant environmental
or safety incidents or deterioration in safety performance standards leading to loss
of life or significant loss of time and disruption or damage to operations.  Evolving
regulation and standards could result in increased costs, litigation or in extreme
cases may threaten the viability of an operation.  
The group has a number of underground projects which are subject to the extensive
risks associated with underground mining.  Failure to monitor or mitigate such risks
may affect the profitability of the group and the operational performance.  Failure to
consider geotechnical failure in planning and then monitor the impact during
operations may impact the geotechnical stability of pits and underground mining
operations.  Extreme weather conditions such as high rainfall may also impact the
geotechnical stability of the pits and therefore could impact mining operations.

STRATEGIC
RISKS
Lack of

failure
The replacement of reserves and resources is key to the long term delivery of the
group’s exploration led growth strategy and therefore the lack of identification of
new exploration targets may lead to a loss of revenue and an inability to grow and
meet strategic objectives.  Exploration and development are costly activities with no
guarantee of success, but are necessary for future growth of the group.
GENERAL
As highlighted earlier in this report, the group has had a challenging quarter, especially at Kibali
and Tongon, partially offset by another good performance at the Loulo-Gounkoto complex.
Notwithstanding these challenges, the groups’ overall annual key performance indicators set at the
start of the year remain intact, albeit in the lower and upper half of the production and cost
guidance ranges respectively. As emphasised in the previous quarterly report, the company is
anticipating increased production in the second half of the year, on the back of anticipated higher
grades at the Loulo-Gounkoto complex in Q4 and improved delivery from Tongon and Kibali
through Q3 and Q4.
Exploration remains core to Randgold’s growth strategy and the company’s exploration activities
continue to make meaningful progress, both in respect of brownfields extensions and across its
greenfields portfolio, in support of its organic growth objectives. Notwithstanding this core strategy,
management routinely reviews corporate and asset acquisition opportunities, focused on Africa.
The directors confirm to the best of their knowledge that:
a)These second quarter results have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 as adopted by the
European Union; and
The interim management report includes a fair review of the information required by the FCA’s
Disclosure and Transparency Rules (4.2.7R and 4.2.8R).

RANDGOLD RESOURCES NEWS UPDATES
PUMPING UP THE POWER
Innovative management solutions are driving down the cost of power and securing the stability of
its supply at Randgold’s operations, while at the same time reducing the group’s carbon footprint.
Technical and capital projects executive John Steele says access to power is one of the key
considerations in developing a mine in Africa, particularly in those remote regions where the
infrastructure is practically non-existent and there is no national power grid.
“In fact, it’s so important that power management has grown into a big business within the
Randgold group, and our engineers have become adept at building and managing major power
stations – some of which are the largest of their kind in their host countries – and at dealing with
the complex demands of maintaining mine-based micro-grids,” he says.
The Loulo-Gounkoto complex has an installed capacity of 60MW of which it draws 45MW. Initially
all power was supplied by high speed diesel-powered generators but over time it has migrated to
HFO (heavy fuel oil) medium speed generators, which now supply 80% of its power, improving
reliability, reducing unit costs significantly and despite being based on thermal generation, the
investment in more efficient medium speed units has helped to reduce our carbon emissions. A
central power station supplies the whole complex through an overhead grid which extends over
more than 30 kilometres.
“The Loulo-Gounkoto power plant is one of the largest and most reliable of its kind in all of West
Africa. Our long term aim is to plug into the region’s planned hydro and gas powered grid but until
that becomes available our focus is on using our thermal power as efficiently as possible,” he says.
Tongon is different from Randgold’s other operations in that it has access to power from Côte
d’Ivoire’s national grid, which is more affordable than self-generated thermal power. The country’s
economy is booming, however, and this occasionally strains the grid power supply, so Tongon still
needs its own back-up power in order to run independently of the grid when necessary.
“Our aim is to draw 97% of Tongon’s power from the grid, which should be achievable once the
power utility has completed its current expansion project. In the meantime, we are boosting the
mine’s standby capacity to 24MW through the installation of six additional generators,” Steele
says.
Kibali in the Democratic Republic of Congo represents a further advance in the evolution of
Randgold’s power management strategy. Here the company has had the opportunity to build its
own hydropower plants. Nzoro, the first of these to be commissioned, has supplied a steady 20MW
into the Kibali grid for over a year. The second, Ambarau, will soon come on line and the third,
Azambi, will be operational in 2018 when Kibali is at full production. Together, the three
hydroplants will have a capacity of 44MW which may reduce to 20MW during the dry season.
Kibali’s peak demand is expected to be 40MW and to ensure that this can always be met it has a
high-speed diesel generating capacity of 36MW. Its current supply is a 55/45 mix of hydro and
thermal power but hydro’s contribution is planned to grow to 75% as the Ambarau and Azambi
plants are commissioned.
“Kibali’s power costs and carbon emissions already compare well with those of similar mines
anywhere in the world, and we expect them to continue decreasing, in the process also improving
the group’s cost and carbon profiles,” Steele says.
CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN DOWNTURN PAYS EXPLORATION DIVIDENDS
While the gold mining industry generally went back into survival mode in the post-supercycle
slump, Randgold stepped up its exploration drive and both its greenfield and brownfield
programmes have consequently delivered significant results, including the discovery of major new
targets and a substantial increase in the company’s groundholdings in its target areas.
Exploration remains the engine that drives Randgold’s business and the resource triangle is still
the most effective way of managing this critically important function, ensuring that the company’s
assets are developed in a balanced and methodical manner, says group general manager
exploration Joel Holliday.
“It’s a simple but essential tool which enables us to maintain a pipeline of projects with the
potential to pass our strategic filters and ultimately to deliver our target of three new mines over the
next five years,” he says.
“We have a broad base of targets in our resource triangle and the discovery of Bakolobi,
Fonondara, Kassere and Gbongogo in the past two years shows how quickly good ground can
develop into significant advanced targets in a short time. All four feature significant mineralised
systems with the potential to host large orebodies. Over the past quarter, we have completed the
detailed surface geological work necessary for the development of models and drill programmes.”
Holliday says Randgold’s generative research is the only work of its kind being carried out in
Africa at the moment and it is providing new insights into the controls of large orebodies on a range
of scales from continental targeting to detailed orebody definition.
“This research is highlighting areas of prospectivity where we will be acquiring new ground over
the next few years. It also ensures that we do not waste time and money in areas which do not
have the potential to host deposits that meet our criteria,” he says.
“In addition to this, we have a large amount of new ground coming into the base of the triangle
through our recent joint ventures in the DRC, our permit applications in Côte d’Ivoire, our joint
ventures and permit applications in Mali and our recently renewed joint venture with Iamgold in
Senegal. Some of this ground is already being worked and we expect it to deliver many quality
targets.”
At the top of the triangle, the Massawa feasibility study has been progressed, with results showing
good recoveries and a materially higher grade and larger resource in the central zone. In tandem
with that, work is continuing on Sofia, where drilling and trenching have confirmed the geological
model and highlighted considerable upside around the existing target. As a high grade, free
leaching ore satellite, expanding Sofia is crucial to the viability of the Massawa project.
Also at the top, deep drilling results at Gara have confirmed the potential to replace its mining
depletion over the next four years while the feasibility study on the Gounkoto superpit/underground
mine nears completion. In the DRC, the Kibali team has concentrated on delivering the Kombokolo
satellite and plans are in place to bring it into this year’s mine plan.
TAKING RANDGOLD’S HEALTH AND SAFETY CULTURE TO THE NEXT LEVEL
Dr Haladou Manirou, group health and safety officer
Employees are Randgold’s most valuable asset, and their health and safety, not only at the
workplace but also in their communities, is a key commitment across all operations. This has
resulted in the development of a highly effective health and safety management system and the
achievement of a world-class safety performance, with everyone committed to improvements year
on year.
The march towards zero harm requires constant reinforcement, however, and we continue to focus
on ways of taking our performance to an even higher level. We are currently conducting a safety
perception survey, in which all heads of department and senior staff engage with employees to get
their feedback on safety practices and increase their awareness of risk. The findings are used to
develop toolbox talk topics and the process itself enhances the ability of employees to identify
potential risks and encourages them to report near-misses. It also shows them that their concerns
are taken seriously and that their welfare is of paramount importance to the company.
For this engagement to be wholly effective, we need to develop the safety management skills of
managers at all levels. As part of this ongoing process, all heads of department and their deputies
have just completed Managing Safely, a training programme from the UK’s Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health.
Our safety system is integrated and we do not distinguish between our own employees and those
of our contractors. More than half of all incidents recorded within the group involved contractors, so
we need to ensure that they operate to our standards. In line with this, we have recently worked
with all of them to review their risk assessment and develop action plans to address the top five
safety risks at our operations.
On the occupational health front, all employees are given a comprehensive medical check-up
before they start with us to ensure that they are fit for work. Health surveillance continues
throughout their employment with periodical follow-ups and an exit check. We also counsel them
on occupational exposures and the means of protection to ensure that they understand the risks
and are fully equipped to meet our safety standards.
And we don’t only consider the occupational exposures. Most of our employees live in their
communities of origin. We identify the health risks in these communities and we update the risk
profiles every year in the light of our own health data generated by medical consultations (our
clinics are open to the community) and the data from the national health services of our host
countries. We then customise health promotion programmes for all these communities. Our
comprehensive malaria and HIV/AIDS initiatives continue to deliver very positive results, and even
simple interventions can prove remarkably
effective. Handwashing, for example, initiated during the Ebola outbreak, has led to a significant
decrease in diarrhoea cases among the local communities in Mali, and we are now extending this
practice to our operations in Côte d’Ivoire and the DRC.
“PASSIONATE ABOUT FACILITATING VALUE CREATORS”
Randgold’s new group human resources executive
Randgold has appointed Cheick Maiga as group human resources executive. A Malian citizen, he
was educated at the École Normale Supériere in that country and at the University of Cape Town’s
Graduate School of Business. He was formerly director of human resources and administration at
Nordgold in Burkina Faso.
Chief executive Mark Bristow said Maiga had been selected for this key position on the basis of a
20 year track record of achievement at diverse African mining companies, where he had
demonstrated the ability to develop and deliver effective human capital management strategies.
Maiga said he had been attracted by Randgold’s philosophy of investing in people development
and the fact that more than 93% of its employees and contractors were host country nationals.
“I subscribe to the belief that only people can create value, and I’m passionate about facilitating the
management of such value creators,” he said.
BOYZONBIKES INITIATIVE EXTENDS COMMUNITY OUTREACH
This year’s BoyzonBikes motorbike safari, which traversed Africa along the equator from its east
coast to west, has to date raised $2.7 million for Nos Vies en Partage (NVEP), the independent
charitable foundation established by Randgold in 2014 to help relieve the plight of some of Africa’s
poorest people. Money is still coming in from well wishers across the world.
NVEP has already earmarked this money for donations to multiple entities across Sub Saharan
Africa. The emphasis this year is on projects, many of them in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
which aim to support abused women and neglected children as well as to rehabilitate former child
soldiers. Previous BoyzonBikes safaris raised some $2.5 million which was donated to 52
charitable organisations in 15 countries.
Randgold chief executive Mark Bristow, who conceived the idea and has led all the rides, said it
was designed to extend some of the benefits of mining in Africa to those impoverished people who
fell outside the ambit of the company’s existing social programmes, which were focused on the
communities around its mines and others affected by its operations.
“It is a cardinal tenet of the Randgold philosophy that miners should be developers rather than
exploiters, and that the people who are the real owners of a country’s natural resources should
receive a fair share of the value created by their extraction. We apply this to our own operations but
when on my very first motorbike safari I saw at first hand how extensive and extreme poverty is in
Africa, I decided that we should extend a helping hand beyond the borders of our own
communities. The establishment of NVEP was the outcome of that decision,” he said.
“This year’s safari, dubbed Safari Kwa Bora Afrika – Swahili for Riding for a Better Africa – was the
most challenging one we have undertaken to date, taking 28 days and covering 8 500 kilometres,
much of it through dense equatorial jungle on uncharted routes never before attempted on a
motorbike. But it was also the most satisfying, as we thrust our way through spectacular
landscapes, passing the sources of both the Nile and Congo rivers, and interacting with people
who had been completely bypassed by the advances of the past 50 years. The contrast between
the beauty and natural wealth of the land and the condition of the people was a stark reminder of
the dire need for initiatives such as ours.”
Some 230 corporate and individual donors supported the project, and Bristow expressed his
heartfelt gratitude and that of NVEP for their generosity.
KIBALI CONTINUES TO WORK THROUGH CHALLENGES AS IT HEADS FOR FULL
PRODUCTION
The giant Kibali gold mining complex in the Democratic Republic of Congo will remain a work in
progress until its underground mining component is completed towards the end of 2017 but in the
meantime its management is making significant progress in dealing with transitional challenges,
says CEO Mark Bristow.
Speaking at the regular quarterly briefing in Kinshasa, Bristow said that, as anticipated, the
complexity of dealing with multiple ore types from different sources had affected throughput,
recovery and grade in the first half of the year. This issue was
being resolved, however, and management had taken measures and revised the mine plan to
keep Kibali on course to meet its plus 600 000 ounce production target for the year.
“Development of the underground mine is on track and the shaft is currently being integrated with
the decline section. Commissioning is scheduled for July 2017. In the meantime, the team is also
focusing on opening two high-grade satellite pits in 2016 and 2017 which will greatly improve
operational flexibility,” he said.
“Elsewhere on site, construction of the Ambarau hydropower station is back on track and is
expected to start generating electricity in the fourth quarter of this year. Work is already underway
on Azambi which will be Kibali’s third hydropower station. Notwithstanding the operational
challenges, management has continued to focus on developing a team consisting entirely of host
country nationals, as at our other mines, as well as building up a strong corps of local contractors
and suppliers. It is also maintaining the emphasis on Kibali’s community programmes, ranging
from capacity building to agribusiness start-ups.”
“During my recent motorbike trip through the DRC as part of Randgold’s Boyzonbikes fundraising
safari, it became clear to me that the country faces many challenges, as does Kibali which is a real
factor in the Congolese economy. I was encouraged, however, by the very positive vision of the
DRC’s future which has been presented by the president. An investor-friendly regime is essential
for the development of the economy in general and the mining industry in particular. As for
Randgold, we continue to expand our footprint in the DRC, most recently through the Ngayu and
Moku joint ventures,” Bristow said.
The workers association of the Great Orientale region in the DRC (ACAGOR) has recognised
Randgold CEO Mark Bristow’s commitment and contribution in the area and throughout the
country. Bristow received the award from the association’s chairperson, Rhydie Noka, and is now
considered a son of the province which comprises the former Orientale Province including Haut
Uele.
SUCCESSFUL AND SUSTAINABLE MINING INDUSTRY KEY TO BUILDING MALI’S
ECONOMY
Clarification of the convention under which Randgold mines in Mali has enabled the company to
commit to further investment in the country, says chief executive Mark Bristow.
Speaking at a briefing for local media in Bamako, Bristow said a recently concluded arbitration
process had cleared up confusion over the interpretation of some points in the 20-year-old
convention, which includes provision for arbitration, thus ensuring that Randgold would be able to
maximise the full potential of the Loulo-Gounkoto complex, one of the largest of its kind in the
world, for the benefit of all stakeholders, including the government and people of Mali.
Consequently, the company does not expect any impact on its financial position following the
ruling which is in line with its previously adopted accounting position. The ruling has also cleared
the way for Randgold to continue investing in its operations and exploring for further world class
mines in the country.
“We have a long history of partnership with Mali and over that time the country and the company
have had to work hard together to overcome many challenges. Randgold is committed to
continuing that cooperation in the interests of securing the long-term sustainability of the Malian
economy, and of its backbone, the mining industry,” Bristow said.
Bristow noted that Randgold’s mines in Mali annually accounted for between 7% and 11% of the
country’s GDP, with Loulo having already contributed $2.3 billion to the country’s economy,
Gounkoto $0.6 billion and Morila $2.0 billion in the form of royalties, taxes, salaries, payments to
local suppliers and community investments. Between them, Loulo, Gounkoto and the Randgold-
managed Morila have produced 11 million ounces of gold and provided employment to 4 800
people. All these operations are run by management teams consisting entirely of Malian nationals.
“Morila is now nearing the end of its life but still has three years of profitable production ahead of it,
while the Loulo-Gounkoto complex is currently on track to beat its 2016 production guidance and
continue to produce more than 600 000 ounces of gold annually for the next 10 years with a Life of
Mine which well exceeds that horizon,” Bristow said.
“In the meantime, our brownfields and greenfields exploration teams continue to expand our asset
base and our footprint in Mali, with significant successes within the Loulo-Gounkoto permit area as
well as in our other tenements. At Gara they have already delivered more than a million ounces of
additional resources over the last 18 months while at Gounkoto, planning for a new superpit is well
advanced.”
Bristow said a successful and sustainable mining industry would play a major role in the growth of
the Malian economy, provided further international investment could be attracted by a clear and
stable fiscal regime secured by convention.
RANDGOLD IDENTIFIES EXCITING NEW PROSPECTS IN CÔTE D’IVOIRE AS TONGON
MINE PAYS MAIDEN DIVIDEND
Randgold’s Tongon mine has completed the final phase of its extensive crusher expansion and
mill circuit upgrade project and, having also dealt with an extended down time on one mill as a
result of poor repairs to the journal and slipper pads following on from last quarter, is set for an
improved performance in the second half of this year, says chief executive Mark Bristow.
Speaking to local media at a regular briefing in Abidjan, Bristow said the mill had been down for 46
days during the past quarter, which impacted heavily on production. The mine has also had to
contend with an erratic power supply from the national grid but a constructive engagement with the
power utility was significantly improving this situation. Bristow thanked the government for the
positive way in which it had facilitated this engagement. Randgold was committed to continue
working with the utility and the energy ministry to permanently secure power supply stability, he
added.
“Tongon is now settling down well but the difficulties it faced over the past two quarters will have a
negative effect on its production for the year. The management team has revised the 2016
business plan and is now targeting to exceed 260koz for the year. It is worth noting, however, that it
remains a profitable operation and, having paid back its capital in 2015, it has just declared a
maiden dividend of $22 million,” he said.
Bristow said during his recent tour of Randgold’s exploration sites in Côte d’Ivoire he had been
struck by the buoyant mood of the people and the many signs of economic development which
were widely evident.
“This is an exciting time for the country and also for our company. We continue to invest in
exploration here and our teams have identified some very attractive new opportunities, notably the
high-potential Boundiali and Mankono permits. We’re also getting good results from our near-mine
exploration. Our geologists have defined the potential for additional resources below the Tongon
pit as well as at some near-mine satellites such as Seydou and Sekala, which could extend
Tongon’s life,” he said.
Bristow noted that Tongon has already contributed $822.6 million to the Ivorian economy in the
form of royalties, taxes, salaries and payments to local suppliers. This also includes its continuing
investment in the development of community health and education programmes and agricultural
projects designed to provide post-mining employment.
“Randgold is committed to playing its part in ensuring that the president’s vision of building a
continent-leading economy by 2020 becomes a reality,” he said.
