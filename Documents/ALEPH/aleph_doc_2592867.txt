International Financial Reporting Standards - IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board - IASB.
Rio de Janeiro – August 11, 2016
Main financial highlights 2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016
·  Net income attributable to the shareholders of Petrobras of US$ 106 million, compared to net loss attributable to the shareholders of
Petrobras of US$ 318 million in the 1Q-2016, as a result of:
§ A decrease of 22% in net finance expenses;
§ An 7% increase of crude oil and natural gas total production;
§ Higher revenues with an increase of 14% in crude oil and oil products exports and lower costs related to natural gas imports;
§ Expenses related to the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan (PIDV); and
§ Impairment losses related to Comperj assets.
·  The higher cash provided by operating activities and the decrease of capital expenditures and investments resulted in a positive free
cash flow* for the fifth consecutive quarter of US$ 3,073 million in the 2Q-2016, 4 times higher when compared to 1Q-2016.
·  Adjusted EBITDA* of US$ 5,789 million in the 2Q-2016, a 7% increase compared to the 1Q-2016.

as of June 30, 2016 and the leverage decreased from 60% to 55% in the same period.
·  The issuing of global notes totaling US$ 6.75 billion and the tender offer of US$ 6.3 billion generated the increase of average maturity of
outstanding debt from 7.14 years as of December 31, 2015 to 7.30 years as of June 30, 2016.
Main operating highlights 2Q-2016 x 1Q-2016

1H-2016 x 1H-2015 Results* :
Virtually all revenues and expenses of our Brazilian operations are denominated and payable in Brazilian Reais. When the Brazilian Real
depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, as it did in the 1H-2016 (a 25% depreciation), revenues and expenses decrease when translated
into U.S. dollars. The depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar affects the line items discussed below in different ways.
Gross Profit
Gross profit decreased by 26% to US$ 11,875 million in the 1H-2016 when compared to the 1H-2015, mainly due to the effect of foreign
exchange translation (depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar). Excluding this effect, gross profit decreased by 9% when
expressed in Brazilian Reais, due to lower sales revenues, as a result of a 7% reduction of domestic oil products sales, partially offset by
higher diesel and gasoline margins. The decreased sales revenues was also due to lower crude oil and oil products export prices, to lower
power generation, decreased electricity prices and the lower domestic natural gas sales volume.
In the 1H-2016, the Company experienced lower import costs and decreased production taxes in Brazil due to lower crude oil prices and
decreased sales. However, higher depreciation expenses occurred as a result of a decrease in reserves estimates (mainly due to lower
crude oil prices), which were partially offset by a lower carrying amount of assets that were impacted by impairment losses that were
taken in 2015.
Operating income
Operating income was US$ 4,132 million in the 1H-2016, a 46% decrease when compared to the 1H-2015. Excluding the effect of foreign
exchange translation, operating income decreased 32% in Brazilian Reais resulting from decreased gross profit, higher idleness expenses
related to drilling rigs, higher expenses with legal proceedings, expenses associated with the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan and
with the return of exploratory blocks. In addition, the 1H-2015 was impacted by the reversal of impairment charge related to trade
receivables from companies in the electricity sector.
These effects were partially offset by lower tax expenses.
Net finance expense
Net finance expense was US$ 3,950 million in the 1H-2016, compared to a net finance expense of US$ 3,932 million in the 1H-2015,
remaining relatively flat. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation, net finance expense increased in Brazilian Reais due to
higher interest expenses as a result of higher debt and the effect of the depreciation of Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.
Net income (loss) attributable to the shareholders of Petrobras
Net loss attributable to the shareholders of Petrobras of US$ 212 million in the 1H-2016, compared to a net income of US$ 2,033 million in
the 1H-2015, mainly due to lower operating income and to the effect of foreign exchange variation over the debt of structured companies in
U.S. dollars, registered in net income attributable to non-controlling interests.
Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow **
Adjusted EBITDA was US$ 11,183 million in the 1H-2016, a 20% decrease compared to the 1H-2015. The Adjusted EBITDA Margin
reached 29% in the 1H-2016. The decrease of capital expenditures and investments resulted in a positive free cash flow of US$ 3,683
million in the 1H-2016. This result represents an important effort to deleverage the Company.
* Additional information about operating results of 1H-2016 x 1H-2015, see item 4.
** See definitions of Free cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA in glossary and the respective reconciliations in Liquidity and Capital Resources
and Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA.

RESULT BY BUSINESS SEGMENT
EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): The decrease in gross profit in the 1H-2016 was generated by decreased Brent prices and by lower crude oil and
NGL production in Brazil and abroad. In addition, gross profit was impacted by higher depreciation costs, partially offset by lower
production taxes.
Operating income
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): The decrease in operating income was due to lower gross profit. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation
(25% depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar), operating expenses were higher as a result of increased idleness
expenses related to drilling rigs, to the expenses related to legal proceedings, to the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan and to
higher expenses mainly due to the return of exploratory blocks.
Operating Performance
Production
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Domestic crude oil and NGL production decreased by 3% mainly due to higher realization of scheduled stoppages,
mainly in P-48, P-53, FPSO Cid. Paraty and  P-18 platforms.  However, there were start-up and ramp-up of new systems, mainly FPSO
Cid. Itaguaí (Lula – Iracema Norte area), FPSO Cid. Maricá (Lula Alto) and P-58 (Parque das Baleias).
Natural gas production remained relatively flat because the scheduled stoppages mentioned above were mainly offset by increased gas
production of P-58 (Parque das Baleias) and by the production start-up of FPSO Cid. Maricá (Lula Alto).
Crude oil and NGL production abroad decreased 12% mainly as a result of the sale/return of fields in Argentina, and of the scheduled
stoppage of Akpo field in Nigeria.
Gas production abroad increased 11% due to the production ramp-up in the Hadrian South field in the United States.
Lifting Cost
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Lifting cost in U.S. dollar decreased due to lower expenses with well intervention and with engineering and
submarine maintenance, in addition to the higher share of pre-salt production, which has a lower unit cost.
In addition, production taxes decreased as a result of lower crude oil price.
Lifting cost decreased abroad due to the sale of the Austral Basin fields in Argentina, with higher operating costs, and to higher production
in the United States, with lower costs.

REFINING, TRANSPORTATION AND MARKETING
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Gross profit remained flat in the period, mainly due to the effects of foreign translation (25% depreciation of the
Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar). Excluding these effects, gross profit increased due to a decrease in crude oil purchase/transfer
costs, following lower Brent prices, the lower share of crude oil imports on feedstock processing and the decreased share of oil products
imports in our sales mix. These effects were partially offset by lower crude oil exports and by lower economic activity in Brazil that
decreased domestic oil products sales.
Operating Income
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Operating income remained relatively flat in the period, mainly due to the effects of foreign translation (25%
depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar). Excluding these effects, operating income increased in Brazilian Reais due to
higher gross profit, partially offset by impairment of Comperj assets due to a reassessment of this project.
Operating Performance
Imports and Exports of Crude Oil and Oil Products
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Improved balance of crude oil exports (imports) net, due to lower imports, as a result of decreased volume
processed and a higher share of domestic crude oil on feedstock processed. These effects were partially offset by decreased export
volume available, following lower production.
The decreased deficit of oil products exports (imports), net was due to lower need of diesel import as a result of lower economic activity.
Refining Operations
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Daily feedstock processed was 5% lower, due to scheduled stoppages, mainly in distillation plants of REPLAN and
REVAP, partially offset by higher production of RNEST, as a result of operating improvements made.
Refining Cost
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Refining cost, as measured in US$/barrel, decreased by 14%. As measured in R$/barrel, refining cost increased by
7% mainly reflecting higher employee compensation costs attributable to the 2015/2016 Collective Bargaining Agreement, along with a
decrease in feedstock processed.

GAS & POWER
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Gross profit decreased 15% in the 1H-2016 when compared to the 1H-2015, mainly due to the effects of foreign
translation (25% depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar). Excluding these effects, gross profit increased 5% in Brazilian
Reais, due to lower acquisition costs, mainly because of the reduction of natural gas and LNG imports. This effect was partially offset by
lower natural gas sales to the thermoelectric sector and by decreased electricity generation due to the improvement of hydrological
conditions in Brazil.
Operating income
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Operating income decreased 11% in the 1H-2016 when compared to the 1H-2015, mainly due to the effect of foreign
translation (25% depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar). Excluding these effects, operating income increased 14% in
Brazilian Reais due to higher gross profit and also to lower operating expenses. The 1H-2015 was mainly impacted by expenses from tax
contingencies and impairment, partially offset by the reversal of impairment of trade receivables from companies in the electricity sector.
Operating Performance
Physical and Financial Indicators
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Electricity sales to the Brazilian free contracting market (Ambiente de Contratação Livre – ACL) were 5% lower,
attributable to the termination of agreements.
Decreased electricity sales volumes to the Brazilian regulated market (Ambiente de Contratação Regulada – ACR) was due to the
termination of agreement representing 205 average MW, which occurred at Electricity Auction of 1H-2015.
The decreased electricity generation and lower electricity prices in the spot market (PLD) were due to improved hydrological conditions.
LNG imports decreased by 56% and natural gas imports from Bolivia were 10% lower, reflecting a decrease in thermoelectric demand.

DISTRIBUTION
Gross Profit
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Gross profit decreased 29% in the 1H-2016 when compared to the 1H-2015. Excluding foreign translation effects
(25% depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar), gross profit decreased 11% in Brazilian Reais due to lower sales volumes
in Brazil, caused by the lower economic activity which impacted industrial customers, in which the market share of BR Distribuidora is
higher than its competitors. These effects were partially offset by improved results abroad, due to higher gross margin as a result of
increased mix of sales products in Paraguay.
Operating income
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Operating income in Brazil decreased as a result of higher losses with tax contingencies, partially offset by
improved result abroad.
Operating Performance
Market Share - Brazil
(1H-2016 x 1H-2015): Decreased market share was the result of lower sales to the thermoelectric sector and lower economic activity that
mainly impacted industrial customers, in which the share of BR Distribuidora is higher than its competitors. In addition, the lower market
share is a result of a shift in our sales policy to prioritize higher margins instead of sales volumes.

As of June 30, 2016, the balance of cash and cash equivalents was US$ 19,609 million and the balance of adjusted cash and cash
equivalents for the same period was US$ 20,366 million. Our principal uses of funds in the 1H-2016 were for repayment of long-term
financing (and interest payments) and for capital expenditures. We partially met these requirements with cash provided by operating
activities of US$ 10,679 million and with proceeds from long-term financing of US$ 9,100 million. The balance of adjusted cash and cash
equivalents was negatively impacted in the 1H-2016 by foreign exchange rate variation applied to our foreign financial investments.
Net cash provided by operating activities of US$ 10,679 million was mainly generated by higher diesel and gasoline margins, lower
production taxes in Brazil and lower crude oil, oil products and natural gas imports costs, along with a higher share of domestic crude oil
on feedstock processing. These effects were partially offset by lower crude oil and oil product exports prices and decreased sales volume
in Brazil due to lower economic activity.
Capital expenditures and investments in investees were US$ 6,996 million in the 1H-2016 (89% in E&P business segment), a 41%
decrease when compared to the 1H-2015.
Free cash flow* was positive, amounting US$ 3,683 million in the 1H-2016, for the fifth consecutive quarter.
From January to June 2016, the Company issued global notes in international capital markets totaling US$ 6.75 billion, with maturities of 5
and 10 years, and the proceeds of those notes offerings were used to tender for US$ 6.3 billion of Petrobras’s existing global notes. In
addition, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback operation with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in the
amount of US$ 1 billion. The average maturity of outstanding debt was 7.30 years as of June 30, 2016 (7.14  years as of December 31,
2015). It is important to mention the issuing of US$ 3 billion for tender offer at the same amount in July 2016.
Repayments of interest and principal were US$ 19,159 million in the 1H-2016 and the nominal cash flow (cash view), including principal
and interest payments, by maturity, is set out in US$ million as follows:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
1.     Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure defined in the International Financial Reporting Standards – IFRS. Our calculation may not be
comparable to the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA by other companies and it should not be considered as a substitute for any measure
calculated in accordance with IFRS. The Company reports its Adjusted EBITDA to give additional information about its profitability and
must be considered in conjunction with other measures and indicators for a better understanding of the Company's financial performance.
The Adjusted EBITDA is also a component of the Net debt / LTM adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is a metric included in the Company’s
Business and Management Plan.
For interim financial periods, the Company calculates the last twelve months adjusted EBITDA (LTM Adjusted EBITDA), consistently with
market best practices.

The decreased reclassification of foreign exchange variation expenses from the Shareholders’ Equity to the Statement of Income was
mainly due to the fact that the 1Q-2016 was impacted by planned exports that were no longer expected to occur or did not occur, mainly
due to the decrease in crude oil prices. Decreased planned export volumes were no longer expected to occur or did not occur in the 2Q-
2016.
Additional hedging relationships may be revoked or additional reclassification adjustments from equity to the Statement of Income may
occur as a result of changes in forecast export prices and export volumes following a review in the Company’s business plan. Based on a
sensitivity analysis considering a US$ 10/barrel decrease in average Brent prices stress scenario, when compared to the Brent price
projections in our most recent update of the 2015-2019 Business and Management Plan (Plano de Negócios e Gestão – PNG), a US$ 302
million reclassification adjustment from Shareholders’ Equity to the statement of income would occur.
The expected annual realization of the foreign exchange variation balance in shareholders’ equity, on June 30, 2016, is set out below:

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
4. Results of Operations of 1H-2016 compared to 1H-2015:
Virtually all revenues and expenses of our Brazilian operations are denominated and payable in Brazilian Reais. When the Brazilian Real
depreciates relative to the U.S. dollar, as it did in the 1H-2016 (a 25% depreciation), revenues and expenses decrease when translated
into U.S. dollars. Nevertheless, the depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar affects the line items discussed below in
different ways.
Sales revenues were US$ 38,309 million in the 1H-2016, a 26% decrease (US$ 13,679 million) when compared to US$ 51,988 million in
the 1H-2015. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation, sales revenues decreased by 8% when expressed in Reais, due to:
·       Decreased domestic sales for oil products (7%), reflecting lower economic activity in Brazil and decreased diesel and fuel oil
consumption for thermoelectric generation;
·       Decreased electricity generation and prices due to improved hydrological conditions and decreased domestic natural gas sales
volumes; and
·       Lower crude oil and oil product export prices as a result of lower international crude oil prices.
These effects were partially offset by higher margins of diesel and gasoline.
Cost of sales were US$ 26,434 million in the 1H-2016, a 26% decrease (US$ 9,407 million) compared to US$ 35,841 million in the 1H-
2015. Excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation, cost of sales decreased by 8% when expressed in Reais, due to lower crude
oil, oil products and natural gas import costs, as well as lower production taxes in Brazil. These effects were partially offset by higher
depreciation expenses as a result of a decrease in estimated reserves (based on the unit of production method), partially offset by lower
carrying amounts of assets impacted by the impairment losses recognized in 2015.
Selling expenses were US$ 2,010 million in the 1H-2016, an 8% increase (US$ 143 million) compared to US$ 1,867 million in the 1H-2015.
Excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation, selling expenses increased by 33% in the period, mainly due to the reversal of
impairment of trade receivables from companies in the electricity sector in the 1Q-2015 (US$ 452 million) and higher freight expenses in
2016, following the depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar.
Exploration costs were US$ 761 million in the 1H-2016, a 5% decrease (US$ 44 million) compared to US$ 805 million in the 1H-2015.
Excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation, exploration costs increased by 16% in the period, mainly generated by return of
exploratory blocks due to their economic viability.
Other taxes were US$ 266 million in the 1H-2016, a 83% decrease (US$ 1,286 million) compared to US$ 1,552 million in the 1H-2015
mainly due to the burden of tax on financial operations (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras - IOF) applicable to intercompany loans
made by Petrobras to foreign subsidiaries and to the VAT tax (Imposto sobre a Circulação de Mercadorias e Serviços) on the acquisition
of natural gas recognized in the 1H-2015.
Other income and expenses, net were US$ 2,945 million in the 1H-2016, a 43% increase (US$ 883 million) when compared to US$ 2,062
million in the 1H-2015.  Excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation, other income and expenses, net increased by 76% in the
period, mainly due to:
·       Higher unscheduled stoppages and pre-operating expenses, mainly with drilling rigs idleness (US$ 527 million);
·       Higher expenses related to legal proceedings contingencies, mainly in connection with labor and civil lawsuits (US$ 440 million); and
·       Expenses with the new Voluntary Separation Incentive Plan (US$ 346 million).
Net finance expense was US$ 3,950 million in the 1H-2016, remaining relatively flat compared to US$ 3,932 million in the 1H-2015, due to
the depreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. Excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation, net finance expense
increased 26% in Brazilian Reais due to:
·       Higher interest expenses due to higher debt and to the effect of the depreciation of the average Brazilian Real against the U.S.
dollar;
·       Foreign exchange gains generated by the impact of an 17.8% appreciation of the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar on the
Company’s net debt in the 1H-2016, compared to foreign exchange losses generated by the impact of a 16.8% depreciation in the 1H-
2015;
·       The higher reclassification of cumulative foreign exchange variation from shareholders’ equity to net income due to occurred exports
designated for cash flow hedge accounting, and to a portion of future exports that were previously designated but were no longer expected
to occur or did not occur;
·       Foreign exchange losses caused by the impact of a 1.4% depreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro on the Company’s net debt
in the 1H-2016, compared to foreign exchange gains caused by the impact of an 8.2% appreciation in the 1H-2015; and
·       Foreign exchange gains caused by the impact of an 10.7% appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the Pound Sterling on the
Company’s net debt in the 1H-2016, compared to foreign exchange losses caused by the impact of a 0.9% depreciation in the 1H-2015.
Share of earnings in equity-accounted investments were US$ 212 million in the 1H-2016, a 84% increase (US$ 97  million) when compared
to US$ 115 million in the 1H-2015.  Excluding the effects of foreign exchange translation (25% depreciation of the Brazilian Real against
the U.S. dollar), share of earnings in equity-accounted investments increased by 130% in the period, mainly due to impairment  losses in
investee companies of Exploration and Production and Biofuels segments in the 1H-2015, as a result of decreased crude oil prices and
higher discount rates, due to an increase in Brazil’s risk premium resulting from a credit risk downgrade (losing its investment grade
status).
Income taxes (corporate income tax and social contribution) were US$ 234 million in the 1H-2016, a 88% decrease (US$ 1,692 million)
compared to US$ 1,926 million in the 1H-2015, mainly due to lower taxable income before income taxes and decreased corporate income
tax and social contribution tax expenses in Brazil over income earned abroad.
Loss related to non-controlling interests of US$ 372 million in the 1H-2016 (a US$ 157 million gain in the 1H-2015), mainly reflecting the
impact of foreign exchange variation on debt of structured entities in U.S. dollars in the period.

the statutory adjustments according to the new
organizational structure of the company and its new
management and governance model, to align the
organization to the new reality of the oil and gas sector
