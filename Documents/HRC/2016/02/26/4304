United Nations Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><b> I. Universal periodic review</b>2<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Basis, principles and objectives of the review 
</b></p>
<p>1. The basis, principles and objectives of the universal periodic review as set forth in 
paragraphs 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 shall be 
reaffirmed. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Periodicity and order of the review 
</b></p>
<p>2. The second cycle of the review shall begin in June 2012. 
</p>
<p>3. The periodicity of the review for the second and subsequent cycles will be of four 
and a half years. This will imply the consideration of 42 States per year during three 
sessions of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review. 
</p>
<p>4. The order of review established for the first cycle of the review shall be maintained 
for the second and subsequent cycles. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Process and modalities of the review 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Focus and documentation 
</b></p>
<p>5. The review during the second and subsequent cycles will continue to be based on the 
three documents identified in paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1. 
</p>
<p>6. The second and subsequent cycles of the review should focus on, inter alia, the 
implementation of the accepted recommendations<b> </b>and<b> </b>the developments of the human 
rights situation in the State under review. 
</p>
<p>7. The general guidelines for universal periodic review reports adopted by the Council 
in its decision 6/102 shall be adjusted to the focus of the second and subsequent cycles 
before the eighteenth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>8. Other relevant stakeholders are encouraged to include in their contributions 
information on the follow-up to the preceding review. 
</p>
<p>9. The summary of the information provided by other relevant stakeholders should 
contain, where appropriate, a separate section for contributions by the national human 
rights institution of the State under review that is accredited in full compliance with the 
Paris Principles. Information provided by other accredited national human rights 
institutions will be reflected accordingly, as well as information provided by other 
stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>  
 2 Changes to the universal periodic review contained in the present section shall be applicable as of the 
</p>
<p>second cycle of the review. </p>


<p><b> 2. Modalities 
</b></p>
<p>10. The role of the troikas shall be maintained as set forth in the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1 and in President&#8217;s statement PRST/8/1. 
</p>
<p>11. Following the extension of the review cycle to four and a half years and within 
existing resources and workload, the duration of the Working Group meeting for the review 
will be extended from the present three hours and the modalities will be agreed upon at the 
seventeenth session of the Council, including the list of speakers, which shall be based on 
the modalities as appear in the Appendix.  
</p>
<p>12. The final outcome of the review will be adopted by the plenary of the Council. The 
modalities for the organization of the one-hour consideration of the outcome shall be in 
accordance with President&#8217;s statement PRST/9/2.  
</p>
<p>13. The national human rights institutions of the State under review consistent with the 
principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of 
human rights annexed to General Assembly resolution 48/134 (the Paris Principles) shall be 
entitled to intervene immediately after the State under review during the adoption of the 
outcome of the review by the Council plenary.  
</p>
<p>14. The Universal Periodic Review Voluntary Trust Fund to facilitate the participation 
of States established by the Council in its resolution 6/17 should be strengthened and 
operationalized in order to encourage a significant participation of developing countries, 
particularly least developing countries and small island developing States, in their review.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Outcome of the review 
</b></p>
<p>15. The recommendations contained in the outcome of the review should preferably<b> </b>be 
clustered thematically with the full involvement and consent of the State under review and 
the States that made the recommendations. 
</p>
<p>16. The State under review should clearly communicate to the Council, in a written 
format preferably prior to the Council plenary, its positions on all received 
recommendations, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 27 and 32 of the annex 
to Council resolution 5/1.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Follow-up to the review 
</b></p>
<p>17. While the outcome of the review, as a cooperative mechanism, should be 
implemented primarily by the State concerned, States are encouraged to conduct broad 
consultations with all relevant stakeholders in this regard. 
</p>
<p>18. States are encouraged to provide the Council, on a voluntary basis, with a midterm 
update on follow-up to accepted recommendations.  
</p>
<p>19. The Voluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance, established by the 
Council in its resolution 6/17, should be strengthened and operationalized in order to 
provide a source of financial and technical assistance to help countries, in particular least 
developed countries and small island developing States, to implement the recommendations 
emanating from their review. A board of trustees should be established in accordance with 
the rules of the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>20. States may request the United Nations representation at the national or regional level 
to assist them in the implementation of follow-up to their review, bearing in mind the 
provisions of paragraph 36 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1. The Office of United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights may act as a clearing house for such 
assistance. </p>


<p>21. Financial and technical assistance for the implementation of the review should 
support national needs and priorities, as may be reflected in national implementation plans. 
</p>
<p><b> II.  Special procedures 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Selection and appointment of mandate holders 
</b></p>
<p>22. To further strengthen and enhance transparency in the selection and appointment 
process of mandate holders envisaged in the annex to Council resolution 5/1, the following 
provisions will apply: 
</p>
<p> (a) In addition to entities specified in paragraph 42, national human rights 
institutions in compliance with the Paris Principles may also nominate candidates as special 
procedures mandate holders;  
</p>
<p> (b) Individual candidates and candidates nominated by entities shall submit an 
application for each specific mandate, together with personal data and a motivation letter no 
longer than 600 words. The Office of the High Commissioner shall prepare a public list of 
candidates who applied for each vacancy; 
</p>
<p> (c) The Consultative Group will consider,<b> </b>in a transparent manner, candidates 
having applied for each specific mandate. However, under exceptional circumstances and if 
a particular post justifies it, the Group may consider additional candidates with equal or 
more suitable qualifications for the post. The Group shall interview shortlisted candidates to 
ensure equal treatment of all candidates;  
</p>
<p> (d) In implementing paragraph 52, the President shall justify his/her decision if 
he/she decides not to follow the order of priority proposed by the Consultative Group.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Working methods  
</b></p>
<p>23. In line with Council resolution 5/2, States should cooperate with and assist special 
procedures in the performance of their tasks and it is incumbent on mandate holders to 
exercise their functions in accordance with their mandates and in compliance with the code 
of conduct.  
</p>
<p>24. The integrity and independence of the special procedures and the principles of 
cooperation, transparency and accountability are integral to ensuring a robust system of the 
special procedures that would enhance the capacity of the Council to address human rights 
situations on the ground.  
</p>
<p>25. The special procedures shall continue to foster a constructive dialogue with States. 
The special procedures shall also endeavour to formulate their recommendations in a 
concrete, comprehensive and action-oriented way and pay attention to the technical 
assistance and capacity-building needs of States in their thematic and country mission 
reports. The comments of the State concerned shall be included as an addendum to country 
mission reports. 
</p>
<p>26. States are urged to cooperate with and assist special procedures by responding in a 
timely manner to requests for information and visits, and to study carefully the conclusions 
and recommendations addressed to them by the special procedures.  
</p>
<p>27. The Council should streamline its requests to special procedures, in particular with 
regard to reporting, to ensure meaningful discussion of their reports. The Council should 
remain as a forum for open, constructive and transparent discussion on cooperation between 
States and special procedures, allowing for the identification and exchange of good 
practices and lessons learned. </p>


<p>28. National human rights institutions consistent with the principles relating to the status 
of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights annexed to 
General Assembly resolution 48/134 (the Paris Principles) of the country concerned shall 
be entitled to intervene immediately after the country concerned during the interactive 
dialogue, following the presentation of a country mission report by a special procedure 
mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>29. The Office of the High Commissioner will continue to maintain information on 
special procedures, such as mandates, mandate holders, invitations and country visits and 
responses thereto, as well as reports presented to the Council and the General Assembly, in 
comprehensive and easily accessible manner.  
</p>
<p>30. The Council strongly rejects any act of intimidation or reprisal against individuals 
and groups who cooperate or have cooperated with the United Nations, its representatives 
and mechanisms in the field of human rights, and urges States to prevent and ensure 
adequate protection against such acts. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Resources and funding  
</b></p>
<p>31. The Council recognizes the importance of ensuring the provision of adequate and 
equitable funding, with equal priority accorded to civil and political rights and economic, 
social and cultural rights, including the right to development, to support all special 
procedures according to their specific needs, including additional tasks entrusted to them by 
the General Assembly. This should be achieved through the regular budget of the United 
Nations.  
</p>
<p>32. The Council therefore requests the Secretary-General to ensure the availability of 
adequate resources within the regular budget of the Office of the High Commissioner to 
support the full implementation by special procedures of their mandates. 
</p>
<p>33. The Council also recognizes the continued need for extra-budgetary funding to 
support the work of the special procedures, and welcomes further voluntary contributions 
by Member States, emphasizing that these contributions should be, to the extent possible, 
unearmarked. 
</p>
<p>34. The Council highlights the need for full transparency in the funding of the special 
procedures. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Advisory Committee 
</b></p>
<p>35. The Council shall, within existing resources, strengthen its interaction with the 
Advisory Committee and engage more systematically with it through work formats such as 
seminars, panels, working groups and sending feedback to the inputs of the Committee. 
</p>
<p>36. The Council shall endeavour to clarify specific mandates given to the Advisory 
Committee under relevant resolutions, including indicating thematic priorities and provide 
specific guidelines for the Advisory Committee with a view to triggering implementation-
oriented outputs.  
</p>
<p>37. In order to provide a proper setting for a better interaction between the Council and 
its Committee, the first annual session of the Committee shall henceforth be convened 
immediately prior to the March session of the Council, while the second session shall be 
held in August. 
</p>

<p>39. The Committee shall endeavour to enhance intersessional work between its 
members in order to give effect to the provisions of paragraph 81 of the annex to Council 
resolution 5/1.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Agenda and framework for the programme of work 
</b></p>
<p>40. The Council&#8217;s agenda and framework for programme of work are as is specified in 
the annex to Council resolution 5/1.  
</p>
<p>41. Council cycles will be aligned with the calendar year and be subject to any 
necessary transitional arrangements decided on by the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Methods of work and rules of procedure 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Yearly panel with United Nations agencies and funds  
</b></p>
<p>42. The Council shall hold a half-day panel discussion once a year to interact with heads 
of governing bodies and secretariats of United Nations agencies and funds within their 
respective mandates on specific human rights themes with the objective of promoting the 
mainstreaming of human rights throughout the United Nations system. The present 
provision does not preclude other opportunities that may arise for discussions between the 
Council and United Nations agencies and funds on the mainstreaming of human rights.  
</p>
<p>43. State or regional groups may propose issues to be discussed by the panel. On the 
basis of such proposals and consultation with all regional groups, the President of the 
Council will propose the theme of the panel discussion for the upcoming year for approval 
by the Council at its relevant organizational session.  
</p>
<p>44. The Office of High Commissioner, in its capacity as secretariat of the Council, shall 
coordinate the preparation of the documentation required for the panel discussion.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Voluntary yearly calendar of resolutions  
</b></p>
<p>45. The Bureau shall establish a tentative yearly calendar for the thematic resolutions of 
the Human Rights Council in consultation with the main sponsors. The yearly calendar will 
be established on a voluntary basis and without prejudice to the right of States as provided 
for by paragraph 117 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1.  
</p>
<p>46. The calendar should also contemplate the appropriate synchronization of schedules 
for resolutions, mandates and presentation of reports by the special procedures, taking into 
account the need for balance between them.  
</p>
<p>47. The Bureau shall present a report to the Council in its eighteenth session.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Bi- and triennial thematic resolutions  
</b></p>
<p>48. In principle and on a voluntary basis, omnibus thematic resolutions should be tabled 
on a biennial or triennial basis.  
</p>
<p>49. Thematic resolutions on the same issue to be presented in between the above-
mentioned intervals are expected to be shorter and focused on addressing the specific 
question or standard gap that justified their presentation.  </p>


<p><b> D. Transparency and extensive consultations for resolutions and decisions  
</b></p>
<p>50. The consultation process on, inter alia, resolutions and decisions of the Council shall 
observe the principles of transparency and inclusiveness.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Documentation  
</b></p>
<p>51. There is a need for ensuring the availability of working documents in a timely 
manner and in all official languages of the United Nations.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Deadlines for the notification and submission of draft initiatives and 
programme budget implication information  
</b></p>
<p>52. There is a need for early submission of Draft resolutions and decisions by the end of 
the penultimate week of the Council session.  
</p>
<p>53. Sponsors of initiatives are encouraged to contact the Office of High Commissioner 
before the second week of the session with a view to facilitate the circulation of information 
on budgetary implications, if any.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Establishment of an office of the President  
</b></p>
<p>54. In line with the procedural and organizational roles of the President, the Office of 
the President of the Human Rights Council shall be established, within existing resources, 
in order to support the President in the fulfilment of his or her tasks and enhance efficiency, 
continuity and institutional memory in this regard. 
</p>
<p>55. The Office of the President shall be provided with adequate resources drawn from 
the regular budget, including staff, office space and necessary equipment required for the 
fulfilment of their tasks. The appointment of the staff of the Office shall promote equitable 
geographic distribution and gender balance. The staff of the Office shall be accountable to 
the President. 
</p>
<p>56. The composition, modalities and financial implications of the Office of President 
shall be considered by the Council on the basis of the report of the secretariat, at its 
seventeenth session. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Human Rights Council secretariat service 
</b></p>
<p>57. The secretariat service to the Council and its mechanisms should continue to be 
improved to enhance the efficiency of the work of the Council.  
</p>
<p><b> I. Accessibility for persons with disabilities 
</b></p>
<p>58. There is a need to enhance accessibility for persons with disabilities to the Council 
and the work of its mechanisms, including its information and communication technology, 
Internet resources and documents, in accordance with international standards on 
accessibility for persons with disabilities.  
</p>
<p><b> J. Use of information technology  
</b></p>
<p>59. The Council shall explore the feasibility of the use of information technology, such 
as videoconferencing or video messaging, in order to enhance access and participation by </p>


<p>non-resident State delegations, specialized agencies, other intergovernmental organizations 
and national human rights institutions consistent with the principles relating to the status of 
national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights annexed to General 
Assembly resolution 48/134 (the Paris Principles), as well as by non-governmental 
organizations in consultative status, bearing in mind the need to ensure full compliance of 
such participation with its rules of procedure and rules concerning accreditation.  
</p>
<p>60. The use of modern information technology, such as the electronic circulation of 
copies, is encouraged in order to reduce the circulation of paper.  
</p>
<p><b> K. Task force 
</b></p>
<p>61. The Council decides to establish a task force to study the issues envisaged in 
paragraphs 57, 58, 59 and 60 in consultation with Government representatives, the Office 
of the High Commissioner and the United Nations Office at Geneva and all relevant 
stakeholders, and to submit concrete recommendations to the Council at its nineteenth 
session. 
</p>
<p><b> L. Technical assistance trust fund 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Council will consider modalities for the establishment of a technical assistance 
trust fund to support the participation of least developed countries and small island 
developing States in the work of the Council at its nineteenth session.</p>


<p><b>Appendix 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Modalities for establishing the list of speakers for the 
Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
</b></p>
<p> The established procedures, which allow speaking time of three minutes for Member 
States and two minutes for observer States, will continue to apply when all speakers can be 
accommodated within -- minutes available to Member and observer States. 
</p>
<p> Should it not be possible to accommodate all speakers within -- minutes based on 
three minutes of speaking time for Member States and two minutes for observer States, the 
speaking time will be reduced to two minutes for all.  
</p>
<p> If all speakers still cannot be accommodated, the speaking time will be divided 
among all delegations inscribed so as to enable each and every speaker to take the floor. 
</p>
<p><b>  Steps for drawing up the list of speakers 
</b></p>
<p>1. The list of speakers will open at 10 a.m. on the Monday of the week preceding the 
beginning of the session of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review and 
remain open for a period of four days. It will close on the Thursday at 6 p.m.. A registration 
desk will be set up at the Palais des Nations. The exact location will be communicated to all 
permanent missions by the secretariat. 
</p>
<p>2. In all cases, regardless of speaking time, the delegations inscribed on the list of 
speakers will be arranged in alphabetical order of the country names in English. On the 
Friday morning preceding the beginning of the session, the President, in the presence of the 
Bureau, will draw by lot the first speaker on the list. The list of speakers will continue from 
the State drawn onward. On the Friday afternoon, all delegations will be informed of the 
speaking order and of the speaking time available to delegations. 
</p>
<p>3. Speaking time limits during the review will be strictly enforced. Speakers who 
exceed their speaking time will have their microphones cut off. Speakers may therefore 
wish to deliver the essential part at the beginning of their statements. 
</p>
<p>4. All speakers will retain the possibility of swapping place on the speakers list under 
bilateral arrangement between speakers. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
