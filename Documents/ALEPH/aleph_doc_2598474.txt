Review of operations 
30 June 2016 
  
Review of Operations and Financial Results 
The principal activities of the consolidated entity consisting of AusTex Oil Limited (herein referred to as the “Company” or 
“AusTex”) and the entities it controlled (the “Group”) consisted of production and development of oil and gas leases in 
Oklahoma and a small amount of production only in Kansas in the United States of America.
Consistent with the presentation currency used for the prior comparative 6-month period to 30 June 2015 and since that 
time, the financial information is presented in US dollars.
Operating Results
The operating result of the Group increased to a loss of USD $(4,184,810) (2015: Loss of USD $3,139,992) principally due 
to a decrease in revenue.
Revenue & Production Growth
Gross  Revenue  from  oil  and  gas  sales  from  leases  held  by  the  Group  for  the  6  months  ended  30  June  2016  was  USD 
$2,144,389 compared to USD $7,286,677 for the 6 months ending 30 June 2015.  Production from the leases held by the 
company for the 6 months ended 30 June 2016 was 136,618 BOE which was comprised of 58.9 MBBLs of Oil and 466.4 
MMCF of Gas compared to 199,751 BOE (99.0 MBBLs of Oil and 604.1 MMCF of Gas) for the 6 months ended 30 June 2015.

During the 6 months ended 30 June 2016, exploration and development was focused on the Snake River Project in Kay 
County, Oklahoma. AusTex, as Operator, drilled just one new vertical production well on the project during the 6 months 
ended 30 June 2016 being the Steichen 12-1A in the north eastern quadrant of the Snake River acreage.
The Steichen 12-1A was the first well drilled since the Wyckoff #29-6 which was drilled into the Mississippian formation in 
the south western quadrant of the Snake River field during the September quarter of last year. The Company believes  this 
is an area which has some old but compelling production and the drilling was undertaken so the Company could enhance 
its  understanding  of  the  complicated  Mississippian  geology  in  the  area  to enable  a  higher  quality  and more  consistent 
drilling program once the oil price rebounds. The well was drilled to a Total Depth of 4,290 feet targeting the Mississippi 
Chat  formation.  Samples  and  open  hole  logs  indicated  the  presence  of  commercial  hydrocarbons  and  a  completion  is 
currently underway The total drill and completion cost for the well was less than USD$300,000 which is roughly 50% less 
than our average for wells drilled in the area. A reduction of that magnitude is likely not sustainable going forward, but in 
this environment, well costs of USD$450,000 – USD$525,000 are expected to be sustainably feasible.
Consistent with its strategy outlined in the first two quarters of 2016, the current downturn in the oil sector is providing 
the Company with the opportunity to maintain the dual focus of, firstly, using its strong balance sheet and cash reserves of 
to  pursue  acquisition  opportunities  that  meet  the  Company’s  stringent  criteria  and,  secondly,  continuing  to  prudently 
develop and produce at its 100% owned Snake River Project in Kay County, Northern Oklahoma targeting the liquid rich 
Mississippi Lime formation.
At  the  end  of  the  half  year  period,  66  wells  were  in  production  (including  3  non-operated  wells)  with  3  wells  under 
completion and a further 15 wells shut in having been determined as temporarily uneconomic. Given the ongoing oil price 
compression, production remained constrained across the half year period so as to preserve oil in the formation for sale in 
a more favourable pricing environment. The Company intends to continue to roughly match production with the Company’s 
hedging book. This strategy will continue to be applied in the near term with the Company continuing to monitor oil prices. 
Should the forward curve move up or down significantly from June quarter levels, management will likely adjust the number 
of wells in active production according to their economic contribution.
The Snake River Project remains the core development focus area of the company.

Kansas
Consistent with previous announcements to the market, given the success of the Snake River Project in Northern Oklahoma, 
following on from 2015 there was no exploration, development or production work on the Company’s acreage in Kansas 
in the half year period. The Company continues to review its acreage throughout Kansas as it prioritizes the acceleration of 
development and production at Snake River and identifying acquisition and other corporate opportunities. The Company’s 
acreage in Kansas contributes only a nominal amount to production of around 1% to 2% of total production.

and in determining the allocation of resources.    
 
The CODM reviews EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). The accounting policies adopted 
for internal reporting to the CODM are consistent with those adopted in the financial statements. The information reported 
to the CODM is on at least a monthly basis.

Note 5. Non-current assets - Derivative financial instruments (continued) 
  
The  company  is  exposed  to  price  risk  which  relates  to  the  risk  that  the  fair  value  or  future  cash  flows  of  a  financial 
instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices largely due to demand and supply factors for oil and gas. In 
conjunction  with  the  term  loan  agreement  covenant,  the  group  is  expected  to  hedge  for  price  risk  on  70%  to  90% 
reasonable projected volume. Open positions were marked to market based on settlement prices and are classified in the 
financial statements according to expected maturity dates. 
  
The  company  uses  futures,  swaps  and  options  to  meet  customer  needs  and  locks  in  market  opportunities.  These 
instruments are intended to be cash flow transactions and are not used for trading. Gains and losses related to contracts 
are reflected in revenue as these contracts are realised. Hedge accounting is not used for these commodity derivatives.

1.3x Proved Developed Reserve PV 10 coverage to loan 
1.0x Current Ratio Average (“PDP PV Ratio”) 
70% to 90% reasonable projected volume to be hedged for 
price risk for 2 to 4 years

Lender 1% on drawdown; 0.5% commitment fee on any used 
$20 million of immediate availability 
Substantially all production properties
Collateral 
 
On May 1, 2016, the Company and the Bank made a minor amendment to the loan agreement to provide for a 
Restricted Cash Reserve Amount of $8.0 million with such funds being available to prepay the loan principal in the event 
that the Company’s PDP PV Ratio is less than 1.3x to 1.0x.  The $8.0 million is shown as restricted cash on the balance 
sheet.  Such funds may also be used to prepay the loan at the Company’s discretion and additionally, the Company may 
request the Bank to release such cash to fund the acquisition and development of collateral properties and for general 
corporate purposes related to exploration and production activities.  The restrictions on these funds will terminate on 
the date the PDP PV Ratio is determined by the Bank based on the delivery of the July 2016 Reserve Report.  
Commencing with the July 2016 Reserve Report and going forward on a semi-annual basis, the Bank’s determination of 
the PDP PV Ratio will reflect adjustments for production and any prepayment of the loan principal since the effective 
date of the Reserve Report.  Outstanding principal of the loan equal to the amount of cash in the restricted account will 
bear interest at the interest rate of the one month LIBOR plus 1.50% versus the LIBOR plus 4.50% interest rate. 
 
Commencing with the end of the restricted cash period (July 2016 Reserve Report) and going forward, the agreement 
provides that the Company will also maintain an unrestricted Additional Cash Reserve Amount up to $2.0 million in the 
event that PDP PV Ratio is less than 1.5x to 1.0x.  The Additional Cash Reserve Amount will be used by the Company to 
prepay loan principal in the event that the PDP PV Ratio is less than 1.3x to 1.0x as at July 2016 (together with the 
Restricted Cash Reserve Amount) and going forward to the extent necessary to be in compliance with such ratio. 
 
Since the July 2016 Reserve Report calculated PDP reserves at less than 1.3 to 1.0 times the outstanding Bank loan 
principal, $1,674,615 of loan principal has been reclassed from non-current to current borrowings due to the ability of 
the Bank to draw down the Restricted cash by a like amount.

Note 13. Fair value measurement 
  
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are assumed to approximate their fair 
values due to their short-term nature. 
  
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the remaining contractual maturities at the current market 
interest rate that is available for similar financial liabilities. 
  
Derivative financial instruments have been valued using quoted market rates (level 1). This valuation technique maximises 
the  use  of  observable  market  data  where  it  is  available  and  relies  as  little  as  possible  on  entity  specific  estimates.  All 
derivative financial instruments remain valued as at level 1 assets or continue to be valued as level 1 assets.
Note 14. Events after the reporting period 
  
No matter or circumstance  has arisen since 30 June 2016 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the 
group's operations, the results of those operations, or the group's state of affairs in future financial years.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REVIEW REPORT
To the members of AusTex Oil Limited
Report on the Half-Year Financial Report
We have reviewed the accompanying half-year financial report of AusTex Oil Limited, which comprises 
the  statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016, the statement of profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income, the statement of changes in equity and the statement of cash flows for the 
half-year ended on that date, notes comprising a statement of accounting policies and other 
explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration of the consolidated entity comprising the 
company and the entities it controlled at the half-year’s end or from time to time during the half-year.
Directors’ Responsibility for the Half-Year Financial Report
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the half-year financial report that 
gives a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 
2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of 
the half-year financial report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half-year financial report based on our review. We 
conducted our review in accordance with Auditing Standard on Review Engagements ASRE 2410 Review 
of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity, in order to state whether, 
on the basis of the procedures described, we have become aware of any matter that makes us believe 
that the half-year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 including: giving 
a true and fair view of the consolidated entity’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and its 
performance for the half-year ended on that date; and complying with Accounting Standard AASB 134 
Interim Financial Reporting and the Corporations Regulations 2001. As the auditor of AusTex Oil 
Limited, ASRE 2410 requires that we comply with the ethical requirements relevant to the audit of the 
annual financial report.
A review of a half-year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible 
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is 
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards 
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant 
matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
Independence
In conducting our review, we have complied with the independence requirements of the Corporations 
Act 2001. We confirm that the independence declaration required by the Corporations Act 2001, which 
has been given to the directors of AusTex Oil Limited, would be in the same terms if given to the 
directors as at the time of this auditor’s review report.

its performance for the half-year ended on that date; and
