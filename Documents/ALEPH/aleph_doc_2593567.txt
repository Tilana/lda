Depository Global Warrants or portion thereof surrendered upon such exchange.
(4)

issuance of such certificate. The Warrant Certificates may be engraved, printed or lithographed, or partly in one form and partly in another, as the Warrant
Agent may determine.
(2)
Any Warrant Certificate validly issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture in effect at the time of issue of such Warrant Certificate shall, subject
to the terms of this Indenture and applicable law, validly entitle the holder to acquire Common Shares, notwithstanding that the form of such Warrant
Certificate may not be in the form currently required by this Indenture.
(3)
No Warrant shall be considered issued and shall be valid or obligatory or shall entitle the holder thereof to the benefits of this Indenture, until it has been
Authenticated by the Warrant Agent. Authentication by the Warrant Agent shall not be construed as a representation or warranty by the Warrant Agent as
to the validity of this Indenture or of such Warrant Certificates or Uncertificated Warrants (except the due Authentication thereof) or as to the performance
by the Corporation of its obligations under this Indenture and the Warrant Agent shall in no respect be liable or answerable for the use made of the
Warrants or any of them or of the consideration thereof. Authentication by the Warrant Agent shall be conclusive evidence as against the Corporation that
the Warrants so Authenticated have been duly issued hereunder and that the holder thereof is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
-12-
(4)
The Warrant Agent shall Authenticate Uncertificated Warrants (whether upon original issuance, exchange, registration of transfer, or otherwise) by
completing its Internal Procedures and the Corporation shall, and hereby acknowledges that it shall, thereupon be deemed to have duly and validly issued
such Uncertificated Warrants under this Indenture. Such Authentication shall be conclusive evidence that such Uncertificated Warrant has been duly
issued hereunder and that the holder or holders are entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. The register shall be final and conclusive evidence as to all
matters relating to Uncertificated Warrants with respect to which this Indenture requires the Warrant Agent to maintain records or accounts. In case of
differences between the register at any time and any other time the register at the later time shall be controlling, absent manifest error.
(5)
No Certificated Warrant shall be considered issued and Authenticated or, if Authenticated, shall be obligatory or shall entitle the holder thereof to the
benefits of this Indenture, until it has been Authenticated by manual signature by or on behalf of the Warrant Agent substantially in the form of the Warrant
set out in Schedule "A" hereto. Such Authentication on any such Certificated Warrant shall be conclusive evidence that such Certificated Warrant is duly
Authenticated and is valid and a binding obligation of the Corporation and that the holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture. The Authentication by
the Warrant Agent on any such Certificated Warrant hereunder shall not be construed as a representation or warranty by the Warrant Agent as to the
validity of this Indenture or of such Warrant or its issuance (except the due Authentication thereof and any other warranties by law) or as to the
performance by the Corporation of its obligations under this Indenture and the Warrant Agent shall in no respect be liable or answerable for the use made
of the Warrants or any of them or the proceeds thereof.
(6)
No Uncertificated Warrant shall be considered issued and shall be obligatory or shall entitle the holder thereof to the benefits of this Indenture, until it has
been Authenticated by entry on the register of the particulars of the Uncertificated Warrant. Such entry on the register of the particulars of an Uncertificated
Warrant shall be conclusive evidence that such Uncertificated Warrant is a valid and binding obligation of the Corporation and that the holder is entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture. Authenticating by way of entry on the register shall not be construed as a representation or warranty by the Warrant Agent as
to the validity of this Indenture or of such Warrants (except the due Authentication thereof) or as to the performance by the Corporation of its obligations
under this Indenture and the Warrant Agent shall in no respect be liable or answerable for the use made of the Uncertificated Warrants or any of them or
the proceeds thereof.
Section 2.8Register of Warrants
(1)
The Warrant Agent shall maintain records and accounts concerning the Warrants, whether certificated and uncertificated, which shall contain the
information called for below with respect to each Warrant, together with such other information as may be required by law or as the Warrant Agent may
elect to record. All such information shall be kept in one set of accounts and records which the Warrant Agent shall designate (in such manner as shall
permit it to be so identified as such by
-13-
an unaffiliated party) as the register of the holders of Warrants. The information to be entered for each account in the register of Warrants at any time shall
  
include (without limitation):
(a) the name and address of the holder of the Warrants, the date of Authentication thereof and the number of Warrants;
(b)
whether such Warrant is a Certificated Warrant or an Uncertificated Warrant and, if a Warrant Certificate, the unique number or code assigned to and
imprinted thereupon and, if an Uncertificated Warrant, the unique number or code assigned thereto if any;
whether such Warrant has been cancelled; and
(c)
(d) a register of transfers in which all transfers of Warrants and the date and other particulars of each transfer shall be entered.
The register shall be available for inspection by the Corporation and or any Registered Warrantholder during the Warrant Agent's regular business hours on
a Business Day and upon payment to the Warrant Agent of its reasonable fees. Any Registered Warrantholder exercising such right of inspection shall first
provide an affidavit in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Warrant Agent stating the name and address of the Registered Warrantholder and
agreeing not to use the information therein except in connection with an effort to call a meeting of Warrantholders or to influence the voting of Warrantholders
at any meeting of Warrantholders.
(2)
Once an Uncertificated Warrant has been Authenticated, the information set forth in the register with respect thereto at the time of Authentication may be
altered, modified, amended, supplemented or otherwise changed only to reflect exercise or proper instructions to the Warrant Agent from the holder as
provided herein, except that the Warrant Agent may act unilaterally to make purely administrative changes internal to the Warrant Agent and changes to
correct errors. Each person who becomes a holder of an Uncertificated Warrant, by his, her or its acquisition thereof shall be deemed to have irrevocably
(i) consented to the foregoing authority of the Warrant Agent to make such error corrections, and (ii) agreed to pay to the Warrant Agent, promptly upon
written demand, the full amount of all losses and expenses (including without limitation reasonable legal fees of the Corporation and the Warrant Agent)
plus interest, at an appropriate then prevailing rate of interest to the Warrant Agent, sustained by the Corporation or the Warrant Agent as a proximate
result of such error if but only if and only to the extent that such present or former holder realized any benefit as a result of such error and could reasonably
have prevented, forestalled or minimized such loss and expense by prompt reporting of the error or avoidance of accepting benefits thereof whether or not
such error is or should have been timely detected and corrected by the Warrant Agent; provided, that no person who is a bona fide purchaser shall have
any such obligation to the Corporation or to the Warrant Agent.
-14-
Section 2.9Issue in Substitution for Warrant Certificates Lost, etc.
(1)
If any Warrant Certificate becomes mutilated or is lost, destroyed or stolen, the Corporation, subject to applicable law, shall issue and thereupon the
Warrant Agent shall certify and deliver, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor as the one mutilated, lost, destroyed or stolen in exchange for and in place
of and upon cancellation of such mutilated Warrant Certificate, or in lieu of and in substitution for such lost, destroyed or stolen Warrant Certificate, and the
substituted Warrant Certificate shall be in a form approved by the Warrant Agent and the Warrants evidenced thereby shall be entitled to the benefits
hereof and shall rank equally in accordance with its terms with all other Warrants issued or to be issued hereunder.
(2)
The applicant for the issue of a new Warrant Certificate pursuant to this Section 2.9 shall bear the cost of the issue thereof and in case of loss, destruction
or theft shall, as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, furnish to the Corporation and to the Warrant Agent such evidence of ownership and of the
loss, destruction or theft of the Warrant Certificate so lost, destroyed or stolen as shall be satisfactory to the Corporation and to the Warrant Agent, in their
sole discretion, and such applicant shall also be required to furnish an indemnity and surety bond in amount and form satisfactory to the Corporation and
the Warrant Agent, in their sole discretion, and shall pay the reasonable charges of the Corporation and the Warrant Agent in connection therewith.
Section 2.10Exchange of Warrant Certificates.
(1)
Any one or more Warrant Certificates representing any number of Warrants may, upon compliance with the reasonable requirements of the Warrant Agent
(including compliance with Applicable Securities Laws), be exchanged for one or more other Warrant Certificates representing the same aggregate
number of Warrants as represented by the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates so exchanged.
(2)
Warrant Certificates may be exchanged only at the Warrant Agency or at any other place that is designated by the Corporation with the approval of the
Warrant Agent. Any Warrant Certificate or duly executed Transaction Instruction from the holder (or such other instructions, in form satisfactory to the
Warrant Agent), tendered for exchange shall be cancelled and surrendered by the Warrant Agency to the Warrant Agent.
Section 2.11Transfer and Ownership of Warrants.
(1)
The Warrants may only be transferred on the register kept by the Warrant Agent at the Warrant Agency by the Registered Warrantholder or its legal
representatives or its attorney duly appointed by an instrument in writing in form and execution satisfactory to the Warrant Agent only upon (a) in the case
of a Warrant Certificate, surrendering to the Warrant Agent at the Warrant Agency the Warrant Certificates representing the Warrants to be transferred
together with a duly executed transfer form as set forth in Schedule "A", (b) in the case of Book Entry Only Warrants, in accordance with procedures
prescribed by the Depository under the book entry registration system, (c) in the case of Uncertificated Warrants, surrendering to the Warrant Agent at the
Warrant Agency, a duly executed Transaction Instruction from
-15-
the holder (or such other instructions, in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent), and (d) upon compliance with:
(i)
the conditions herein;
(ii)
such reasonable requirements as the Warrant Agent may prescribe; and
(iii)
all Applicable Securities Laws and requirements of Regulatory Authorities;
and such transfer shall be duly noted in such register by the Warrant Agent. Upon compliance with such requirements, the Warrant Agent shall issue to the
transferee of a Certificated Warrant, a Warrant Certificate, and to the transferee of an Uncertificated Warrant, an Uncertificated Warrant (or it shall
Authenticate and deliver a Certificated Warrant instead, upon request), representing the Warrants transferred and the transferee of a Book Entry Only Warrant
shall be recorded through the relevant Book Entry Only Participant in accordance with the book entry registration system as the entitlement holder in respect
of such Warrants.
(2)
Subject to the provisions of this Indenture and applicable law, the Warrantholder shall be entitled to the rights and privileges attaching to the Warrants, and
the issue of Common Shares by the Corporation upon the exercise of Warrants in accordance with the terms and conditions herein contained shall
discharge all responsibilities of the Corporation and the Warrant Agent with respect to such Warrants and neither the Corporation nor the Warrant Agent
shall be bound to inquire into the title of any such holder.
Section 2.12Cancellation of Surrendered Warrants.
All Warrant Certificates surrendered pursuant to Section 2.13, Section 3.1 or Section 3.4 shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent and upon such
circumstances all such Uncertificated Warrants, as applicable, shall be deemed cancelled and so noted on the register by the Warrant Agent. Upon request
by the Corporation, the Warrant Agent shall furnish to the Corporation a cancellation certificate identifying the Warrant Certificates so cancelled, the number
of Warrants evidenced thereby, the number of Common Shares, if any, issued pursuant to such Warrants and the details of any Warrant Certificates issued in
substitution or exchange for such Warrant Certificates cancelled.
Section 2.13Withdrawal of Warrants from Warrant Indenture.
(1)
Subject to compliance with Applicable Securities Laws, the requirements of Regulatory Authorities and this Section 2.13, a Registered Warrantholder (or
its legal representatives or its attorney duly appointed by an instrument in writing in form and execution satisfactory to the Warrant Agent) may elect to
withdraw Warrants represented by Warrant Certificates from this Warrant Indenture in exchange for a Warrant Agreement in the form set forth in Schedule
“C” by delivering the Warrant Certificates representing the Warrants to be withdrawn to the Warrant Agent,
-16-
together with a duly executed and completed Withdrawal Form in the form set forth as Schedule “D” to each of the Warrant Agent and the Corporation.
(2)
Upon receipt by the Warrant Agent of the Withdrawal Form, and the applicable Warrant Certificates, the Warrant Agent shall immediately notify the
Corporation, and such withdrawal shall thereafter be duly noted in such register by the Warrant Agent and the number of Warrants evidenced thereby shall
be removed from the register and the Warrant Certificate(s) cancelled. Upon withdrawal from this Warrant Indenture, the Warrant Agent shall have no
further obligations with respect to such Warrants under this Warrant Indenture and no Warrant Agency shall exist with the Warrantholder.
(3)
Immediately upon the delivery to the Warrant Agent and the Corporation of the duly executed and completed Withdrawal Form in compliance with this
Section 2.13 the Warrant Agreement to be issued to such Warrantholder shall be deemed to have been concurrently issued, and the Person or Persons to
whom such Warrant Agreement is to be issued shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of such Warrants on the date of delivery of
the Withdrawal Form and bound by the terms set forth in the Warrant Agreement.
As soon as possible following receipt of the written notice from the Warrant Agent referred to in Section 2.13(2), but in any event no later than one (1)
(4)Trading Day after delivery of the Withdrawal Notice to the Warrant Agent and the Corporation, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered or mailed to the
Person or Persons in whose name or names the Warrant is registered or, if so specified in writing by the holder, cause to be delivered to such Person or
Persons at the offices of the Warrant Agent where the Warrant Certificate was surrendered, the Warrant Agreement.
Article 3
EXERCISE OF WARRANTS
Section 3.1Right of Exercise.
Subject to the provisions hereof, each Registered Warrantholder may exercise the right conferred on such holder to subscribe for and purchase one
Common Share for each Warrant after the Issue Date and prior to the Expiry Time and in accordance with the conditions herein.
If no Registration Statement is effective under the U.S. Securities Act, or if the prospectus contained therein is not available for the offer and sale of the
Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, at any time prior to the Expiry Time, such Warrantholder shall be notified forthwith by the Warrant
Agent that such Warrantholder is entitled to a cashless exercise, in accordance with Section 3.3.
Section 3.2Warrant Exercise.
(1)Registered Warrantholders of Warrant Certificates who wish to exercise the Warrants held by them in order to acquire Common Shares must either:
-17-
(a)
complete a Transaction Instruction or the exercise form (the "Exercise Notice") attached to the Warrant Certificate(s) in the form set forth in Schedule "A"
hereto, which may be amended by the Corporation with the consent of the Warrant Agent, if such amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion of the
Corporation and the Warrant Agent, which may be based on the advice of Counsel, materially and adversely affect the rights, entitlements and interests of
the Warrantholders and deliver such certificate(s), the executed Exercise Notice and a certified cheque, bank draft or money order payable to or to the
order of the Corporation for the Exercise Price to the Warrant Agent at the Warrant Agency; or
(b)
complete a Transaction Instruction or the Exercise Notice attached to the Warrant Certificate(s) in the form set forth in Schedule "A" hereto, and deliver
such certificate(s) and the executed Exercise Notice to the Warrant Agent with a copy of such certificate(s) and the executed Exercise Notice to the
Corporation and send a wire transfer to the Corporation for the Exercise Price in accordance with the following wire transfer instructions:
Wells Fargo
Account Name: Vista Gold Corp
Routing Number: 121000248
Account Number: 4977297647
Swift Code: WFBIUS6S
The Corporation will provide written confirmation in the form attached as Schedule “B” to the Warrant Agent upon receipt of the Exercise Price in accordance
with this section.
(c)
In either case, the Warrants represented by a Warrant Certificate shall be deemed to be surrendered upon personal delivery of such certificate, Exercise
Notice and Exercise Price or, if such documents are sent by mail or other means of transmission, upon actual receipt thereof by the Warrant Agent at the
Warrant Agency.
(2)
A beneficial holder of Uncertificated Warrants evidenced by a security entitlement in respect of Warrants in the book entry registration system who desires
to exercise his or her Warrants must do so by causing a Book Entry Only Participant to deliver to the Depository on behalf of the entitlement holder, notice
of the owner's intention to exercise Warrants in a manner acceptable to the Depository. Forthwith upon receipt by the Depository of such notice, as well as
payment for the Exercise Price, the Depository shall deliver to the Warrant Agent confirmation of its intention to exercise Warrants ("Confirmation") in a
manner acceptable to the Warrant Agent, including by electronic means through the book entry registration system.
(3)
Payment representing the Exercise Price must be provided to the appropriate office of the Book Entry Only Participant in a manner acceptable to it. A
notice in form acceptable to the Book Entry Only Participant and payment from such beneficial
-18-
holder should be provided to the Book Entry Only Participant sufficiently in advance so as to permit the Book Entry Only Participant to deliver notice and
payment to the Depository and for the Depository in turn to deliver notice and payment to the Warrant Agent prior to the Expiry Time. The Depository will
initiate the exercise by way of the Confirmation and forward the Exercise Price electronically to the Warrant Agent and the Warrant Agent will execute the
exercise by issuing to the Depository through the book entry registration system the Common Shares to which the exercising Warrantholder is entitled
pursuant to the exercise. Any expense associated with the exercise process will be for the account of the entitlement holder exercising the Warrants and/or
the Book Entry Only Participant exercising the Warrants on its behalf.
(4)
By causing a Book Entry Only Participant to deliver notice to the Depository, a Warrantholder shall be deemed to have irrevocably surrendered his or her
Warrants so exercised and appointed such Book Entry Only Participant to act as his or her exclusive settlement agent with respect to the exercise and the
receipt of Common Shares in connection with the obligations arising from such exercise.
(5)
Any notice which the Depository determines to be incomplete, not in proper form or not duly executed shall for all purposes be void and of no effect and
the exercise to which it relates shall be considered for all purposes not to have been exercised thereby. A failure by a Book Entry Only Participant to
exercise or to give effect to the settlement thereof in accordance with the Warrantholder's instructions will not give rise to any obligations or liability on the
part of the Corporation or Warrant Agent to the Book Entry Only Participant or the Warrantholder.
(6)
Any exercise form or Exercise Notice referred to in this Section 3.2 shall be signed by the Registered Warrantholder, or its executors or administrators or
other legal representatives or an attorney of the Registered Warrantholder, duly appointed by an instrument in writing satisfactory to the Warrant Agent but
such exercise form need not be executed by the Depository.
(7)
Any exercise referred to in this Section 3.2 shall require that the entire Exercise Price for Common Shares subscribed must be paid within one business
day of subscription and such Exercise Price and original Exercise Notice executed by the Registered Warrantholder or the Confirmation from the
Depository must be received by the Warrant Agent prior to the Expiry Time.
(8)
Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 3.2, Warrants may only be exercised pursuant to this Section 3.2 by or on behalf of a Registered
Warrantholder, except the Depository or Warrantholder, as applicable, who makes the certifications set forth on the Exercise Notice set forth in Schedule
"A" hereto.
(9)
If the form of Exercise Notice set forth in the Warrant Certificate shall have been amended, the Corporation shall cause the amended Exercise Notice to be
forwarded to all Registered Warrantholders.
-19-
(10)
Exercise Notices and Confirmations must be delivered to the Warrant Agent at any time during the Warrant Agent's actual business hours on any
Business Day prior to the Expiry Time. Any Exercise Notice or Confirmations received by the Warrant Agent after business hours on any Business Day
other than the Expiry Date will be deemed to have been received by the Warrant Agent on the next following Business Day.
(11)
Any Warrant with respect to which an Exercise Notice or a Confirmation is not received by the Warrant Agent before the Expiry Time shall be deemed to
have expired and become void and all rights with respect to such Warrants shall terminate and be cancelled.
(12)
A beneficial owner of Warrants issued in uncertificated form evidenced by a security entitlement in respect of Warrants in the book entry registration
system who desires to exercise his or her Warrants must do so by causing a Book Entry Only Participant to deliver to the Depository on behalf of the
entitlement holder, notice of the owner’s intention to exercise Warrants in a manner acceptable to the Depository. Forthwith upon receipt by the
Depository of such notice, as well as payment for the aggregate Exercise Price, the Depository shall deliver to the Warrant Agent confirmation of its
intention to exercise Warrants (a “Confirmation”) in a manner acceptable to the Warrant Agent, including by electronic means through a book based
registration system, including CDSX.
Section 3.3Cashless Exercise of Warrants.
(1)
If, at the time of exercise of any Warrant in accordance with this Indenture, there is no effective Registration Statement under the U.S. Securities Act, or the
prospectus contained therein is not available for the offer and sale of the Common Shares to the Warrantholder under the U.S Securities Act, then the
Warrants may only be exercised, in whole or in part, at such time by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the Warrantholder shall be entitled to receive
a number of Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:
A
=
the last VWAP immediately preceding the time of delivery of the Exercise Form giving rise to the applicable “cashless exercise” (to clarify, the “last VWAP”
will be the last Current Market Price as calculated over an entire Trading Day such that, in the event that a Warrant is exercised at a time when the Trading
Market is open, the prior Trading Day’s VWAP shall be used in this calculation);
B =the Exercise Price of the Warrant, as adjusted hereunder (if any); and
X
=
the number of Common Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of the Warrant in accordance with the terms of such Warrant if such exercise were by
means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.
(2)
If Common Shares are issued pursuant to such a cashless exercise, the parties acknowledge and agree that in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the
U.S. Securities
-20-
Act, such Common Shares shall take on the registered characteristics of the Warrants being exercised. The Corporation agrees not to take any position
contrary to this Section 3.3(1).
(3)
Upon receipt of a duly completed Subscription Form that specifies a cashless exercise, the Warrant Agent will notify the Corporation, which will calculate
and provide to the Warrant Agent the number of Common Shares to be allotted to the Warrantholder.
(4)
Any Warrantholder that holds Warrants registered in the name of CDS and that wishes to exercise such Warrants under this section by means of a
cashless exercise must first withdraw their position from CDS, arrange to have the applicable Warrant certificated and surrender such warrant certificate to
the Warrant Agent for exercise by means of a “cashless exercise”.
For the avoidance of doubt, a Warrantholder may only exercise his or her warrants by means of “cashless exercise” if there is no effective registration
statement under the U.S. Securities Act registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for, the offer and issuance of the Common Shares to
the Warrantholder upon the exercise of his or her Warrants. If there is an effective registration statement under the U.S. Securities Act registering, or the
prospectus contained therein is available for, the offer and issuance of the Common Shares to the Warrantholder upon the exercise of his or her Warrants,
such Warrantholder may only exercise his or her Warrants in accordance with Section 3.2.
Section 3.4Transfer Fees and Taxes.
If any of the Common Shares subscribed for are to be issued to a Person or Persons other than the Registered Warrantholder, the Registered Warrantholder
shall execute the form of transfer and will comply with such reasonable requirements as the Warrant Agent may stipulate and will pay to the Corporation or
the Warrant Agent on behalf of the Corporation, all applicable transfer or similar taxes and the Corporation will not be required to issue or deliver certificates
evidencing Common Shares unless or until such Warrantholder shall have paid to the Corporation or the Warrant Agent on behalf of the Corporation, the
amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation and the Warrant Agent that such tax has been paid or that no tax is due.
Section 3.5Warrant Agency.
To facilitate the exchange, transfer or exercise of Warrants and compliance with such other terms and conditions hereof as may be required, the Corporation
has appointed the Warrant Agency, as the agency at which Warrants may be surrendered for exchange or transfer or at which Warrants may be exercised
and the Warrant Agent has accepted such appointment. The Corporation may from time to time designate alternate or additional places as the Warrant
Agency (subject to the Warrant Agent's prior approval) and will give notice to the Warrant Agent of any proposed change of the Warrant Agency. Branch
registers shall also be kept at such other place or places, if any, as the Corporation, with the approval of the Warrant Agent, may designate. The Warrant
Agent will from time to time when requested to do so by the Corporation or any Registered Warrantholder, upon payment of the Warrant Agent's reasonable
charges (and in the case of a Registered
-21-
Warrantholder the affidavit required by Section 2.8(1)), furnish a list of the names and addresses of Registered Warrantholders showing the number of
Warrants held by each such Registered Warrantholder.
Section 3.6Effect of Exercise of Warrant Certificates.
(1)
Upon the exercise of Warrant Certificates pursuant to and in compliance with Section 3.2 and subject to Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, the Common Shares
to be issued pursuant to the Warrants exercised shall be deemed to have been issued and the Person or Persons to whom such Common Shares are to
be issued shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of such Common Shares on the Exercise Date, unless the transfer registers of
the Corporation shall be closed on such date, in which case the Common Shares subscribed for shall be deemed to have been issued and such Person
or Persons deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of such Common Shares, on the date on which such transfer registers are reopened. It
is hereby understood that in order for holders to be holders of Warrants on record on an Exercise Date, beneficial holders must commence the exercise
process sufficiently in advance so that the Warrant Agent is in receipt of all items of exercise at least one Business Day prior to such Exercise Date.
(2)
Within three (3) Business Days after the Exercise Date with respect to a Warrant (the “Common Share Delivery Date”), the Warrant Agent shall use its
best efforts to cause to be delivered or mailed to the Person or Persons in whose name or names the Warrant is registered or, if so specified in writing by
the holder, cause to be delivered to such Person or Persons at the Warrant Agency where the Warrant Certificate was surrendered, a certificate or
certificates for the appropriate number of Common Shares subscribed for, or any other appropriate evidence of the issuance of Common Shares to such
Person or Persons in respect of Common Shares issued under the book entry registration system. The Warrant Agent will not be liable to the Corporation
for any payment made by the Corporation under Section 3.6(4) of this Indenture.
(3)
If the Corporation fails to cause the Warrant Agent to deliver to the Warrantholder the Warrant Shares issuable pursuant to Section 3.6(2) by the Common
Share Delivery Date, then the Warrantholder will have the right to rescind such exercise.
(4)
In addition to any other rights available to a Warrantholder, if the Corporation fails to cause the Warrant Agent to deliver to the Warrantholder the Common
Shares issuable in accordance with Section 3.6(2) pursuant to an exercise on or before the Common Share Delivery Date and, if after such date, the
Warrantholder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Warrantholder’s brokerage firm otherwise
purchases, Common Shares to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Warrantholder of the Warrant Shares that the Warrantholder anticipated receiving
upon such exercise (a “Buy-In”), then the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to the Warrantholder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Warrantholder’s total
purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Common Shares so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the
number of Common Shares that the Corporation was required to
-22-
deliver to the Warrantholder in connection with the exercise at issue, times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was
executed, and (B) at the option of the Warrantholder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such
exercise was not honoured (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Warrantholder the number of Common Shares that
would have been issued had the Corporation timely complied with its delivery obligations under Section 3.6(2). For example, if the Warrantholder purchases
Common Shares having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of Common Shares with an aggregate sale
price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to pay to
the Warrantholder $1,000. The Warrantholder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Warrantholder in respect of
the Buy-In and, upon request of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Warrantholder’s right to pursue any other
remedies available to it under this Indenture, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with
respect to the Corporation’s failure to timely deliver Warrant Shares as required under Section 3.6(2) following the valid exercise of Warrants under this
Indenture.
Section 3.7Partial Exercise of Warrants; Fractions.
The holder of any Warrants may exercise its right to acquire a number of whole Common Shares less than the aggregate number which the holder is
entitled to acquire pursuant to the Warrants exercised in connection therewith. In the event of any exercise of a number of Warrants less than the maximum
number that the holder is entitled to acquire, the holder of Warrants upon such exercise shall, in addition, be entitled to receive, without charge therefor, a
new Warrant Certificate(s), bearing the same legend, if applicable, or other appropriate evidence of Warrants, in respect of the balance of the Warrants
(1)
held by such holder and which were not then acquired in connection with the applicable exercise thereof.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything herein contained including any adjustment provided for in Article 4, the Corporation shall not be required, upon the exercise of
any Warrants, to issue fractions of Common Shares. Warrants may only be exercised in a sufficient number to acquire whole numbers of Common Shares.
Section 3.8Expiration of Warrants.
Immediately after the Expiry Time, all rights under any Warrant in respect of which the right of acquisition provided for herein shall not have been exercised
shall cease and terminate and each Warrant shall be void and of no further force or effect.
Section 3.9Accounting and Recording.
(1)
The Warrant Agent shall promptly account to the Corporation with respect to Warrants exercised, and shall promptly forward to the Corporation (or into an
account or accounts of the Corporation with the bank or trust company designated by the Corporation for that purpose), all monies received by the
Warrant Agent on
-23-
the subscription of Common Shares through the exercise of Warrants. All such monies and any securities or other instruments, from time to time received by
the Warrant Agent shall be received in trust for, and shall be segregated and kept apart by the Warrant Agent for the benefit of the Warrantholders and the
Corporation as their interests may appear.
(2)
The Warrant Agent shall record the particulars of Warrants exercised, which particulars shall include the names and addresses of the persons who
become holders of Common Shares on exercise and the Exercise Date, in respect thereof. The Warrant Agent shall provide such particulars in writing to
the Corporation within five Business Days of any request by the Corporation therefore.
Section 3.10Securities Restrictions.
(1)
The Warrant Agent shall be entitled to assume that Common Shares may be issued pursuant to the exercise of any Warrant without violating the securities
laws of any applicable jurisdiction and without legending any certificate representing the Common Shares unless the Warrant Agent has received notice
in writing from the Corporation stating otherwise and setting forth the restrictions on the exercise of the Warrants and any legend the certificates
representing the Common Shares should bear.
(2)
Neither the Corporation nor the Warrant Agent shall effect any exercise of a Warrant, and a Warrantholder shall not have the right to exercise any portion
of a Warrant, pursuant to Article 3 or otherwise, to the extent that, after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Exercise
Form, the Warrantholder (together with the Warrantholder’s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Warrantholder or any of
the Warrantholder’s Affiliates (such Persons, “Attribution Parties”)), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined
below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of Common Shares beneficially owned by the Warrantholder and its Affiliates and Attribution
Parties shall include the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but
shall exclude the number of Common Shares that would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining, non-exercised portion of a Warrant beneficially
owned by the Warrantholder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties, and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any
other securities of the Corporation (including, without limitation, any other Equity Share equivalents), subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
analogous to the limitation contained herein, beneficially owned by the Warrantholder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 3.10(2), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the U.S. Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Warrantholder that neither the Warrant Agent nor the Corporation
is representing to the Warrantholder that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the U.S. Exchange Act and the Warrantholder further
acknowledges that it is solely
-24-
responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 3.10(2) applies, the
determination of whether a Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Warrantholder together with any Affiliates and Attribution
Parties) and of which portion of a Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion and at the sole responsibility of the Warrantholder, and the submission
of an Exercise Notice shall be deemed to be the Warrantholder’s determination of whether a Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by
the Warrantholder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of a Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation, and neither the Warrant Agent nor the Corporation shall have any obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In
addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the U. S. Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 3.10(2) in determining the number of outstanding Common Shares, a
Warrantholder may rely on the number of outstanding Common Shares as reflected in (A) the Corporation’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with
the SEC or on SEDAR, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation, or (C) a more recent written notice by the
Corporation or the Corporation’s transfer agent setting forth the number of Common Shares outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Warrantholder,
the Corporation shall, within two Trading Days, confirm orally and in writing to the Warrantholder the number of Common Shares then outstanding. In any
case, the number of outstanding Common Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation,
including the Warrant being exercised, by the Warrantholder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding
Common Shares was reported. The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 4.99% of the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after
giving effect to the issuance of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant in question. The Warrantholder, upon written notice to the Corporation,
may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 3.10(2), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no
event exceeds 9.99% of the number of Common Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of Warrant Shares upon exercise of the
Warrant in question held by the Warrantholder and the provisions of this Section 3.10(2) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation. The provisions of this paragraph shall be
construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 3.10(2) to correct this paragraph (or any portion
hereof) that may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements
necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this Section 3.10(2) shall apply to a successor holder of a
Warrant.
-25-
Section 3.11U.S. Securities Law Matters.
(1)
In connection with any exercise of Warrants, if it is required by law, the Corporation shall cause to be delivered to any person in whose name the Common
Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are to be issued a prospectus that complies with the U.S. Securities Act and that is a part of the
Registration Statement. For so long as any Warrants remain outstanding, the Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) keep the
Registration Statement continuously effective and ensure that the prospectus contained therein is available, and (ii) avoid the issuance of, or, if issued,
obtain the withdrawal of any order enjoining or suspending the use or effectiveness of the Registration Statement or related prospectus contained therein
or the lifting of any suspension of the qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Warrants for sale in the United States, at the earliest
practicable moment. All expenses incidental to the Corporation’s performance of or compliance with the foregoing provisions will be borne by the
Corporation, including, without limitation: (i) all registration and filing fees and expenses; (ii) all fees and expenses of compliance with federal securities
and state Blue Sky securities laws; and (iii) all fees and disbursements of counsel for the Corporation, independent certified public accountants of the
Corporation and technical experts retained by the Corporation whose consent is required to be provided with respect to any Registration Statement.
(2)
The Corporation will notify the Warrant Agent when a Registration Statement becomes effective under the U.S. Securities Act, and the Warrant Agent will
notify the Registered Warrantholders as required. Thereafter, the Warrant Agent may assume that the Registration Statement remains effective, and that
the prospectus contained therein is available, until otherwise notified in writing by the Corporation that the Registration Statement is no longer effective, or
that such prospectus is not available. The Corporation shall at all times be obligated to provide prompt notice to the Warrant Agent regarding any change
in the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or the availability of the prospectus.
Article 4
ADJUSTMENT OF NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES AND EXERCISE PRICE
Section 4.1Adjustment of Number of Common Shares and Exercise Price.
The subscription rights in effect under the Warrants for Common Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time as follows:
(a)
if, at any time during the Adjustment Period , the Corporation shall:
(i) subdivide, re-divide or change its outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of Common Shares;
(ii) reduce, combine or consolidate its outstanding Common Shares into a smaller number of Common Shares; or
-26-
(iii)
issue Common Shares or securities exchangeable for, or convertible into, Common Shares to all or substantially all of the holders of Common Shares by
way of distribution (other than a distribution of Common Shares upon the exercise of Warrants);
the Exercise Price in effect on the effective date of such subdivision, re-division, change, reduction, combination, consolidation or on the record
date of such distribution, as the case may be, shall in the case of the events referred to in (i) or (iii) above be decreased in proportion to the
number of outstanding Common Shares resulting from such subdivision, re-division, change or distribution, or shall, in the case of the events
referred to in (ii) above, be increased in proportion to the number of outstanding Common Shares resulting from such reduction, combination or
consolidation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event referred to in this Section 4.1(a) shall occur. Upon any
adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 4.1(a), the Exchange Rate shall be contemporaneously adjusted by multiplying the number
of Common Shares theretofore obtainable on the exercise thereof by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect
immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment;
(b)
if and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or
substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares entitling them, for a period expiring not more than 45 days after such record date, to
subscribe for or purchase Common Shares (or securities convertible or exchangeable into Common Shares) on such record date (a "Rights Offering"),
then, subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the consent of a majority of the Registered Warrantholders, given in accordance with
Article 7, in addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 4.1 above, the Warrantholder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such
Rights Offering, the aggregate number of Common Shares that the Warrantholder could have acquired if the Warrantholder had held the number of
Common Shares acquirable upon complete exercise of the Warrantholder’s Warrants then held (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof,
including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of
such Rights Offering, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the grant, issue or
sale of such Rights Offering (provided, however, to the extent that the Warrantholder’s right to participate in any such Rights Offering would result in the
Warrantholder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Warrantholder shall not be entitled to participate in such Rights Offering to such
extent (or beneficial ownership of such Common Shares as a result of such Rights Offering to such extent) and such Rights Offering, to such extent, shall
be held in abeyance for the Warrantholder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Warrantholder exceeding the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation). Any
-27-
Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation or a Subsidiary shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such
computation. If all the rights, options or warrants are not so issued or if all rights, options or warrants are not exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the
number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant shall be readjusted to that number in effect immediately prior to the record date, and such
number shall be further adjusted based upon the number of Common Shares (or Convertible Securities that are convertible into Common Shares) actually
  
delivered upon the exercise of the rights, options or warrants, as the case may be, but subject to any other adjustment required hereunder by reason of any
event arising after that record date; for the avoidance of doubt, the Corporation covenants and agrees that it shall not fix a record date for the issuance of
rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding Common Shares without obtaining both the approval of the Toronto Stock
Exchange to permit the Warrantholders to fully participate in such issuance (as contemplated in this Section 4.1(b)) and the prior consent of a majority of the
Registered Warrantholders given in accordance with Article 7.
(c)
if and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all or substantially all the
holders of its outstanding Common Shares of (i) securities of any class, whether of the Corporation or any other trust (other than Common Shares), (ii)
rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares (or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares), other
than pursuant to a Rights Offering; (iii) evidences of its indebtedness or (iv) any property or other assets then (any of those non-excluded events being
herein called a “Special Distribution”), then, in each such case, the Warrantholder shall be entitled to participate in such Special Distribution to the same
extent that the Warrantholder would have participated therein if the Warrantholder had held the number of Common Shares acquirable upon complete
exercise of the Warrantholder’s Warrants then held (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Special Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of
which the record holders of Common Shares are to be determined for the participation in such Special Distribution (provided, however, to the extent that
the Warrantholder’s right to participate in any such Special Distribution would result in the Warrantholder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation,
then the Warrantholder shall not be entitled to participate in such Special Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any Common
Shares as a result of such Special Distribution to such extent) and the portion of such Special Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the
Warrantholder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Warrantholder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). To the
extent that a Warrantholder’s Warrants have not been partially or completely exercised at the time of such Special
-28-
Distribution, such portion of the Special Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Warrantholder until the Warrantholder has exercised the
Warrantholder’s Warrants as to such undistributed amount of the Special Distribution. Any Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the
Corporation or a Subsidiary shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. To the extent that the distribution of shares,
rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets is not so made or to the extent that any rights, options or warrants so distributed are not
exercised, the number of Common Shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant shall be readjusted to the number that would then be in effect based upon
 
shares, rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets actually distributed or based upon the number of Common Shares or Convertible
Securities actually delivered upon the exercise of the rights, options or warrants, as the case may be, but subject to any other adjustment required hereunder
by reason of any event arising after the record date. To the extent that the Warrantholder’s Warrants have not been partially or completely exercised at the
time of such Special Distribution, such portion of the Special Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Warrantholder until, and only if, the
Warrantholder has exercised such Warrantholder’s Warrants;
(d)
if and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, there is a reclassification of the Common Shares or a capital reorganization of the Corporation
other than as described in Section 4.1(a) or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or into any other body
corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, or a sale or conveyance of the property and assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an
entirety to any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, any Registered Warrantholder who has not exercised its right of acquisition prior to
the effective date of such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, upon the
exercise of such right thereafter, shall be entitled to receive upon payment of the Exercise Price and shall accept, in lieu of the number of Common Shares
that prior to such effective date the Registered Warrantholder would have been entitled to receive, the number of shares or other securities or property of
the Corporation or of the body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity resulting from such merger, amalgamation or consolidation, or to which such sale
or conveyance may be made, as the case may be, that such Registered Warrantholder would have been entitled to receive on such reclassification,
capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, if, on the effective date thereof, as the case may be, the
Registered Warrantholder had been the registered holder of the number of Common Shares to which prior to such effective date it was entitled to acquire
upon the exercise of the Warrants. If determined appropriate by the Warrant Agent, relying on advice of Counsel, to give effect to or to evidence the
provisions of this Section 4.1(d), the Corporation, its successor, or such purchasing body corporate, partnership,
-29-
trust or other entity, as the case may be, shall, prior to or contemporaneously with any such reclassification, capital reorganization, consolidation,
amalgamation, arrangement, merger, sale or conveyance, enter into an indenture which shall provide, to the extent possible, for the application of the
provisions set forth in this Indenture with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the Registered Warrantholders to the end that the provisions set forth
in this Indenture shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, with respect to any shares, other securities or
property to which a Registered Warrantholder is entitled on the exercise of its acquisition rights thereafter. Any indenture entered into between the
 
Corporation and the Warrant Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.1(d) shall be a supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to the provisions
of Article 8 hereof. Any indenture entered into between the Corporation, any successor to the Corporation or such purchasing body corporate, partnership,
trust or other entity and the Warrant Agent shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments
provided in this Section 4.1 and which shall apply to successive reclassifications, capital reorganizations, amalgamations, consolidations, mergers, sales or
conveyances;
(e)
in any case in which this Section 4.1 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an event referred to herein,
the Corporation may defer, until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Registered Warrantholder of any Warrant exercised after the record date and
prior to the completion of such event the additional Common Shares issuable by reason of the adjustment required by such event before giving effect to
such adjustment; provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to such Registered Warrantholder an appropriate instrument evidencing such
Registered Warrantholder's right to receive such additional Common Shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment and the right to
receive any distributions made on such additional Common Shares declared in favour of holders of record of Common Shares on and after the relevant
date of exercise or such later date as such Registered Warrantholder would, but for the provisions of this Section 4.1(e), have become the holder of record
of such additional Common Shares pursuant to Section 4.1;
(f)
in any case in which Section 4.1(a)(iii) or 4.1(c) require that an adjustment be made to the Exercise Price no such adjustment shall be made if the
Registered Warrantholders of the outstanding Warrants receive, subject to the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange and NYSE MKT, if required, the
rights or warrants referred to in Section 4.1(a)(iii) and Section 4.1(c) in such kind and number as they would have received if they had been holders of
Common Shares on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be, by virtue of their outstanding Warrant having then been exercised into
Common Shares at the Exercise Price in effect on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case may be;
-30-
(g)
the adjustments provided for in this Section 4.1 are cumulative, and shall, in the case of adjustments to the Exercise Price be computed to the nearest
whole cent and shall apply to successive subdivisions, re-divisions, reductions, combinations, consolidations, distributions, issues or other events
resulting in any adjustment under the provisions of this Section 4.1, provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no adjustment of the
Exercise Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Exercise Price then in effect;
provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 4.1(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into
account in any subsequent adjustment; and
after any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.1, the term "Common Shares" where used in this Indenture shall be interpreted to mean securities of any
class or classes which, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this Section 4.1, the Registered Warrantholder is entitled to
(h)receive upon the exercise of his Warrant, and the number of Common Shares indicated by any exercise made pursuant to a Warrant shall be interpreted to
mean the number of Common Shares or other property or securities a Registered Warrantholder is entitled to receive, as a result of such adjustment and
all prior adjustments pursuant to this Section 4.1, upon the full exercise of a Warrant.
Section 4.2Entitlement to Common Shares on Exercise of Warrant.
All Common Shares or shares of any class or other securities, which a Registered Warrantholder is at the time in question entitled to receive on
the exercise of its Warrant, whether or not as a result of adjustments made pursuant to this Article 4, shall, for the purposes of the interpretation of
this Indenture, be deemed to be Common Shares which such Registered Warrantholder is entitled to acquire pursuant to such Warrant.
Section 4.3No Adjustment for Certain Transactions.
Notwithstanding anything in this Article 4, no adjustment shall be made in the acquisition rights attached to the Warrants if the issue of Common
Shares is being made pursuant to this Indenture or in connection with (a) any share incentive plan or restricted share plan or share purchase plan
in force from time to time for directors, officers, employees, consultants or other service providers of the Corporation; or (b) the satisfaction of
existing instruments issued at the date hereof.
Section 4.4Determination by Auditors.
In the event of any question arising with respect to the adjustments provided for in this Article 4 such question shall be conclusively determined
by an independent firm of chartered accountants other than the Auditors, who shall have access to all necessary records of the Corporation, and
such determination shall be binding upon the Corporation, the Warrant Agent, all holders and all other persons interested therein.
-31-
Section 4.5Proceedings Prior to any Action Requiring Adjustment.
As a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment in any of the acquisition rights pursuant to any of the
Warrants, including the number of Common Shares which are to be received upon the exercise thereof, the Corporation shall take any action
which may, in the opinion of Counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation has unissued and reserved in its authorized capital and may
validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable all the Common Shares which the holders of such Warrants are entitled to receive on
the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Section 4.6Certificate of Adjustment.
The Corporation shall from time to time immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided
in Article 4, deliver a certificate of the Corporation to the Warrant Agent specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and the amount of
the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which
such calculation is based, which certificate shall be supported by a certificate of the Corporation's Auditors verifying such calculation. The
Warrant Agent shall rely, and shall be protected in so doing, upon the certificate of the Corporation or of the Corporation's Auditor and any other
document filed by the Corporation pursuant to this Article 4 for all purposes. The Corporation shall file such certificate of adjustment on a Form 6-
K with the SEC on the same date it is submitted to the Warrant Agent.
Section 4.7Notice of Special Matters.
The Corporation covenants with the Warrant Agent that, so long as any Warrant remains outstanding, it will give notice to the Warrant Agent and
to the Registered Warrantholders of its intention to fix a record date that is prior to the Expiry Date for any matter for which an adjustment may be
required pursuant to Section 4.1. Such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date for such event, provided that the
Corporation shall only be required to specify in the notice such particulars of the event as shall have been fixed and determined on the date on
which the notice is given. The notice shall be given in each case not less than 14 days prior to such applicable record date. If notice has been
given and the adjustment is not then determinable, the Corporation shall promptly, after the adjustment is determinable, file with the Warrant
Agent a computation of the adjustment and give notice to the Registered Warrantholders of such adjustment computation.
Section 4.8No Action after Notice.
The Corporation covenants with the Warrant Agent that it will not close its transfer books or take any other corporate action which might deprive
the Registered Warrantholder of the opportunity to exercise its right of acquisition pursuant thereto during the period of 14 days after the giving of
the certificate or notices set forth in Section 4.6 and Section 4.7.
-32-
Section 4.9Other Action.
If the Corporation, after the date hereof, shall take any action affecting the Common Shares other than action described in Section 4.1, which in the
reasonable opinion of the directors of the Corporation would materially affect the rights of Registered Warrantholders, the Exercise Price and/or
the Exchange Rate, the number of Common Shares which may be acquired upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted in such manner and
at such time, by action of the directors, acting reasonably, in their sole discretion as they may determine to be equitable to the Registered
Warrantholders in the circumstances, provided that no such adjustment will be made unless any requisite prior approval of any stock exchange
on which the Common Shares are listed for trading has been obtained.
Section 4.10Protection of Warrant Agent.
The Warrant Agent shall not:
(a)
at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Registered Warrantholder to determine whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment
contemplated by Section 4.1, or with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method employed in making
the same;
(b)
be accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Common Shares or of any other securities or property which may at any
time be issued or delivered upon the exercise of the rights attaching to any Warrant;
(c)
be responsible for any failure of the Corporation to issue, transfer or deliver Common Shares or certificates for the same upon the surrender of any
Warrants for the purpose of the exercise of such rights or to comply with any of the covenants contained in this Article 4; and
(d)
incur any liability or be in any way responsible for the consequences of any breach on the part of the Corporation of any of the representations, warranties
or covenants herein contained or of any acts of the directors, officers, employees, agents or servants of the Corporation.
Section 4.11Participation by Warrantholder.
No adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Article 4 if the Registered Warrantholders are entitled to participate in any event described in this
Article 4 on the same terms, mutatis mutandis, as if the Registered Warrantholders had exercised their Warrants prior to, or on the effective date or
record date of, such event.
-33-
Article 5
RIGHTS OF THE CORPORATION AND COVENANTS
Section 5.1Optional Purchases by the Corporation.
Subject to compliance with Applicable Securities Laws and approval of applicable Regulatory Authorities, the Corporation may from time to time
purchase by private contract or otherwise any of the Warrants. Any such purchase shall be made at the lowest price or prices at which, in the
opinion of the directors, such Warrants are then obtainable, plus reasonable costs of purchase, and may be made in such manner, from such
persons and on such other terms as the Corporation, in its sole discretion, may determine. In the case of Certificated Warrants, Warrant
Certificates representing the Warrants purchased pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall forthwith be delivered to and cancelled by the Warrant Agent.
In the case of Uncertificated Warrants, the Warrants purchased pursuant to this Section 5.1 shall be reflected accordingly in accordance with
procedures prescribed by the Depository under the book entry registration system. No Warrants shall be issued in replacement thereof.
Section 5.2General Covenants.
The Corporation covenants with the Warrant Agent for the benefit of the Warrant Agent and the Warrantholders that so long as any Warrants
remain outstanding:
(a)
it will reserve and keep available a sufficient number of Common Shares for the purpose of enabling it to satisfy its obligations to issue Common Shares
upon the exercise of the Warrants;
(b)
it will cause the Common Shares from time to time acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Warrants to be duly issued and delivered in accordance with
the Warrants and the terms hereof;
(c)all Common Shares which shall be issued upon exercise of the right to acquire provided for herein will be fully paid and non-assessable;
(d) it will use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain its existence and carry on its business in the ordinary course;
(e)
it will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that all Common Shares outstanding or issuable from time to time (including without limitation the
Common Shares issuable on the exercise of the Warrants) (or, if the Corporation enters into an amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation
with or into any other corporation or other entity which effects a change of the Common Shares into other shares or an exchange of the Common Shares
for other securities (including securities of another entity), such securities) continue to be or are listed and posted for trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange (or such other Canadian stock exchange acceptable to the Corporation) and the NYSE MKT;
(f)it will make all requisite filings under applicable Canadian and US securities legislation including those necessary to remain a reporting issuer not in
-34-
default in each of the provinces and other jurisdictions where it is or becomes a reporting issuer;
(g) generally, it will well and truly perform and carry out all of the acts or things to be done by it as provided in this Indenture;
(h)
if at any time no Registration Statement is effective under the U.S. Securities Act, or if the prospectus contained therein is not available, it will give notice
to the Warrant Agent forthwith; and
(i)
it will use reasonable commercial efforts to maintain the Registration Statement continuously effective under the U.S. Securities Act, and ensure that the
prospectus contained therein is available, until the Expiry Time or exercise of all Warrants (provided, however, that nothing shall prevent the Corporation's
amalgamation, arrangement, merger or sale, including any take-over bid, and any associated delisting or deregistration or ceasing to be a reporting issuer,
provided that, so long as the Warrants are still outstanding and represent a right to acquire securities of the acquiring company, the acquiring company
shall assume the Corporation's obligations under the Warrant Indenture).
Section 5.3Warrant Agent's Remuneration and Expenses.
The Corporation covenants that it will pay to the Warrant Agent from time to time reasonable remuneration for its services hereunder and will pay
or reimburse the Warrant Agent upon its request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Warrant
Agent in the administration or execution of the trusts hereby created (including the reasonable compensation and the disbursements of its
Counsel and all other advisers and assistants not regularly in its employ) both before any default hereunder and thereafter until all duties of the
Warrant Agent hereunder shall be finally and fully performed. Any amount owing hereunder and remaining unpaid after 30 days from the invoice
date will bear interest at the then current rate charged by the Warrant Agent against unpaid invoices and shall be payable upon demand. This
Section shall survive the resignation of the Warrant Agent and/or the termination of this Indenture.
Section 5.4Performance of Covenants by Warrant Agent.
If the Corporation shall fail to perform any of its covenants contained in this Indenture, the Warrant Agent may notify the Registered
Warrantholders of such failure on the part of the Corporation or may itself perform any of the covenants capable of being performed by it but,
subject to Section 9.2, shall be under no obligation to perform said covenants or to notify the Registered Warrantholders of such performance by
it. All sums expended or advanced by the Warrant Agent in so doing shall be repayable as provided in Section 5.3. No such performance,
expenditure or advance by the Warrant Agent shall relieve the Corporation of any default hereunder or of its continuing obligations under the
covenants herein contained.
-35-
Section 5.5Enforceability of Warrants.
The Corporation covenants and agrees that it is duly authorized to create and issue the Warrants to be issued hereunder and that the Warrants,
when issued and Authenticated as herein provided, will be valid and enforceable against the Corporation in accordance with the provisions
hereof and the terms hereof and that, subject to the provisions of this Indenture, the Corporation will cause the Common Shares from time to time
acquired upon exercise of Warrants issued under this Indenture to be duly issued and delivered in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.
Article 6
ENFORCEMENT
Section 6.1Suits by Registered Warrantholders.
All or any of the rights conferred upon any Registered Warrantholder by any of the terms of this Indenture may be enforced by the Registered
Warrantholder by appropriate proceedings but without prejudice to the right which is hereby conferred upon the Warrant Agent to proceed in its
own name to enforce each and all of the provisions herein contained for the benefit of the Registered Warrantholders.
Section 6.2Suits by the Corporation.
The Corporation shall have the right to enforce full payment of the Exercise Price of all Common Shares issued by the Warrant Agent to a
Registered Warrantholder hereunder and shall be entitled to demand such payment from the Registered Warrantholder or alternatively to instruct
the Warrant Agent to cancel the share certificates and amend the securities register accordingly.
Section 6.3Immunity of Shareholders, etc.
The Warrant Agent and the Warrantholders hereby waive and release any right, cause of action or remedy now or hereafter existing in any
jurisdiction against any incorporator or any past, present or future shareholder, trustee, employee or agent of the Corporation or any successor
Corporation on any covenant, agreement, representation or warranty by the Corporation herein.
Section 6.4Waiver of Default.
Upon the happening of any default hereunder:
(a)
the Registered Warrantholders of not less than 66 2/3% of the Warrants then outstanding shall have power (in addition to the powers exercisable by
Extraordinary Resolution) by requisition in writing to instruct the Warrant Agent to waive any default hereunder and the Warrant Agent shall thereupon

such Warrantholders' Request against the costs which may be incurred in connection with the calling and holding of such meeting, convene a

place where the meeting is to be held, shall state briefly the general nature of the business to be transacted thereat and shall contain such

the parties hereto, shall instruct the Warrant Agent in writing, to cancel the exercise transaction and any such underlying shares on the register,
which may have already been issued upon the Warrant exercise.  In the event that any payment is received from the Corporation by virtue of the
holder being a shareholder for such Warrants that were subsequently rescinded, such payment must be returned by the Corporation to the holder
and the Warrant Agent shall not be under any duty or obligation to take any steps to ensure or enforce that the funds are returned pursuant to this
section, nor shall the Warrant Agent be in any other way responsible in the event that any payment is not delivered or received pursuant to this
section.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporation provides the refund to the Warrant Agent for distribution to the holder,
the Warrant Agent shall return such funds to the holder as soon as reasonably practicable, and in so doing, the Warrant Agent shall incur no
liability with respect to the delivery or non-delivery of any such funds.

holder, by acceptance hereof, assents. The Corporation will furnish to the holder, on request and without charge, a copy of the Warrant Indenture.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of the Warrant Indenture, if at any time following the initial effectiveness of the shelf registration statement filed with the
United States Securities Commission under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, registering the Common Shares issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants (the “Registration Statement”) and prior to the Expiry Date, the Corporation determines that such Registration Statement
is not effective, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for, the offer and sale of the Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Warrants, the Corporation shall promptly provide written notice of such determination to the Warrant Agent. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Warrant Agent shall provide a copy thereof to each Warrantholder, and confirm in writing that the then outstanding Warrants may, until the earlier
of the Registration Statement becoming effective or the Expiry Date, only be exercised by means of a “cashless exercise” pursuant to Section
3.3(1) of the Warrant Indenture.
On presentation at the principal office of the Warrant Agent as set out above, subject to the provisions of the Warrant Indenture and on
compliance with the reasonable requirements of the Warrant Agent, one or more Warrant Certificates may be exchanged for one or more Warrant

Certificate(s) so exchanged.

meetings of holders of Warrants held in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant Indenture and instruments in writing signed by
Warrantholders of Warrants entitled to purchase a specific majority of the Common Shares that can be purchased pursuant to such Warrants.
Nothing contained in this Warrant Certificate, the Warrant Indenture or elsewhere shall be construed as conferring upon the holder hereof any
right or interest whatsoever as a holder of Common Shares or any other right or interest except as herein and in the Warrant Indenture expressly
provided. In the event of any discrepancy between anything contained in this Warrant Certificate and the terms and conditions of the Warrant
Indenture, the terms and conditions of the Warrant Indenture shall govern.
Warrants may only be transferred in compliance with the conditions of the Warrant Indenture on the register to be kept by the Warrant Agent in
Vancouver, British Columbia, or such other registrar as the Corporation, with the approval of the Warrant Agent, may appoint at such other place
or places, if any, as may be designated, upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate to the Warrant Agent or other registrar accompanied by a
written instrument of transfer in form and execution satisfactory to the Warrant Agent or other registrar and upon compliance with the conditions
prescribed in the Warrant Indenture and with such reasonable requirements as the Warrant Agent or other registrar may prescribe and upon the
transfer being duly noted thereon by the Warrant Agent or other registrar. Time is of the essence hereof.
This Warrant Certificate will not be valid for any purpose until it has been countersigned by or on behalf of the Warrant Agent from time to time
under the Warrant Indenture.
The parties hereto have declared that they have required that these presents and all other documents related hereto be in the English language.

entitled to receive without charge a new Warrant Certificate in respect of the balance of the Common Shares not so purchased. No fractional
Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of any Warrant.

statement filed with the United States Securities Commission under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended, registering the
Common Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants (the “Registration Statement”) and prior to the Expiry Date, the Corporation determines
that such Registration Statement is not effective, or the prospectus contained therein is not available for, the offer and sale of the Common Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, the Corporation shall promptly provide written notice of such determination to the Warrantholder, and
confirm in writing that the then outstanding Warrants may, until the earlier of the Registration Statement becoming effective or the Expiry Date,

Warrants outstanding thereunder resolutions passed at meetings of holders of Warrants held in accordance with the provisions of the Warrant
Indenture and instruments in writing signed by Warrantholders of Warrants entitled to purchase a specific majority of the Common Shares that

Nothing contained in this Warrant Agreement or elsewhere shall be construed as conferring upon the holder hereof any right or interest
whatsoever as a holder of Common Shares or any other right or interest except as herein expressly provided. In the event of any discrepancy
between anything contained in this Warrant Agreement and the terms and conditions of the Warrant Indenture, the terms and conditions of
adopted and incorporated into this Warrant Agreement from the Warrant Indenture shall govern.
