Half year results for the six months ended 30 June 2016
“Performance in the first half of 2016 reflects the balance of a challenging oil and gas market, our continued focus on utilisation and cost
management and the benefits of our flexible, asset light model. Our overall outlook for 2016 remains unchanged; with full year EBITA anticipated
to be around 20% lower than 2015, in line with previous guidance.
Looking further ahead, we see early indications of modest recovery in some areas and believe our customer relationships, geographic footprint,
strong financial footing and relentless focus on delivering value through our asset life cycle services and specialist technical solutions, position us
well” - Robin Watson, Chief Executive

Total revenue down 17% and Total EBITA down 26% as challenging conditions prevailed in the oil and gas sector. Pricing pressure partly
offset by management of utilisation and additional overhead cost savings of c.$50m in the first half.  2015 EBITA benefitted from the release
of deferred consideration on acquisitions   
Focus on ongoing reorganisation to enhance customer delivery
Delayering and back office rationalisation to maximise efficiency
Prioritisation of utilisation across all levels; group headcount down 10% in 1H16
Cost efficiency and reorganisation initiatives reflected in exceptional cost of $30m net of tax

plants business. Margin benefitted from legacy engineering projects and the continued focus on utilisation and drive for efficiency
PSN Production Services – Total revenue down 15% and EBITA down 33%. Continued pressure on volumes, scope and pricing in the
North Sea and US onshore in the Americas. Underlying trading margin down c0.8% as cost reductions and efficiencies partly offset the
continued pricing pressure from customers
Strong balance sheet. Net debt, including JVs of $351.4m.  Net debt: rolling EBITDA ratio of 0.7x
Interim dividend of 10.8 cents up 10%.  In line with intention to increase the dividend per share by a double digit percentage for 2016
Unchanged outlook for full year 2016; anticipate full year EBITA down around 20% on 2015, in line with previous guidance

Note: The commentary below on trading performance is presented based on proportionally consolidated numbers, which is the basis used by
management to run the business.  Total Revenue and Total EBITA include the contribution from joint ventures.
Performance in the first half reflects the challenging market conditions in oil and gas; total revenue was down 17%. Our strict management of
utilisation and significant overhead cost savings helped mitigate the impact of reduced volumes and pricing.  The Group delivered EBITA of
$166m in the first half, down 26% and AEPS of 28.7c down 28%.  2015 EBITA benefitted from the release of deferred consideration on
acquisitions.
We have continued to focus on what we can control and what we can manage during a period where lower oil prices have endured and activity
has fallen. Our focus remains on managing costs, improving efficiency and maintaining capability. We are working with our customers to work
smarter, streamlining work processes while increasing quality and efficiency.
In 2015 we delivered sustainable overhead cost reductions of $148m and in the first half of 2016 we have delivered around $50m of additional
sustainable overhead savings through ongoing reorganisation, delayering and back office rationalisation.  We expect to deliver a further
significant overhead cost saving in 2016, although the pace of saving will slow significantly in the second half of 2016.  Management of utilisation
remains a priority at all levels of the business and this has resulted in a further 10% fall in headcount in the first half of the year.
In Engineering, total revenue fell 23% however total EBITA margin increased by 0.3% compared to the first half of 2015.  Performance reflects the
subdued nature of detailed design awards in the first half and increased competition in our downstream and process plants business. EBITA
margin benefitted from improved profitability on legacy engineering projects and the continued focus on utilisation and drive for efficiency.
In Wood Group PSN Production Services, total revenue fell 15% and total EBITA fell by 33% largely reflecting continued pressure on volumes,
scope and pricing in the North Sea and US onshore in the Americas and the impact in 2015 of the release of deferred consideration on
acquisitions. EBITA margin came down by 1.6% compared with the first half of 2015.  The margin in 2015 benefitted from the release of provisions
relating to deferred consideration on acquisitions.  Adjusting for this, the underlying trading margin is down c0.8% as we see further overhead cost
reductions and efficiencies partly offset the continued pricing pressure from customers.
In Turbine Activities, growth in RWG was offset by lower performance in TCT. Performance in EthosEnergy continues to face various challenges. 
We expect full year performance in our turbine joint ventures overall to be in line with 2015.
The Group is in a strong financial position.  Our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to reinvest in the business through acquisition and organic
investment. Net debt including JVs of $351m is towards the lower end of our targeted Net Debt: EBITDA range.  Although we anticipate strong
cash flow generation for the year we have seen a slight increase in our debtor days, reflecting the challenging market conditions, although this has
not resulted in higher levels of bad debts.  In April 2016 the Group extended its $950m bilateral bank facilities for a further year until 2021 at the
same competitive rate.
Bolt-on M&A remains a focus and is our preferred use of cash.  In the first half of the year, we completed two small acquisitions in the Engineering
business and acquired a further non-controlling interest in our Saudi Arabian engineering business.
We have declared an interim dividend of 10.8 cents per share, an increase of 10%, which will be paid on 22 September 2016. Our intention
remains to increase the dividend per share by a double digit percentage for 2016.
Outlook
Conditions in oil & gas markets remain challenging.  Performance in the first half of 2016 demonstrates our continued focus on utilisation and cost
management and the benefits of our asset light, predominantly reimbursable business model.  We expect the full year to reflect both the continued
challenging conditions and the benefit of the combination of our customer relationships, geographic footprint, asset life cycle solutions and our
specialist technical solutions, with performance being weighted to the second half of the year as in prior years. Our management of utilisation and
costs, together with the ongoing reorganisation of the business to better serve our customers will continue to be a priority.
Our overall outlook for 2016 remains unchanged; full year EBITA for 2016 is anticipated to be around 20% lower than 2015, in line with
expectations.
Looking further ahead, our breadth and range of services, reputation for delivery and strong financial footing position us well in the market and we
are encouraged by early indicators of recovery in some areas including some movement in Upstream award sanctioning and the apparent
bottoming of the US onshore rigcount.
Wood Group Engineering
We provide a wide range of market leading engineering services to the upstream, subsea & pipeline, downstream, chemical, process & industrial,
automation and clean energy sectors. These include conceptual studies, engineering, project and construction management (EPCM) and control

In Engineering, total revenue fell 23% and total EBITA fell 21%. The fall in total revenue principally reflects the subdued market in subsea and
lower activity in our downstream and process plants business.  EBITA margin benefitted from the improved profitability on legacy engineering
projects, the continued focus on utilisation and drive for efficiency.
Upstream accounted for around 35% of revenue. Our activity on Det Norske’s Ivar Aasen and Hess Stampede is now in the late stage of follow-on
engineering and construction support.  Activity remains solid on our Saudi Aramco contracts.  We have seen some revisiting of early stage work
and positive movement in project sanctioning in the first half.  We have moved into the detailed design phase for Statoil Peregrino in Brazil, and
this is progressing well.  Following final investment decision on Chevron’s Tengiz expansion project, we recently announced our successful
award for the automation detailed design in Kazahkstan.  This represents one of the largest projects which has been awarded to our automation
business.  We expect this project to continue until 2021.  Another significant engineering project which we were pleased to be selected for is the
FEED and detailed design for the Noble Leviathan fixed platform.  This builds on our relationship with Noble following our successful completion
of the Tamar project.  While we are modestly encouraged by these awards and they give us visibility into 2017, we do not see activity on these
ramping up in the second half beyond our current expectations.
Subsea and Pipelines accounted for around 40% of total revenue.  We have seen significantly reduced activity in our Subsea business and a lack
of visibility as minimal large subsea detailed design capex projects come to market.  Activity in the Caspian remains solid, where we are
delivering engineering and project management services on projects including BP Shah Deniz with follow on work expected through to 2018. 
However, this activity has not been immune to ongoing pressure from customers on rates.  We remain confident in our competitive position.
 Relationships with our long term customers are positive and we have renewed or secured several worldwide master service agreements
including Statoil and BP. Our US onshore pipelines business is performing robustly.  Work on the ETC Dakota access pipeline and other
transmission pipelines is expected to continue through to 2017.  We feel well placed for further opportunities when US onshore shale activity
increases.
Downstream, process and industrial accounted for around 25% of total revenue.  We have seen a reduction in activity in the first half of 2016, as
activity on the Flint Hills refinery project winds down and we see significant competitive pressure in our process plants business.  Performance in
the first half of 2015 did however benefit from the successful close out of lump sum projects.
Outlook
We expect trends in the first half to continue into the full year end and performance to reflect relative resilience in upstream and onshore pipelines,
with reduced activity in subsea and downstream.  Customer pricing pressure remains in focus and is reflected in current bidding activity. We will
continue to work alongside our customers towards more efficient ways of working and concentrate on the management of utilisation. Looking
further ahead, we are encouraged in particular by recent Upstream awards and are confident this reflects the strength of our independent service
offering and customer relationships.

In Wood Group PSN Production Services, revenue fell 15% and EBITA fell by 33% largely reflecting continued pressure on volumes, scope and
pricing in the North Sea and US onshore in the Americas, and the impact in 2015 of the release of deferred consideration on acquisitions. EBITA
margin came down by 1.6% compared with the first half of 2015 however the margin in 2015 benefitted from the release of provisions relating to
deferred consideration on acquisitions.  Adjusting for this, the underlying trading margin is down c0.8% as we see further overhead cost
reductions and efficiencies partly offset the continued pricing pressure from customers.
The Americas accounted for around 50% of revenues, with US onshore representing over half of this and the remainder coming from the Gulf of
Mexico, East Canada, Trinidad and South America.  In the US onshore business, we are encouraged by the apparent bottoming out of the rig
count.  We have not yet seen any significant improvement in activity, however we expect our construction and drilling related activity to broadly
correlate to increased rig count.  We are confident that our differentiated capability, breadth of services and geographic presence in the Permian,
Bakken, Eagle Ford, Niobrara, Marcellus and Utica basins positions us well as the market recovers.  Our strategic acquisition at the end of 2015,
Infinity is performing in line with plan in the Gulf coast petrochemical market and the US offshore business has been relatively robust despite
challenging market conditions.
The North Sea accounted for around 30% of revenue in the first half as we continued to face pressure on volume and prices.  The operating
environment in the North Sea remains very challenging.  However, we have successfully renewed the vast majority of our existing contracts and
are maintaining our leading position in maintenance and brownfield engineering work with good visibility under longer term contracts.  We have
worked alongside our customers towards the standardisation and simplification of processes to drive cost reduction in line with industry best
practice.  Some of our employees have engaged in industrial action on our Shell contract and we are focused on resolving the dispute consistent
with the overarching requirement to have a reduced sustainable cost base moving forward. Our dutyholder position operating the CATS pipeline
and terminal for Antin Infrastructure is progressing well and we see near term growth potential following this model, as further new entrants
appear.
Performance in our international business represents around 20% of revenue. Activity has been robust on our Exxon contracts in Papua New
Guinea and work is progressing well on our recently secured contracts in Iraq and Baku, and we continue to see future opportunities in these
areas.  In Australia, we recently renewed our contract with Melbourne Water for a further 3 years and added civil maintenance to the service
provision.
Outlook
We expect the performance in Wood Group PSN Production Services in 2016 to reflect the challenging market conditions, specifically in the US
onshore and UK North Sea, partly offset by significant cost savings and efficiencies.  We have confidence in our service offering and geographic
footprint across all the significant US onshore basins and we would expect to benefit as that market recovers. We have retained our leading
position in the North Sea, helping secure access to the market for maintenance and upgrade work as it arises. The outlook for our international
business is encouraging, particularly in the Middle East which we see as an area of future potential growth.

The financial performance of the Group, adjusting for acquisitions and on a constant currency basis, is shown below. The 2015 results have been
restated to include the results of acquisitions made in 2015 (Infinity, Kelchner, Beta and ATG) as if they had been acquired on 1 January 2015 and
also to apply the average exchange rates used to translate the 2016 results.  The 2016 results have been adjusted to exclude the revenue and
profits earned by SVT and Ingenious since acquisition.

The amortisation charge for the half year of $53.8m (2015: $54.0m) includes $24.8m (2015: $27.1m) of amortisation relating to intangible assets
arising from acquisitions. $19.5m of the charge relates to businesses acquired by WG PSN Americas including Elkhorn, Mitchells and Infinity.
Intangibles relating to the PSN acquisition in 2011 are now fully amortised.  Amortisation in respect of software and development costs was
$29.0m (2015: $26.9m) and this largely relates to engineering software and ERP system development. We currently anticipate that the
amortisation charge for the full year will be around $108.0m (2015: $109.0m), of which $51.0m (2015: $54.2m) will relate to intangibles arising
from acquisitions. Included in the amortisation charge for the half year above is $1.0m (2015: $0.9m) in respect of joint ventures.

As a result of reorganisation, delayering and back office rationalisation, an exceptional charge of $36.2m has been recorded in the period.  The
largest element, $22.1m, principally relates to redundancy costs as people have left the business.  The reduction in workforce has also had an
impact on our property portfolio and the general property market in our principal locations.    The balance of the charge relates to an increase in
our onerous lease provisions in relation to property of $14.1m.
Earnings per share
Adjusted diluted EPS for the six months to 30 June 2016 was 28.7 cents per share (2015: 40.1 cents). The average number of fully diluted shares
used in the EPS calculation for the period was 382.9m (June 2015: 378.6m).
Adjusted diluted EPS adds back all amortisation.  If only the amortisation related to intangible assets arising on acquisition is adjusted and no
adjustment is made for that relating to software and development costs, the figure for June 2016 would be 23.1 cents per share (June 2015: 34.9
cents).
Dividend
We have previously signaled our confidence in the longer term outlook for the Group and indicated our intent to increase the annual dividend by a
double digit percentage between 2014 and 2016.
In line with this intention, an interim dividend of 10.8 cents per share (2015: 9.8 cents) has been declared which will be paid on 22 September
2016, representing an increase of 10%.   The dividend is covered 2.7 times (June 2015: 4.1 times) by adjusted earnings per share.

* The gross debt numbers in the above table assume borrowings relating to the Group’s cash pooling arrangements are netted with the related
cash and are not grossed up.
In April 2016 the Group extended its $950m bilateral bank facilities for a further year until 2021 at the same competitive rates.
Cash generated from operations pre-working capital fell by $92.8m to $149.3m largely due to lower profits in the period. Cash generated from
operations post-working capital reduced by $101.6m to $123.6m as a result of lower profits and an increase in working capital. Cash generation in
the first half of 2015 benefitted from a significant receipt relating to the Dorad contract.
Acquisition payments include $12.1m relating to the acquisitions of SVT and Ingenious, $11.8m relating to the purchase of the minority interests in
our Saudi Arabian engineering business and $1.0m relating to payments made in respect of companies acquired in prior periods.  The acquisition
figure is stated net of $6.0m returned to the Group in relation to an amount held in escrow as part of the Infinity acquisition in December 2015.
Payments for capex and intangible assets increased to $54.6m (2015: $42.3m) largely due to the continued investment in our core ERP systems
across the Group.

The reduction in net current assets since June 2015 is due to lower receivables and net cash.
Capital efficiency
Net debt (including our share of JV net debt) to rolling EBITDA at 30 June 2016 was 0.7 times (June 2015: 0.5 times).   The Board would generally
expect net debt to EBITDA on this basis to be in a range of around 0.5 to 1.5 times going forward and to be typically below 1.0 times.
The Group’s Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”)5 reduced from 15.4% at 30 June 2015 to 11.7% largely due to lower EBITA in the period.
The Group’s ratio of average Operating Capital Employed to Revenue (OCER) of 19.9% has increased from 2015 (16.1%) largely due to the
reduction in revenue.
Acquisitions
In April 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of SVT Holdings Pty Limited.  SVT, which is based in Perth, Australia, provides piping
and rotating equipment vibration, noise, integrity engineering and asset integrity services to the oil and gas, power, mining and utilities sectors.
Also in April, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ingenious Inc.  Ingenious, which is based in Houston, Texas, provides proprietary
software and consulting services to the global chemical, oil and gas, and energy industries. Both SVT and Ingenious are reported in the Wood
Group Engineering segment. In May 2016, the Group purchased the trade and assets of Enterprise Engineering Limited, an Aberdeen based
fabrication and manufacturing business. Enterprise is reported in the Wood Group PSN segment. The Group also purchased an additional
shareholding in Mustang Al-Hejailan, its Saudi Arabian engineering business, in the first half of the year.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group in the second half of 2016 that could lead to a significant loss of reputation or could impact
on the performance of the Group, along with our approach to managing, mitigating and monitoring these risks, remain broadly unchanged from
those described in the Group’s 2015 Annual Report.  The key risks are in the following categories:
Health, Safety, Security & Environment
Strategic
Operational
Financial
People
Compliance
Commercial
Technology
The mitigating factors are designed to reduce, but cannot be relied upon to eliminate, the risk areas identified.  For further details on the
management of risk and the principal risks and uncertainties see pages 18 to 20 of the Group’s 2015 Annual Report.
We do not expect the outcome of June’s referendum, that the UK will exit the European Union (“Brexit”), to have a major impact on the Group in
the short term, although there is a potential impact on our financial results due to the weakening of Sterling relative to the US dollar.   In terms of
our underlying business, we do not carry out any material business in the EU outside of the UK (less than 0.5% of our 2015 revenue).
Appointment of auditors
The Group has recently completed an external audit tender process as a result of which the decision was taken to award the audit to KPMG with
effect from the year ending 31 December 2018. PwC will continue as Group auditors for the years ending 31 December 2016 and 2017.
***********************
Footnotes
1 Total EBITA represents operating profit including JVs on a proportional basis of $76.4m (2015: $176.2m) before the deduction of amortisation of
$53.8m (2015: $54.0m) and exceptional costs of $36.2m (2015: income $4.3m) and is provided as it is a key unit of measurement used by the
Group in the management of its business.
2 Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“AEPS”) is calculated by dividing earnings before exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax, by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding shares held by the Group's employee share ownership trusts
and adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
3 Number of people includes both employees and contractors at 30 June 2016 and includes our proportional share of headcount in joint ventures.
4 Interest cover is EBITA divided by net finance expense.
5 Return of Capital Employed (“ROCE”) is EBITA divided by average capital employed.

receivables and cash and cash equivalents have been restated by $26.5m in relation to a restricted cash balance.

Notes to the interim financial statements
for the six month period to 30 June 2016
1. Basis of preparation
The interim report and condensed financial statements for the six months ended 30 June 2016 have been prepared in accordance with the
Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority and in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim financial reporting’ as adopted by
the European Union.  The interim report and condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Group’s 2015 Annual Report
and Accounts which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements are also in
compliance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
The interim report and condensed financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the accounting policies set out in the Group’s 2015
Annual Report and Accounts and those new standards discussed below which are applicable from 1 January 2016.  The interim report and
condensed financial statements do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006.  The interim
condensed financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 15 August 2016.  The results for the six months to 30 June 2016 and
the comparative results for six months to 30 June 2015 are unaudited.  The comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2015 do not
constitute the statutory financial statements for that year.  Those financial statements have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and
include the auditor's report which was unqualified and did not contain any statement under Section 498 of the Companies Act 2006.
Following the issue of an agenda decision by the IFRS Interpretations Committee regarding offsetting and cash pooling arrangements, the Group
has restated its comparative figures for cash and cash equivalents and short term borrowings at 30 June and 31 December 2015. The restatement
increases cash and borrowings by $566.9m and $646.8m respectively. There is no change to the results or the cash flows for the respective
periods.
The directors have reviewed the Group’s backlog, trading outlook and funding position and re-assessed its principal risks and consider it
appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the interim condensed financial statements.
In preparing these interim condensed financial statements, the significant judgments made by management in applying the Group’s accounting
policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended
31 December 2015.
Functional currency
The Group’s earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative currency
of the Group.  The Group’s financial statements are therefore prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts:
Average rate £1 = $
Closing rate £1 = $

Disclosure of impact of new and future accounting standards
(a) Amended standards and interpretations
Amendments have been made to the following standards effective 1 January 2016. These amendments have not had a material impact on the
Group’s financial statements.
IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’
IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’
IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’
IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements’
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’
IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group
The following standards have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, but the
Group has not adopted them early:
IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group is in
the process of assessing the likely impact of this standard on the financial statements.
IFRS 9 ‘Financial ‘instruments’ is effective for accounting periods on or after 1 January 2018. The Group does not expect the adoption of this
standard to have a material impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 16 ‘Leases’ is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group is in the process of assessing the
likely impact of this standard on the financial statements.

2. Segmental reporting
The Group operates through two segments, Wood Group Engineering and Wood Group PSN. All of the Group’s predominantly opex related
turbine activity is carried out through joint ventures and is managed and reported as part of the Wood Group PSN division. In order to provide
visibility over the performance of the turbine activities, they are included on a separate line in the table below (Wood Group PSN – Turbine
activities). This presentation is consistent with the Group’s internal management reporting for the period to 30 June 2016.
Under IFRS 11, the Group is required to account for joint ventures using equity accounting, however for management reporting the Group
continues to use proportional consolidation hence the inclusion of the proportional presentation in this note.
The segment information provided to the Group’s Chief Executive for the reportable operating segments for the period included the following:

As a result of reorganisation, delayering and back office rationalisation, an exceptional charge of $36.2m has been recorded in the period.  The
largest element, $22.1m, principally relates to redundancy costs incurred as people have left the business.  The reduction in workforce has also
had an impact on the Group’s property portfolio and the general property market in our principal locations. The balance of the exceptional charge
relates to an increase in onerous lease provisions in relation to property of $14.1m.
$27.8m of the exceptional charge is recorded in Wood Group PSN, $6.9m in Wood Group Engineering and $1.5m in Central costs.
Full details of the 2015 exceptional items are included in the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.

After the balance sheet date, the directors declared an interim dividend of 10.8 cents per share (2015: 9.8 cents) which will be paid on 22
September 2016.  The interim financial statements do not reflect the interim dividend, which will result in an estimated reduction of $40.1m in
equity attributable to owners of the parent. This will be shown as an appropriation of retained earnings in the financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2016.
5. Acquisitions
In April 2016, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of SVT Holdings Pty Limited for $9.0m, net of $1.0m cash acquired. Net assets
acquired amount to $0.3m and goodwill and intangible assets of $9.7m have provisionally been recognised on the acquisition. The accounting for
the acquisition will be finalised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016.  SVT provides piping and rotating equipment
vibration, noise, integrity engineering and asset integrity services to the oil and gas, power, mining and utilities sectors. SVT, which is based in
Perth, Australia is reported in the Wood Group Engineering segment.
Also in April, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Ingenious Inc for an initial consideration of $3.1m with a further $8.2m of estimated
contingent consideration provided. Net assets acquired amount to $0.5m and goodwill and intangible assets of $10.8m have provisionally been
recognised on the acquisition. The accounting for the acquisition will be finalised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December
2016.  Ingenious provides proprietary software and consulting services to the global chemical, oil and gas, and energy industries. Ingenious,
which is based in Houston, Texas is reported in the Wood Group Engineering segment.
In May 2016, the Group purchased the trade and assets of Enterprise Engineering Limited, an Aberdeen based fabrication and manufacturing
business for $0.4m. This purchase was accounted for as an addition to property, plant and equipment in the period to 30 June.
$6m of cash that was placed in an escrow account in relation to the Infinity acquisition in December 2015 was returned to the Group in the first half
of 2016.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Group’s wider client base and use the Group’s resources to further grow and develop
their businesses.  The acquisitions expand the Group’s existing service lines and provide increased diversification and entry into new markets.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised on the acquisitions.
Acquisition costs incurred in relation to the companies acquired during the period are included in administrative expenses in the income
statement.
From the date of acquisition to 30th June, SVT and Ingenious contributed $4.1m to Group revenues and $0.5m to EBITA.
Contingent consideration payments amounting to $1.0m were made during the period in relation to acquisitions completed in previous years.
Estimated contingent consideration liabilities at 30 June 2016 amounted to $102.0m (June 2015: $35.6m) and are payable over the next three
years. The amount of contingent consideration payable is dependent on the post-acquisition profits of the acquired entities and the provision
made is based on the Group’s estimate of the likely profits of those entities. Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the
estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.

The calculation of basic earnings per share (‘EPS’) is based on the earnings attributable to equity shareholders divided by the weighted average
number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding shares held by the Group’s employee share trusts.  For the calculation of diluted
EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.  The
Group’s dilutive ordinary shares comprise share options granted to employees under Employee Share Option Schemes and the Long Term
Retention Plan and shares and share options awarded under the Group’s Long Term Plan. Adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS are
disclosed to show the results excluding the impact of exceptional items and amortisation, net of tax.
7. Taxation
The taxation charge, recognising the profits from joint ventures on a proportional basis, for the six months ended 30 June 2016 is 26.1% (June
2015: 27.0%) which is the anticipated effective rate on profit before taxation and exceptional items for the year ending 31 December 2016. The
table below shows how these rates reconcile to the amounts presented in the income statement.

8. Retirement benefit obligations
The Group closed its defined benefit scheme to future accrual in 2014. As a result of the actuarial gains arising during 2015 the scheme was in
surplus at 31 December 2015. Management believe that the Group will benefit from the surplus and an asset has therefore been recognised in the
Group balance sheet. No interim revaluation of the pension liability has been carried out at 30 June 2016 and accordingly there is no actuarial
gain/loss in the Group statement of comprehensive income.  The figures for gains and losses for the full year together with the surplus or deficit at
31 December 2016 will be presented in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.

Net debt of $0.3m (2015: net debt $1.6m) was held by joint ventures at 30 June.
The restricted cash of $26.5m (2015: $26.5m) is cash that is subject to an attachment order. The Group cannot access this cash until it receives a
release letter from the Courts and as a result the cash balance is presented in receivables. Management believe it is appropriate to include the
restricted cash balance in the Group’s net debt figure.

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk
and
liquidity risk. The condensed interim financial statements do not include all financial risk management information and disclosures required in the
annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Group’s 2015 Annual Report and Accounts.
There have been no changes in the risk management function or in any risk management policies since the year end.
Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities
The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand
approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments. Drawdowns under long-term
bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.
14. Capital commitments
At 30 June 2016 the Group had entered into contracts for future capital expenditure amounting to $3.8m.  The capital expenditure relates to
property plant and equipment and has not been provided in the financial statements.
15. Contingent liabilities
At the balance sheet date the Group had cross guarantees without limit extended to its principal bankers in respect of sums advanced to
subsidiaries.
From time to time, the Group is notified of claims in respect of work carried out. Where management believes we are in a strong position to defend
these claims no provision is made.
The Group is aware of a potential challenge to historic employment costs which may have an impact on the Group.  In addition, recent court cases
have challenged the UK’s historic interpretation of EU legislation relating to holiday pay and this may have an impact on all companies who have
employees in the UK, including Wood Group. At this point it is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the liability, if any, that may arise from
either of these issues and therefore no provision has been made.
The Group believes that an investigation into inspection and regulatory reporting services in the US is now close to reaching a conclusion, and
that any costs arising will be covered by amounts provided in prior periods.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
for the six month period to 30 June 2016
The directors confirm that the interim condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’
as issued by the IASB and adopted by the European Union and that the interim management report includes a fair review of the information
required by DTR 4.2.7 and DTR 4.2.8, namely:
an indication of important events that have occurred during the first six months and their impact on the financial statements and a description
of the principal risks and uncertainties for the remaining six months of the financial year; and
material related party transactions in the first six months and any material changes in the related party transactions described in the last
annual      report.

Independent review report to John Wood Group PLC
Report on the condensed consolidated interim financial statements
Our conclusion
We have reviewed John Wood Group PLC's condensed consolidated interim financial statements (the "interim financial statements") in the half
year report of John Wood Group PLC for the 6 month period ended 30 June 2016. Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that
causes us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with International Accounting
Standard 34, ‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the United
Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority.
What we have reviewed
The interim financial statements comprise:
the group balance sheet as at 30 June 2016;
the group income statement and group statement of comprehensive income for the period then ended;
the group cash flow statement for the period then ended;
the group statement of changes in equity for the period then ended; and
the explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.
The interim financial statements included in the half year report have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard 34,
‘Interim Financial Reporting’, as adopted by the European Union and the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s
Financial Conduct Authority.
As disclosed in note 1 to the interim financial statements, the financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the full
annual financial statements of the Group is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European
Union.
Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
The half year report, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has been approved by, the directors. The directors are
responsible for preparing the half year report in accordance with the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the United Kingdom’s Financial
Conduct Authority.
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the half year report based on our review. This report, including
the conclusion, has been prepared for and only for the company for the purpose of complying with the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules
of the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What a review of interim financial statements involves
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements (UK and Ireland) 2410, ‘Review of Interim Financial
Information Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity’ issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom. A review of
interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying
analytical and other review procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and,
consequently, does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.
Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.  We have read the other information contained in the half year report and considered whether it
contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the interim financial statements.

a.  The maintenance and integrity of the John Wood Group PLC website is the responsibility of the directors; the work carried out by the
auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may
have occurred to the interim financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
b.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other
jurisdictions.
