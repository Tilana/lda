<p><b>  17/&#8230;  Migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing from events in North Africa </b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that all 
human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to 
all the rights and freedoms set out therein, without distinction of any kind, such as race, 
colour or national origin, including the right to life and security of the person,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention against Torture and 
Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention on the Rights 
of the Child, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination, the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the International Convention on the Protection of 
the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 and the 
Protocol thereto of 1967, 
</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the important role of the Human Rights Council in promoting respect 
for the protection of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, including those of 
migrants and asylum-seekers, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that everyone has the right to freedom of movement and residence 
within the borders of each State, and to leave any country, including his or her own, and to 
return to his or her country, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> States&#8217; obligations under international human rights, humanitarian and 
refugee Law, in particular the principle of <i>non-refoulement</i>, including from territorial 
waters, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reiterating</i> the obligations of countries and organizations whose ships patrol the 
Mediterranean Sea to provide assistance to non-seaworthy boats leaving North Africa, 
including the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 
</p>

<p> 1. <i>Expresses its alarm</i> at the continuing vulnerable situation, seen in recent 
events, of migrants and asylum-seekers who have suffered untold hardship and, in some 
cases, even death as they attempt to flee North Africa; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Also expresses its alarm</i> at the fact that, after having been compelled to make 
dangerous journeys, including in crowded and unsafe boats, the above-mentioned migrants 
are subjected to life-threatening exclusion, detention, rejection and xenophobia; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Further expresses its alarm</i> at the fact that, since the beginning of the recent 
events in North Africa, there have been several reports of boats sinking and, in this regard, 
notes with sadness the death at sea of several hundreds of people, mostly African citizens, 
after their boats sank and that, according to accounts of survivors and family members, 
more than one thousand two hundred people are still unaccounted for;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes</i> that, despite the efforts made by countries of destination on the 
northern shores of the Mediterranean sea to host migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing from 
North Africa, the burden of this situation falls disproportionately on neighbouring North 
African countries, and commends the solidarity shown by these countries; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms<b> </b>the need</i> to respect the humanitarian principle of <i>non-refoulement</i> 
from territorial waters and lands for the thousands of people fleeing the events in the North 
African region;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Emphasizes</i> that, in a spirit of solidarity and burden-sharing, countries of 
destination should deal with the arrival of thousands of migrants and asylum-seekers in 
non-seaworthy boats in a humane way and in compliance with their international 
obligations;  
</p>
<p> 7.  <i>Calls for</i> a comprehensive inquiry into the very troubling allegations that 
sinking vessels carrying migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing the events in North Africa 
were abandoned to their fate despite the alleged ability of European ships in the vicinity to 
rescue them, and welcomes the call made by the Council of Europe in this regard on 9 May 
2011;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human rights to pay 
particular attention to the situation of migrants and asylum-seekers fleeing North Africa 
described in the present resolution, to report to the Human Rights Council at its eighteenth 
session and to provide updates thereon; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants and all 
other relevant special procedures mandate holders to pay particular attention to the situation 
of persons fleeing by sea, including from North Africa, and who are denied assistance or 
rescue when approaching the countries of destination, and to report regularly thereon to the 
Human Rights Council.
