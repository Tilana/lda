</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Palau expressed the view that it was truly committed to fulfilling its human rights 
obligations. Efforts in this regard had resulted in pending new legislation, policies and the 
creation of Task Force Committees to oversee and address its human rights commitments 
and obligations.  
</p>
<p>6. Palau indicated that it had acceded only to the Convention of the Rights of the Child, 
and that it intended to carefully examine the possibility of signing and acceding to other 
human rights covenants and protocols, including the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>7. Palau mentioned the following challenges it faced: climate change and 
environmental degradation; lack of technical capacity to undertake and implement human 
rights issues domestically, including reporting to treaty bodies; lack of financial and 
funding capacity to fulfil human rights norms and obligations; lack of technical and 
financial assistance to undertake human right awareness and activities; disparity in social 
and economic well-being; alcohol and substance abuse; high mortality rate affected by non-
communicable diseases; limited access and opportunities of vulnerable groups and persons 
with disabilities; employment protection for local Palauan workers; domestic violence and 
human trafficking.

made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report.  
</p>
<p>23. A number of delegations commended Palau for the presentation of its national 
report, the high quality and self-critical nature of the latter, the participation of civil society 
in its preparation, and Palau&#8217;s participation and commitment in the UPR process despite the 
challenges it faced as a small island State. Some countries welcomed Palau&#8217;s genuine 
efforts as one of the world&#8217;s newest democracies to meet international human rights 
standards.   
</p>
<p>24. Algeria<b> </b>noted that Palau&#8217;s free and fair elections, respect for the rule of law 
and functioning judiciary were encouraging, given that it gained independence just 
16 years ago. Algeria noted that the Convention on the Rights of the Child was the 
only core international human rights instrument to which Palau was a party. It 
referred to the important areas of concern identified in Palau&#8217;s report. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Canada commended Palau&#8217;s commitment to democracy and respect for the

about the legal discrimination against married women regarding rape and property, 
the problem of statelessness affecting children and the reported widespread 
mistreatment of foreign workers. Hungary encouraged Palau to cooperate more 
closely with special procedures and to consider becoming a party to the International 
Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on

related to education, social equality, reduction of infant mortality and the fight 
against HIV/AIDS. Thailand shared the concerns expressed about child abuse,  
including the absence of adequate labour laws protecting children from economic 
exploitation. Thailand hoped to see the strengthening of cooperation between Palau 
and regional and international agencies, particularly to reinforce Palau&#8217;s human 
rights institutions and its implementation and ratification of key human rights 
conventions. Thailand urged the Human Rights Council, OHCHR and other relevant 
agencies to provide greater assistance to Palau in facing the increasing threats from

criminalize sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex and that 
Palau&#8217;s legislation discriminated against women in the field of inheritance and did 
not criminalize rape within marriage. Norway made recommendations.

trade. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>

protecting human rights because of its size, geography and capacity constraints. 
Maldives noted Palau&#8217;s pledge to ratify the remaining core human rights 
conventions, including CEDAW, which was pending approval in Parliament. It also 
noted Palau&#8217;s consideration of the establishment of a national human rights 
institution and that such a process can be lengthy and complicated. Maldives referred

faced in the field of civil and political rights, Malaysia understood that Palau faced 
equally, if not more, daunting challenges in the field of economic social and cultural 
rights, which included climate change, food security, environment degradation, 
disparity of social and economic well-being, alcohol and substance abuse and high 
mortality rates.<b> </b>Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>

change and its impacts on human rights. Philippines made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Palau thanked all delegations for the recommendations addressed to it. Palau 
indicated that it intended to engage in wide consultations with civil society on mapping out  
strategies for the dissemination and implementation of UPR recommendations. Palau 
intended to seek technical assistance from civil society and non-governmental organizations 
in implementing specific recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Regarding laws which discriminate against women, Palau clarified that these 
provisions are not in the Constitution but in legislative statutes and that there were 
initiatives towards amending these laws, such as the Palau Protection Act of 2010 which

another draft bill which, if approved, would allow women to have inheritance rights on an 
equal basis. 
</p>
<p>56. Two proposed bills, the Domestic Violence Family Act and the Victims Assistance 
Act, addressed issues such as domestic violence and sexual abuse; they provide for shelters 
for victims of violence and child abuse. Palau explained that there were in place other 
governmental mechanisms to assist victims of violence and sexual abuse, like the Victims 
of Crimes Assistance Office, within the Ministry of Health, which provides assistance and 
protection to children victims of physical or sexual abuse. The medical profession is also 
required to report any alleged child abuse. The Micronesian Legal Services Corporation 
provides legal assistance to low-income families in cases of victims of physical or sexual 
abuse. </p>


<p>57. Palau clarified that sex between consenting same-sex adults is not criminalized in its 
domestic laws. 
</p>

environmental issues and that it is the focal point of three United Nations conventions in the 
matter. 
</p>
<p>59. Regarding human trafficking, Palau indicated that it has recently established the 
Human Trafficking Task Force Committee to oversee human trafficking issues and process
