Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except per share data)
(Unaudited)
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the
“Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim financial
information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by
GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments
(which are of a normal, recurring nature) and disclosures necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income,
and cash flows of the reported interim periods. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from audited financial
statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year
or any other interim period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated
financial statements as filed in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and notes thereto and information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Change in Classification
In the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company changed the classification of certain operating expenses on the Condensed Consolidated
Statements of Income (Loss). Previously, the Company classified expenses incurred related to the downturn in the proppant market as “restructuring and
other charges.” The Company now further classifies these types of expenses between asset impairments and restructuring charges. All comparative periods
presented have been restated accordingly. See Notes 14 and 15 for further detail.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2015-03 – Interest – Imputation of
Interest (Subtopic 835-30). Under Subtopic 835-30, debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance is required to be applied on a retrospective basis
beginning January 1, 2016. Accordingly, the Company applied this guidance to its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in the first quarter of 2016. See
Note 4 for further detail.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 – Leases (ASC 842), which sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and
disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e., lessees and lessors). The ASU requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either
finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will
determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A
lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except per share data)
(Unaudited)
for all leases with a term of greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to
existing guidance for operating leases today. The ASU requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing
guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The ASU is expected to impact the Company’s consolidated financial
statements as the Company has certain operating and land lease arrangements for which it is the lessee. ASC 842 supersedes the previous leases
standard, ASC 840 – Leases. The ASU is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the
impact of this new guidance on its financial statements and disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 – Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718), which provides guidance on simplified accounting
for and presentation of share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, minimum tax withholding requirements, forfeitures,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU requires all tax effects of share-based
payments to be recorded through the income statement, windfall tax benefits to be recorded when the benefit arises, and all share-based payment tax-related
cash flows to be reported as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Regarding tax withholding requirements, the ASU allows entities to withhold
an amount up to the employees’ maximum individual tax rates without classifying the award as a liability. The ASU also permits entities to make an
accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on expense recognition, either recognized when forfeitures are estimated or when forfeitures
occur. The ASU is expected to impact the Company’s financial statements and disclosures as the Company makes share-based payments to its
employees. The ASU is effective beginning January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of this
new guidance on its financial statements and disclosures.
In April and May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers – Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,
ASU No. 2016-11 – Revenue Recognition and Derivatives and Hedging – Recession of SEC Guidance, and ASU No. 2016-12 – Revenue from Contracts
with Customers – Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. These ASU’s each affect the guidance of the new revenue recognition standard in
ASU No. 2014-09 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers and related subsequent ASUs. This guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2018. The
Company is in the process of evaluating the effect of the new guidance on its financial statements and disclosures.

Under ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company is required to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Based on the continuing adverse
business conditions and the idling of certain assets, the Company evaluated certain of its asset groups that contained mineral reserves and other long-lived
assets contained in the Proppant Solutions segment and concluded that the carrying amounts of those assets were not recoverable. Fair value was
determined by prices obtained from third parties for the assets and from estimating the net present value of the future cash flows over the life of the
assets. Critical assumptions for these valuations included future selling prices of products, future operating costs, and the cost of capital. The Company
incurred $90,578 and $6,475 of such asset impairments in the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $90,654 and $6,475 in the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These impairments are recorded as asset impairments in operating expenses in the Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). See Notes 14 and 15 for further detail. Of the carrying value of the assets (after impairment), $1,317 is classified
as a current asset held-for-sale as of June 30, 2016.
If the ongoing uncertainty in oil and gas markets continues, it is possible that additional assets, both tangible and intangible, could be subject to additional
impairment losses in future periods.

As detailed in “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1, ASU 2015-03 dictates that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability are
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The “deferred financing
costs, net” line in the table above is the application of this new guidance.
On September 5, 2013, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “2013 Amended Credit Agreement”). The 2013
Amended Credit Agreement initially contained a revolving credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”) and two tranches of term loans, a term B-1 facility (“Term
B-1 Loans”) and a term B-2 facility (“Term B-2 Loans”). The Revolving Credit Facility, the Term B-1 Loans, and the Term B-2 Loans are secured by a first
priority lien on substantially all of the Company’s domestic assets.
The 2013 Amended Credit Agreement was amended in March 2014, April 2015, and May 2015 as well as joinder agreements as of August 2014 and
September 2014. These amendments and joinder agreements made various changes to maturity dates and interest rate margins. In addition, amounts that
were initially Term B-1 Loans and balances on the Revolving Credit Facility were converted into term loans with essentially the same terms as the Term B-2
Loans (the “Extended Term B-1 Loans”). The applicable margin for B-1 and B-2 Base Rate loans was 2.5% and the margin on B-1 and B-2 Eurodollar Rate
loans was 3.5%.
On September 30, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2013 Amended Credit Agreement that modified the Revolving Credit
Facility. These modifications consisted primarily of (i) a reduction in the U.S. revolving commitments from $124,000 to $99,000 (while the aggregate
Canadian revolving commitment remained at $1,000) and (ii) changes in the financial covenant governing the availability of amounts under the Revolving
Credit Facility if, and only if, the Company has drawn, including letters of credit, more than $31,250 on the Revolving Credit Facility. Generally, if the
Company’s leverage ratio is greater than 4.75:1.00 during the period from the third quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2016, so long as the stated
quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are exceeded, the amount available to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility is increased from $31,250 to
$40,000. Commencing with the end of the first quarter of 2017, the quarterly adjusted EBITDA thresholds are discontinued and the full amount of the
revolving commitment ($100,000) is available so long as the Company’s leverage ratio does not exceed a revised limit (6.50:1.00 for the first quarter of 2017
declining quarterly to 4.75:1.00 for the fourth quarter of 2017). As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s leverage ratio was 77.75:1.00.
On April 28, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2013 Amended Credit Agreement that extended the maturity of certain of the Term B-1
Loans to July 15, 2018 (the “2016 Extended Term Loans”). The Company made a prepayment of accrued interest of $227 and principal of $69,580 on April
28, 2016 to the lenders consenting to the amendment.

(A)   -  The principal payment shown for April 28, 2016 represents a prepayment of principal to the lenders consenting to the extended maturity.
(B)   -  These amounts do not reflect the amortization of original issue discounts.
Accrued interest related to the $16,723 principal payment due on March 17, 2017 will also be due on the same date, as shown above. The applicable base
rate margin on the interest rate for the Base Rate Term B-1 Loans, the Extended Term B-1 Loans, the 2016 Extended Term Loans, and the Term B-2 Loans
is 2.5% and the applicable margin on the interest rate for the Eurodollar Term B-1, Extended Term B-1, 2016 Extended Term Loans, and the Term B-2 Loans
is 3.5%. The Eurodollar Extended Term B-1, 2016 Extended Term, and Term B-2 Loans all contain a 1% rate floor, plus the applicable margin. The Term B-1
Loan does not contain any type of interest rate floor.
As of June 30, 2016, Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans, Extended Term B-1 Loans, the 2016 Extended Term Loans, and the Revolving Credit Facility had
interest rates of 4.2%, 4.5%, 4.5%, 4.5%, and 4.3%, respectively.
As of June 30, 2016, there was $18,323 available capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility and $12,927 committed to outstanding letters of credit. As of June
30, 2016, the Company has not drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility.
The Company has a $10,000 Industrial Revenue Bond outstanding related to the construction of a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin. The bond bears
interest, which is payable monthly, at a variable rate. The rate was 0.46% at June 30, 2016. The bond matures on September 1, 2027 and is collateralized by
a letter of credit of $10,000.

Because the Company experienced a loss in the six months ended June 30, 2016, the impact of dilution has not been included in the earnings per share
calculation as the effect of including these potential common shares would be antidilutive. The calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding
for the six months ended June 30, 2015 excludes 6,914 potential common shares because the effect of including these potential common shares would be
antidilutive.
6. Derivative Instruments
The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements as a means to partially hedge its variable interest rate risk on debt instruments. The current notional
value of these swap agreements is $525,225, which represents a total of approximately 46% of term debt outstanding at June 30, 2016 and effectively fixes
the variable rate in a range of 0.83% to 3.115% for the portion of the debt that is hedged. The interest rate swap agreements mature at various dates between
March 15, 2017 and September 5, 2019.
The derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or in other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging relationship and, if it is, depending on the
type of hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which the Company is hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate liability, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during which earnings are impacted
by the variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings. As interest expense is
accrued on the debt obligation, amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to the interest rate swaps are reclassified into income to
obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap. In the event that an interest rate swap is terminated prior to
maturity, gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) remain deferred and are reclassified into earnings in the periods in which the
hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.
The Company formally designates and documents instruments at inception that qualify for hedge accounting of underlying exposures in accordance with
GAAP. Both at inception and for each reporting period, the Company assesses whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective
in offsetting changes in cash flows of the related underlying exposure.
The following table summarizes the fair values and the respective classification in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015:

the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company expects $6,550 to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) into interest expense within the next twelve months.

7. Fair Value Measurements
Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. and Subsidiaries
Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(in thousands, except per share data)
(Unaudited)
Financial instruments held by the Company include cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt (including the current portion
thereof) and interest rate swaps. The Company is also liable for contingent consideration from an acquisition that is subject to fair value measurement. Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability,
including assumptions about risk and/or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique.
Based on the examination of the inputs used in the valuation techniques, the Company is required to provide the following information according to the fair
value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. Financial assets and liabilities at fair
value will be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:
Level 1   Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Level 2   Observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data
Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data
A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
The book value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their fair values because of their short
maturities. The carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt (including the current portion thereof) is recognized at amortized cost. The fair value of the
Term B-1 Loans, the Extended Term B-1 Loans, the 2016 Extended Term Loans, and the Term B-2 Loans differs from amortized costs and is valued at prices
obtained from a readily-available source for trading non-public debt, which represent quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not
active, and therefore is considered Level 2. The following table presents the fair value as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for the Company’s long-
term debt:

In the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded approximately $2,135 of stock compensation expense related to a modification of the
retirement provisions of the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plans. The modification allows retirement-eligible participants (defined as age 55, plus 10 years
of service) to continue to vest in options following retirement, and also allows retired participants to exercise options for up to 10 years from grant date.
9. Income Taxes
The Company computes and applies to ordinary income an estimated annual effective tax rate on a quarterly basis based on current and forecasted
business levels and activities, including the mix of domestic and foreign results and enacted tax laws. The estimated annual effective tax rate is updated
quarterly based on actual results and updated operating forecasts. Ordinary income refers to income (loss) before income tax expense excluding significant,
unusual, or infrequently occurring items. The tax effect of an unusual or infrequently occurring item is recorded in the interim period in which it occurs as a
discrete item of tax.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $63,019 on a loss before income taxes of $150,889 resulting in an
effective tax rate of 41.8%, compared to a tax benefit of $26,677 on a loss before income taxes of $12,536 resulting in an effective tax rate of 212.8% for the
same period of 2015. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a decrease in the impact of depletion applied against forecasted results
in 2016 as compared to 2015. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the benefit from a loss carryback and depletion.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded a tax benefit $78,773 on a loss before income taxes of $178,422 resulting in an effective tax
rate of 44.1%, compared to a tax benefit of $16,060 on income before income taxes of $28,961 resulting in an effective tax rate of (55.5%) for the same period
of 2015. The increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to the impact of depletion as well as a tax benefit from a loss carryback, applied against
forecasted results in 2016 as compared to forecasted results in 2015. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the benefit
from a loss carryback and depletion.
10. Defined Benefit Plans
The Company maintained two defined benefit pension plans, the Wedron pension plan and the Troy Grove pension plan, covering union employees at
certain facilities that provide benefits based upon years of service or a combination of employee earnings and length of service. The benefits under the
Wedron plan were frozen effective December 31, 2012.
Net periodic benefit cost recognized for other Company defined benefit pension plans for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:

12. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
The Company has entered into numerous mineral rights agreements, in which payments under the agreements are expensed as incurred. Certain
agreements require annual payments while other agreements require payments based upon annual tons mined and others a combination thereof.
The Company has entered into agreements with third party terminal operators whereby certain minimum payments are due regardless of terminal utilization.
The Company leases certain machinery, equipment (including railcars), buildings and office space under operating lease arrangements. Total rent expense
associated with these leases was $35,156 and $33,503 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company is subject to a contingent consideration arrangement related to the purchase of Self-Suspending Proppant LLC (“SSP”), which was accounted
for as an acquisition of a group of assets. The contingent consideration is based on a fixed percentage of the cumulative product margin, less certain
adjustments, generated by sales of Propel SSP and other products incorporating SSP technology for the five years commencing on October 1, 2015. The
Company entered into an Amendment to this agreement on December 17, 2015. This Amendment (a) extends the period during which the aggregate earnout
payments must equal or exceed $45,000 from the two-year period ending October 1, 2017 until the three-year period ending October 1, 2018; and (b)
provides that the aggregate earnout payments during the two-year period ending October 1, 2017 must equal or exceed $15,000 and granted the Seller a
security interest in 51% of the equity interests in the Company to secure such $15,000. The Amendment does not alter the final threshold earnout amount,
which continues to be $195,000 (inclusive of the $45,000 payment, if any) by October 1, 2020. The contingent consideration is accrued and capitalized as
part of the cost of the SSP assets at the time a payment is probable and reasonably estimable. Accordingly, the Company accrued and capitalized $56 in the
six months ended June 30, 2016.
Certain subsidiaries are defendants in lawsuits in which the alleged injuries are claimed to be silicosis-related and to have resulted, in whole or in part, from
exposure to silica-containing products, allegedly including those sold by certain subsidiaries. In the majority of cases, there are numerous other
defendants. In accordance with its insurance obligations, the defense of these actions has been tendered to and the cases are being defended by the
subsidiaries’ insurance carriers. Management believes that the Company’s substantial level of existing and available insurance coverage combined with
various open indemnities is more than sufficient to cover any exposure to silicosis-related expenses. An estimate of the possible loss, if any, cannot be made
at this time.
In December 2015, the Company was notified by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) that it was being investigated for possible violations
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) and other securities laws relating to matters concerning certain of the Company’s international
operations. The Company had previously retained outside legal counsel to investigate the subject matter of the SEC’s investigation, and at that time, the
Company determined that no further action was necessary. The Company cannot predict what, if any, further action the SEC may take regarding its
investigation, and cannot provide an estimate of the potential costs of the SEC’s investigation or any possible fines, penalties, or other remedial actions that
might result, if any, at this time.
13. Transactions with Related Parties
The Company had purchases from an affiliated entity for freight, logistic services and consulting services related to its operations in China of $372 and $120
in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
The Company pays American Securities LLC (“American Securities”), in accordance with its policy, for Board of Directors fees and Company-related
expenses, including travel and lodging, market research, and other miscellaneous expenses. Fees and expenses paid to American Securities were $169
and $0 in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
14. Segment Reporting
The Company organizes its business into two reportable segments, Proppant Solutions and Industrial & Recreational Products. The reportable segments are
consistent with how management views the markets served by the Company and the financial information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in
deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance.

15. Restructuring Charges
As a result of challenging conditions in the energy market, the Company has taken actions to adjust its overall operational footprint and reduce costs. The
restructuring program primarily consists of workforce reductions and costs to idle or exit facilities. The Company expects to complete these activities prior to
the end of 2016, although a continued sustained downturn in the oil and gas market could extend the duration of this restructuring process. A summary of the
restructuring costs recognized for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is as follows:
Restructuring charges
  
Workforce reduction costs, including one-time severance payments  
Other exit costs, including multiemployer pension plan withdrawal

As of June 30, 2016, the balance of Goodwill was $15,301, which represents goodwill related to acquisitions in the Company’s Industrial & Recreational
Products segment. The Company performed a review of qualitative factors and concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, there were no events or changes in
circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
17. Subsequent Event
On July 26, 2016, the Company completed a public offering of 25,000 shares of its common stock. In addition, the underwriters completed their exercise of an
overallotment option on July 28, 2016 to sell an additional 3,750 shares. Cash proceeds received by the Company for the 28,750 shares sold were
approximately $161,000, net of underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses. After these transactions, there were 191,413 shares of common
stock issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2016.
The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which include, but are not limited to, working capital,
repayment, redemption or refinancing of debt and leases, investments in or loans to subsidiaries, and satisfaction of other obligations.

should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this Report in the context of these risks and uncertainties.
We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that
we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or
our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this Report are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash
flows of our company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related information contained herein and our audited financial statements as of December 31, 2015 and
2014 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as
well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or
implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed herein, particularly in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
Overview
We are one of the world’s largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for nearly 40 years have been a pioneer in the development of high
performance proppants used by Exploration & Production (“E&P”) companies to enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells. Additionally, for more
than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications
knowledge to end users in the Industrial & Recreational (“I&R”) markets.
As one of the industry leaders, our asset base at December 31, 2015 included 798 million tons of proven and probable mineral reserves, which we believe is
one of the largest reserve bases in the industry. Due to the continuing challenging conditions in the oil and gas markets, we continue to adjust our
operational footprint to consolidate into the lowest-cost footprint possible. As of August 2016, we have 10 sand processing facilities (5 of which are active)
with 16.8 million tons of annual sand processing capacity. To date in 2016, we have idled our Shakopee, Minnesota facility, our Wisconsin facilities in
Maiden Rock and Menomonie, and our international facility in Mexico. We also have 9 coating facilities (5 of which are active) with 2.3 million tons of annual
coating capacity.
We are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America’s major oil and gas producing basins and also have the flexibility to ship our product
via barge, marine terminals and trucks to reach our customers as needed. We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 42 proppant distribution
terminals and a fleet of approximately 10,100 railcars considering car returns that took place throughout the year and subleases. Our unit train capabilities
include two production facilities and eight in-basin terminals, which reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our railcar fleet. In order to better align
our logistics network with customer demand and to reduce costs, we discontinued activity at three transloading terminals in 2016.
Our operations are organized into two segments based on the primary end markets we serve: (i) Proppant Solutions and (ii) I&R Products. Our Proppant
Solutions segment predominantly provides sand-based proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing operations throughout the U.S. and Canada, Argentina,
Mexico, China, northern Europe and the United Arab Emirates. Our I&R Products segment provides raw, coated, and custom blended sands to the foundry,
building products, glass, turf and landscape and filtration industries primarily in North America. We believe our two market segments are complementary. Our
ability to sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us to maximize the recovery of our reserve base within our mining operations
and to reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.
Segment Contribution Margin
Segment contribution margin is a key metric that management uses to evaluate our operating performance and to determine resource allocation between
segments. Segment contribution margin is defined as total revenues less the

cost of goods sold to produce and deliver the products, less selling, general and administrative expenses that are directly attributable to each segment. The
definition excludes certain corporate costs not associated with the operations of the segment. These unallocated costs include costs related to corporate
functional areas such as administration, accounting, finance, treasury, information technology, human resources, research and development, business
development and sustainable development, as well as unallocated costs related to operations such as undeveloped mineral rights reserves.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and certain external users of our financial
statements.
We define EBITDA as net income before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as
EBITDA before non-cash stock-based compensation, impairment of assets, and certain other non-cash income or expenses.
Management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow us to more effectively evaluate our operations from period to period
without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered
as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of our
operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a
company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are
components of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Although we attempt to determine EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in a manner that is consistent with other
companies in our industry, our computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other
companies. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are widely followed measures of operating performance and may also be used by investors to
measure our ability to meet debt service requirements.
The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:

Our operating results declined in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. The declines in revenues and
contribution margin in our Proppant Solutions segment resulted from decreases in proppant volumes, in particular coated proppants, product mix, and lower
pricing across the segment. The I&R Products segment offset some of the declines in the Proppant Solutions business with sequential increase in volume
and segment contribution margin due to seasonality and increase in new business. The Proppant Solutions segment contribution margin was also impacted
by asset impairments and inventory write-downs in the three months ended June 30, 2016.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Revenues
Revenues decreased $107.1 million, or 48%, to $114.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $221.3 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to decreased volumes, a change in product mix, and lower selling prices in our Proppant Solutions segment.
North American rig counts continued to decline in the second quarter 2016, which softened drilling activity and demand for proppants in the quarter. E&P
companies, in partnership with oilfield service companies, are continuing to refine their well designs and hydraulic fracturing techniques to increase the
amount of proppant used per frac stage and, together, these techniques have greatly increased the volume of proppant used in the completion of each well
(“proppant intensity”). The trend of increasing proppant intensity has offset, to some extent, the decrease in demand for proppants resulting from reduced rig
counts and drilling activity.
Total volumes in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased 19% to 1.3 million tons in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 1.6 million tons in
the three months ended June 30, 2015. Raw frac sand volumes decreased 11% to 1.2 million tons in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
three months ended June 30, 2015. Coated proppant volumes decreased 71% to 0.1 million tons in the second quarter of 2016 compared to 0.2 million tons
in the second quarter of 2015. Revenues in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $106.0 million, or 56%, to $82.1 million for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 compared to $188.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in Proppant Solutions revenue was largely due to
pricing declines and declines in volumes, particularly resin-coated proppant.
The rapid decline in oil and gas prices and continued price volatility that has occurred since late 2014 led to reduced drilling activity and reduced demand for
proppants. As a result, the proppant market is in a position of oversupply, which has caused selling prices for all proppants to decline significantly through
the second quarter of 2016 relative
Table of Contents
26
to the second quarter of 2015. Although uncertain, future increases in demand for proppants are expected to be driven by completion of previously drilled but
uncompleted wells (“DUCs”), increases in proppant intensity, and climbing North American rig counts.
Revenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $1.0 million, or 3%, to $32.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $33.2 million
for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Volumes increased to 0.7 million tons in the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 0.6 million tons in
the three months ended June 30, 2015. I&R Products segment revenue was impacted by seasonal sales growth in the sports and recreation market coupled
with stronger volumes in key markets, particularly those aligned with construction-driven markets.
Revenues in our I&R Products segment are driven by macroeconomic factors such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel activity and
industrial production. To the extent these demand drivers continue on their current trends, we expect that demand for our commercial silica products will
remain relatively stable.
Segment Contribution Margin
Contribution margin decreased $96.9 million to negative $62.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $34.5 million for the three
months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to decreased volumes and selling prices in our Proppant Solutions segment, in addition to non-cash asset
impairment charges. Contribution margin for the three months ended June 30, 2016 included non-cash asset impairments of $57.2 million and inventory
write-downs of $10.3 million. Contribution margin for the three months ended June 30, 2015 included $14.4 million of asset impairment charges and
restructuring costs.
Contribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $109.8 million to negative $74.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $35.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes, changes in product mix between
raw frac sand and coated proppant, decreased selling prices, and non-cash impairment charges in the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Proppant
Solutions segment contribution margin includes non-cash asset impairment charges of $57.2 million and inventory write-downs of $9.9 million in the three
months ended June 30, 2016. Contribution margin for the three months ended June 30, 2015 included $2.3 million of asset impairments and restructuring
charges.
Contribution margin in the I&R Products segment increased $12.9 million to $12.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a negative
$0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in contribution margin is primarily due to favorable selling prices, customer mix, and
improved manufacturing costs per ton. Contribution margin includes inventory write-downs of $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016. Contribution margin for the three months ended June 30, 2015 included $12.1 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) increased $1.9 million, or 10%, to $21.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared
to $19.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. SG&A attributable to our segments decreased $0.9 million primarily as a result of workforce
reductions made in the first quarter. Corporate SG&A costs increased $2.9 million as a result of $5.3 million in fees committed for additional cost reduction
initiatives and extension of approximately $70 million of our Term B-1 Loans to 2018, partially offset by other SG&A reductions.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
27
Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $1.8 million to $18.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $16.3 million in the
three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in depreciation is due to more assets placed in service primarily related to the Wedron plant expansion.
Income (Loss) from Operations
Income (loss) from operations decreased $136.6 million to a loss of $134.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to income of $2.4
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Second quarter earnings were largely impacted by declines in contribution margins due to lower volumes
and decreased selling prices, in addition to the non-cash asset impairments, restructuring charges, inventory write-downs, and professional fees totaling
$111 million.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $1.7 million, or 11%, to $16.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $14.9 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the notional amounts on interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2013, that became effective
October 2015 and a reduction in capitalized interest due to the completion of the Wedron facility expansion, partially offset as a result of the prepayment of
$69.6 million of the Term B-1 Loans.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
Benefit from income taxes increased $36.3 million to a benefit of $63.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $26.7
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in the benefit recorded during the second quarter of 2016 is primarily related to the decrease
in income before income taxes and a loss carryback. The effective tax rate was 41.8% and 212.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a decrease in the impact of depletion applied against forecasted results for 2016
as compared to 2015. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the benefit from a loss carryback and depletion.
Income before income taxes decreased $138.4 million to a loss of $150.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $12.5
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The provision (benefit) for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual
effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective
tax rate. If our estimated effective tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc.
Net income attributable to Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. decreased $102.0 million to a loss of $87.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to income of $14.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 due to the factors noted above, including asset impairments and restructuring
charges totaling $70 million on an after-tax basis.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $58.3 million to a loss of $21.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to income of $36.5 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of $94.5 million of non-cash stock compensation expense and impairment
charges. The Adjusted EBITDA loss includes inventory write-downs, restructuring charges, and fees committed for cost-reduction initiatives and extension of
our debt totaling approximately $16.8 million. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was largely due to declines in proppant volumes, change in product mix, and
pricing as noted above.

tons in the six months ended June 30, 2015. Revenues in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $261.5 million, or 57%, to $199.6 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $461.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in Proppant Solutions revenue was largely
due to pricing declines and declines in volumes, particularly in resin-coated proppant volumes.
Revenues in the I&R Products segment decreased $1.7 million, or 3%, to $60.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $61.8 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. Volumes remained relatively flat at 1.2 million tons in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2015. I&R Products segment revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was impacted by seasonal sales growth in the sports and
recreation market coupled with stronger volumes in key markets, particularly those aligned with construction-driven markets.
Segment Contribution Margin
Contribution margin decreased $166.4 million to negative $40.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $125.4 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to decreased volumes and selling prices, in addition to changes in product mix in our Proppant Solutions
segment. Contribution margin for the six months ended June 30, 2016 also included non-cash asset impairments of $57.3 million and inventory write-downs
of $10.3 million. Contribution margin in the six months ended June 30, 2015 included $14.4 million of asset impairment charges and restructuring charges.
Contribution margin in the Proppant Solutions segment decreased $181.0 million to negative $61.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to $119.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volumes, changes in product mix between
raw frac sand and coated proppant, decreased selling prices, and non-cash impairment charges of $57.3 million and inventory write-downs of $9.9 million in
the six months ended June 30, 2016. Contribution margin for the six months ended June 30, 2015 included $2.4 million of asset impairments and
restructuring charges.
Contribution margin in the I&R Products segment increased $14.7 million to $20.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $6.2 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in contribution margin is primarily due to favorable selling prices, customer mix, and improved
manufacturing costs per ton. Contribution margin for the six months ended June 30, 2016 includes inventory write-downs of $0.4 million. Contribution margin
for the six months ended June 30, 2015 included $12.1 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $5.5 million, or 13%, to $37.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $43.2
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. SG&A attributable to our segments decreased $3.4 million and Corporate SG&A costs decreased $2.1
million primarily due to our continued cost reduction initiatives and reductions in force. SG&A costs included $5.3 million in professional fees for cost
reduction initiatives and extension of our Term B-1 Loans for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization
29
Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased $4.1 million to $36.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $32.5 million in the six
months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in depreciation is due to more assets placed in service primarily related to the Wedron plant expansion.
Income (Loss) from Operations
Income (loss) from operations decreased $203.7 million to a loss of $144.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to income of $59.2
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Earnings were largely impacted by declines in contribution margins due to the lower volumes and decreased
selling prices, in addition to the non-cash impairments, restructuring costs, inventory write-downs, and professional fees totaling $113 million.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $3.7 million, or 12%, to $33.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $30.2 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 primarily due to an increase in the notional amounts for interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2013, that became effective October
2015 and a reduction in capitalized interest due to the completion of the Wedron facility expansion.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
Benefit from income taxes increased $62.7 million to a benefit of $78.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $16.1 million
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in the benefit primarily related to the decrease in income before income taxes and a loss carryback.
The effective tax rate was 44.1% and negative 55.5% in the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate is
primarily attributable to the impact of depletion as well as a tax benefit from a loss carryback, applied against forecasted results for 2016 as compared to
forecasted results in 2015. The effective rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the benefit from a loss carryback and depletion.
Income before income taxes decreased $207.4 million to a loss of $178.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to income of $29.0
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The provision (benefit) for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual
effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective
tax rate. If our estimated effective tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment.
Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc.
Net income attributable to Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc. decreased $144.6 million to a loss of $99.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to income of $44.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 due to the factors noted above totaling $71.2 million on an after-tax basis.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $123.4 million to a loss of $11.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to income of $111.7 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of $96.2 million of non-cash stock compensation expense and impairment
charges. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was largely due to declines in proppant pricing and volumes as noted above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Overview
Our principal liquidity requirements have been to service our debt, to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs. We have met our liquidity and
capital investment needs with funds generated through operations. We also have the ability to raise additional capital, subject to market conditions, through
the issuance of shares of our common stock, as was done subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
Table of Contents
30
As of June 30, 2016, we had outstanding term loan borrowings of $1.15 billion and cash on hand of $61.6 million. In addition, we have a Revolving Credit
Facility that can provide additional liquidity, if needed. As of June 30, 2016 we had $31.3 million of availability under our revolving credit facility with $12.9
million committed to letters of credit, leaving net availability at $18.3 million. On April 28, 2016, we amended our term loan facility. Under the terms of the
amendment, we prepaid $69.6 million, plus accrued interest, to certain of our Term B-1 Loans lenders. These lenders in turn agreed to extend the maturity
date to July 15, 2018 for $69.6 million of Term B-1 Loans, which were originally due March 15, 2017.
After the extension of the maturity of certain of the Term B-1 Loans and the additional cash raised in the July 2016 stock offering, as of the date of this report,
we believe that our cash on-hand, cash generated through operations, and amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet
cash obligations, such as working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and scheduled debt payments, over the next twelve months. We
may use cash at times to negotiate repurchases of a portion of our syndicated term debt to the extent permitted under our credit agreement. See “Credit
Facilities” below for more information.
A continued sustained downturn in our business’s key markets could significantly impact our forecasts. While we believe that our operations forecasts are
reasonable, the forecasts are based on assumptions and market conditions impacting the industry, primarily the proppant business, are uncertain. In the
event the operating results are significantly worse than projected or we are unsuccessful in generating sufficient liquidity, we may not be able to satisfy our
debt obligations and would be necessary to restructure these obligations. In order to address this risk, we have implemented reductions in operating costs,
selling, general, and administrative costs, reduced planned capital spending, and working capital improvements over the past few years.
Working Capital
Working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities, is a measure of liquidity, and source of cash flow. Our working capital was
$147.3 million at June 30, 2016 and $274.1 million at December 31, 2015.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable decreased $9.6 million to $63.9 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $73.6 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily the
result of higher sales in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in increased collections during the second quarter of 2016, in addition to lower overall sales during
the first six months of 2016 compared to the prior year. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, our top ten proppant customers collectively
represented 70% and 71% of our revenues, respectively. During the same periods, sales in the aggregate to our top two customers, Halliburton Company
(“Halliburton”) and FTS International Services, LLC (“FTSI”), collectively accounted for 44% and 43% of our revenues, respectively.
Inventory
Inventory consists of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods. The cost of finished goods includes processing costs and transportation costs to
terminals. The decrease in inventory to $56.7 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $70.5 million at December 31, 2015 relates to efforts to decrease
inventory levels to match projected decreasing demand, particularly for resin-coated products. The inventory balance at June 30, 2016 also incorporates the
impact from $10.3 million of inventory write-downs as a result of valuation adjustments.
Prepaid Expenses and Other Assets
Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased $6.6 million to $6.8 million at June 30, 2016 from $13.4 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to a
decrease in prepaid insurance and railcar leases.

Refundable Income Taxes
31
Refundable income taxes increased $15.5 million to $42.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $26.5 million at December 31, 2015, primarily due to the carryback
of a 2016 estimated loss.
Accounts Payable
Accounts payable decreased $6.1 million to $34.3 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $40.4 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease in accounts
payable is due to timing for payments and reduced purchasing and freight activity driven by lower sales volumes and reduced capital spending.
Accrued Expenses
The decrease in accrued expenses to $20.1 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $26.8 million at December 31, 2015 was primarily due a reduction in
accrued bonuses, pension expenses, and accrued real estate taxes.
Cash Flow Analysis
Net Cash Provided (Used in) by Operating Activities
Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items, including depreciation, depletion, and amortization, asset impairments, and
the effect of changes in working capital.
Net cash used in operating activities was $13.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared with $173.6 million provided in the six months
ended June 30, 2015. This $186.8 million variance was primarily the result of changes in operating income and working capital.
Net Cash Used in Investing Activities
Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth and maintenance. Capital expenditures generally are for expansions of production or
terminal capacities. Maintenance capital expenditures generally are for asset replacement and health, safety, and quality improvements.
Net cash used in investing activities was $18.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $61.3 million used for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. The $43.1 million variance was primarily the result of a decrease in capital expenditures.
Capital expenditures, including stripping costs, of $21.9 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 were primarily focused on expansion of our sand
processing capacities at our Wedron facility. Capital expenditures were $61.3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015 and also primarily associated
with the expansion of the Wedron facility.
Net Cash Used in Financing Activities
Financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and repayments under our term loans and revolving credit facility.
Net cash used in financing activities was $79.4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $13.5 million used in the six months ended June
30, 2015 primarily due to the prepayment of a portion of our Term B-1 Loans in exchange for an extension of the maturity date of a portion of the Term B-1
Loans to September 2019.

Credit Facilities
32
As of June 30, 2016, there was $18.3 million available capacity remaining on the Revolving Credit Facility and $12.9 million committed to outstanding letters
of credit. As of June 30, 2016, we have not drawn on the Revolving Credit Facility.
In order to provide greater near-term liquidity in the event of possible continued downturns in the oil and gas markets we serve, on April 28, 2016, we entered
into an amendment to the 2013 Amended Credit Agreement that extended the maturity of certain of the Term B-1 Loans to July 15, 2018 (the “2016 Extended
Term Loans”). Under the terms of the amendment, we committed to a prepayment of $69.6 million, plus accrued interest, to certain of our Term B-1 Loans
lenders. These lenders in turn agreed to extend the maturity date to July 15, 2018 for $69.6 million of Term B-1 Loans, which were originally due March 15,
2017. This extension lowered the total March 2017 principal payments on our term debt to $16.7 million on the Term B-1 Loans. Our principal payments in
2017 now consist of (i) $16.7 million on the Term B-1 Loans; (ii) $9.3 million on the Term B-2 Loans and; (iii) $1.6 million on the Extended Term B-1 Loans
for a total of $27.6 million. The applicable margin on the interest rate for the 2016 Extended Term Loans is now the same as the Extended Term B-1 and
Term B-2 Loans, which is the LIBOR interest rate plus 3.5%. With the amendment, the 2016 Extended Term Loans now have a 1% LIBOR floor, which is the
same as the Extended Term B-1 and Term B-2 Loans. See Note 4 in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q for further detail regarding the change in the maturities of the 2016 Extended Term Loans.
As of June 30, 2016, the Term B-1 Loans, Term B-2 Loans, Extended Term B-1 Loans, 2016 Extended Term Loans, and the Revolving Credit Facility had
actual interest rates of 4.2%, 4.5%, 4.5%, 4.5%, and 4.3%, respectively.
We have a $10 million Industrial Revenue Bond outstanding related to the construction of a manufacturing facility in Wisconsin. The bond bears interest,
which is payable monthly, at a variable rate. The rate was 0.46% at June 30, 2016. The bond matures on September 1, 2027 and is collateralized by a letter
of credit of $10 million.
As of the date of this report, we believe that the amount available under the Revolving Credit Facility, cash generated from operations, and our cash and
cash equivalents on hand, in addition to the net proceeds from our July 2016 common stock offering, will provide adequate liquidity to allow us to meet our
cash obligations over the next twelve months.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Contractual Obligations
As of June 30, 2016, we have contractual obligations for long-term debt, capital leases, operating leases, purchase obligations, terminal operating costs, and
other long-term liabilities. The purchase obligations include approximately 1,900 railcars with future delivery dates in 2017 and 2018. We intend to satisfy
these purchase obligations through leasing arrangements with third-party lessors or extend them into the future, although there is no assurance that these
arrangements could be financed satisfactorily in the present environment or extended. Substantially all of the operating lease obligations are for railcars.
In the six months ended June 30, 2016, except for changes to the timing of long-term debt payments as disclosed within Footnote 4 of the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as reported in
our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The 2016 Extended Term Loans change the maturity dates of long-term debt obligations, but not the amount of the
obligations.

Environmental Matters
33
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other things, hazardous materials, air and water emissions,
environmental contamination and reclamation and the protection of the environment and natural resources. We have made, and expect to make in the future,
expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations, but cannot predict the full amount of such future expenditures. We may also incur fines and penalties
from time to time associated with noncompliance with such laws and regulations.
There have been no other significant changes to environmental liabilities or future reclamation costs since December 31, 2015.
We discuss certain environmental matters relating to our various production and other facilities, certain regulatory requirements relating to human exposure
to crystalline silica and our mining activity and how such matters may affect our business in the future under “Regulation and Legislation” in our 2015 Annual
Report on Form 10-K.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience,
current conditions and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis
for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as identifying and assessing the accounting treatment with respect to
commitments and contingencies. Our actual results may materially differ from these estimates. These critical accounting policies and estimates should be
read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as filed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Among the critical accounting policies and estimates are estimates of the fair values of our reporting units used in determining whether the amount of
recorded goodwill at our I&R Products segment reporting unit has been impaired. The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit is based in part on
management’s estimates of future cash flows from operations, multiples of future cash flows as determined by market participants, and discount rates used in
evaluating the net present value of these cash flows. The expected amount of and variations in future cash flows from operations is highly judgmental, and is
based on part of estimates from management’s internal planning processes. The multiples and present values used in these calculations are estimates
based on data that available from the public record, such as analyst reports.
Similarly, these future cash flows from operations are used in determining whether other long-lived tangible and intangible assets have a fair value in excess
of carrying value. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment for long-lived assets at several Proppant Solutions locations since the
recoverability of these locations could not be assured. The value of the supply agreement in the FTSI agreement is based on estimates of discounted future
cash flows from sales under the agreement. As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of the supply agreement exceeded its carrying value. Should FTSI undergo
financial difficulties or not comply with the terms of this agreement, the fair value could decline such that an impairment in carrying value exists.
There have been no material changes in our accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended June 30, 2016.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
New accounting guidance that has been recently issued but not yet adopted by us, is included in Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

ITEM 3.
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Interest Rate Swaps
Due to our variable-rate indebtedness, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates. We use interest rate swaps to manage this exposure. These
derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair values. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current
earnings or in other comprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedging relationship and, if it is, depending on the
type of hedging relationship. For cash flow hedges in which we are hedging the variability of cash flows related to a variable-rate liability, the effective portion
of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported in other comprehensive income in the periods during which earnings are impacted by the
variability of the cash flows of the hedged item. The ineffective portion of all hedges is recognized in current period earnings.
We do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all such instruments involve risk, including the possibility
that a loss may occur from the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of a contract (credit risk) or the possibility that future changes in
market price may make a financial instrument less valuable or more onerous (market risk). As is customary for these types of instruments, we do not require
collateral or other security from other parties to these instruments. In management’s opinion, there is no significant risk of loss in the event of nonperformance
of the counterparties to these financial instruments.
We formally designate and document instruments at inception that qualify for hedge accounting of underlying exposures in accordance with GAAP. We
assess, both at inception and for each reporting period, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective in offsetting changes in
cash flows of the related underlying exposure.
As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of $20.2 million.
A hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates by 1.0% would have had an approximate $0.8 million impact on our interest expense in the six months
ended June 30, 2016.
Market Risk
We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates. Market risk related to interest rates is the potential loss arising from adverse
changes in interest rates. We do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our financial position or results of operations during periods covered by
the financial statements included in this Report.
Credit Risk
We are subject to risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our top two
proppant customers, Halliburton and FTSI, accounted for approximately 44% of our sales. Approximately 39% of our accounts receivable balance at June
30, 2016, was outstanding from two customers. We examine the creditworthiness of third-party customers to whom we extend credit and manage our
exposure to credit risk through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures, and for certain transactions, we may request letters of
credit, prepayments or guarantees, although collateral is generally not required.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure of Controls and Procedures
35
Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the six months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.
LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We and/or our predecessors have been named as a defendant, usually among many defendants, in numerous products liability lawsuits brought by or on
behalf of current or former employees of our customers alleging damages caused by silica exposure. As of June 30, 2016, we were subject to approximately
4 active silica exposure cases. In accordance with our insurance obligations, these claims are being defended by our subsidiaries’ insurance carriers,
subject to our payment of approximately 7% of the defense costs. We believe that our level of existing and available insurance coverage combined with
various open indemnities is sufficient to cover any exposure to silicosis-related expenses. Should our insurance coverage or indemnities prove to be
insufficient or unavailable, it could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, cash flows and prospects.
ITEM 1A.

The operation of our U.S. based mines is subject to regulation by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) under the Federal Mine
Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes a
violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Following passage of The Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, MSHA significantly
increased the numbers of citations and orders charged against mining operations. The dollar penalties assessed for citations issued has also increased in
recent years.
Fairmount Santrol is required to report certain mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K, and that required information is included in Exhibit 95.1 and is incorporated by
