<body><p>GE.<footnote name="1">9. To a large degree, prosecutions and the threat of prosecution have had a very limited 
impact on the number and level of human rights violations committed by State, guerrilla or 
paramilitary actors during the conflict. Most human rights violations remain in the 
preliminary stage of investigation. Law No. 975, known as &#8220;Justice and Peace Law&#8221;, on 
demobilized paramilitaries, appears to have served as a vehicle for truth, but not 
significantly as an instrument of criminal justice. In fact, almost all of the accused will most 
likely be released after eight years without ever having gone to trial.

<p><b>  Situation of human rights in Colombia</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> In the present report, the United nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
commends the Government of Colombia for its determined pursuit of a negotiated end to 
the internal armed conflict and the ongoing efforts made to meet its international human 
rights obligations.  
</p>
<p> Many human rights violations linked to the internal armed conflict could be ended 
or greatly reduced if the progress made in the peace negotiations leads to well conceived 
and implemented peace accords. An end to hostilities would also create a unique 
opportunity to address human rights more broadly. The High Commissioner illustrates the 
difficulties of moving from a counter-insurgency culture to one where rights-holders and 
duty-bearers work to address human rights challenges together. 
</p>
<p> The High Commissioner analyses and offers lessons learned with regard to the mass 
demonstrations that characterized 2013. She welcomes the positive developments 
witnessed in the area of victims&#8217; rights, while identifying remaining shortcomings and 
challenges. She also emphasizes serious human rights concerns, including the attempt to 
expand military criminal jurisdiction and the situation of human rights defenders and of 
land restitution claimants.

much prison time people responsible for human rights crimes should serve. Such 
considerations crowded out necessary thought and debate on essential issues relating to past 
violations, including the purpose of punishment; how criminal justice may effectively 
address past violations; the structural changes needed to ensure non-repetition, including 
the total demobilization of illegal armed groups and vetting of State agents linked to past 
human rights violations; the transformations necessary to dissuade people from joining 
illegal armed groups; and how to use the truth documented in academic studies to generate 
political and popular recognition and transformations in survivors&#8217; lives.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In July 2013, the Government of Colombia and the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights renewed the 1996 agreement that established the Office 
of the High Commissioner in Colombia (OHCHR-Colombia) until 31 October 2014. While 
reiterating the original mandate, the High Commissioner and the Government agreed to 
intensify the work of OHCHR-Colombia in regions facing particularly complex human 
rights problems, and cooperation with the Presidential Programme on Human Rights to 
create local human rights progress indicators and benchmarks. 
</p>
<p>2. In April 2013, Colombia participated in its second cycle of the universal periodic 
review. Colombia was commended on the progress that it had made towards ending the 
armed conflict and implementing the Victims and Land Restitution Law, as well as its 
ongoing commitment to work with OHCHR. At the same time, Council Members 
expressed their concerns about military justice, impunity and the situation of human rights 
defenders. 
</p>
<p>3. The High Commissioner visited Colombia in July 2013, when she met with national 
and local authorities, human rights defenders, survivors of human rights violations, and 
representatives of indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples and peasant organizations. She 
acknowledged the progress made by Colombia in the promotion of human rights, and 
encouraged ongoing work between the State and civil society. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General 
</b></p>
<p>4. Peace negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia &#8211; People&#8217;s 
Army (FARC-EP) marked their first anniversary in November 2013. Agreements were 
reached on two of the six agenda items (rural development and political participation). 
After more than 50 years of conflict, achieving peace appears at times more difficult than 
continuing the conflict. Institutions and attitudes reflect generations of armed conflict. 
Mistrust runs deep and is perhaps the greatest obstacle to peace. The possibility of 
negotiations with the National Liberation Army (ELN) was announced in 2013. 
5. If properly elaborated and implemented, the peace accords eventually reached with 
FARC-EP and ELN will have an enormous potential for improving the situation of human 
rights of all in Colombia. A post-conflict scenario needs to envisage a new engagement 
between Colombia and OHCHR, and possibly with the United Nations as a whole. New 
modalities of work would include defining the mission completion strategy of OHCHR-
Colombia in a successful and orderly manner. 
</p>
<p>6. The period under review was characterized by mass social protests organized by 
numerous sectors on various issues. During the demonstrations, OHCHR-Colombia, in 
coordination with other United Nations entities, and in particular the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP), helped actively to build bridges between protesters and 
the Government to foster dialogue and prevent violence and human rights violations. 
Important lessons can be drawn from the organization of and response to the protests. The 
High Commissioner commends the fact that all the protests ended through negotiated 
agreements aimed at addressing demonstrators&#180; claims. 
</p>
<p>7. The current panorama of peace, social mobilization and polarization with regard to 
such sensitive issues as justice will define the agenda of electoral campaigns for upcoming </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>presidential and legislative elections, to be held in May and March 2014, respectively. In 
November 2013, President Santos announced his intention to run for a second term. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Activities of the Office of the High Commissioner 
</b></p>
<p>8. OHCHR-Colombia continued to contribute to positive human rights change in 2013 
through its monitoring, advocacy, public statements, good offices and technical 
cooperation, including training and advice. Office priorities were identified through 
monitoring, analysis and constant consultation with victims, State authorities and civil 
society. OHCHR-Colombia provides an impartial, principle-based voice to assist duty-
bearers and rights-holders. It offers human rights-related information in close to real time to 
State partners on advances and difficulties in order that corrective action may be taken. 
</p>
<p>9. The activities conducted by OHCHR-Colombia arise from the three interrelated 
pillars of the United Nations: peace, human rights, and development. On the basis of an 
agreement with the Government and in response to the requests of local authorities and 
civil society, OHCHR-Colombia opened three additional field offices: in Quibd&#243;, to 
address the situation of Afro-Colombian and indigenous peoples, and social conflict linked 
to mining; in Barranquilla, to better support land restitution efforts in the Caribbean region; 
and in Neiva, to increase human rights monitoring and intervention capacity in conflict-
affected Putumayo, Caquet&#225;, Huila and Tolima. 
</p>
<p>10. Social protests highlighted the importance of the preventive work of OHCHR-
Colombia as an impartial third party. For example, OHCHR helped to facilitate the 
initiation of negotiations, was part of the process to reach and monitor agreements as a 
guarantor, and worked within the United Nations system contributing to conflict prevention 
and resolution. 
</p>
<p>11. In order to maximize its strategic impact with duty-bearers and rights-holders, 
OHCHR-Colombia has prioritized approximately 80 communities afflicted by human rights 
violations by various actors. The majority are in rural areas and municipalities with 
especially limited resources. Replicable good practices are documented in order to facilitate 
positive human rights change throughout the country. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Government and State institutions 
</b></p>
<p>12. OHCHR-Colombia collaborates with as many State institutions as possible. 
However, lack of coordination among those institutions and unwillingness to accept 
responsibility for human rights violations undermine further advances in human rights. The 
national human rights system, established in November 2011, is an important institutional 
development aimed at defining common goals and responsibilities, creating baselines and 
indicators to measure the achievement of objectives. In 2013, OHCHR-Colombia continued 
to support this process, and the tripartite effort between State, civil society and international 
community that resulted in the initiative &#8220;From violence to a society of rights: a 2014-2034 
comprehensive human rights policy&#8221;, officially launched in December 2013. 
</p>
<p>13. The State has robust human rights architecture that is, however, more accessible in 
urban than in rural areas. For example, there are 1, 102 municipalities in Colombia, each  </p>
<p>with a local ombudsperson. In Medellin, the local ombudsperson&#8217;s office operates 24 hours,  </p>
<p>seven days a week, with a staff of approximately 60. By contrast, 90 per cent of local  </p>
<p>ombudspersons, who commonly face the most complex of human rights situations, operate 
in their municipalities with the scarcest resources, usually with entirely inadequate 
materials and human resources. OHCHR-Colombia advocates for legislative change so that </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>local ombudspersons are provided with the resources on the basis of the human rights 
challenges actually faced, rather than of municipal income. 
</p>
<p>14. Today, the national Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office has an annual budget of $167 million 
and 1,<footnote name="2">Ibid., paras. 42 &#8211; 47. </footnote>20 staff; the Procurator General&#8217;s Office, $242 million and 3,800 staff; the Victims&#8217; 
Unit, $770 million and almost 1,800 employees; the Attorney Generals Office&#8217;, just over $1 
billion and more than 25,000 staff; the anti-poverty agency - Department of Social 
Prosperity, just over $1.<footnote name="2">0. The purpose of criminal law in post-conflict Colombia should be clearly articulated 
and examined from a human rights perspective. The State should find the right balance 
between prevention, punishment and rehabilitation, restoration and reparation. </footnote> billion and more than 1,200 staff; and the security forces, $15.<footnote name="4">3. OHCHR-Colombia interacts with the armed forces on a daily basis, in an open, 
productive and frank relationship. Nonetheless, cooperation on prevention is more fluid 
than that in addressing current and past violations. OHCHR is concerned that some military 
authorities only regard as human rights violations those extrajudicial executions in the 
modality of &#8220;false positives&#8221;, a position that is inconsistent with the State&#8217;s international 
obligations. Another matter of concern is that, despite the information available, the 
Ministry of Defence and military authorities continue to report no human rights complaints </footnote> 
billion, of which $3.<footnote name="9">8. In 2013, the Rural Development Institute received protection requests from 79 
indigenous peoples and 45 Afro-Colombian communities, the majority from the </footnote> billion go to the police. The armed forces have approximately 
398,000 members, and the police 167,000. An end to hostilities will provide the 
opportunity to reprioritize human rights, peace and development in the national agenda and 
budget. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview of the situation directly related to the conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Victims  
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Peace and past violations 
</b>15. As at December 2013, there were 5,<footnote name="9">7. OHCHR-Colombia is aware of cases where businesses have exerted an 
inappropriate influence on local and national authorities, as well as on some ethnic group 
representatives. Prior consultation protocols will greatly assist in making the exercise of the 
right more transparent. It is important that prior consultation and consent not be considered 
an obstacle, but rather a solution for the realization of the collective rights of indigenous 
and Afro-Colombian peoples. 
</footnote>66,211 victims of armed conflict registered in 
the Single Registry for Victims, of whom 5,155,406 were forced displacement victims. 
Estimates by non-governmental sources are significantly higher. The continuing conflict 
creates additional victims daily. According to the Registry, 55,157 people were displaced 
between January and October 2013. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>21. Some high-ranking officers and soldiers in the armed forces are still linked to 
proceedings for past human rights violations, including for extrajudicial executions known 
as &#8220;false positives&#8221;. The peace negotiations present an opportunity to improve further the 
professionalism and legitimacy of the military by removing such individuals from service. 
</p>
<p>22. International experience has shown the importance of providing long-term 
alternative and differential livelihood opportunities to demobilized persons while attending 
to the rights of victims. Post-conflict mechanisms are often criticized for benefiting the 
perpetrators only. For this reason, jobs provided to those persons demobilizing should be 
linked to restoring the rights of victims.  
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR-Colombia welcomed the report of the Centre of Historical Memory, 
entitled &#8220;&#161;Basta ya! Colombia, Memorias de Guerra y Dignidad&#8221;, as an important 
contribution to clarifying the root causes of the armed conflict and reconstructing the truth. 
Various other initiatives, such as the regional &#8220;Acuerdos por la Verdad&#8221;, and the centres for 
historical memory in Bogot&#225; and Medellin should be commended. Truth-telling in 
Colombia, however, is generally received with apathy, which hampers accountability and 
non-repetition. 
</p>
<p>24. Given the sheer number of victims, the State&#8217;s planned response is necessarily 
ambitious, especially in the area of reparations. OHCHR-Colombia acknowledges the 
efforts made in the two first years of implementation of the Victims&#8217; Law, particularly by 
the Victims and Land Restitution Units. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) Victims&#8217; rights 
</b>25. On the basis of its monitoring activities in 2013, OHCHR-Colombia submitted three 
reports to the Victims&#8217; Unit. They included summarized findings on the changes OHCHR 
had attempted to facilitate, results, and recommendations for action. In the reports, it 
examined individual and collective reparation processes, specific actions to provide redress 
for ethnic groups, and the space for the political participation of victims. OHCHR-
Colombia established a victims&#8217; follow-up mechanism to oversee implementation of the 
recommendations at the local and national levels, and to measure collaborative results. 
</p>
<p>26. OHCHR-Colombia identified the widespread inadequacy of resources as a limitation 
for municipalities to meet their responsibilities as first respondents to victims&#8217; claims. Of 
the municipalities with greater resources, Bogot&#225; and Medellin stand out as examples where 
victims are treated as rights-holders and their lives positively transformed. 
</p>
<p>27. Territorial plans of action on attention and comprehensive reparation for victims 
submitted by local to national authorities are vital to addressing challenges and 
coordinating assistance in implementing the Victims&#8217; Law. The majority of municipalities 
monitored, however, were not using this tool effectively to improve their capacity to 
respond to survivor&#8217;s claims. A greater effort is needed to create an understanding of and 
capacity to apply this tool, which will be essential for effective implementation, particularly 
in the poorest rural municipalities and regions still significantly affected by the armed 
conflict. 
</p>
<p>28. The High Commissioner welcomed the decision made by the Constitutional Court in 
2013 to instruct the Victims&#8217; Unit to register all victims of forced displacement regardless 
of the perpetrator. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(c) Land restitution 
</b>29. OHCHR-Colombia also submitted three reports based on its field monitoring to the 
Land Restitution Unit. In its reports, it examined the restitution process, the implementation </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>of collective measures for ethnic groups, and judicial land restitutions rulings and their 
impact. A joint follow-up mechanism was also created. 
30. OHCHR recognizes the significant effort made to date by the Land Restitution Unit, 
specialized judges and magistrates: 277 rulings were adopted between December 2011 and 
October 2013. A number of challenges to guaranteeing the rights of land restitution 
claimants remain. Among the most serious are the limited capacity to work in areas still 
affected by the internal armed conflict; threats against and the killing of land restitution 
claimants and activists; the lack of inter-institutional coordination in the planning and 
execution of return efforts; and the need for access to stable markets for sustainable 
livelihoods. 
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR-Colombia observed an increased number of killings, threats and attacks 
against claimants, social leaders and public officials involved in land restitution processes. 
For example, in the department of C&#243;rdoba, two prominent victims&#8217; leaders from Valencia 
were murdered in a 20-day period in March and April 2013, just prior to the President 
handing over land deeds to displaced persons in that department. The killings undermined 
public trust in land restitution and in the State&#8217;s ability to protect restitution claimants. 
</p>
<p>32. Adequate individual and collective protection measures and stronger State presence 
are required to guarantee return and non-repetition for families. In departments such as 
Bolivar, Cesar, C&#243;rdoba and Sucre, criminal interests constitute serious obstacles to 
restitution. There is therefore a need for the Attorney General&#180;s Office to redouble its 
efforts for prompt, effective investigations and prosecutions. The investigation and arrest of 
two well-known people associated with former paramilitary groups on the charge of land 
grabbing are an important step forward.  
</p>
<p>33. In 2013, the Governor of the department of Antioquia, the Mayor of Bogot&#225; and the 
Colombian Family Welfare Institute developed institutional food procurement programmes 
with small farmers, including land restitution beneficiaries, which contribute to income 
generation and sustainability. OHCHR supported these efforts and encouraged other 
governmental entities and the private sector to become involved. 
</p>
<p>34. OHCHR-Colombia noted additional challenges to land restitution processes. For 
instance, in the Montes de Maria region and the Cesar, North Santander and Putumayo 
departments, third parties occupying land to be restituted are often themselves peasants and 
victims. Extractive industries and large-scale development projects are present in areas 
where land restitution to ethnic groups is planned, which may result in social conflict and 
human rights violations. There is also a need to ensure that women can exercise land 
restitution claims as direct rights-holders. Rather than emphasizing quantitative results, land 
restitution processes should focus on the quality of results, transforming victims&#8217; lives by 
ensuring their ability to exercise their full range of rights in a sustainable manner. 
Sustainability will be assured by the successes enjoyed by victims. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(d) The voices of victims 
</b>35. It is essential that victims feel that their rights have been restored. In 2013, many 
expressed the need for their voices to be heard in the peace negotiations, especially on 
issues affecting their rights. In particular, indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples and 
women&#8217;s organizations expressed scepticism about the participation mechanisms for 
victims developed by the negotiating parties. OHCHR-Colombia has been working with the 
United Nations system and the High Commissioner for Peace of Colombia to develop a 
process to better integrate the perspectives of victims into the peace process. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Acknowledgement of present and past violations 
</b></p>
<p>36. Despite the peace negotiations, internal armed conflict-related violations persisted in 
2013. Military actions by the parties to the conflict continued to have deleterious 
consequences for the security and human rights of the civilian population.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Current human rights violations: FARC-EP and ELN 
</b>37. OHCHR-Colombia continued to remind FARC-EP and ELN of their obligations to 
respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Violations 
attributed to FARC-EP and ELN and their exercise of social control over the population in 
rural areas with little government presence were documented. OHCHR-Colombia 
registered many violations, inter alia, killings of protected persons, the recruitment and use 
of children, hostage-taking, the use of mines and other improvised explosive devices, 
indiscriminate attacks, forced displacement and individual and collective confinement. 
Attacks on civilian infrastructure affected the entire range of human rights. 
</p>
<p>38. Selective killings attributed to FARC-EP, particularly of indigenous leaders, 
continued in the department of Cauca. During the first semester of 2013 alone, OHCHR-
Colombia registered eight killings of members of the Nasa people, three of whom were 
leaders, in the north of the department. In addition, by November, the number of registered 
threats against indigenous leaders and authorities attributed to FARC-EP had risen to 190.  
</p>
<p>39. The Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office documented an increase in child recruitment. 
Facilitating the disengagement of children from armed groups and ensuring their 
reintegration with full respect for their rights must be a priority. 
</p>
<p>40. According to the Presidential Programme for Comprehensive Action against Anti-
Personnel Mines, by November 2013, there had been 285 mine incidents, resulting in 94 
male and 13 female civilians wounded, and 13 dead, including three women. A total of 147 
police and military members were injured and 18 killed. The most affected departments 
were Antioquia, Arauca, Bolivar, Caquet&#225;, Meta, Nari&#241;o and North Santander.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Past human rights violations: FARC-EP  
</b>41. During the peace negotiations, FARC-EP indicated that it could acknowledge 
responsibility for past human rights violations, for example, by declaring that the 
widespread use of kidnapping might have been a mistake. Further acknowledgements by 
FARC-EP and other armed groups, as well as actions to stop current violations, are needed. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(c) Current human rights violations: armed forces 
</b>42. Progress has been made in recent years in strengthening the human rights culture 
within the military. This progress can be attributed to the efforts made by soldiers, non-
commissioner officers, officers, politicians, victims, prosecutors and investigators, the 
judiciary, civil society and the international community. While often working from 
different perspectives, the result has been a reduction in the number and gravity of 
violations documented. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>annually. There is therefore a need to move from denial to recognition and response with 
regard to current and past violations.  
</p>
<p>44. Respect for the rights to life and integrity of the civilian population during military 
operations continues to be a cause for concern. OHCHR-Colombia observed situations of 
alleged arbitrary deprivations of life resulting from a lack of planning, of military 
discipline, and of command and control. For example, on 15 May 2013, in La Fonda, Pat&#237;a 
(department of Cauca), a 19-year old farmer died when members of the 29th Mobile 
Brigade shot him at a checkpoint, allegedly because he ignored a call to stop. In Caldono 
(department of Cauca), on 30 March, a 57-year old Nasa male from Kiwea Sat Tama 
reservation was shot dead by members of the 29th Mobile Brigade. In her previous report, 
the High Commissioner referred to similar cases.1 On 5 May, in Tierralta (department of 
C&#243;rdoba), a man traveling home by motorcycle died after being shot by members of the 
11th Battalion. On 4 June, in Puerto Claver, El Bagre (department of Antioquia), two 
hunters were shot by members of the army, one fatally. On 22 July, in Nuevo Horizonte, 
Fortul (department of Arauca), a 61-year old man was shot dead on his own property by a 
soldier. OHCHR-Colombia notes that criminal and disciplinary proceedings initiated in 
these cases remain at a preliminary stage. 
</p>
<p>45. OHCHR is concerned that, even if these cases were considered &#8220;military errors&#8221; or 
&#8220;unavoidable errors&#8221;, in practice, military commanders have not fully assumed the 
corresponding institutional responsibilities with regard to truth, justice, discipline, redress 
and non-repetition. Furthermore, a similar approach seems to have been taken in internal 
army investigations relating to the use of the firearms during the demonstrations held in 
2013. As the High Commissioner has previously reported,2 the concepts of &#8220;military error&#8221; 
and &#8220;unavoidable error&#8221; irrespective of the result of disciplinary or criminal investigations, 
do not preclude the State&#8217;s accountability for a violation of international humanitarian law 
and human rights law, and towards victims. 
</p>
<p>46. OHCHR-Colombia continued to receive information on illegal interrogations of 
child members of guerrilla groups in the department of Cauca. OHCHR-Colombia 
continued to receive complaints of the arbitrary detention of young males, including 
conscientious objectors, during irregular military recruitment procedures. If such 
allegations were to be proved, they would be a violation of Constitutional Court rulings, 
including a new decision made in July 2013, 
</p>
<p>47. In June 2013, OHCHR-Colombia submitted to the Ministry of Defence a report on 
32 recent cases that had been monitored, involving the use and occupation of schools and 
other civilian infrastructure by the military around the country. OHCHR-Colombia notes 
that the few investigations still open on these cases remain at the preliminary stage, while 
the majority has been closed without charges having been laid.  
48. In February 2013, OHCHR-Colombia submitted to the Minister of Defence and the 
General Commander of the Armed Forces a final report on a two-year joint project on the 
effectiveness of seven military prevention and control mechanisms in the field of human 
rights. In the report, OHCHR highlighted the continued relevance of existing mechanisms, 
while identifying shortcomings in their use. OHCHR-Colombia has received preliminary 
information regarding implementation of the recommendations, and trusts that it will 
continue working with the Ministry in this regard. 
</p>
<p>49. While the High Commissioner recognizes the progress made in certain areas, she 
remains concerned at the apparent reluctance of military authorities to address ongoing

<p>problems. In the context of the peace negotiations, it will be essential for the armed forces 
to acknowledge violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, including in 
the context of legitimate operations, and to take action to ensure institutional and individual 
accountability. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(d) Past human rights violations: armed forces 
</b>50. While the State generally takes ensuring the conformity of its laws with its 
international human rights obligations seriously, this was not the case of the constitutional 
reform to expand military criminal jurisdiction. In October, the Constitutional Court 
declared the reform unconstitutional for procedural reasons. The High Commissioner and 
11 special procedures mandate holders had indicated that the reform was inconsistent with 
decades of legal developments nationally and internationally. Reactions from some 
government officials to the Court ruling were sometimes disrespectful of the separation of 
powers. The Minister for Defence announced the Government&#8217;s decision to pursue new 
reform in 2014.  
</p>
<p>51. From January through August 2013 48 cases of homicides attributed to the army, 
characteristic of &#8220;false positives&#8221;, were transferred from ordinary to military jurisdiction, 
despite Government assurances that this would not occur. Numerous other cases were 
transferred directly by civilian prosecutors. It is worth noting that a magistrate of the 
Superior Council of the Judiciary, the organ competent to rule on civilian-military 
jurisdictional conflicts, was forced to resign when it was revealed that he had promised a 
military officer under criminal investigation for an alleged extrajudicial execution 
assistance in transferring his case to the military courts. 
</p>
<p>52. In December 2013, following the Court decision on military justice reform, 
Congress rushed through the adoption (supported by the Government) of a legal aid system 
for security service members facing criminal charges or international proceedings. 
OHCHR-Colombia has called continually for the free and impartial legal aid programme 
run by the Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office to be extended to all, including the military, to avoid 
risks under the approved system of subordinating the defence of individual soldiers to the 
interests of institutional or commanding officers. OHCHR continues to receive army 
members who fear coming forward or giving full testimony on cases of extrajudicial 
executions. The High Commissioner noted that, in October 2013, the Inter-American 
Human Rights Commission accorded precautionary measures to an active army member 
participating as a witness in cases of extrajudicial executions as a result of threats and 
harassment. 
</p>
<p>53. With regard to the responsibilities of the military for past violations, the High 
Commissioner regrets the impunity afforded by the continued granting of illegal privileges 
to military members detained or imprisoned in military facilities two years after the 
recommendations of a special inter-institutional report on this problem in Tolemaida.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Overview of the situation indirectly related to the conflict 
</b></p>
<p>54. Although the issues discussed in the present section have been compounded by the 
armed conflict, they will not be resolved automatically by peace. Nonetheless, an end to 
hostilities will create a unique opportunity to address these problems by redirecting 
resources and political capital, and reforming the counter-insurgency logic that permeates 
State institutions and society. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>2011, and by anchoring the concept as a foundation of the National Police. Much, however, 
remains to be done for the State as a whole to conceive security as a situation where people 
live free of the threat of violence and crime, and where institutions have the capacity to 
guarantee and protect rights. In post-conflict Colombia, the National Police must grow and 
be strengthened, while military involvement in citizen security activities should be 
minimized through regulation and oversight. Furthermore, arms control and private security 
oversight systems require reform.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Rights-holders 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Social movements and protests 
</b>56. Mass social protests enacted by a variety of social sectors were a feature of 2013. 
These demonstrations, and the reasonable manner (for the most part) in which they were 
conducted confirmed that there is political space for democratic protest in Colombia. The 
first demonstrations to be held, in February, were by coffee growers. In June, 
approximately 10,000 farmers from Catatumbo, one of the poorest regions in Colombia, 
blocked roads for 53 days. In July, protests flared in the mining sector. In August, the 
farming and agriculture sector declared a national strike, and was soon joined by transport, 
education, fisheries, health, indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples, and other sectors. 
Protesters mainly demanded a reorientation of the country&#8217;s development agenda, 
participation in public policy and decision-making, agrarian and rural reform and 
alternatives to growing coca and the forced destruction of coca plants.  
</p>
<p>57. In October 2013, a large number of indigenous peoples and organizations staged 
demonstrations to demand the implementation of their constitutional rights, in particular 
those associated with territorial autonomy. 
</p>
<p>58. In August, the first ever National Congress of Black, Afro-Colombian, Palenquero 
and Raizal peoples was held to draw attention to the need to fully implement Law No. 70 of 
1993 on the recognition and protection of the collective and ancestral land and cultural 
rights of Afro-Colombians. 
</p>
<p>59. In general, demonstrations were peaceful and respectful of the rights of others. In 
some cases, however, human rights violations by security forces, and excesses by protesters 
were committed. Good and bad practices could be found in the organization of and 
response to the protests.  
</p>
<p> (i) Good practices 
60. All the protests ended through negotiated agreements and processes aimed at 
addressing the claims of demonstrators. Importantly, the agreements reached with 
indigenous peoples were aimed at implementing their constitutional rights, which have yet 
to be fully respected. Confidence-building accords reached in Catatumbo represented a 
crucial first step to resolving long-standing issues. In these cases, follow-up mechanisms 
were or are being established. 
</p>
<p>61. State entities and social movements requested that OHCHR, in coordination with 
other United Nations entities, and in particular UNDP, serve as guarantor for many of the 
agreements reached. The role of OHCHR-Colombia varies, but relates principally to 
facilitating dialogue between demonstrators and the Government, and assisting them in 
reaching and implementing agreements. For example, in July, the Vice-President and 
farmers&#8217; organizations requested OHCHR-Colombia to witness their talks in Catatumbo at 
a time of tension, road blockage and clashes. Effective implementation of agreements is 
necessary for confidence-building, as well as for reducing gaps, marginalization and 
discrimination in the enjoyment of the full spectrum of human rights. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>62. In the context of the nationwide indigenous mobilization in October, interventions 
by the United Nations, including OHCHR, in building trust between parties was crucial to 
the resumption of dialogue between indigenous peoples and civilian, police and military 
authorities, which led to important agreements from a human rights perspective. Since 
November, OHCHR-Colombia and the United Nations Resident Coordinator have acted as 
guarantors of the agreement between the national indigenous organization of Colombia and 
the Government. 
</p>
<p> (ii) Bad practices 
63. In some cases, planning, management, command, control and communication before 
and during the demonstrations among the civilian authorities, the police and the military 
were inadequate, leading to excessive use of force and other human rights violations. In 
many cases, the departmental and municipal civilian authorities did not exercise their 
constitutional responsibilities by guaranteeing public order and human rights. On occasion, 
instructions from national authorities to end protests by force undermined the initiatives 
taken by local authorities and dialogue initiated by the police.  
</p>
<p>64. OHCHR-Colombia documented the shooting and death of nine protesters, five 
bystanders and one policeman (all male) during the demonstrations. In addition, a male 
motorcyclist died after hitting an obstacle placed in the road by protesters, and an injured 
man in an ambulance died when unable to reach a hospital. More than 400 people, 
including members of the security forces, were injured by rocks, tear gas, rubber bullets and 
firearms. Violence was also witnessed during house-to-house searches, as wall as the 
destruction of protesters&#8217; and bystanders&#8217; property. 
</p>
<p>65. The High Commissioner is concerned at the repeated public statements made by 
senior government officials during the protests according to which armed groups were 
behind events. It should be noted that an estimated 250,000 people participated in the June 
protests, and 837 were arrested, of which 54 were remanded into custody. Most charges 
related to violence and the destruction of property. No one was charged with crimes related 
to membership of an illegal armed group. OHCHR-Colombia emphasized repeatedly that 
the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly, association and expression are 
fundamental aspects of democracy, and called upon the Government to focus on responding 
to the political and social demands motivating the protests while individualizing criminal 
responsibilities, without making generalized public statements that risk causing 
stigmatization. 
</p>
<p>66. In September, during the protests, the Ministry of Defence proposed reforms to the 
criminal code to increase penalties against demonstrators. The High Commissioner reminds 
the Government that the organizers of peaceful protests should not be held liable for violent 
behaviour committed by others. Instead, the police have the duty to identify and remove 
violent individuals, and to allow protesters to exercise peacefully their rights. 
</p>
<p>67. The High Commissioner thanks authorities and demonstrators for their confidence 
during times of high tension, and recognizes the particularly effective partnership between 
OHCHR and the Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) Human rights defenders 
</b>68. OHCHR-Colombia works on three fronts to increase the space available to human 
rights defenders. Firstly, it supports their efforts and takes action when defenders are 
stigmatized. Statements were made in support of, inter alia, stigmatized indigenous, farmer 
and LGBTI defenders. Secondly, OHCHR-Colombia works with defenders who have been 
threatened or suffered assassination attempts, advocating with the National Protection Unit 
of the Ministry of the Interior for more timely and effective measures of protection. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p>Thirdly, OHCHR-Colombia works with the Office of the Attorney General to support 
investigations into threats and attacks against and the killing of defenders. 
</p>
<p>69. OHCHR-Colombia continued to document attacks, threats, illegal surveillance and 
theft of information targeting defenders. In most cases, these cases were attributed to post-
demobilization groups. 
</p>
<p>70. As at December, OHCHR-Colombia had confirmed 39 killings of defenders, 
including three women. Victims included land restitution claimants, rural community 
leaders, indigenous authorities and campaigners against mining and large-scale 
development projects. Some 36 defenders lived or worked in rural areas. Twelve received 
death threats before being killed, and at least 22 appeared to have been killed without a 
threat having been made beforehand. The information available indicates that two of those 
killed enjoyed measures of State protection. A third victim, a teacher, was awaiting 
relocation by the Ministry of Education as a measure of protection. Five other victims were 
associated with organizations that had already requested collective measures of protection. 
</p>
<p>71. According to the Foundation for Press Freedom (FLIP), in 2013, two journalists 
were killed, 58 received threats and three were forced into exile. Various journalists 
reported having been assaulted and/or prevented from carrying out their work by the 
security forces during the demonstrations. An attempt was made on the life of a journalist 
investigating ongoing illegal privileges in military prisons. 
</p>
<p>72. The number of defenders under the protection of the National Protection Unit 
dropped from approximately 3,500 in 2012 to 2,<footnote name="7">6. In October, the Supreme Court shelved a key investigation against a former 
intelligence director for alleged illegal interception inside Colombia of communications 
against numerous defenders, journalists, members of the political opposition and 
international human rights organizations on the grounds that the Office of the Attorney 
General had failed to comply with the legal time limits to prosecute the case. The ruling 
could have detrimental implications for other cases against senior government officials. 
</footnote>00 by October 2013. While the number of 
protected victims of the armed conflict, including land restitution claimants and activists 
and ethnic groups, rose, the number of protected trade unionists, journalists and non-
governmental organization activists decreased. 
</p>
<p>73. OHCHR-Colombia registered important delays in the implementation of protection 
measures by the National Protection Unit, thereby increasing the risk for defenders. These 
delays were mostly caused by lengthy bureaucratic procedures and insufficient and late 
budget allocations by the Ministry of Finance. OHCHR welcomes initiatives to increase 
differential and collective measures of protection, including the strengthening of the 
traditional &#8220;indigenous guards&#8221; mechanism. 
</p>
<p>74. Prevention and protection are closely related, and generate responsibilities for 
various authorities. Greater coordination between relevant State entities, especially at the 
local level, is needed to ensure an immediate response and long-term protection. OHCHR-
Colombia has initiated a project to improve defender protection coordination among these 
entities. 
</p>
<p>75. The success of the investigations conducted by the Office of the Attorney General of 
crimes against defenders remains insufficient. Very few investigations have actually led to 
the identification of the perpetrators, a situation that undermines prevention and protection. 
OHCHR-Colombia has knowledge of only one case of an alleged perpetrator being brought 
to trial in 2013, concerning the killing of an indigenous Jil leader in San Jos&#233; de Guaviare. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>advance investigations by generating context analysis and encouraging dialogue between 
different prosecutors. Progress has, however, been insufficient. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Duty-bearers 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Police 
</b>78. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the openness of the National Police to advice and 
cooperation on human rights issues, including the implementation of a joint project to 
evaluate internal control mechanisms. The principles set out by the new Director General in 
his inauguration speech &#8211; effectiveness, transparency, human rights and solidarity within a 
citizen security framework &#8211; are a sound basis for the future. In order to meet the demands 
of its constitutional responsibilities, with or without a peace agreement, it is necessary that 
the police intensify existing efforts to strengthen the institutional culture of human rights. 
</p>
<p>79. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the leadership demonstrated by the Director General 
in a statement delivered in June before the Senate in relation to the killing in 2011 of a 
young street artist and subsequent cover-up: &#8220;We do not agree, nor do we condone this 
action by a member of the police. We request that those who diverged from institutional 
principles face the law. Colombia must have the police force that it deserves.&#8221; OHCHR-
Colombia notes, however, that a general allegedly implicated in the case was subsequently 
promoted by the Senate. 
</p>
<p>80. Challenges for the National Police in respecting and guaranteeing the rights to life 
and physical integrity remain. Of particular and recurrent concern were the actions by the 
Mobile Anti-Riot Squad (ESMAD). OHCHR-Colombia identified deficiencies at the 
strategic, operational and tactical levels, and in the coordination efforts of municipal 
authorities; command and control problems before, during and after the use of force; 
tactical indiscipline; and failures to meet international standards for the use of firearms, 
which resulted in alleged human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>81. On 11 January, in Los Olivos, Soacha, a 17-year-old boy was shot in the head and 
killed by the police. On 7 April, in San Jos&#233;, Bosa, a 17-year-old boy was shot in the chest 
during a police operation. On 22 June, during a demonstration by farmers in Oca&#241;a, the 
police and the army shot several people at Aguas Claras Airport, two of whom 
subsequently died, when trying to protect an ESMAD member injured by protesters. 
Adequate planning and equipment, as well as tactical discipline, would have made options 
other than the lethal use of firearms available. During the same protest, on 25 June, two 
more people were killed in circumstances requiring clarification. 
</p>
<p>82. The National Police have requested the assistance of OHCHR-Colombia to continue 
to strengthen human rights and internal control capacity in 2014/15. This will include the 
issuance of a comprehensive regulation on the use of force and firearms that is compliant 
with international human rights standards. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) Justice system and criminal policy 
</b>83. While working with the Office of the Attorney General, OHCHR identified a 
number of challenges relating to criminal investigations, including the absence of case 
mapping; disjointed case distribution and assignment; the compartmentalization of 
individual cases; insufficient examination of command or criminal structures; limited 
physical reconstruction of crime scenes; unidentified victims; overburdened prosecutors 
and lack of investigators; insufficient prosecutor protection capacity; performance criteria 
based on procedural advances rather than prosecution results; prioritization by convenience; 
gaps in legal knowledge; inadequate knowledge of military structures and operations; and 
deference to military authority.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>84. OHCHR observed additional obstacles to the full realization of the right to justice, 
including lack of independence of a number of trial judges; intimidation, threats and attacks 
against victims, witnesses, investigators, prosecutors and judges; destruction of and 
tampering with evidence; the stigmatization of prosecutors investigating military personnel 
for serious crimes; lack of inter-institutional support for ongoing investigations (for 
example<i>,</i> in access to documents); time-wasting tactics by the defence of military personnel 
(for example<i>,</i> failure to appear at hearings, resignation and periodic substitution of counsel, 
and frivolous requests for continuance); and obstructive use of military justice as a shield 
against civil prosecution. 
</p>
<p>85. State criminal and penitentiary policy appears to prioritize punishment rather than 
prevention, rehabilitation and restoration. OHCHR-Colombia notes the recent approval of 
the Penitentiary Code, which should focus on rehabilitation, and reiterates that prison terms 
are not always the most effective means to achieve non-recidivism or to prevent crime. 
OHCHR-Colombia insists on the importance of adopting restorative justice measures, as 
defined by the Constitutional Court in various decisions. 
</p>
<p>86. The High Commissioner is concerned about the implications of overcrowded prisons 
for the life and dignity of detainees and their families. National overcrowding rates are have 
reached 56.5 per cent, and rise to 88 per cent in some prisons outside Bogot&#225;.  
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(c) Corporate actors 
</b>87. OHCHR-Colombia has begun to work on business and human rights following the 
endorsement by the Human Rights Council&#8217;s, in its resolution 17/4, of the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights as a means to implement the United Nations 
&#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; framework. OHCHR-Colombia works in a number of its 
prioritized communities where businesses have undermined human rights and do not 
acknowledge their obligations; recognized the need to conform to human rights standards; 
or identified human rights respect as an opportunity to improve their operations and the 
communities and societies in which they work. In all three scenarios, OHCHR-Colombia 
helps build bridges between communities, the State and business to measurably improve the 
situation of human rights. 
</p>
<p>88. In a report issued in 2013, the Comptroller General outlined the damaging social and 
environmental consequences of mining activities and their negative impact on the rights of 
indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples, as well as of farmers. The Rural Development 
Institute documented that businesses had illegally obtained more than 600,000 hectares of 
land. 
</p>
<p>89. OHCHR-Colombia recognizes the importance of initiatives, such as the Comit&#233; 
Minero Energ&#233;tico, Gu&#237;as Colombia and the partnership with the Global Compact, and will 
continue to support these efforts to promote business compliance with the Guiding 
Principles on Business and Human Rights. OHCHR commends the organization of the first 
Latin American and Caribbean Regional Forum on Business and Human Rights, held in 
August 2013. 
</p>
<p>90. The High Commissioner reiterates the view that the private sector has an essential 
role to play in fostering successful peace and human rights consolidation processes. She 
commends the launching of the &#8220;Business for Peace&#8221; initiative, aimed at promoting private 
sector commitment in post-conflict situations.  </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Other human rights challenges 
</b></p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(a) Post-demobilization groups 
</b>91. Disputes, violence and social control by post-demobilization groups and criminal 
organizations continue to affect the full range of human rights of the population, and 
particularly those of human rights defenders, community leaders, civil servants, police 
officers and land restitution claimants. In the department of Antioquia, OHCHR-Colombia 
registered 14 massacres attributable to these groups. In Buenaventura (department of Valle 
del Cauca), eight cases of dismemberment of persons were registered, and three in 
Barranquilla. Poverty, social exclusion, insecurity and lack of opportunities continue to 
make young people and children vulnerable to recruitment, use, exploitation and sexual 
violence by these groups.  
</p>
<p>92. The High Commissioner commends the considerable efforts made by the authorities 
to dismantle post-demobilization groups. However, the gravity of the problem and the 
likelihood that a peace agreement would unleash further violence by and among these 
groups requires a stronger comprehensive approach combining security and justice with 
actions to fight poverty and social exclusion at all levels. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(b) Discrimination 
</b>93. OHCHR-Colombia continues to document cases of discrimination on the basis of 
ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, medical condition, age and political 
opinion. 
</p>
<p>94. In 2013, public officials in various parts of the country made discriminatory 
statements about Afro-Colombians, women and LGBTI persons. As at November, police 
had registered 52 killings of LGBTI persons, compared with 41 in 2012. 
</p>
<p><i> <b></b></i><b>(c) Economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p> (i) Prior consultation and consent 
95. During mass demonstrations in 2013, indigenous and Afro-Colombian protesters 
frequently demanded information on the number of concessions granted for natural 
resource exploitation on their lands, and whether prior consultation and consent 
requirements had been followed in accordance with international standards. Demonstrators 
demanded that concessions granted without proper procedures be cancelled. 
Representatives of indigenous peoples and the Government agreed to establish an ad hoc 
commission to address this matter. 
</p>
<p>96. In 2013, OHCHR-Colombia supported the efforts of the Ministry of the Interior to 
better respect and protect the rights of indigenous and Afro-Colombian peoples. As an 
important step forward, the Ministry recognized the need to adopt prior consultation 
protocols with each people. However, personnel changes in the Ministry have made it 
difficult to properly see through these efforts. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/25/19/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>departments of Antioquia, Cauca, Choc&#243;, Guaviare, Nari&#241;o and Valle del Cauca. In 
February, the Constitutional Court ordered the implementation of protection measures 
specifically designed for 12 Afro-Colombian communities threatened by large-scale 
development projects in the department of Nari&#241;o.  
</p>
<p> (ii) Progressive realization 
99. Despite efforts to reduce poverty and inequality, there is an insufficient 
acknowledgement of the need for radical structural change and innovation to address the 
very different realities of Colombians. In some municipalities, poverty rates continue to be 
up to four times as high as in certain cities, reflecting the lack of enjoyment of the full 
spectrum of human rights. Too many rural areas continue to have little or no access to State 
institutions and services beyond the military.  
</p>
<p>100. In 2013, OHCHR-Colombia discussed with the Administrative Department of Social 
Prosperity how Colombia could better comply with its international obligations to satisfy 
economic, social and cultural rights in the fight against poverty and, on the basis of its field 
monitoring, provided the Department with a report on how to reorient institutional efforts in 
this regard. The Government has demonstrated its readiness to apply a human rights-based 
approach to poverty reduction. 
</p>
<p>101. According to a multidimensional poverty index used by National Department of 
Statistics, in 2013 the percentage of rural homes without access to drinking water was 15 
times higher than in urban areas; the illiteracy rate, three times higher; and the school 
truancy rate was 2.6 times higher. In the department of Choc&#243;, where Afro-Colombians 
represent 82.1 per cent and indigenous peoples 12.7 per cent poverty affects 68 per cent of 
the population.  
</p>
<p>102. Many obstacles remain before the full realization of the right to education. For 
example, in the south of the department of Bolivar, the beginning of the academic year was 
delayed for at least four months because teachers had not been hired on time. OHCHR-
Colombia found similar problems in Tierralta (department of C&#243;rdoba), where, in April, 
8,219 children were still unable to attend school.  
</p>
<p>103. The Ombudsperson&#8217;s Office identified a number of barriers to access to health-care 
services and medicines. In particular, it found that patients, including people living with 
HIV/AIDS, had to resort to petitions to the Constitutional Court to obtain services and 
medicines that should have been available under the Mandatory Health Plan. A total of 
420,000 such health-related petitions were registered in 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> In the light of the findings made by OHCHR-Colombia, the High 
Commissioner:</b> 
</p>
<p> <b>(a) Congratulates the Government of Colombia on its determined pursuit of 
a negotiated end to the internal armed conflict and its ongoing efforts to meet its 
international human rights obligations; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Acknowledges the Government&#8217;s efforts to implement her previous 
recommendations and those of the entire international human rights system, and 
urges it to continue and to strengthen them; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Reminds all parties to the armed conflict that transitional justice 
measures can only be an effective tool if the institutions and individuals involved </b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b>demonstrate a meaningful commitment to truth, the restoration of victims&#8217; rights and 
reconciliation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Requests, in this regard and as an act of commitment to the Colombian 
people and to peace, FARC-EP and ELN to deliver comprehensive, specific 
information with regard to civilians and police and military personnel who have 
disappeared or are in their power, and on the location of mines and other improvised 
explosive devices. FARC-EP and ELN should immediately cease recruiting and using 
children and collaborate with the Government to create and implement a plan of 
action to effectively disengage children in their ranks; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Urges the Government to implement a transparent and public 
monitoring and reporting mechanism with third-party oversight to ensure that the 
agreements reached after public protests are fully implemented; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Encourages the Government to create a mechanism comprising both 
governmental and civil society actors to identify good and bad practices during social 
protests, and to make recommendations for local, departmental and national 
authorities to improve their capacity to respond to demonstrations in conformity with

</b></p>
<p><b> (g) Calls upon the Government to create protocols defining the procedures
