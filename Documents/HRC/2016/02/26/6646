</p>
<p>already exist, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>that regional arrangements play an important role in promoting

<p>contained in international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> progress made by Governments in the establishment of

</p>
<p> 2. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to 
</p>
<p>convene in 2008 a workshop for an exchange of views on good practices, added value </p>

<p>and challenges for such regional arrangements, with the participation of 
</p>
<p>representatives of the relevant regional and subregional arrangements from different 
</p>
<p>regions, experts as well as all interested United Nations Member States, observers, 
</p>
<p>national human rights institutions and representatives of non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, based on arrangements, including Economic and Social Council 
</p>

</p>
<p>Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to present to the
