<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At its June 2008 session, the Human Rights Council was unanimous in welcoming the 
&#8220;protect, respect and remedy&#8221; policy framework proposed by the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business 
enterprises.<b>1</b> This marked the first time the Council or its predecessor had taken a substantive 
policy position on business and human rights. By its resolution 8/7, the Council also extended 
the Special Representative&#8217;s mandate for another three years, tasking him with 
&#8220;operationalizing&#8221; the framework - providing &#8220;practical recommendations&#8221; and &#8220;concrete 
guidance&#8221; to States, businesses and other social actors on its implementation. 
</p>
<p>2. The framework rests on three pillars: the State duty to protect against human rights abuses 
by third parties, including business, through appropriate policies, regulation, and adjudication; 
the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, which in essence means to act with due 
diligence to avoid infringing on the rights of others; and greater access by victims to effective 
remedy, judicial and non-judicial.<b>2</b> The three pillars are complementary in that each supports the 
others. 
</p>
<p>3. The new mandate is intended to translate the framework into practical guiding principles. 
Even prior to further operationalization, it has enjoyed considerable uptake. For example, the 
announcement of Canada&#8217;s export credit agency&#8217;s new &#8220;Statement on Human Rights&#8221; referenced 
the framework and said the agency would monitor the Special Representative&#8217;s work to &#8220;guide 
its approach to assessing human rights&#8221;.<b>3</b> The United Kingdom&#8217;s National Contact Point (NCP) 
for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises found against a company for failing to 
exercise adequate human rights &#8220;due diligence&#8221; - using the term as defined in the Special 
Representative&#8217;s report to the Council in 2008 (A/HRC/8/5) - and drew the company&#8217;s attention 
to that report in recommending how to implement an effective corporate responsibility policy.<b>4</b> 
An Australian parliamentary motion took note of the framework and called on the Government 
to &#8220;encourage Australian companies to respect the rights of members of the communities in

</b>  The State duty to protect is well-established, with a firm basis in international human rights

debate.

<p>which they operate and to develop rights-compliant grievance mechanisms, whether acting in 
Australia or overseas&#8221;.<b>5</b> The Norwegian Government&#8217;s 2009 Corporate Social Responsibility 
White Paper discusses the framework extensively.<b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>4. Leading business entities have endorsed the framework. In a joint statement, the 
International Organization of Employers (IOE), the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) 
and the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC) to the OECD said that the 
framework provides &#8220;a clear, practical and objective way of approaching a very complex set of 
issues&#8221;.<b>7</b> It was welcomed by the International Council of Mining and Metals and the Business 
Leaders Initiative on Human Rights.<b>8</b> Forty socially responsible investment funds wrote to the 
Council, saying that the framework helped them by promoting greater disclosure of corporate 
human rights impacts, and appropriate steps to mitigate them.<b>9</b> The oil company, ExxonMobil, in 
a public commemoration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, cited the framework&#8217;s corporate responsibility to respect principle as a benchmark for its 
own employees.<b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>5. A joint civil society statement to the Council in May 2008 noted the framework&#8217;s value, 
and several signatories have invoked it in subsequent advocacy work.<b>11</b> Amnesty International 
said the framework &#8220;has the potential to make an important contribution to the protection of 
human rights&#8221;.<b>12</b> The Special Representative was pleased by the positive feedback from 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) at a multi-stakeholder consultation in New Delhi in 
February 2009, and a NGO briefing in New York in March 2009. Finally, his work is featured 
prominently in academic writings and the media.

operationalizing the framework, and it addresses a number of issues related to it that have

<p>emerged from ongoing consultations. But before proceeding, brief reflections are in order 
concerning today&#8217;s very difficult economic climate, and how it might affect business and 
human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  THE ECONOMIC CRISIS 
</b></p>
<p>7. From his first report to the Commission on Human Rights in 2006 onwards, the Special 
Representative has maintained that the widening gaps between the scope and impact of economic 
forces and actors, and the capacity of societies to manage their adverse consequences, were 
unsustainable.<b>13</b> &#8220;There is no magic in the marketplace&#8221;, he began his 2007 report.<b>14</b> Markets can 
be highly efficient means for allocating scarce resources, and powerful forces for promoting 
social objectives ranging from poverty alleviation to the rule of law. But for markets to work 
optimally they must have adequate institutional underpinnings and be embedded in the broader 
values of social community. All along he has stressed that these governance gaps &#8220;create the 
permissive environment within which blameworthy acts by corporations may occur without 
adequate sanctioning or reparation&#8221;.<b>15</b> He employed this framing to explain the state of business 
and human rights. We now know it holds for the world political economy as a whole. 
</p>
<p>8. Today, policymakers everywhere are focused on putting out the fires in the global financial 
system and containing their consequences for the real economy. According to an Asian 
Development Bank report, the worldwide loss of wealth this year may total US$ 50 trillion, or 
one year&#8217;s worth of GDP.<b>16</b> A World Bank report projects global GDP in 2009 to decline for the 
first time since World War II, and the drop in world trade to be the steepest in 80 years.<b>17</b> Even 
countries that were relatively insulated from the original financial sector meltdown, including the 
majority of developing countries, are hard hit by its effects: weak demand for their exports, 
collapsing commodity prices, lack of trade finance, severe credit squeezes, deep declines in 
foreign direct investment, and a sharp deceleration in workers&#8217; remittances. The ILO estimates 
that the number of persons officially unemployed could rise above 230 million in 2009, 
from 193 million last year.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>9. In major downturns, those who are already vulnerable - individuals and countries - are 
often the most severely affected. Global and national efforts are needed to limit the damage and

 <p> 
</p>
<p>restore economic momentum. Governments must avoid erecting protectionist barriers or 
lowering human rights standards for businesses; their short-run gains are illusory and they 
undermine longer term recovery. For companies, even downsizing and plant closings must be 
conducted responsibly, and restoring public trust and confidence in business is as much of an 
immediate challenge as reinventing viable business models. 
</p>
<p>10. However painful the near-term may be, going forward elements of the business and human 
rights agenda should become more closely aligned with the world&#8217;s overall economic policy 
agenda than in recent decades. Governments once championing neo-liberal economic doctrines 
have been reminded starkly that they have duties no other social actor can fulfil, resulting in a 
recalibration of the balance between market and State. For other countries, the need to deepen 
their domestic markets will require greater attention to social investments and safety nets, 
thereby fostering their citizens&#8217; fuller realization of certain economic and social rights. 
Companies have had to acknowledge that business as usual is not good enough for anybody, 
including business itself, and that they must better integrate societal concerns into their 
long-term strategic goals. Society as a whole cries out for remedy where wrong has been done. 
The terms transparency and accountability resonate more widely than before. And calls for 
fairness are more insistent. Because the business and human rights agenda is tightly connected to 
these shifts, it both contributes to and gains from a successful transition toward a more inclusive 
and sustainable model of economic growth. 
</p>
<p>11. It is often mused that in every crisis there are opportunities. In operationalizing the 
&#8220;protect, respect and remedy&#8221; framework, the Special Representative aims to identify such 
opportunities in the business and human rights domain and demonstrate how they can be grasped 
and acted upon. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE STATE DUTY TO PROTECT 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Council asked the Special Representative to provide views and recommendations on 
strengthening the fulfilment of the State duty to protect against corporate-related human rights 
abuse, including through international cooperation. This section summarizes this duty&#8217;s content 
and elaborates upon several business-related policy areas highly relevant to States fulfilling their 
duty.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>13. The State duty to protect against third party abuse is grounded in international human 
rights law. The specific language employed in the main United Nations human rights treaties 
varies, but all include two sets of obligations. First, the treaties commit States parties to refrain 
from violating the enumerated rights of persons within their territory and/or jurisdiction. Second, 
the treaties require States to &#8220;ensure&#8221; (or some functionally equivalent verb) the enjoyment or 
realization of those rights by rights holders.<b>20</b> In turn, ensuring that rights holders enjoy their 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>19
</b>  Access to remedy is discussed in section IV. 
</p>
<p><b>20
</b>  For example, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of the Child use &#8220;respect and ensure&#8221;, with &#8220;respect&#8221; in the State context, meaning 
that the State must refrain from violating the rights. The Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities requires States parties to &#8220;ensure and promote&#8221;, and to take appropriate 
 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>rights requires protection by States against other social actors, including business, who impede or 
negate those rights. Guidance from international human rights bodies suggests that the State duty 
to protect applies to all recognized rights that private parties are capable of impairing, and to all 
types of business enterprises.<b>21</b> 
</p>
<p>14. The State duty to protect is a standard of conduct, and not a standard of result. That is, 
States are not held responsible for corporate-related human rights abuse per se, but may be 
considered in breach of their obligations where they fail to take appropriate steps to prevent it 
and to investigate, punish and redress it when it occurs.<b>22</b> Within these parameters, States have 
discretion as to how to fulfil their duty. The main human rights treaties generally contemplate 
legislative, administrative and judicial measures.<b> </b>The treaty bodies have recommended to States 
such measures as adopting anti-discrimination legislation governing employment practices; 
consulting with communities before approving mining and logging projects; monitoring and 
addressing the human rights impacts of such projects; and encouraging businesses to develop 
codes of conduct that include human rights. 
</p>
<p>15. The extraterritorial dimension of the duty to protect remains unsettled in international law. 
Current guidance from international human rights bodies suggests that States are not required to 
regulate the extraterritorial activities of businesses incorporated in their jurisdiction, nor are they 
generally prohibited from doing so provided there is a recognized jurisdictional basis, and that an 
overall test of reasonableness is met. Within those parameters, some treaty bodies encourage 
home States to take steps to prevent abuse abroad by corporations within their jurisdiction.<b>23</b> 
16. There are also strong policy reasons for home States to encourage their companies to 
respect rights abroad, especially if a State itself is involved in the business venture - whether as 
owner, investor, insurer, procurer, or simply promoter. Such encouragement gets home States out 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>measures to &#8220;eliminate&#8221; abuse by private &#8220;enterprises&#8221;. The International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination requires that States parties &#8220;shall prohibit and 
bring to an end &#8230; racial discrimination by any persons, group or organization&#8221;. The Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women requires States parties &#8220;to 
take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women by any person, 
organization or enterprise&#8221;. In the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights, States parties undertake &#8220;to take steps &#8230; achieving progressively the full realization of 
rights&#8221;, while its rights-specific provisions, such as those dealing with labour, refer to States 
&#8220;ensuring&#8221; those rights.  
<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  See A/HRC/8/5/Add.1 for a summary of the Special Representative&#8217;s research on the 
United Nations human rights treaties and treaty body commentaries.  
<b>22
</b></p>
<p>  Corporate acts may be directly attributed to States in some circumstances, for example where 
a State exercises such close control that the company is its mere agent.  
<b>23

<p>  E.g. CERD/C/USA/CO/6 (2008), para. 30; CESCR general comment 19 (2008), para. 54. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of the untenable position of being associated with possible overseas corporate abuse. And it can 
provide much-needed support to host States that lack the capacity to implement fully an effective 
regulatory environment on their own. 
</p>
<p>17. States have long been aware of the range of measures required of them in relation to abuse 
by State agents. Moreover, most States have adopted measures and established institutions in 
certain core areas of business and human rights, such as labour standards and workplace 
non-discrimination. But beyond that, the business and human rights domain exhibits 
considerable legal and policy incoherence, as discussed in the Special Representative&#8217;s 2008 
report. 
</p>
<p>18. There is &#8220;vertical&#8221; incoherence, where Governments sign on to human rights obligations 
but then fail to adopt policies, laws, and processes to implement them. Even more widespread is 
&#8220;horizontal&#8221; incoherence, where economic or business-focused departments and agencies that 
directly shape business practices - including trade, investment, export credit and insurance, 
corporate law, and securities regulation - conduct their work in isolation from and largely 
uninformed by their Government&#8217;s human rights agencies and obligations. 
</p>
<p>19. Domestic policy incoherence is reproduced at the international level. This results in 
ambiguous and mixed messages to business from Governments and international organizations. 
</p>
<p>20. Recent legal and policy developments begin to address some of the challenges. In previous 
reports, the Special Representative noted four significant legal developments: the growing 
international harmonization of standards for international crimes that apply to corporations under 
domestic law, largely as a by-product of converging standards applicable to individuals; an 
emerging standard of corporate complicity in human rights abuses; the consideration by some 
States of &#8220;corporate culture&#8221; in deciding criminal responsibility or punishment; and an increase 
in civil cases brought against parent companies for their acts and omissions in relation to harm 
involving their foreign subsidiaries.<b>24</b> 
</p>
<p>21. In the policy realm, a growing number of States are adopting corporate social 
responsibility (CSR) policies.<b>25</b> They vary in content and form, but generally encourage 
responsible business practices, including fostering business understanding of and respect for 
human rights. In some cases, access to official assistance, such as export credit or investment 
insurance, may be linked to companies having a CSR policy, participating in the United Nations 
Global Compact, or confirming their awareness of the OECD Guidelines. 
</p>
<p>22. The Special Representative considers it important for all stakeholders, including 
Governments, to learn more about these policy developments and how they may contribute to 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>24
</b>  A/HRC/4/35, paras. 19-32; A/HRC/8/5, paras. 31 and 90; A/HRC/8/16. 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  Many OECD countries have such policies. Elements can also be found in Brazil, China, 
</p>
<p>Indonesia and elsewhere. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>greater policy coherence in business and human rights. Therefore, he is surveying 
Member States. He is grateful to OHCHR for facilitating the survey, and urges all Governments 
to respond.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Representative is also exploring several other policy domains closely related 
to the State duty to protect - corporate law, investment and trade agreements, and international 
cooperation, particularly with respect to conflict affected areas. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Corporate law 
</b></p>
<p>24. Corporate law directly shapes what companies do and how they do it. Yet its implications 
for human rights remain poorly understood. Traditionally, the two have been viewed as distinct 
legal and policy spheres, populated by different communities of practice. That trend is beginning 
to change as Governments and courts introduce more public interest considerations into the 
equation. A few examples illustrate the trend.  
</p>
<p>25. Recently adopted Danish legislation requires larger companies to report on their 
CSR programme, or report that they lack one.<b>26</b> The recently revised Companies Act in the 
United Kingdom requires directors to &#8220;have regard&#8221; to such matters as &#8220;the impact of the 
company&#8217;s operations on the community and the environment&#8221; as part of their duties towards the 
company.<b>27</b> The United Kingdom Government recently confirmed that pension fund trustees are 
not prohibited from considering social, environmental and ethical issues in their investment 
decisions, provided they act in the fund&#8217;s best interests.<b>28</b> The recent South African 
Companies Act allows the Government to prescribe social and ethics committees for certain 
companies.<b>29</b> A draft companies bill in India includes a provision requiring publicly listed 
companies above a certain size to have a board-level &#8220;stakeholder relations committee&#8221; to 
&#8220;consider and resolve the grievances of stakeholders&#8221;.<b>30</b> 
</p>
<p>26. In the United States, Federal statutes require publicly listed companies to have robust 
programmes to assess, manage and report on material risks. None refers to human rights 
explicitly, but material risks clearly do encompass human rights issues: since the path-breaking 
<i>Doe v. Unocal</i> litigation in 1997, more than 50 cases have been brought against companies under 
the Alien Tort Statute alleging corporate involvement in human rights abuse abroad. 
Reputational damage and operational disruptions pose additional risks.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>27. To provide greater clarity about what is currently expected of companies under corporate 
law as it relates to human rights, the Special Representative is pleased that 19 leading law firms 
from around the world have volunteered to survey corporate law provisions in over 
40 jurisdictions.<b>31</b> The firms will document how the consideration of human rights by companies 
and their officers are addressed, explicitly or by implication, in laws and guidelines relating to 
incorporation, directors&#8217; duties, reporting, stakeholder engagement, and corporate governance 
generally. They will also report on how corporate regulators and courts apply these laws and 
guidelines, and whether legal or policy reform is being considered. The results will be published, 
and the Special Representative then will consult widely on what recommendations he might 
make to States. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Investment and trade agreements 
</b></p>
<p>28. Despite the current downturn, investment and trade will resume as engines of economic 
growth, and sustainable growth remains the necessary condition for economic and social 
development. The challenge in the short run is to avoid tit-for-tat escalation of protectionism - 
which deepened and lengthened the Great Depression, ultimately giving rise to some of the worst 
horrors of the twentieth century. 
</p>
<p>29. History has also witnessed successive waves of States arbitrarily expropriating foreign 
investments, and in prior eras, the &#8220;gunboat diplomacy&#8221; that was sometimes triggered in 
response. The modern investment regime is based on international investment treaties and 
contracts, often coupled with binding investor-State arbitration, all of which increased 
exponentially in the 1990s. 
</p>
<p>30. Nevertheless, recent experience suggests that some treaty guarantees and contract 
provisions may unduly constrain the host Government&#8217;s ability to achieve its legitimate policy 
objectives, including its international human rights obligations. That is because under threat of 
binding international arbitration, a foreign investor may be able to insulate its business venture 
from new laws and regulations, or seek compensation from the Government for the cost of 
compliance.<b>32</b> 
</p>
<p>31. A Norwegian draft model agreement and commentary address such concerns about 
bilateral investment treaties. The commentary notes that these treaties pose potential risks to 
Norway&#8217;s own highly developed system of regulations and protection, including environmental 
and social policies. It also stresses the vulnerability of developing countries to agreements &#8220;that 
tie up political freedom of action and the exercise of authority ... &#8221;.<b>33</b> The draft model agreement

</p>
<p>strives to &#8220;ensure that the State&#8217;s right to make legitimate regulations of the actions of investors 
is not restricted by an investment agreement. However, the right to regulate must be balanced 
against the investors&#8217; wish for predictability, legal safeguards, minimum requirements regarding 
the actions of the State and compensation in the event of expropriation&#8221;.<b>34</b> 
</p>
<p>32. Investors often enhance the protection available under bilateral investment treaties with 
&#8220;stabilization&#8221; provisions in confidential contracts with host Governments called &#8220;host 
Government agreements&#8221;. The Special Representative, in collaboration with the International 
Finance Corporation, analysed stabilization provisions in nearly 90 recent host Government 
agreements.<b>35</b> Among the key findings are: none of the host Government agreements with OECD 
countries offered investors exemptions from new laws and, with minor exceptions, they tailored 
stabilization clauses to preserve public interest considerations; a majority of the host 
Government agreements with non-OECD countries did have provisions to insulate investors 
from compliance with new environmental and social laws or facilitated compensation for 
compliance; the most sweeping stabilization provisions were found in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
where 7 of the 11 host Government agreements specified exemptions from or compensation for 
the effect of all new laws for the duration of the project, irrespective of their relevance to 
protecting human rights or any other public interest. 
</p>
<p>33. This research was discussed with experts in London, Johannesburg, and Marrakesh. 
Seasoned project lawyers from major international law firms expressed surprise that some of 
their peers were still employing the more extreme stabilization provisions and that Governments 
were willing to sign them, while several developing country negotiators were unaware of 
alternatives. 
</p>
<p>34. When an investor brings a claim regarding a bilateral investment treaty or host 
Government agreement to binding international arbitration, depending on the rules incorporated 
into the agreements, little or nothing about the case may be made public. This is at variance with 
precepts of transparency and good governance. While confidential business information must be 
protected, under some rules not even the existence of a case against a country is known to its 
public, let alone its substance. This impedes more responsible contracting by companies and 
Governments, and contributes to inconsistent rulings by arbitrators, undermining the system&#8217;s 
predictability and legitimacy. 
</p>
<p>35. Accordingly, the Special Representative was pleased that the United Nations Commission 
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), one of the sources of arbitration rules, invited his 
views at its forty-first session in 2008. He is encouraged by the Commission&#8217;s conclusion that 
transparency is a desirable objective in investor-State arbitration and its decision to address this 
as a matter of priority.<b>36</b>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>36. As a next step, the Special Representative is exploring the feasibility of developing 
guidance on &#8220;responsible contracting&#8221; for host Government agreements in relation to human 
rights. As in the aforementioned Norwegian commentary concerning bilateral investment 
treaties, such guidance would have to satisfy two equally important objectives, safeguarding the 
host State&#8217;s ability to discharge its obligations, including those under international human rights 
law, and giving investors confidence that the host State will not act in a discriminatory or 
arbitrary manner or for non-bona fide purposes. 
</p>
<p>37. The Special Representative has not yet undertaken corresponding projects on trade. But he 
continues to consult experts extensively on whether and how the trade regime may constrain or 
facilitate the State duty to protect.<b>37</b> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>38. The Human Rights Council asked the Special Representative to provide recommendations 
regarding &#8220;international cooperation&#8221; in relation to the State duty to protect. As he understands 
the term in the business and human rights context, this involves States working together through 
awareness-raising, capacity-building and joint problem-solving. Several factors currently limit 
the achievement of these aims. 
</p>
<p>39. First, States are not using existing forums as effectively as they could to enhance peer 
learning with respect to the State duty to protect in the business context. These forums include 
the treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Universal Periodic Review, National Contact 
Points under the OECD Guidelines, and regional human rights mechanisms. No serious 
intergovernmental dialogue on these issues is evident in international trade and financial 
institutions, with the exception of the IFC and OECD, in part reflecting the involvement of 
private sector actors. 
</p>
<p>40. The Special Representative continues his outreach efforts within and beyond the 
United Nations human rights mechanisms - to date, the treaty bodies and special procedures, 
regional human rights entities, national human rights commissions, the World Bank, 
UNCITRAL, OECD, the European Commission and Parliament, and national Governments. He 
welcomes additional opportunities. 
</p>
<p>41. Beyond dialogue and learning lies State capacity-building. But business and human rights 
is not high on the capacity-building agenda of most international and bilateral agencies. The ILO 
is a notable exception regarding labour rights, and some bilateral development agencies support 
CSR programmes in developing countries. OHCHR only within the past year has begun to 
consider including business and human rights in its capacity-building work at the country level, 
but this is not yet a priority. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>37
</b>  The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, for example, has expressed 
</p>
<p>concern about the potential adverse impact of trade agreements on Covenant obligations 
(C.12/CRI/CO/4/CRP.1, para. 42). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>42. The adverse consequences of this scarcity of support are demonstrated in the earlier 
example of developing country investment negotiators signing contracts that adversely affect 
their States&#8217; duty to protect, at least in part because of capacity shortfalls that also extend to other 
policy domains. 
</p>
<p>43. Finally, international cooperation involves joint problem-solving by States. Nowhere is this 
more desperately needed than in conflict situations. The current international human rights 
regime cannot possibly be expected to function as intended where societies are torn apart by civil 
war or other major strife. It is therefore unsurprising that the most egregious corporate-related 
human rights abuses typically occur amidst conflict. The Special Representative has found that 
all stakeholders want greater guidance on how to prevent corporate-related abuse in conflict 
affected areas. Therefore, he is exploring the possibility of working with an informal group of 
home and host States to generate ideas about effective approaches and tools States could employ 
to help achieve that end. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Summing up 
</b></p>
<p>44. Governments are the most appropriate entities to make the difficult decisions required to 
reconcile different societal needs. Yet, as the Special Representative noted in his 2008 report, 
most Governments take a relatively narrow approach to managing the business and human rights 
agenda. Human rights concerns remain poorly integrated into other policy domains that directly 
shape business practices. Therefore, a major objective of the Special Representative&#8217;s renewed 
mandate is to assist Governments in recognizing those connections and advancing the business 
and human rights agenda beyond its currently narrow confines. 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  THE CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPECT 
</b></p>
<p>45. In paragraph 4 (b) of resolution 8/7, the Human Rights Council asked the Special 
Representative &#8220;to elaborate further on the scope and content of the corporate responsibility to 
respect all human rights and to provide concrete guidance to business and other stakeholders&#8221;. 
This section summarizes the responsibility to respect and addresses several issues requiring 
further elaboration. 
</p>
<p>46. Companies know they must comply with all applicable laws to obtain and sustain their 
legal licence to operate. However, over time companies have found that legal compliance alone 
may not ensure their social licence to operate, particularly where the law is weak. The social 
licence to operate is based in prevailing social norms that can be as important to the success of a 
business as legal norms. Of course, social norms may vary by region and industry. But one of 
them has acquired near-universal recognition by all stakeholders, namely the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights, or, put simply, to not infringe on the rights of others. 
</p>
<p>47. By near-universal is meant two things. First, the corporate responsibility to respect is 
acknowledged by virtually every company and industry CSR initiative, endorsed by the world&#8217;s 
largest business associations, affirmed in the Global Compact and its worldwide national 
networks, and enshrined in such soft law instruments as the ILO Tripartite Declaration and the 
OECD Guidelines. Second, violations of this social norm are routinely brought to public 
attention globally through mobilized local communities, networks of civil society, the media 
including blogs, complaints procedures such as the OECD NCPs, and if they involve alleged </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>violations of the law, then possibly through the courts. This transnational normative regime 
reaches not only Western multinationals, which have long experienced its effects, but also 
emerging economy companies operating abroad, and even large national firms.<b>38</b> 
</p>
<p>48. As a well established and institutionalized social norm, the corporate responsibility to 
respect exists independently of State duties and variations in national law. There may be 
situations in which companies have additional responsibilities. But the responsibility to respect is 
the baseline norm for all companies in all situations. 
</p>
<p>49. Company claims that they respect human rights are all well and good. But the Special 
Representative has asked whether companies have systems in place enabling them to 
demonstrate the claim with any degree of confidence. He has found that relatively few do. What 
is required is an ongoing process of human rights due diligence, whereby companies become 
aware of, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts. The four core elements of human 
rights due diligence were outlined in his 2008 report: having a human rights policy, assessing 
human rights impacts of company activities, integrating those values and findings into corporate 
cultures and management systems, and tracking as well as reporting performance.<b>39</b> 
</p>
<p>50. What is the appropriate scope of a company&#8217;s human rights due diligence process, the 
range of factors it needs to consider? Three are essential. The first is the country and local 
context in which the business activity takes place. This might include the country&#8217;s human rights 
commitments and practices, the public sector&#8217;s institutional capacity, ethnic tensions, migration 
patterns, the scarcity of critical resources like water, and so on. The second factor is what 
impacts the company&#8217;s own activities may have within that context, in its capacity as producer, 
service provider, employer and neighbour, and understanding that its presence inevitably will 
change many pre-existing conditions. The third factor is whether and how the company might 
contribute to abuse through the relationships connected to its activities, such as with business 
partners, entities in its value chain, other non-State actors, and State agents. 
</p>
<p>51. Companies do not control some of these factors, but that is no reason to ignore them. 
Businesses routinely employ due diligence to assess exposure to risks beyond their control and 
develop mitigation strategies for them, such as changes in government policy, shifts in consumer 
preferences, and even weather patterns. Controllable or not, human rights challenges arising 
from the business context, its impacts and its relationships can pose material risks to the 
company and its stakeholders, and generate outright abuses that may be linked to the company in 
perception or reality. Therefore, they merit a similar level of due diligence as any other risk. 
</p>
<p>52. Finally, companies need to know the substantive content of this due diligence process, or 
which rights it should encompass. The answer is simple - in principle, all internationally 
recognized human rights. The quest to determine a finite list of rights for companies to respect is 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>38
</b>  A good indicator is the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre&#8217;s website, which posts 
</p>
<p>human rights allegations about business operations in more than 180 countries and gets 
1.5 million hits per month. http://www.business-humanrights.org/. 
<b>39
</b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/8/5, paras. 56-64. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>a fool&#8217;s errand because companies can affect the entire spectrum of rights, as documented in the 
Special Representative&#8217;s mapping of nearly 400 public allegations against companies.<b>40</b> 
Therefore, the responsibility to respect must apply to all such rights, although in practice some 
may be more relevant than others in particular contexts.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>53. For the substantive content of due diligence, then, companies at a minimum should look to 
the International Bill of Human Rights - the Universal Declaration and the two Covenants - as 
well as the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. They should do so 
for two reasons. First, the principles these instruments embody are the most universally agreed 
upon by the international community. Second, they are the main benchmarks against which other 
social actors judge the human rights impacts of companies. 
</p><p>54. Companies might need to consider additional standards depending on the situation. For 
example, in conflict affected areas they should take into account international humanitarian law 
and policies; and in projects affecting indigenous peoples, standards specific to those 
communities will be relevant. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Representative is planning consultations to further operationalize the corporate 
responsibility to respect human rights and related due diligence requirements. He will also 
continue to seek greater conceptual clarity on two sets of issues that have emerged in stakeholder 
discussions, addressed briefly below. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Responsibility to respect 
</b></p>
<p>56. A number of issues and dilemmas have been raised regarding the corporate responsibility 
to respect. 
</p>
<p><b>Demystifying human rights 
</b></p>
<p>57. One issue concerns the conceptual difficulties that even companies committed to 
internalizing human rights have faced in mastering this subject. Part of the problem is that 
international human rights instruments were written by States, for States. Their meaning for 
businesses has not always been understood clearly by human rights experts, let alone the 
engineers, security managers, and supply chain officers in companies who have to deal with the 
corporate responsibility to respect on the ground. But considerable advances have been made 
recently. In particular, an OHCHR publication, &#8220;Human Rights Translated&#8221;, does what the title 
promises, by translating State-based text into language and examples that make sense in a 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>40
</b>  See A/HRC/8/5/Add.2 and E/CN.4/2006/97, paras. 24-30. 
</p>
<p><b>41
</b>  Companies may support their baseline human rights responsibilities with collaborative 
</p>
<p>initiatives focused on specific areas of rights particularly relevant to their business, such as the 
Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and the Fair Labour Association. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>business context.<b>42</b> Similarly, the Business Leaders Initiative on Human Rights has developed a 
matrix mapping elements of the International Bill of Human Rights onto various business 
functions, making it more accessible to company staff.<b>43</b> The Special Representative will 
continue to engage developers and users of such tools, aiming to achieve further clarity and 
consistency while maintaining the integrity of the underlying human rights standards. 
</p>
<p>58. Confusion has also existed because the first generation of advocacy in business and human 
rights, culminating in the Draft Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and 
Other Business Enterprises with Regard to Human Rights,<b>44</b> so co-mingled the respective 
responsibilities of States and companies that it was difficult if not impossible to disentangle the 
two. Unsurprisingly, this approach was rejected by Governments and business alike. Here, too, 
there has been good progress: the &#8220;protect, respect and remedy&#8221; framework now provides a 
common platform of differentiated yet complementary responsibilities on the basis of which to 
move forward. 
</p>
<p><b>Positive acts 
</b></p>
<p>59. Some stakeholders have queried whether the responsibility to respect is a mere analogue to 
a &#8220;negative duty&#8221;. The answer should be clear from the foregoing: the responsibility to respect 
requires companies to undertake human rights due diligence to become aware of, prevent and 
address adverse human rights impacts. Moreover, for companies to know they are not infringing 
on others&#8217; rights requires mechanisms at the operational level, to which affected individuals and 
communities can bring grievances concerning company-related impacts and which companies 
may need to establish where none exist. By definition, these are positive acts. 
</p>
<p>60. There will be variations in the details of due diligence and grievance mechanisms 
depending on specific situations, and the Special Representative will continue to explore them. 
But the underlying principles should be observed irrespective of situational factors. 
</p>
<p><b>Beyond respect? 
</b></p>
<p>61. In addition to legal compliance, the responsibility to respect human rights is the baseline 
responsibility of all companies in all situations. But some stakeholders maintain that more should 
be required of companies, while many companies claim already to be doing more. 
</p>
<p>62. Clearly, companies may undertake additional commitments voluntarily or as a matter of 
philanthropy. Moreover, some have developed new business opportunities by offering goods and 
services more closely aligned with basic needs, as in bottom-of-the-pyramid strategies and other

 <p> 
</p>
<p>types of inclusive business models. These are worthy endeavours that may contribute to the 
enjoyment of human rights. But what it is desirable for companies to do should not be confused 
with what is required of them. Nor do such desirable activities offset a company&#8217;s failure to do 
what is required, namely to respect human rights throughout its operations and relationships. 
</p>
<p>63. Operating conditions may impose additional requirements on companies, for example, the 
need to protect employees in conflict affected areas, or from violence in the workplace. But this 
is more appropriately considered a specific operationalization of the responsibility to respect, and 
not a separate responsibility altogether. 
</p>
<p>64. More than respect may be required when companies perform certain public functions. For 
example, the rights of prisoners do not diminish when prisons become privatized. Here, 
additional corporate responsibilities may arise as a result of the specific functions the company is 
performing. But it remains unclear what the full range of those responsibilities might be and how 
they relate to the State&#8217;s ongoing obligation to ensure that the rights in question are not 
diminished. 
</p>
<p>65. Beyond such situations, the picture becomes even murkier. A number of additional factors 
have been proposed for attributing greater responsibilities to companies. They include power, 
influence, capacity, and the notion that companies are &#8220;organs of society&#8221;. While such factors 
may impose certain moral obligations on any person or entity, including business, they are 
highly problematic bases for assigning responsibilities to companies beyond respecting all rights 
at all times, for reasons the Special Representative elaborated in previous reports.<b>45</b> 
</p>
<p><b>International standards and national law 
</b></p>
<p>66. One of the toughest dilemmas companies face is where national law significantly 
contradicts and does not offer the same level of protection as international human rights 
standards. National authorities may demand compliance with the law, while other stakeholders 
may advocate adherence to international standards, as might the company itself, for reasons of 
principle or simple consistency of policy. 
</p>
<p>67. Where the country is under United Nations sanctions, or where the possibility exists of the 
company becoming complicit in international crimes committed by others, a company&#8217;s own due 
diligence should generate warning signs or even flashing red lights. But the majority of cases do 
not fall into these categories, leaving companies caught in the middle unless they find ways to 
honour the spirit of international standards without violating national law. 
</p>
<p>68. Companies have grappled with this dilemma in relation to freedom of association. Some 
have encouraged workers to form their own representation within the company and facilitated 
elections of workers&#8217; representatives. Efforts have also been made to provide education on 
labour rights and train local management on how to respond constructively to worker grievances. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>45
</b>  See E/CN.4/2006/97, paras. 66-68, and A/HRC/8/5, paras. 65-72. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Companies have faced similar dilemmas in relation to gender equality, and most recently 
freedom of expression and the right to privacy in the Internet and telecommunications sectors, 
where the Global Network Initiative was recently formed to help guide companies.<b>46</b> 
</p>
<p>69. In sum, while there is now considerably greater shared understanding of many issues 
regarding the corporate responsibility to respect than there was only a year or two ago, for others 
further clarification is required and will be pursued in consultations. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Due diligence 
</b></p>
<p>70. A number of issues regarding human rights due diligence have emerged in stakeholder 
discussions; four are addressed here. 
</p>
<p><b>Life cycle 
</b></p>
<p>71. Due diligence is commonly defined as &#8220;diligence reasonably expected from, and ordinarily 
exercised by, a person who seeks to satisfy a legal requirement or to discharge an obligation&#8221;.<b>47</b> 
Some have viewed this in strictly transactional terms - what an investor or buyer does to assess a 
target asset or venture. The Special Representative uses this term in its broader sense: a 
comprehensive, proactive attempt to uncover human rights risks, actual and potential, over the 
entire life cycle of a project or business activity, with the aim of avoiding and mitigating those 
risks. 
</p>
<p><b>Business role and size 
</b></p>
<p>72. The principles of human rights due diligence and its core elements should be internalized 
by all businesses, regardless of their nature or size. But the specific activities that companies 
must undertake to discharge this responsibility will vary in ways not yet fully understood. 
</p>
<p>73. For example, a bank&#8217;s human rights due diligence for a project loan will differ in some 
respects from that of the company operating the project. Nevertheless, banks do have human 
rights due diligence requirements in this context, and human rights risks related to the projects 
are also risks to the banks&#8217; liability, returns and reputation. Beyond banks lies an even more 
complex array of other lenders, investors, and asset managers. Precisely how their respective due 
diligence differs requires further clarity. 
</p>
<p>74. Similarly, small- and medium-sized enterprises must consider their human rights impacts. 
But the scale and complexity of their due diligence can hardly mirror that of large transnational 
corporations. 
</p>
<p>75. Supply chains pose their own issues. It is often overlooked that suppliers are also 
companies, subject to the same responsibility to respect human rights as any other business. The 
challenge for buyers is to ensure they are not complicit in violations by their suppliers. How far 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>46
</b>  http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/. 
</p>
<p><b>47
</b>  <i>Black&#8217;s Law Dictionary</i>, 8th edition (2006). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>down the supply chain a buyer&#8217;s responsibility extends depends on what a proper due diligence 
process reveals about prevailing country and sector conditions, and about potential business 
partners and their sourcing practices. A growing number of global buyers are finding it necessary 
to engage in human rights capacity-building with suppliers in order to sustain the relationship. 
</p>
<p>76. The Special Representative will continue to explore how human rights due diligence might 
legitimately vary across businesses of different roles and sizes, as he provides a principled 
elaboration of human rights due diligence applicable to all businesses. 
</p>
<p><b>Free-standing? 
</b></p>
<p>77. Debate continues on how best to integrate human rights policies throughout a company. 
Some believe that human rights should be folded into existing due diligence processes, while 
others believe that human rights due diligence needs to be free-standing. 
</p>
<p>78. An advantage cited for free-standing procedures is that the relevant issues get the attention 
and professionalization they deserve. But a disadvantage may be that it is not connected to the 
rest of the company. In contrast, folding human rights due diligence into ongoing processes may 
put human rights on par with other key issues when managers evaluate potential projects, but the 
unique attributes of human rights may thereby get diminished. 
</p>
<p>79. A single model is unlikely to fit all situations. But two principles seem critical. First, 
companies must recognize that human rights are not merely another topic, but that it demands 
meaningful engagement with affected parties within and beyond the company. Second, oversight 
of compliance with a company&#8217;s human rights policy must have its own direct line of access to 
corporate leadership. The Special Representative will draw on lessons from practical experience 
to inform further conceptual refinement of this issue. 
</p>
<p><b>Liability 
</b></p>
<p>80. Another question that has been raised, including by some corporate general counsel, is 
whether following these human rights due diligence requirements could increase the potential 
liability for firms by providing external parties with information they would not otherwise have 
had to use against the company. 
</p>
<p>81. This view seems to be more widespread in the United States than elsewhere, perhaps 
reflecting a more litigious tradition. But the case for it is not self-evident, even in the 
United States context. Under a variety of corporate governance regulations, companies are 
required to assess, manage and disclose material risks - as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of 
their systems for doing so - in order to avoid liability. As we have seen, involvement in human 
rights violations can be a material risk. Moreover, not knowing is itself a risk, and an unreliable 
defence. Beyond the legal sphere lie the value of reputation and the cost of operational 
disruptions. On sheer prudential grounds, therefore, a leading Wall Street law firm concluded </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>that the due diligence process elaborated by the Special Representative &#8220;encourages robust risk 
assessment that is &#8230; highly advisable from a business perspective in today&#8217;s highly visible and 
transparent environment&#8221;.<b>48</b> 
</p>
<p>82. There are two scenarios under which legal liability could flow from human rights due 
diligence, but the decisive factor in both is how the company responds to new information. In the 
first, the company gains knowledge of possible human rights violations it may commit or be 
involved in, does nothing to act on it, the violations occur, and word of the company&#8217;s prior 
knowledge gets out. In the second, the company publicly misrepresents what it finds in its due 
diligence and that fact becomes known. But the point of human rights due diligence is to learn 
about risks that the company would then take action to mitigate, and not to ignore or 
misrepresent the findings. 
</p>
<p>83. Some have claimed that the more information there is in the public domain about a 
company&#8217;s potential human rights impacts, the more fodder there might be for vexatious legal 
claims or public campaigns. But done properly, human rights due diligence should precisely 
create opportunities to mitigate risks and engage meaningfully with stakeholders so that 
disingenuous lawsuits will find little support beyond the individuals who file them. Moreover, 
recent experience shows that other social actors are quite capable of concluding and stating 
publicly that a company facing criticism has undertaken good faith efforts to avoid human rights 
harm, and that transparency in acknowledging inadvertent problems can work in its favour.<b>49</b> 
</p>
<p>84. The mandate&#8217;s ongoing work, including the corporate law project, should shed further light 
on this question, and on what policy changes by States could ensure that companies are 
incentivized to undertake human rights due diligence. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Summing up 
</b></p>
<p>85. Discharging the responsibility to respect human rights requires due diligence whereby 
companies become aware of, prevent, and mitigate adverse human rights impacts of their 
activities and relationships. The responsibility to respect is not intended to carry the entire 
burden of the business and human rights agenda: it is bracketed by the State duty to protect on 
one side, and access to effective remedy on the other. We now turn to the latter.

<i>The Economist</i>, 19 January 2008. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>V.  ACCESS TO REMEDY 
</b></p>
<p>86. Access to effective remedy, the framework&#8217;s third pillar, is an important component of 
both the State duty to protect and of the corporate responsibility to respect. This section is 
divided into four parts. The first seeks to clarify ambiguities concerning States&#8217; obligations in 
this area. The second addresses the relationship between judicial and non-judicial mechanisms. 
The third and fourth parts describe the Special Representative&#8217;s current work and thinking on 
judicial and non-judicial mechanisms. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  State obligations 
</b></p>
<p>87. As part of their duty to protect, States are required to take appropriate steps to investigate, 
punish and redress corporate-related abuse of the rights of individuals within their territory 
and/or jurisdiction - in short, to provide access to remedy. Without such steps, the duty could be 
rendered weak or even meaningless. Remedy may be provided through judicial, administrative, 
legislative or other appropriate means. States may also be required to provide adequate 
reparation, including compensation, to victims.<b>50</b> 
</p>
<p>88. This State obligation to provide access to remedy is distinct from the individual right to 
remedy recognized in a number of international and regional human rights conventions. While 
the State obligation applies to corporate abuse of all applicable human rights, it is unclear how 
far the individual right to remedy extends to non-State abuses. However, an individual right to 
remedy has been affirmed for the category of acts covered by the United Nations Basic 
Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross 
Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law (General Assembly resolution 60/147, annex), &#8220;irrespective of who may 
ultimately be the bearer of responsibility for the violation&#8221;.<b>51</b> 
</p>
<p>89. Some international and regional human rights bodies have addressed what States are 
expected to do in providing access to remedy for corporate-related abuse. For example, they 
have emphasized establishing effective complaints mechanisms for employment-related 
grievances; minimizing the potential for extractive companies to impair the ability of 
communities affected by their operations, especially indigenous peoples, to access remedial 
mechanisms; and ensuring that effective remedial processes exist for abuses by private 
companies carrying out &#8220;State functions&#8221;. However, guidance continues to vary as to: whether 
States are expected to punish corporate entities directly, apart from individuals acting on their 
behalf; when States are expected to provide individuals with civil causes of action regarding 
corporate-related abuse; and whether and to what extent States should hold corporations 
accountable for alleged rights abuses overseas. 
</p>
<p>90. These complex issues are further elaborated in the addendum to this report. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>50
</b>  Several core international and regional human rights treaties provide for these elements; 
</p>
<p>where they do not, there has been some useful commentary from human rights bodies. 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  Principle 3 (c). </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interplay between judicial and non-judicial mechanisms 
</b>91. Judicial and non-judicial mechanisms sometimes are thought of as mutually exclusive, and 
in some circumstances, they may be. For instance, grievances that raise issues of criminal law in 
particular may necessitate judicial recourse. But typically the two mechanisms are more 
interactive, and may be complementary, reinforcing, sequential or preventive, as illustrated 
below: 
</p>
<p> (a) Non-judicial mechanisms often can be engaged earlier and faster than judicial 
processes, as well as in situations where a dispute does not amount to a legal cause of action; 
</p>
<p> (b) The prospect of litigation often incentivizes parties to reach a negotiated or mediated 
solution; 
</p>
<p> (c) Mechanisms at the national or international levels may offer alternatives where local 
courts or mediated processes fail, or are inadequate or absent; 
</p>
<p> (d) Mechanisms at the company level form an essential part of early warning and risk 
management to identify, mitigate and resolve grievances before they escalate and possibly entail 
extensive abuses and lawsuits. 
</p>
<p>92. Each type of mechanism has inherent advantages and disadvantages<b>52</b>. If effective 
remedies for business-related human rights abuses are to be improved, a range of options is 
required from which complainants can choose according to their needs and situations. Progress 
from the current patchwork to a more complete and deliberate system will require improvements 
in access to, and the effectiveness of, existing mechanisms; and new mechanisms where no 
effective ones are currently in prospect. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Judicial mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>93. States often point to their criminal and civil law systems to demonstrate that they are 
meeting their international obligations to investigate, punish and redress abuse. However, 
significant barriers to accessing effective judicial remedy persist.<b>53</b> Most are well known, are not 
unique to business and human rights, and are the subject of ongoing capacity-building work by 
States in partnership with international institutions. The Special Representative&#8217;s work focuses 
specifically on barriers that are particularly salient for victims of corporate-related human rights 
abuses.

 <p> 
</p>
<p>94. With regard to civil claims, a complainant may not be able to obtain an effective remedy 
from a company through a host State&#8217;s national courts because of a range of legal and practical 
impediments. There may be no available course of action. The courts may lack the capacity to 
handle complex claims. Costs are frequently prohibitive: even filing a case may be too expensive 
for poor individuals and communities, and cost allocation provisions like the &#8220;loser pays&#8221; may 
preclude many more claimants from bringing a case. In the event of a favourable judgement 
enforcement may be difficult, especially if the company lacks sufficient assets. 
</p>
<p>95. Where the company is a subsidiary of an overseas parent, additional factors can compound 
these barriers. The parent company may use its own leverage with the host Government or 
mobilize the home Government and international financial institutions. The alternative of filing a 
suit in the parent company&#8217;s home State for the subsidiary&#8217;s actions, or for the parent&#8217;s own acts 
or omissions, can raise jurisdictional questions about whether it is the appropriate forum, and 
may trigger policy objections by both home and host State Governments. Moreover, the 
standards expected of parent companies with regard to subsidiaries may be unclear or untested in 
national law. Such transnational claims also raise their own evidentiary, representational, and 
financial difficulties. 
</p>
<p>96. As regards criminal proceedings, even where a legal basis exists, if State authorities are 
unwilling or unable to dedicate the resources to pursue allegations, currently there may be little 
that victims can do. 
</p>
<p>97. Legal and practical access barriers are often accentuated for &#8220;at risk&#8221; or vulnerable groups, 
whether companies are national or transnational. Such groups may include women, children and 
indigenous peoples, as well as those marginalized for other reasons in their interactions with 
companies.<b>54</b> Governments have a critical role - and in some cases, a duty - to raise awareness of 
the risks facing these individuals and communities, and to ensure that their rights are adequately 
protected, including by providing access to remedy. 
</p>
<p>98. The Special Representative will continue research and consultations on barriers to judicial 
remedy, as well as possible options to address them. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Non-judicial mechanisms 
</b>99. In his 2008 report, the Special Representative presented a set of grievance mechanism 
principles. Six should underpin all non-judicial grievance mechanisms: legitimacy, accessibility, 
predictability, equitability, rights-compatibility and transparency.<b>55</b> As a seventh principle 
specifically for company-level mechanisms, he stressed that they should operate through 
dialogue and mediation rather than the company itself acting as adjudicator. The remainder of 
this section looks at mechanisms at company, national and international levels.

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>Company level 
</b></p>
<p>100. Effective grievance mechanisms are an important part of the corporate responsibility to 
respect. They complement monitoring or auditing for human rights compliance. They also 
provide an ongoing channel through which the company gains early warning of problems and 
disputes and can seek to avoid escalation; many of now emblematic cases of corporate-related 
human rights abuse started out as far lesser grievances. Moreover, by tracking complaints, 
companies can identify systemic problems and adapt practices to prevent future harm and 
disputes. 
</p>
<p>101. The scale and complexity of dedicated mechanisms will depend on the extent of the 
companies&#8217; likely impacts. They need not be cumbersome to be effective and they may be 
partially outsourced or shared with other operations or companies, provided the grievance 
mechanism principles are met. An increasing number of companies, business associations and 
business-related organizations are developing grievance mechanisms or related guidance. The 
Special Representative welcomes the decision by the ICC, IOE and BIAC to pilot these 
principles with companies in different sectors, and hopes this will generate broader lessons.<b>56</b> 
</p>
<p><b>National level 
</b></p>
<p>102. National human rights institutions (NHRIs) and the NCPs of States adhering to the OECD 
Guidelines are potentially important avenues for remedy at the national level. In 2008, the 
Special Representative contributed to various meetings of national human rights institutions and 
addressed the annual meeting of NCPs. 
</p>
<p>103. While the mandates of some NHRIs may currently preclude them from work on business 
and human rights, for many it has been a question of choice, tradition or capacity. The Special 
Representative hopes that more NHRIs will reflect on ways they can address alleged human 
rights abuses involving business. He welcomes the decision of the International Coordinating 
Committee of NHRIs to establish a working group on business and human rights and looks 
forward to continued cooperation. 
</p>
<p>104. NCPs stress the need for operational flexibility that reflects national circumstances. But to 
ensure the credibility of the system as a whole, this ought to be delimited by minimum 
performance criteria in line with those set out by the Special Representative. Several NCPs, 
notably in the United Kingdom and Netherlands, have developed innovative governance 
structures, transparency measures and mediation capacity that merit attention. Moreover, 
Governments should consider ways to give more weight to NCP findings against companies. For 
example, since Governments are obliged to promote the OECD Guidelines under which NCPs 
operate, a negative finding logically might affect the company&#8217;s access to government 
procurement and guarantees. 
</p>
<p>

</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>105. Other bodies can also play important roles in providing remedy at the national level. Some 
may be issue-specific, for example focused on non-discrimination or labour rights. Others may 
be sector-specific, such as for example, the banking and telecommunications industry 
ombudsman systems in Australia. The Special Representative continues to explore promising 
models. 
</p>
<p><b>International level 
</b></p>
<p>106. A number of voluntary industry codes, multi-stakeholder initiatives and investor-led 
standards have established grievance mechanisms, and the above principles now provide a basis 
for assessing whether they meet the minimum criteria. But many initiatives lack grievance 
procedures, and there is evidence that this erodes their perceived legitimacy. The logical 
implication is for them to adopt such mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>107. A major barrier to victims&#8217; accessing available mechanisms, from the company or industry 
to the national and international levels, is the sheer lack of information available about them. 
This information deficit also makes it difficult to improve such mechanisms and to learn from 
past disputes and to avoid their replication. 
</p>
<p>108. With these barriers in mind, the Special Representative has launched a global wiki: 
Business and Society Exploring Solutions-A Dispute Resolution Community.<b>57</b> BASESwiki 
(www.baseswiki.org) is an interactive online forum for sharing, accessing and discussing 
information about non-judicial mechanisms that address disputes between companies and their 
external stakeholders. It includes information about how and where mechanisms work, solutions 
they have achieved, experts who can help, and research and case studies. BASESwiki will be 
built over time by and for its users. It is currently available with English, French, Spanish, 
Chinese and Russian portals; Arabic is under development. The Special Representative urges all 
stakeholders - business, NGOs, Governments, mediators, lawyers, academics and others - to help 
develop this important resource and to assist in bringing its benefits to those without internet 
access.  
</p>
<p>109. Various stakeholders have pressed for a new international institution to improve access to 
non-judicial remedy. Proposals include a clearing house to direct those with disputes towards 
mechanisms that might offer remedy; a capacity-building entity to help disputing parties use 
those mechanisms effectively; an expert body to aggregate and analyse outcomes, enabling more 
systemic learning and dispute prevention; and a grievance mechanism for when local or national 
mechanisms fail or are inadequate. 
</p>
<p>110. The first three suggestions hold promise of practical, achievable benefits, if done 
appropriately. Developing global information and resource platforms such as BASESwiki is an 
essential precursor to any of these roles. 
</p>
<p>

</b>  In collaboration with the International Bar Association and with support from the Compliance 
</p>
<p>Advisor/Ombudsman of the World Bank Group and JAMS Foundation. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>111. The proposition of creating a single, mandatory, non-judicial but adjudicative mechanism 
at the international level inevitably poses greater difficulty. In handling complex disputes that 
involve diverse and economically unequal parties in remote locations, processes based solely on 
written submissions are unlikely to meet basic standards of fairness and rigor. The demands of 
appropriate investigations and/or hearings are likely to raise significant evidentiary, practical, 
financial and political challenges, while offering only limited prospects of remedies that are 
timely, enforceable and extend beyond a few complaints a year. 
</p>
<p>112. An alternative option would be to look to an existing body or network with international 
standing that could offer mediation of disputes involving human rights issues. If it had capacity 
to enable mediated processes in the locations where disputes arise, this could avoid many of the 
challenges noted above. At the same time, the mediation process would have to reflect the 
grievance mechanism principles set out by the Special Representative. Complainants might need 
advice and support to engage as equal participants in the process, and a funding model would be 
needed to avoid their facing prohibitive costs. 
</p>
<p>113. Arbitration by such entities might also be an option. In particular, companies operating in 
conflict affected areas should have a strong incentive to agree ex ante to use such 
mediation/arbitration bodies in the event of disputes with communities, and their investors and 
States should have a strong interest in seeing them do so. Arbitration would be subject to the 
same caveats as above, and should not preclude judicial recourse. 
</p><p>114. The Special Representative continues to explore options for institutional innovations where 
they hold promise of quantitative and qualitative improvements in access to effective remedy, 
with a view to future recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Summing up 
</b></p>
<p>115. Grievance mechanisms, judicial and non-judicial, form part of both the State duty to 
protect and the corporate responsibility to respect. They are essential to ensuring access to 
remedy for victims of corporate abuse. For States, they are also means of enforcing or 
incentivizing corporate compliance with relevant law and standards, and of deterring abuse. For 
companies, operational-level mechanisms have the added benefit of giving early warning of 
problems and helping mitigate or resolve them before abuses occur or disputes compound. But 
too many barriers exist to accessing judicial remedy, and too few non-judicial mechanisms meet 
the minimum principles of effectiveness. Further improvements, shared learning, and 
innovations are required. 
</p>
<p><b>VI.  CONCLUSION 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>The Special Representative is honoured and humbled by the task the Human Rights 
Council has set for him of operationalizing the &#8220;protect, respect and remedy&#8221; framework 
so as to provide concrete guidance for all relevant actors.</b> 
</p>
<p>117. <b>In the face of what may be the worst worldwide economic downturn in a century, 
however, some may be inclined to ask: with so many unprecedented challenges, is this the 
appropriate time to be addressing business and human rights? This report answers with a 
resounding &#8220;yes&#8221;. It does so based on three grounds.</b> </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>118. <b>First, human rights are most at risk in times of crisis, and economic crises pose a 
particular risk to economic and social rights. Now more than ever, therefore, the business 
and human rights agenda matters. Any gains Governments believe can be had by lowering 
human rights standards for business are illusory, and no sustainable recovery can be built 
on so flimsy a foundation. Companies must weigh any corresponding temptations against 
the impact of declining public confidence in business, growing populism and an impending 
epochal shift in regulatory environments.</b> 
</p>
<p>119. <b>Second, it was noted earlier that the same types of governance gaps and failures that 
produced the current economic crisis also constitute what the Special Representative has 
called the permissive environment for corporate wrongdoing in relation to human rights. 
The necessary solutions for both similarly point in the same direction: Governments 
adopting policies that induce greater corporate responsibility, and companies adopting 
strategies reflecting the now inescapable fact that their own long-term prospects are tightly 
coupled with the well-being of society as a whole. Strengthening the international human 
rights regime against corporate-related abuse thereby contributes to, and gains from, the 
universally desired transition toward a more inclusive and sustainable world economy. 
Values are becoming a value proposition.</b> 
</p>
<p>120. <b>Third, the &#8220;protect, respect and remedy&#8221; framework identifies specific ways to 
achieve these objectives. For Governments, the key is to drive the business and human 
rights agenda more deeply into policy domains that directly shape business practices. For 
companies, the key is to become more fully aware of and responsive to their infringements 
on the rights of others. Access to effective remedy, judicial and non-judicial, is an essential 
component enabling individuals and communities to vindicate their rights - the very 
purpose of the human rights regime. More prosaically, it also serves as a signalling device, 
a feedback loop, alerting Governments, business and society as a whole when all is not well, 
while providing opportunities for early intervention and resolution before greater harm 
occurs.</b> 
</p>
<p>121. <b>In short, business and human rights is not an ephemeral issue to be considered at 
some future date. It is and must remain at the core of our common concerns today. </b> 
</p>
