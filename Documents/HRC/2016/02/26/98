<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
</p>
<p>Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention 
</p>
<p>against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and 
</p>
<p>reaffirming that all States must implement their obligations under international human 
</p>
<p>rights law, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights aiming at the abolition of the death penalty, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling further</i> General Assembly resolutions 62/149 of 18 December 2007, 
</p>
<p>63/168 of 18 December 2008, 65/206 of 21 December 2010, 67/176 of 20 December 2012 
</p>
<p>and 69/186 of 18 December 2014 on the question of a moratorium on the use of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of persons facing the death 
</p>
<p>penalty set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 
</p>
<p>1984, and the provisions regarding the implementation of the guidelines contained in 
</p>
<p>Council resolutions 1989/64 of 24 May 1989 and 1996/15 of 23 July 1996, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights on the question of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty, the last of which was resolution 2005/59 of 20 April 2005, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> Human Rights Council decision 18/117 of 28 September 2011 on 
</p>
<p>reporting by the Secretary-General on the question of the death penalty, Council resolution 
</p>
<p>22/11 of 21 March 2013 on a panel on the human rights of children of parents sentenced to 
</p>
<p>the death penalty or executed, Council decision 22/117 of 21 March 2013 on a high-level 
</p>
<p>panel discussion on the question of the death penalty and Council resolution 26/2 of 26 
</p>
<p>June 2014 on the question of the death penalty, 
</p>
<p> 
 
 
</p>

<p><i>Taking note</i> of the reports of the Secretary-General on the question of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, in the latest of which1 the Secretary-General concluded that the imposition of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty was incompatible with human dignity, the right to life and the prohibition of 
</p>
<p>torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and highlighted the 
</p>
<p>consequences of the lack of transparency in the imposition and application of the death 
</p>
<p>penalty and the consequences arising at various stages of the imposition and application of 
</p>
<p>the death penalty for the enjoyment of the human rights of other affected persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful </i>of the work of special procedure mandate holders who have addressed 
</p>
<p>human rights issues related to the death penalty, including the Special Rapporteur on torture 
</p>
<p>and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on 
</p>
<p>extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>independence of judges and lawyers, 
</p>
<p><i>Mindful also</i> of the work undertaken by the treaty bodies to address human rights 
</p>
<p>issues related to the death penalty, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the role of regional and subregional instruments and initiatives towards 
</p>
<p>the abolition of the death penalty, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the fact that many States are applying a moratorium on the use of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> that States with different legal systems, traditions, cultures and religious 
</p>
<p>backgrounds have abolished the death penalty or are applying a moratorium on its use, 
</p>
<p><i>Strongly deploring</i> the fact that the use of the death penalty leads to violations of the 
</p>
<p>human rights of the persons facing the death penalty and of other affected persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> the calls to consider whether the use of the death penalty violates the 
</p>
<p>prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
</p>
<p>including because of the death row phenomenon or the methods of execution, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing </i>the need to ensure that persons facing the death penalty are treated with 
</p>
<p>humanity and with respect for their inherent dignity, and to improve conditions in prisons in 
</p>
<p>accordance with international standards, such as the Standard Minimum Rules for the 
</p>
<p>Treatment of Prisoners, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> that all methods of execution can inflict inordinate pain and suffering, and 
</p>
<p>that the circumstances in which executions are carried out, in particular public executions, 
</p>
<p>which imply an undignified exposure of the persons sentenced to death, and secret 
</p>
<p>executions or those with short or no prior warning add to the suffering of the persons 
</p>
<p>sentenced to death, as well as of other affected persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Emphasizing</i> that lack of transparency in the use of the death penalty has direct 
</p>
<p>consequences for the human rights of the persons sentenced to death as well as for other 
</p>
<p>affected persons, 
</p>
<p><i>Acknowledging</i> the interest in studying the question of the death penalty, as well as 
</p>
<p>in holding local, national, regional and international debates related thereto, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Urges</i> all States to protect the rights of persons facing the death penalty and 
</p>
<p>other affected persons by complying with their international obligations, including the 
</p>
<p>absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
</p>
<p>punishment; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1  A/HRC/30/18. </p>


<p>2. <i>Calls upon </i>States that have not yet acceded to or ratified the Second Optional 
</p>
<p>Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights aiming at the abolition 
</p>
<p>of the death penalty to consider doing so; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States that have not yet abolished the death penalty to make 
</p>
<p>available relevant information, disaggregated by sex, age and other applicable criteria, with 
</p>
<p>regard to their use of the death penalty, inter alia, the number of persons sentenced to death, 
</p>
<p>the number of persons on death row, the number of executions carried out and the number 
</p>
<p>of death sentences reversed, commuted on appeal or in which amnesty or pardon has been 
</p>
<p>granted, which can contribute to possible informed and transparent national and 
</p>
<p>international debates, including on the obligations of States with regard to the use of the 
</p>
<p>death penalty; 
</p>
<p>4.<b> </b><i>Calls upon </i>States<b> </b>to ensure that children whose parents or parental caregivers 
</p>
<p>are on death row, the inmates themselves, their families and their legal representatives are 
</p>
<p>provided, in advance, with adequate information about a pending execution, its date, time 
</p>
<p>and location, to allow a last visit or communication with the convicted person, the return of 
</p>
<p>the body to the family for burial or to inform on where the body is located, unless this is not 
</p>
<p>in the best interests of the child; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to dedicate the 2017 supplement to his 
</p>
<p>quinquennial report on capital punishment to the consequences arising at various stages of 
</p>
<p>the imposition and application of the death penalty on the enjoyment of the human rights of 
</p>
<p>the persons facing the death penalty and other affected persons, paying specific attention to 
</p>
<p>the right to equality and non-discrimination, including on foreign nationals, and to present it 
</p>
<p>to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-sixth session; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Decides</i> that the upcoming biennial high-level panel discussion to be held at 
</p>
<p>the thirty-fourth session of the Human Rights Council will address the human rights 
</p>
<p>violations related to the use of the death penalty, in particular with respect to the prohibition 
</p>
<p>of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights to organize the panel discussion and to liaise with States, relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>bodies, agencies, treaty bodies, special procedures and regional human rights mechanisms, 
</p>
<p>as well as with parliamentarians, civil society, including non-governmental organizations, 
</p>
<p>and national human rights institutions with a view to ensuring their participation in the 
</p>
<p>panel discussion; 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Also requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to prepare a summary 
</p>
<p>report on the panel discussion and to submit it to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-
</p>
