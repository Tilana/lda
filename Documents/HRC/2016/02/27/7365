<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 25/20, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare a study on the right of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities to live independently and be included in the community (art. 19 of 
</p>
<p>the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities), in consultation with States and 
</p>
<p>other relevant stakeholders, regional organizations, the Special Rapporteur on disability of 
</p>
<p>the Commission for Social Development, civil society organizations, including 
</p>
<p>organizations of persons with disabilities, and national human rights institutions. The 
</p>
<p>Council requested that the study be made available on the OHCHR website, in an 
</p>
<p>accessible format, prior to the twenty-eighth session of the Council. 
</p>
<p>2. OHCHR solicited contributions from Member States, regional organizations, civil 
</p>
<p>society organizations and organizations of persons with disabilities, the Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>on disability of the Commission for Social Development and national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions, requesting responses to a set of questions concerning existing legislation and 
</p>
<p>policies enabling persons with disabilities to live independently and be included in the 
</p>
<p>community. OHCHR received 27 responses from States, 12 from national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and 16 from civil society organizations and other stakeholders. The full texts of 
</p>
<p>all submissions received are available on the OHCHR website.1 
</p>
<p><b> II. The right to live independently and be included in the 
community 
</b></p>
<p>3. Persons with disabilities are often presumed to be unable to live independently. That 
</p>
<p>presumption is based on misconceptions, including that they lack the ability to make sound 
</p>
<p>decisions for themselves and that, therefore, society needs to protect them. This approach, 
</p>
<p>practised in many countries for a long time, has deprived persons with disabilities of the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to choose where and with whom to live and to determine their own future.  
</p>
<p>4. In article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the States 
</p>
<p>parties to the Convention recognized the equal right of all persons with disabilities to live 
</p>
<p>independently and be included in the community, with choices equal to others. The 
</p>
<p>foundation of that right is the core human rights principle that all humans are born equal in 
</p>
<p>dignity and rights, and that all life is of equal worth. On those grounds, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities have claimed the right to participate in all areas of mainstream community 
</p>
<p>living, arguing that the capacity of all individuals to make choices in that regard must be 
</p>
<p>acknowledged and enabled. Knowing their own needs best, persons with disabilities have 
</p>
<p>sought control over options to choose, requesting that community services be made 
</p>
<p>available to them on an equal basis with others. That approach has gradually been 
</p>
<p>introduced in the laws and policies of some countries.  
</p>
<p>5. Those changes in approach are causes and consequences of the transition from a 
</p>
<p>medical and charity approach to disability, whereby persons with disabilities were seen as 
</p>
<p>passive objects of care, to a human rights-based approach. The latter approach takes the 
</p>
<p>view that it is the society that must accommodate human diversity and enable persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, among others, to be an active part of it. An important milestone in the process 
</p>
<p>was the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2006, 
</p>
<p>which established an obligation for States parties to take effective and appropriate measures 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Disability/Pages/LiveIndependently.aspx. </p>


<p>with a view to achieving full inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities in the 
</p>
<p>community.  
</p>
<p>6. Article 19 reflects the essence of the Convention, in which persons with disabilities 
</p>
<p>are regarded as subjects of rights. The article is aimed at preventing abandonment, 
</p>
<p>institutionalization and segregation in domestic settings through the promotion of enabling 
</p>
<p>and inclusive environments for all, and the abolishment of legal provisions that deprive 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities of choice by forcing them to live in institutions or other segregated 
</p>
<p>settings. Fulfilment of the obligations under Article 19 also provides the conditions for the 
</p>
<p>full development of the personality and capabilities of persons with disabilities. 
</p>
<p>7. The foundation of an independent and inclusive life in the community for persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities is provided for by the general principles of the Convention (art. 3), in 
</p>
<p>particular the principles concerning full and effective participation and inclusion in society, 
</p>
<p>and respect for the individual&#8217;s inherent dignity, autonomy and independence. Full 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to live independently in the community is both the result of, and a 
</p>
<p>precondition for, the combating of stereotypes and prejudices relating to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and the promotion of awareness of their capabilities and contributions to society 
</p>
<p>(art. 8). Non-discrimination (art. 5) and accessibility (art. 9) are essential to ensure that 
</p>
<p>community services and facilities for the general population are available on an equal basis 
</p>
<p>to persons with disabilities and respond to their needs. Measures to prevent multiple 
</p>
<p>discrimination are required to guarantee women with disabilities the full and equal 
</p>
<p>enjoyment of the right to live independently in the community (art. 6). The specific barriers 
</p>
<p>that children with disabilities face in enjoying this right, including to have their views taken 
</p>
<p>into account on an equal basis with other children, should be duly considered and addressed 
</p>
<p>when determining the best interest of the child on issues related to article 19 (art. 7). 
</p>
<p>8. The Convention recognizes that persons with disabilities have the right to equal 
</p>
<p>recognition before the law (art. 12). The enjoyment of this right is essential for the effective 
</p>
<p>realization of the right to live independently in the community, to make choices and to have 
</p>
<p>control over their everyday lives, on an equal basis with others.2 Similarly, respecting the 
</p>
<p>right to liberty and security of the person (art. 14) includes ending all forms of deprivation 
</p>
<p>of liberty that are based on the existence of an impairment. 
</p>
<p>9. Ensuring that persons with disabilities enjoy an adequate standard of living (art. 28) 
</p>
<p>entails, inter alia, providing for support services that facilitate independence in their daily 
</p>
<p>lives.3 To that end, States parties are obliged to ensure access to appropriate and affordable 
</p>
<p>services, devices and other assistance for impairment-related needs, in particular for those 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities living in poverty. It also requires that persons with disabilities have 
</p>
<p>access to public housing programmes. Inclusive education systems, accessible general and 
</p>
<p>specific health services, the availability of habilitation and rehabilitation programmes, and 
</p>
<p>equal opportunities in the open labour market are other examples of interconnected rights 
</p>
<p>that contribute significantly to people living independently in the community (arts. 24&#8211; 27). 
</p>
<p>10. Article 19 is closely connected to provisions in other human rights treaties, 
</p>
<p>including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,4 the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights5 and the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 See Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, general comment No. 1 (2014) on equal 
</p>
<p>recognition before the law, para. 44. 
</p>
<p> 3 See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 5 (1994) on persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, para. 33. 
</p>
<p> 4 For instance, articles 9, 12, 16 and 17. 
</p>
<p> 5 For instance, articles 11 and 12. </p>


<p>the Child.6 The right to live independently and to be included in the community has also 
</p>
<p>been recognized in regional human rights documents, such as the European Social Charter 
</p>
<p>(art. 15) and the Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (art. 4, para. 2 (b)). 
</p>
<p>11. Several United Nations human rights treaty bodies and other mechanisms, including 
</p>
<p>the special procedures of the Human Rights Council,7 have contributed in developing the 
</p>
<p>various elements of the right of persons with disabilities to live independently and be 
</p>
<p>included in the community. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, for 
</p>
<p>instance, considers this right from a non-discrimination perspective, while the Committee 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of the Child stressed that disability should never be a reason for 
</p>
<p>institutionalization of children.8 The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>has consistently addressed this right in its dialogue with States parties, as well as in 
</p>
<p>individual communications.9  
</p>
<p><b> III. Elements of article 19: choice, support and availability of 
community services and facilities 
</b></p>
<p>12. Article 19 reflects the diversity of cultural approaches discussed during the 
</p>
<p>negotiations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, where care was 
</p>
<p>taken to ensure that the right covered under the article was not limited to the provision of 
</p>
<p>services available in developed countries. States parties are given a range of options, with 
</p>
<p>the provision that they respect the principles of control by persons with disabilities over 
</p>
<p>their lives and non-segregation from the community.10 
</p>
<p>13. Living independently does not mean living alone or in isolation.11 Rather, it means 
</p>
<p>exercising freedom of choice and control over decisions affecting one&#8217;s life with the same 
</p>
<p>level of independence and interdependence within society on an equal basis with others. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, article 19 refers to &#8220;living independently and being included in the 
</p>
<p>community&#8221; as one right, where autonomy and inclusion are mutually reinforcing and 
</p>
<p>jointly avoid segregation.12 
</p>

</p>
<p>punishment (see A/HRC/22/53), the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (see A/HRC/27/47) and 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences (see A/67/227).

</p>
<p>childhood, and general comment No. 9 (2007) on the rights of children with disabilities.

<p> 9 See Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, communication No. 3/2011, <i>H.M.</i> v. 
</p>
<p>Sweden, Views adopted on 19 April 2012. The Committee determined that the denial of a building 
</p>
<p>permit for an indoor pool for the purpose of rehabilitation was a violation of article 19 (b) and would 
</p>
<p>have the effect of forcing the complainant to enter an institution.

<p>14. Article 19 provides a road map aimed at achieving the full and effective 
</p>
<p>participation and inclusion in the society of all persons with disabilities (art. 3 (c)). In this 
</p>
<p>approach, general services available and accessible to all, individualized support to enable 
</p>
<p>the inclusion of each person, and choice for the individual in the type and supply of 
</p>
<p>services, are all equally important. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Choice 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Legal capacity and decision-making 
</b></p>
<p>15. Article 19 (a) requires States parties to ensure that persons with disabilities have the 
</p>
<p>opportunity to choose their place of residence and where and with whom they live on an 
</p>
<p>equal basis with others and are not obliged to live in a particular living arrangement. This 
</p>
<p>entails the possibility to choose from the same range of options as other members of 
</p>
<p>society, or to reject those options. 
</p>
<p>16. The right to equal recognition before the law of persons with disabilities, who shall 
</p>
<p>enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life (art. 12), underpins 
</p>
<p>the right to live independently in the community. Legal capacity consists of two inseparable 
</p>
<p>elements: to be recognized as a legal person before the law and to exercise rights as a legal 
</p>
<p>person under the law.13 The exercise of legal capacity as recognized in the Convention on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities requires that the will and preferences of a person are 
</p>
<p>respected, and allows for the exercise of free and informed consent. That, in turn, applies 
</p>
<p>to, among other matters, the acceptance or rejection of medical treatment, 
</p>
<p>institutionalization or other life-affecting interventions. Several States have recently 
</p>
<p>reformed their legal frameworks in line with article 12. In Peru, for example, full legal 
</p>
<p>capacity of persons with disabilities was recognized by the Government in its General Law 
</p>
<p>on Persons with Disabilities of 2012, in which it also mandated revision of the Civil Code. 
</p>
<p>The submissions received for the present study refer to other proposed or ongoing reforms. 
</p>
<p>It is crucial to note that in their legal reform processes States should actively consult with, 
</p>
<p>and involve, persons with disabilities and their representative organizations.  
</p>
<p>17. States must replace regimes that provide for substitute decision-making by 
</p>
<p>supported decision-making in order to address discrimination and the denial of legal 
</p>
<p>capacity to persons with disabilities. The new legal regime needs to comply with a number 
</p>
<p>of other defining elements.14 In the case of children with disabilities, primary consideration 
</p>
<p>needs to be given to the best interest of the child, including the right of children to express 
</p>
<p>their views in determining their best interest.15 
</p>
<p>18. Various forms of supported decision-making exist in some countries, while others 
</p>
<p>have forms of supported decision-making under consideration. The recently approved civil 
</p>
<p>code in Argentina includes the possibility of the provision of support in decision-making 
</p>
<p>processes. The  Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Bill currently under consideration in 
</p>
<p>Ireland would provide a statutory framework that maximizes individual autonomy and 
</p>
<p>establish an &#8220;office of the public guardian&#8221; to supervise those who provide such support. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>to article 15 at the third session of the Ad Hoc Committee, available from 
</p>
<p>www.un.org/esa/socdev/enable/rights/ahc3sum15.htm. 
</p>
<p> 13 See Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, general comment No. 1, paras. 12 and 14. 
</p>
<p> 14 Ibid., paras. 25&#8211;29. 
</p>
<p> 15 See Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 14 (2013) on the right of the child to 
</p>
<p>have his or her best interests taken as primary consideration, paras. 52&#8211;54. </p>


<p>19. Submissions received for the present report show that, in general, in every region of 
</p>
<p>the world laws or practices deprive persons with disabilities of their legal capacity. Often 
</p>
<p>third parties are given the right to make decisions on their behalf. Common schemes 
</p>
<p>include guardianship, incapacity to appeal against imposed guardianship, and involuntary 
</p>
<p>medical treatment. Substitute decision-making is a violation of article 19, as it shifts the 
</p>
<p>power from the individual to the guardian in decisions related to living arrangements, such 
</p>
<p>as whether and when to move from institution living to community living. While substitute 
</p>
<p>decision-making may affect a wide range of persons with disabilities, in many cases the 
</p>
<p>denial of legal capacity stems from mental health legislation, which results in persons with 
</p>
<p>psychosocial or intellectual disabilities being more likely to be denied the right to choose 
</p>
<p>their living arrangements. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Prohibition of forced institutionalization  
</b></p>
<p>20. Article 19, in conjunction with articles12 and 14, prohibits forced institutionalization 
</p>
<p>and deprivation of liberty on the basis of the existence of an impairment. In particular, 
</p>
<p>article 14 does not permit any exceptions on the basis of which persons may be detained on 
</p>
<p>the grounds of their actual or perceived disability, including perceived danger to themselves 
</p>
<p>or others, or lack of fitness to stand trial.16 However, despite those prohibitions, submissions 
</p>
<p>from all regions indicated that forced institutionalization continues to be widely practised. 
</p>
<p>Mental health legislation is usually the basis for institutionalization without consent (decided 
</p>
<p>by a judicial or administrative authority, or by a guardian) and for compulsory medical 
</p>
<p>measures. In many cases, the presumption of danger to oneself and others is a ground for 
</p>
<p>forced institutionalization. 
</p>
<p>21. While institutionalization can differ from one context to another, certain common 
</p>
<p>elements define it: isolation and segregation from community life; lack of control over day-
</p>
<p>to-day decisions; rigidity of routine, irrespective of personal preferences or needs; identical 
</p>
<p>activities in the same place for a group of persons under a central authority; a paternalistic 
</p>
<p>approach in the provision of services; supervision of living arrangements without consent; 
</p>
<p>and disproportion in the number of persons with disabilities living in the same environment. 
</p>
<p>Institutionalization is therefore not just about living in a particular setting; it is, above all, 
</p>
<p>about losing control as a result of the imposition of a certain living arrangement. In that 
</p>
<p>sense, small environments, including group homes, are not necessarily better than large 
</p>
<p>institutions if overall control remains with supervisors.  
</p>
<p>22. Living arrangements should be assessed taking into account issues such as the 
</p>
<p>choice of housemates, who decides when residents can enter or exit, who is allowed to enter 
</p>
<p>a person&#8217;s home, who decides the schedule of daily activities, who decides what food is 
</p>
<p>eaten and what is bought and who pays the expenses. Institutions that control those choices, 
</p>
<p>regardless of their size and name, are inconsistent with the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities and constitute a deprivation of liberty. Lack of thorough 
</p>
<p>understanding of what constitutes institutionalization for persons with disabilities may 
</p>
<p>result in the promotion of newer forms of institutions concealed by superficial changes. For 
</p>
<p>instance, splitting large institutions into smaller ones with the sole purpose of reducing the 
</p>
<p>number of persons living therein only results in the replacement of one type of institution 
</p>
<p>with another. 
</p>
<p>23. Segregation and institutionalization are often seen as the only available options. 
</p>
<p>However, as the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has made clear, 
</p>
<p>institutionalization is incompatible with article 19, and it is an obligation of States parties to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 16 Statement of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on article 14, issued at the 
</p>
<p>twelfth session of the Committee (CRPD/C/12/2, p. 14). </p>


<p>make alternatives available.17 Other drivers of institutionalization include the lack of 
</p>
<p>adequate knowledge among policymakers, vested interests of institutional care providers, 
</p>
<p>reduction in social and health-care budgets, lack of alternative resources for some persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities, unavailability of community-based services, and the conditionality of 
</p>
<p>support upon certain living arrangements. In the case of older persons with disabilities, age 
</p>
<p>and impairment, separately or jointly, could increase vulnerability to institutionalization.18 
</p>
<p>24. Cutting a person off from family, friends, education and employment through 
</p>
<p>institutionalization results in social exclusion, creates barriers to inclusion in the 
</p>
<p>community and reduces or denies the capacity of persons with disabilities to choose and 
</p>
<p>plan their lives. That inhibits their autonomy by fostering dependency, preventing persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities from reaching their full potential in terms of independence and social 
</p>
<p>participation. In addition, it has been widely documented that institutionalization may 
</p>
<p>render persons vulnerable to violence and abuse, with women with disabilities particularly 
</p>
<p>exposed to such risk. The risk of abuse is further exacerbated by the absence of public 
</p>
<p>scrutiny, a lack of access to remedies, a fear of reporting violations, and disability-related 
</p>
<p>communication barriers.19 Instances of abuse are in direct contradiction to the State&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>obligation to protect persons with disabilities from all forms of exploitation, violence and 
</p>
<p>abuse, including their gender-based aspects (art. 16).  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Deinstitutionalization 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities repeatedly urges States 
</p>
<p>parties to adopt adequately funded strategies for deinstitutionalization with clear time 
</p>
<p>frames and benchmarks, in cooperation with organizations of persons with disabilities.20 
</p>
<p>Deinstitutionalization is a process that provides for a shift in living arrangements for 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, from institutional and other segregating settings to a system 
</p>
<p>enabling social participation where services are provided in the community according to 
</p>
<p>individual will and preference. Such a shift entails a reclaiming of control over one&#8217;s life, 
</p>
<p>and requires that individualized support services (art. 19 (b)) be provided to, and 
</p>
<p>mainstream services and facilities be made available for and accessible to, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities (art. 19 (c)). Effective deinstitutionalization requires a systemic approach, in 
</p>
<p>which the transformation of residential institutional services is only one element of a wider 
</p>
<p>change in areas such as health care, rehabilitation, support services, education and 
</p>
<p>employment, as well as in the societal perception of disability. Evidence shows that 
</p>
<p>deinstitutionalization and adequate support enhances the quality of life and improves the 
</p>
<p>personal functioning abilities of persons with disabilities.21 The deinstitutionalization 
</p>
<p>process should also cover children with disabilities; in such cases, institutions should be

<p>replaced with families, extended families or foster-care systems. Specific steps should be 
</p>
<p>taken to avoid further institutionalization in the transition from care to aftercare.22 
</p>
<p>26. Deinstitutionalization should include public and private institutions to avoid transfer 
</p>
<p>from one to the other, and target all persons with disabilities, without exception. Real 
</p>
<p>options need to be made available to persons moving out of an institution: community 
</p>
<p>living arrangements should not be established and monitored by the institution itself. The  
</p>
<p>Government of Finland is currently implementing programmes providing individual 
</p>
<p>housing and community services for persons with intellectual disabilities, with a deadline of 
</p>
<p>2020 for full deinstitutionalization. Support is particularly important in the transition from 
</p>
<p>institutional to community living and should include individualized assessment, 
</p>
<p>information, counselling, housing and income assistance. Such support should be based on 
</p>
<p>effective coordination among health-care and social-service providers, and the housing 
</p>
<p>sector. The programme &#8220;I, just like you&#8221; implemented in Croatia has provided persons with 
</p>
<p>intellectual and psychosocial disabilities in institutions with individual planning and skills 
</p>
<p>development as a preparation for life in the community. Continued support is provided even 
</p>
<p>after the project&#8217;s beneficiaries move to community-based arrangements. In the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Korea, some local governments provide resettlement benefits to help persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities discharged from institutions to live independently in local communities. 
</p>
<p>27. The cost of deinstitutionalization should be addressed by a reallocation of resources, 
</p>
<p>which may require targeted investments, particularly in the initial phase, effective 
</p>
<p>partnerships and prioritization. Adequate resources need to be available to build the new 
</p>
<p>support infrastructure &#8212; both accessible mainstream community services and specific 
</p>
<p>support services &#8212; prior to altering the balance of service provision. Funding opportunities 
</p>
<p>should be directed to sustaining systemic reforms. For instance, in the new European Union 
</p>
<p>structural funds regulations for 2014&#8211;2020, the availability of funding is closely linked to 
</p>
<p>deinstitutionalization through a number of ex ante conditionalities. Community-based 
</p>
<p>services should exist alongside institutions during the transition phase, necessitating double 
</p>
<p>funding. Studies have demonstrated that after the initial phase, community-based services 
</p>
<p>are not necessarily more expensive than institutional services; on the contrary, they are 
</p>
<p>more cost-effective and provide higher quality services.23 The comparison of the costs of 
</p>
<p>institutional care and those of community-based services should also take into account the 
</p>
<p>long-term impact of deinstitutionalization, including the fiscal implications of a higher 
</p>
<p>number of persons with disabilities being part of the workforce and household income.24 
</p>
<p><b> B. Support 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Community support services 
</b></p>
<p>28. Support services are essential for enabling persons with disabilities to live 
</p>
<p>independently and be included in the community; they are also an indispensable element of 
</p>
<p>deinstitutionalization. Article 19 (b) of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
</p>
<p>Disabilities requires States parties to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to a 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 22 See Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 9, paras. 47&#8211;49, and the Guidelines 
</p>
<p>for the Alternative Care of Children, in particular paras. 3, 14, 22, 34 and 132. 
</p>
<p> 23 See WHO and World Bank, <i>World Report</i>, p. 149, and Council of Europe Commissioner for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights, &#8220;The right of people with disabilities to live independently&#8221;, p. 32. 
</p>
<p> 24 On the impact of employment of persons with disabilities on the gross domestic product, see, for 
</p>
<p>instance, Sebastian Buckup, &#8220;The price of exclusion: the economic consequences of excluding people 
</p>
<p>with disabilities from the world of work&#8221;, Employment Working Paper No. 43 (International Labour 
</p>
<p>Office, 2009).  </p>


<p>range of in-home, residential and other community support services, including personal 
</p>
<p>assistance necessary to support living and inclusion in the community, and to prevent 
</p>
<p>isolation or segregation from the community. Support provided in segregated settings to 
</p>
<p>continue institutionalization is therefore not compliant with the Convention. 
</p>
<p>29. No single option of support fits all contexts. Therefore, article 19 (b) includes a 
</p>
<p>reference to a range of services that can involve different providers. There are, however, 
</p>
<p>certain criteria that need to be met based on the principle that support as intended by 
</p>
<p>article 19 implies a shift from &#8220;care&#8221; to &#8220;rights&#8221;. All persons with disabilities should have 
</p>
<p>equal access to, an equal choice of, and control over support services that respect their 
</p>
<p>inherent dignity and individual autonomy and aim to achieve effective participation and 
</p>
<p>inclusion in society. The promotion of participation and self-reliance as a goal of support 
</p>
<p>should also extend to children with disabilities, whose inclusion in society is at the core of 
</p>
<p>both article 23 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and article 7 of the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.25 
</p>
<p>30. In-home support services include assistance with self-care and housekeeping. In 
</p>
<p>Cuba, for instance, persons with disabilities living independently can have access to the 
</p>
<p>State-funded domestic social assistant service, which provides personal and domestic 
</p>
<p>support. In any case, in-home support must contribute to promoting inclusion and 
</p>
<p>preventing segregation. It should not prevent a person from leaving the home when he or 
</p>
<p>she desires and should be complemented, where needed, by other community-based 
</p>
<p>services. 
</p>
<p>31. States have established various forms of residential support and accommodation in 
</p>
<p>independent living homes. Residential support must respect the choice of the individual to 
</p>
<p>avoid forms of institutionalization. Day-care centres may also lead to isolation and 
</p>
<p>stigmatization if they are used to keep persons with disabilities separate from the 
</p>
<p>community.26 
</p>
<p>32. Submissions referred to a wide range of other community support services, often so-
</p>
<p>called centres for independent living. The support provided in such cases is geared towards 
</p>
<p>information and advice, self and peer support, protection of rights and interests, shelters, 
</p>
<p>housing services, training for independent living, supported decision-making and personal 
</p>
<p>assistance.27 States mentioned transportation and communication support, such as the 
</p>
<p>provision of a sign language interpreter. Community support in the form of professionalized 
</p>
<p>assessments of individual needs or family crisis services, such as mediation and support in 
</p>
<p>cases of violence, has been directed to families. Here, the concept of community should not 
</p>
<p>be necessarily limited to a geographic and physical location: some persons with autism 
</p>
<p>have found that support provided online may be more effective, in certain cases, than 
</p>
<p>support received in person.28 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Personal assistance 
</b></p>
<p>33. Personal assistance fosters inclusion by supporting persons with disabilities to 
</p>
<p>participate fully in community life. Under the Swedish Act concerning Support and Service 
</p>
<p>for Persons with Certain Functional Impairments, for instance, personal assistance can 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 25 See also Committee on the Rights of the Child, general comment No. 9.

</i></p>
<p><i>Article 19: The Right to Live and Be Included in the Community </i>(2012), p. 78.  
</p>
<p> 27 See the specific support services for the different constituencies of persons with disabilities 
</p>
<p>referenced in the contribution by International Disability Alliance.  
</p>
<p> 28 See the joint contribution by Autistic Minority International, Alliance Autiste (France) and 
</p>

<p>include individually designed support for personal hygiene, meals, dressing, mobility and 
</p>
<p>communicating with others. Persons with greater support needs in Thailand can apply for a 
</p>
<p>personal assistant for a maximum period of six hours per day or 180 hours per month. In 
</p>
<p>the Republic of Korea, about 50,000 persons with disabilities had benefited from personal 
</p>
<p>assistance services as at January 2013.  
</p>
<p>34. Personal assistance should be available to all persons with disabilities. However, in 
</p>
<p>many countries it is available only to persons with certain impairments. The Committee on 
</p>
<p>the Rights of Persons with Disabilities has expressed concern at such limitations in its 
</p>
<p>dialogue with States parties.29 A range of personal assistance approaches, including peer 
</p>
<p>support and advocacy, crisis respite and planning, non-medical support to deal with altered 
</p>
<p>perceptions, assistance to meet practical needs of everyday life, advocates for decision-
</p>
<p>making support and living support networks to help make connections in the community, 
</p>
<p>have proved particularly beneficial to persons with psychosocial or intellectual disabilities. 
</p>
<p>The provision of access to personal assistants for persons with intellectual and psychosocial 
</p>
<p>disabilities is essential to moving from a medical to a social approach concerning mental 
</p>
<p>health issues with respect to personal autonomy. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Naturally occurring community support 
</b></p>
<p>35. Alongside the variety of services identified, naturally occurring community support 
</p>
<p>is provided informally to persons with disabilities by family, friends or other members of 
</p>
<p>the community. In some countries policies stipulate that the responsibility to assist persons 
</p>
<p>with disabilities rests with their families. That approach is also sometimes encouraged 
</p>
<p>through incentives such as social security benefits, allowances and pension schemes or 
</p>
<p>eligibility criteria to qualify as service providers. 
</p>
<p>36. Support provided by family, friends and the broader community is extremely 
</p>
<p>important and should be encouraged in order to promote inclusive and respectful societies; 
</p>
<p>in many situations this is the only support available. Nevertheless, exclusive reliance on 
</p>
<p>informal support can have adverse consequences, including by endorsing gender 
</p>
<p>stereotypes of women as care providers. When women are the principal care providers in 
</p>
<p>families, as mothers they are often exposed to higher levels of stress and fatigue, and as 
</p>
<p>siblings they lose out on opportunities for education. Family support may also affect the 
</p>
<p>choice and control that persons with disabilities exercise over the type of support required, 
</p>
<p>in particular when support is encouraged by State benefits. Women with disabilities may 
</p>
<p>also be exposed to higher risks of segregation, violence and abuse. Provision of informal 
</p>
<p>support may mean that the number of working members in the family is reduced, which 
</p>
<p>will have a direct impact on household income and gross domestic product. Finally, relying 
</p>
<p>on informal support may not be sustainable, as the family members may not be able to 
</p>
<p>provide such support as they age or if they fall ill.30 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Requisites for adequate support 
</b></p>
<p>37. In certain contexts training is essential, in order to ensure that support is in 
</p>
<p>conformity with the standards of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 
</p>
<p>responds to needs and respects the individual&#8217;s will. The Personal Assistants Training 
</p>
<p>Programme in Trinidad and Tobago, for instance, comprises classroom and practical 
</p>
<p>training, as well as a 15-month period of on-the-job training. Certification and evaluation 
</p>
<p>are equally important. Specific training should be directed at professionals who currently 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 29 See, for instance, CRPD/C/AUT/CO/1. 
</p>
<p> 30 See, for instance, WHO and World Bank, <i>World Report</i>, p. 142. </p>


<p>work, as well as those who formerly worked, in residential institutions to ensure that they 
</p>
<p>actively contribute to the transformation and complement the deinstitutionalization process. 
</p>
<p>38. Persons with disabilities must have control over the support provided and be the 
</p>
<p>ones who hire, employ, supervise, evaluate and dismiss their assistants. The possibility to 
</p>
<p>choose between different service providers is a way to make the services more accountable, 
</p>
<p>increase control by the user and provide protection against the risk of abuse. There may be 
</p>
<p>a variety of providers, including the State, as well as providers from the private and non-
</p>
<p>profit sector, although in practice the choice may be limited by the type of impairment or 
</p>
<p>the available service alternatives. Payment to users rather than providers contributes to 
</p>
<p>ensuring that the support is person-centred and respects the preferences of the person with 
</p>
<p>disabilities. In several countries, direct payments rather than services in kind have been 
</p>
<p>introduced, often in the form of a personal budget payable to the eligible person. In 
</p>
<p>Germany, by 2009 about 10,000 recipients, 31 per cent of whom were persons with 
</p>
<p>intellectual disabilities, had opted to receive vouchers. Independent planning support and 
</p>
<p>facilitation services may be required to assist the person in deciding how to use personal 
</p>
<p>budgets. The National Disability Insurance Scheme currently being piloted in Australia will 
</p>
<p>provide persons with disabilities with individualized planning support to identify suitable 
</p>
<p>and necessary services based on their functional needs rather than on diagnosis.  
</p>
<p>39. Lack of adequate human resources, poor service coordination, disparities in access 
</p>
<p>between urban and rural settings, and the conditions attached to the provision of support 
</p>
<p>(for example, when dependent on a specific living arrangement) are some of the common 
</p>
<p>barriers to adequate community support services. Lack of information and awareness is 
</p>
<p>often another reason for the exclusion of persons with disabilities. Inappropriate policy and 
</p>
<p>institutional frameworks, as well as the lack of knowledge of policymakers and service 
</p>
<p>providers, often result in low quality support, routinely geared towards medical or charity 
</p>
<p>approaches. There have been instances in which personal assistance has been misused. At 
</p>
<p>the policy level, regulations have failed to establish guarantees for user control over budget 
</p>
<p>and services. At the practical level, service providers have absorbed budgets to cover 
</p>
<p>general expenses, instead of providing individualized services, or personal assistants have 
</p>
<p>imposed decisions or actions on the user. In order to avoid such abuse and ensure that the 
</p>
<p>user has control over the budget and supervision of the personal assistant, a correct 
</p>
<p>understanding of the concept of personal assistance is essential.31 This is also needed to 
</p>
<p>enable users to enjoy access to effective redress and remedy.  
</p>
<p>40. Eligibility criteria for access to support services need to be defined in a non-
</p>
<p>discriminatory way. In particular, the assessment should shift from a medical to a human 
</p>
<p>rights-based approach to disability, focus on the needs of the person rather than the 
</p>
<p>impairment32 and respect individual choice and preferences by ensuring the participation of 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities in the decision-making process. In defining criteria, it is also 
</p>
<p>important to ensure that persons with disabilities have equal access to support. Here, 
</p>
<p>adopting an open concept on disability compliant with the Convention on the Rights of 
</p>
<p>Persons with Disabilities (art. 1, second paragraph) is an essential step. 
</p>
<p>41. There are different options for covering the costs of support services. Some States 
</p>
<p>cover the entire budget for service delivery and provision, while others share costs with 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries. Sometimes services are provided directly by organizations of persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities, which can receive co-financing by State or local government, or can raise their 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 31 The European Network on Independent Living, for instance, has proposed a definition of personal 
</p>
<p>assistance, available from www.enil.eu/policy/. 
</p>
<p> 32 The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disability has expressed concern about linking the 
</p>
<p>eligibility of social services to a specific grade of disability. See, for instance, CRPD/C/ESP/CO/1. </p>


<p>own funds. The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities repeatedly calls on 
</p>
<p>States to allocate adequate resources for support services that enable persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities to live in their communities.33 
</p>
<p>42. Austerity measures have had a significant negative impact on the financing and 
</p>
<p>provision of support in many countries. Measures have included direct budget cuts, closure 
</p>
<p>and merging of services, delivery of more standardized and/or institutional services, cuts in 
</p>
<p>staffing and conditions, cuts in independent-living support, delays in payments from the 
</p>
<p>public to the non-profit sector, postponement of reforms, longer waiting lists and increased 
</p>
<p>privatization of services.34 In some cases, independent-living funds have been closed 
</p>
<p>entirely to new applicants, hence drastically reducing the number of recipients of personal 
</p>
<p>budgets. Austerity measures raise important concerns in relation to the States&#8217; obligations 
</p>
<p>of non-retrogression,35 non-discrimination and compliance with minimum core obligations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Availability of community services and facilities 
</b></p>
<p>43. Persons with disabilities must be allowed access to mainstream community services 
</p>
<p>and facilities to fully enjoy their right to live independently and be included in the 
</p>
<p>community. Article 19 (c) requires States parties to ensure that community services and 
</p>
<p>facilities for the general population are available on an equal basis to persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities and are responsive to their needs. This is to be interpreted broadly to cover all 
</p>
<p>services and facilities provided for in society, and can include, by way of illustration, the 
</p>
<p>rights to attend a community school, to use the general transport system and to have access 
</p>
<p>to work in the open job market depending on individual aspirations and qualifications. In 
</p>
<p>combination with specific support services, the availability of community services and 
</p>
<p>facilities is also essential for successful deinstitutionalization. 
</p>
<p>44. Article 19 (c) flows from the general principles of article 3, in particular those of full 
</p>
<p>and effective participation and inclusion in society and of respect for difference and 
</p>
<p>acceptance of persons with disabilities as part of human diversity. Building an inclusive 
</p>
<p>community requires (a) the removal of barriers; (b) systemic transformation of mainstream 
</p>
<p>services in society; and (c) an inclusive process in which persons with disabilities are 
</p>
<p>actively involved. 
</p>
<p>45. Obligations under article 9 of the Convention include taking appropriate measures to 
</p>
<p>ensure to persons with disabilities access, on an equal basis with others, to the physical 
</p>
<p>environment, to transportation, to information and communications and to other facilities 
</p>
<p>and services open or provided to the public. Contributions from all regions show advances 
</p>
<p>in the adaptation of public buildings and facilities, roads and transportation, to enhance 
</p>
<p>accessibility. Other measures include the revision of building control acts and urban 
</p>
<p>planning codes, the modification of the information environment, and the inclusion of 
</p>
<p>standards of universal design in a variety of sectors. Measures have also been adopted in 
</p>
<p>the housing sector to ensure that new dwellings are built according to accessibility 
</p>
<p>standards and that persons with disabilities are included in social housing schemes. 
</p>

</p>
<p> 35 See for instance Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 19 
</p>
<p>(2007) on the right to social security, paras. 42 and 64. </p>


<p>Inclusive education systems are promoted in some countries, although persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities still face various forms of discrimination in education settings. Measures to 
</p>
<p>encourage employment of persons with disabilities are also common, although there is a 
</p>
<p>consistent practice of sheltered work, contrary to article 27 of the Convention on the Rights 
</p>
<p>of Persons with Disabilities. Sheltered work in effect prevents inclusion and interaction 
</p>
<p>with the community.36 
</p>
<p>46. Community-based rehabilitation can be an effective platform for supporting the 
</p>
<p>inclusion of persons with disabilities in the development of their communities. Over the 
</p>
<p>years, community-based rehabilitation has evolved from a medical-focused, often single-
</p>
<p>sector approach of service delivery, to a &#8220;strategy within general community development 
</p>
<p>for the rehabilitation, equalization of opportunities, and social inclusion of all people with 
</p>
<p>disabilities&#8221;.37 The community-based rehabilitation guidelines published in 2010 by the 
</p>
<p>World Health Organization are aimed at promoting access of persons with disabilities to the 
</p>
<p>mainstream health, education, social and employment sectors, while identifying new areas 
</p>
<p>for development with regard to support services, such as personal assistance. The positive 
</p>
<p>impact of community-based rehabilitation was highlighted in the submissions received, in 
</p>
<p>particular those from El Salvador and Nicaragua, where other services for supporting 
</p>
<p>independent life are not yet fully developed. 
</p>
<p>47. Informal networks play an important role in building an inclusive society. Family 
</p>
<p>group conferencing is a practice found in several countries. In the Netherlands, the 
</p>
<p>Eindhoven Model applies family group conferencing to actual or potential psychosocial 
</p>
<p>crisis situations, using the network of the family, friends, neighbours, peers and other 
</p>
<p>persons to prevent forced psychiatric interventions. &#8220;Microboards&#8221;, composed of a small 
</p>
<p>group of friends and family, have also been used in some countries to engage community 
</p>
<p>members to provide sustained support structures. Regardless of the nature of informal 
</p>
<p>networks, article 19 requires that persons with disabilities exercise full decision-making 
</p>
<p>abilities, with the network playing a supportive role.38 
</p>
<p>48. Inadequate or inaccessible infrastructure and remoteness are common reasons for 
</p>
<p>discrimination against persons with disabilities in access to community services. States 
</p>
<p>have an immediate obligation to provide reasonable accommodation in the absence of 
</p>
<p>general accessibility measures in accordance with articles 2 and 5 of the Convention. While 
</p>
<p>ageing cannot be equated with impairment, older persons with disabilities constitute a large 
</p>
<p>section of the population and are particularly vulnerable to exclusion.39 The ongoing 
</p>
<p>development of new standards on older persons should not be regressive and must build on 
</p>
<p>the norms of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>49. Building inclusive systems requires public investment and may appear costly. 
</p>
<p>However, it is evident that providing for accessibility and inclusion from the outset is more 
</p>
<p>cost-effective than adapting services and facilities at a later stage. Inclusive societies are 
</p>
<p>also more cost-effective in the long term, in that they enable persons with disabilities to 
</p>
<p>fully participate and contribute to economic, social, political and cultural life. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 36 In previous reports to the Human Rights Council, OHCHR has addressed inclusion in employment 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/22/25) and inclusive education (A/HRC/25/29 and Corr.1).

<p><b> IV. National implementation 
</b></p>
<p>50. Existing studies and submissions for the present report highlight significant 
</p>
<p>differences, including at the intraregional level, in the availability of community services to 
</p>
<p>persons with disabilities, the provision of individualized support and the opportunities to 
</p>
<p>choose services.40 National implementation should be sensitive to local and cultural 
</p>
<p>approaches, including to rural and indigenous practices, placing persons with disability at 
</p>
<p>the center of the control over their life.  
</p>
<p>51. Persons with disabilities and their representative organizations should be actively 
</p>
<p>involved in the implementation of article 19, including in the development and 
</p>
<p>implementation of legislation, policies and programmes, as stipulated in article 4, paragraph 
</p>
<p>3, of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>52. There is a range of legislative and administrative measures that States should 
</p>
<p>consider in order to avoid exclusion of, and discrimination against, persons with 
</p>
<p>disabilities.41 In most cases, establishing equal recognition before the law and legal capacity 
</p>
<p>for persons with disabilities requires revision of the civil law. The legal framework should 
</p>
<p>recognize the right of persons with disabilities to live independently and be included in the 
</p>
<p>community, and provisions allowing for forced institutionalization should be repealed. In 
</p>
<p>some cases, States have not taken full advantage of reform processes and have made only 
</p>
<p>partial advances. It is important that legislative reviews be aimed at integrating the 
</p>
<p>standards of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in all sectors, not 
</p>
<p>just in one. 
</p>
<p>53. Deinstitutionalization plans should envisage a systemic transformation and the 
</p>
<p>progressive increase of support and alternative services available in the community, and 
</p>
<p>provide for a realistic time frame. This requires the reallocation of resources from 
</p>
<p>institutions to community support services and an end to the creation of new institutions or 
</p>
<p>structural refurbishment of those that exist. Where residential institutions do not exist, 
</p>
<p>States should not reproduce outdated models but rather implement approaches that promote 
</p>
<p>and protect the rights of persons with disabilities to live independently and be included in 
</p>
<p>the community. 
</p>
<p>54. States have the responsibility to set relevant non-discriminatory standards for both 
</p>
<p>support services and mainstream community services, and to provide adequate funding. In 
</p>
<p>that sense, it may be effective to include support services in the formulation of a national 
</p>
<p>disability policy and related action plans. Where States do not provide support services 
</p>
<p>directly, they should ensure that, in compliance with article 19, privatization does not 
</p>
<p>negatively affect the availability, accessibility, affordability and quality of services. Support 
</p>
<p>should remain driven by the needs of the individual, not the interests of the provider. 
</p>
<p>55. Ministries in charge of the implementation of policies on service provision differ 
</p>
<p>from one country to the next. Often ministries with social/welfare portfolios play a major 
</p>
<p>role in providing support services, housing and infrastructure for inclusive environments. In 
</p>
<p>order to guard against an exclusively medical approach to support and services, it is better 
</p>
<p>if all support-related portfolios are not entirely the responsibility of the ministry of health. 
</p>
<p>However, health ministries, together with the ministries of justice, have a particular role in 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 40 See, for instance, Inclusion International, <i>Inclusive Communities</i>, chap. 5. 
</p>
<p> 41 Including the provision of reasonable accommodation in line with articles 2 and 5 of the Convention 
</p>
<p>on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. </p>


<p>ensuring free and informed consent to prevent forced institutionalization and deprivation of 
</p>
<p>liberty.42 
</p>
<p>56. Submissions for the study contained descriptions of the variety of mechanisms in 
</p>
<p>place to monitor the implementation of deinstitutionalization policies and the incidence of 
</p>
<p>abuse in current segregated settings, and to ensure access to justice. Such mechanisms 
</p>
<p>include general judicial remedies, national human rights institutions, ombudsmen, specific 
</p>
<p>bodies established by disability laws, insurance bodies and independent monitoring 
</p>
<p>mechanisms established in line with article 33, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which requires that States parties take into account the 
</p>
<p>principles relating to the status and functioning of national institutions for the protection 
</p>
<p>and promotion of human rights. In some States, including Lithuania, specific inter-
</p>
<p>institutional bodies have been established to oversee the deinstitutionalization process. 
</p>
<p>National preventive mechanisms created in compliance with the Optional Protocol to the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment have also been mandated, in some cases, to monitor residential institutions. 
</p>
<p>Regardless of the mechanism, its independence must be secured and guided by the 
</p>
<p>standards of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p><b> V. International cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>57. International cooperation has, in some cases, been directed to promote independent 
</p>
<p>and community living. In Serbia, Oxfam, Handicap International, Irish Aid and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Development Programme funded pilot projects of personal assistance services from 
</p>
<p>2001 to 2009. In 2013, the Special Rapporteur on disability of the Commission for Social 
</p>
<p>Development worked with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency to establish two 
</p>
<p>independent living centres in Johannesburg, South Africa to build local capacities and 
</p>
<p>replicate the model in other parts of South Africa and the region.43 In the Republic of 
</p>
<p>Moldova, the partnership between OHCHR and the Ministry of Health led to a system-wide 
</p>
<p>decision in 2013 to move, within 18 months, from reliance on large psychiatric hospitals to 
</p>
<p>community-based support. In addition, OHCHR-led United Nations cooperation 
</p>
<p>contributed to the establishment in 2014 of the first non-governmental organization of users 
</p>
<p>and survivors of psychiatry in the Republic of Moldova, and the subsequent opening of the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s first user-managed community center and multiple-service provider. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Article 19 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>illustrates the paradigm shift from a medical and charity approach to a social and 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights-based approach to disability. Persons with disabilities, without 
</b></p>
<p><b>exception, have the right to live independently and be included in the community. In 
</b></p>
<p><b>practice, however, some groups are more likely to be excluded than others.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>States parties have the obligation to comply with article 19 by putting an end to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the segregation of persons with disabilities and enabling them to have control over 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 42 See the thematic report by OHCHR on the structure and role of national mechanisms for the 
</p>
<p>implementation and monitoring of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/13/29).

<p>Persons with Disabilities (E/CN.5/2013/10).  </p>


<p><b>their lives, irrespective of whether services to that end are provided by the private 
</b></p>
<p><b>sector. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Forced institutionalization violates the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>with Disabilities, as it is a form of deprivation of liberty based on the existence of an 
</b></p>
<p><b>impairment, and must be discontinued. States parties must establish full recognition 
</b></p>
<p><b>before the law of all persons with disabilities and ensure that they are able to exercise 
</b></p>
<p><b>choice and control over their lives on an equal basis with others, with access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>supported decision-making when needed. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Deinstitutionalization requires a systemic transformation that goes beyond the 
</b></p>
<p><b>closure of institutional settings. In order to enable social participation, it should 
</b></p>
<p><b>provide for (a) individualized support services and (b) inclusive mainstream services 
</b></p>
<p><b>in full respect for the will and preference of persons with disabilities. Newer forms of 
</b></p>
<p><b>institutionalization tend to be concealed by superficial changes that do not transfer 
</b></p>
<p><b>actual control from service providers to the service users as required by the human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights-based approach to disability. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Support for persons with disabilities engages different suppliers and settings. 
</b></p>
<p><b>In-home, residential and other community services can offer quality support while 
</b></p>
<p><b>reducing adverse consequences for the family and for gender equality. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Personal assistance is an effective means to ensure the right to live 
</b></p>
<p><b>independently and be included in the community in ways that respect the inherent 
</b></p>
<p><b>dignity, individual autonomy and independence of persons with disabilities. Personal 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance should be available to all persons with disabilities, including those with 
</b></p>
<p><b>intellectual and psychosocial disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Persons with disabilities are the best experts regarding their needs. Allocating 
</b></p>
<p><b>budgets to service users rather than service providers shifts the control and choice to 
</b></p>
<p><b>persons with disabilities and ultimately improves the quality of support. Training is 
</b></p>
<p><b>also important to ensure that the support provided is of adequate quality and 
</b></p>
<p><b>complies with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>High quality individualized support and inclusive mainstream services may 
</b></p>
<p><b>require an initial investment. However, inclusive societies, in which persons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>disabilities fully participate and contribute to the economic, social, political and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cultural life, are more cost-effective in the long term. Resource limitations should not 
</b></p>
<p><b>be a reason for inaction; rather, effective partnerships and relevant, rights-based 
</b></p>
<p><b>prioritization should be promoted. Austerity measures should not justify retrogressive 
</b></p>
<p><b>steps. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities contains the most 
</b></p>
<p><b>recent norms relating to the right to live independently and be included in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>community, which should be considered the minimum standards when developing 
</b></p>
<p><b>future human rights instruments at global or regional levels.
