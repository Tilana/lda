INTREPID POTASH, INC.
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
"Intrepid," "our," "we," or "us" means Intrepid Potash, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Note 1— COMPANY BACKGROUND
We are the only producer of muriate of potash (“potassium chloride” or “potash”) in the United
States and one of two producers of langbeinite ("sulfate of potash magnesia"), which we market
and sell as Trio®. We sell potash and Trio® primarily into the agricultural market as a fertilizer.
We also sell these products into the animal feed market as a nutritional supplement and sell
potash into the industrial market as a component in drilling and fracturing fluids for oil and gas
wells and other industrial inputs. Our revenues are generated exclusively from the sale of potash
and Trio®. We also produce salt and magnesium chloride from our potash mining processes, the
sales of which are accounted for as by-product credits to our cost of sales. These by-product
credits represented approximately 2% to 3% of total cost of goods sold in each of the last three
years.
During the first quarter, we produced potash from three solution mining facilities and two
conventional underground mining facilities. Our solution mining production comes from our HB
solar solution mine near Carlsbad, New Mexico, a solar solution mine near Moab, Utah, and a
solar brine recovery mine in Wendover, Utah. Our conventional production of potash came from
our underground West and East mines near Carlsbad, New Mexico. We also operate the North
compaction facility near Carlsbad, New Mexico, which services the West and HB mines. We
produce Trio® from our underground conventional East mine.
In April 2016, we converted our East facility from a mixed-ore facility that produced both potash
and Trio® to a Trio®-only facility. We expect our commissioning activities related to that transition
to continue into the second half of 2016. Subsequent to the transition, we no longer produce
potash at our East facility.
In May 2016, we initiated a plan to idle mining operations at our West facility and transition it into
a care-and- maintenance mode due to the decline in potash prices. We expect the transition to
occur in July 2016. After the transition of West, all of our potash will be produced from our three
solution mining facilities.
Note 2— SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Principles of Consolidation—Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and
those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal
recurring accruals considered necessary for a fair presentation of interim financial information,
have been included.
The lenders under our credit facility have agreed to waive until no later than July 31, 2016, the
requirements under our credit facility that we comply with certain financial covenants and that we
deliver audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, without any
going concern modification. In addition, the holders of our senior notes have agreed to waive
until June 30, 2016, the requirement under the terms of the senior notes that we comply with
certain financial covenants. If current market conditions continue, we anticipate that our adjusted
EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other
expenses, as defined in the credit facility) will not be sufficient for us to return to compliance with
these covenants through 2016. As a result, we are proactively working with our lenders and
evaluating our options, which could include additional covenant amendments, waivers, or
forbearances, alternative financing arrangements, a possible further reduction in the amount of
the facility, and a possible reduction of our outstanding debt (including the payment of
prepayment penalties). Our continued failure to comply with these covenants after June 30, 2016,
will result in an event of default under the terms of the senior notes and a cross-default under the
credit facility that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding
indebtedness, including the acceleration of our senior notes and any amounts outstanding under
the credit facility. If the lenders were to make such a demand for repayment, we would be unable
to pay the obligations as we do not have existing facilities or sufficient cash on hand to satisfy
these obligations. With this material uncertainty surrounding compliance with our debt covenants,
declining revenues, lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments, and negative cash flows from
operations, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While we
will continue to work with our lenders, there can be no assurance that we will be successful. The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis,
6
Table of Contents
which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course
of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going
concern.
Reclassifications—Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in order to conform to the
current period presentation. In accordance with the adoption of new accounting standards
indicated in note 16, we have reclassified deferred financing costs associated with our
outstanding debt from "Other current assets" and "Other assets" to "Long-term debt, net."
Use of Estimates—The preparation of financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.
Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, those for proven and probable mineral
reserves, the related present value of estimated future net cash flows, useful lives of plant assets,
asset retirement obligations, normal inventory production levels, inventory valuations, the
valuation of equity awards, valuation of investments, the valuation of receivables, valuation of our
deferred tax assets, and estimated blended income tax rates utilized in the current and deferred
income tax calculations. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
proven and probable reserves, projecting future rates of production, and the timing of
development expenditures. Future mineral prices may vary significantly from the prices in effect
at the time the estimates are made, as may estimates of future operating costs. The estimate of
proven and probable mineral reserves, the related present value of estimated future cash flows,
and useful lives of plant assets can affect various other items, including depletion; the net
carrying value of our mineral properties; the useful lives of related property, plant, and equipment;
depreciation expense; and estimates associated with recoverability of long-lived assets and
asset retirement obligations. Specific to income tax items, we experience fluctuations in the
valuation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities due to changing state income tax rates and the
blend of state tax rates.
Revenue Recognition—Revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists; risks
and rewards of ownership have been transferred to customers, which is generally when title
passes; the selling price is fixed and determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. Title
passes at the designated shipping point for the majority of sales, but, in a few cases, title passes
at the delivery destination. The shipping point may be the plant, a distribution warehouse, a
customer warehouse, or a port. Title passes for some international shipments upon payment by
the purchaser; however, revenue is not recognized for these transactions until shipment because
the risks and rewards of ownership have not transferred pursuant to a contractual arrangement.
Prices are generally set at the time of, or prior to, shipment. In cases where the final price is
determined after shipment and agreed to with our customer, revenue is recognized when the final
sales price is fixed and determinable and the other revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Sales are reported on a gross basis. We quote prices to customers both on a delivered basis and
on the basis of pick-up at our plants and warehouses. When a sale occurs on a delivered basis,
we incur and, in turn, bill the customer and record as gross revenue the product sales value,
freight, packaging, and certain other distribution costs. Many customers, however, arrange and
pay for these costs directly and, in these situations, only the product sales are included in gross
revenues.
Inventory—Inventory consists of product and by-product stocks that are ready for sale; mined ore;
potash in evaporation ponds, which is considered work-in-process; and parts and supplies
inventory. Product and by-product inventory cost is determined using the lower of weighted
average cost or estimated net realizable value and includes direct costs, maintenance,
operational overhead, depreciation, depletion, and equipment lease costs applicable to the
production process. Direct costs, maintenance, and operational overhead include labor and
associated benefits.
We evaluate our production levels and costs to determine if any should be deemed abnormal
and therefore excluded from inventory costs and expensed directly during the applicable period.
The assessment of normal production levels is judgmental and unique to each period. We model
normal production levels and evaluate historical ranges of production by operating plant in
assessing what is deemed to be normal.
Property, Plant, Equipment, Mineral Properties, and Development Costs—Property, plant, and
equipment are stated at historical cost. Expenditures for property, plant, and equipment relating to
new assets or improvements are capitalized, provided the expenditure extends the useful life of
an asset or extends the asset’s functionality. Property, plant, and equipment are depreciated
under the straight-line method using estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of
property, plant, and equipment are evaluated periodically as changes in estimates occur. No
depreciation is taken on assets classified as construction in progress until the asset is placed into
service. Gains and losses are recorded upon retirement,
7
Table of Contents
sale, or disposal of assets. Maintenance and repair costs are recognized as period costs when
incurred. Capitalized interest, to the extent of debt outstanding, is calculated and capitalized on
assets that are being constructed, drilled, or built or that are otherwise classified as construction
in progress.
Mineral properties and development costs, which are referred to collectively as mineral
properties, include acquisition costs, the cost of drilling production wells, and the cost of other
development work, all of which are capitalized. Depletion of mineral properties is calculated
using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the relevant ore body. The lives of
reserves used for accounting purposes are shorter than current reserve life determinations due to
uncertainties inherent in long-term estimates. These reserve life estimates have been prepared
by us and reviewed and independently determined by mine consultants. Tons of potash and
langbeinite in the proven and probable reserves are expressed in terms of expected finished tons
of product to be realized, net of estimated losses. Market price fluctuations of potash or Trio®, as
well as increased production costs or reduced recovery rates, could render proven and probable
reserves containing relatively lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might
result in a reduction of reserves. In addition, the provisions of our mineral leases, including
royalty provisions, are subject to periodic readjustment by the state and federal government,
which could affect the economics of our reserve estimates. Significant changes in the estimated
reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.
Earnings (Loss) per Share—Basic net income or loss per common share of stock is calculated by
dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average basic
common shares outstanding for the respective period.
Diluted net income or loss per common share of stock is calculated by dividing net income or
loss by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding, which includes the effect of
potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities for the diluted earnings or loss per
share calculation consist of awards of non-vested restricted shares of common stock, non-vested
performance units, and non-qualified stock options. The dilutive effect of stock based
compensation arrangements are computed using the treasury stock method. Following the lapse
of the vesting period of restricted shares of common stock, the shares are considered issued and
therefore are included in the number of issued and outstanding shares for purposes of these
calculations.

Note 3— (LOSS) EARNINGS PER SHARE
Potentially dilutive securities, including non-vested restricted common stock, stock options, and
performance units, are excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding
computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect, such as when there is a net
loss. The treasury stock method is used to measure the dilutive impact of non-vested restricted
common stock, stock options outstanding, and performance units. The following table shows the
shares that have an anti-dilutive effect and are excluded from the diluted weighted average
shares outstanding computations:

Parts inventories are shown net of any required allowances. At March 31, 2016, and 2015,
allowances for parts inventory obsolescence were $3.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, we recorded charges of
approximately $9.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as a result of routine assessments of
the lower of weighted average cost or estimated net realizable value of our finished goods
product inventory.
During the first quarter of 2016, we temporarily suspended potash production at our East facility
for a total of three days as we performed a langbeinite-only testing run. As a result of the

temporary suspension of production, we determined that approximately $0.7 million of production
costs at our East facility would have been allocated to additional tons produced, assuming we
had been operating at normal production rates. Accordingly, these costs were excluded from our
inventory values and instead expensed in the first quarter of 2016 as period production costs. We
compare actual production relative to what we estimated could have been produced if we had not
incurred the temporary production suspensions and lower operating rates in order to determine
the abnormal cost adjustment.

Note 7— DEBT
Unsecured Credit Facility—We have an unsecured credit facility, led by U.S. Bank, as
administrative agent, and Wells Fargo Bank, as syndication agent. In February, March, and May
2016, we entered into a series of amendments that reduced the amount available to us under the
credit facility to a maximum of $8 million, which amount may be used only for letters of credit. Any
availability of the credit facility is subject to our compliance with financial covenants that provide
that our leverage ratio may not exceed 3.5 to 1, and our fixed charge coverage ratio may not be
below 1.3 to 1. We were not in compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2016; however,
the lenders under the credit facility have agreed to waive until July 31, 2016, the requirement that
we comply with these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Further, the lenders
agreed that noncompliance with these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, will not
constitute a default or event of default under the credit facility until July 31, 2016. However, if the
noteholder waiver discussed below expires before July 31, 2016, as it may be mutually
extended, then the waiver under the credit facility will also expire at that earlier date. If current
market conditions continue, we anticipate that our adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest,
income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other expenses, as defined in the credit
facility) will not be sufficient for us to return to compliance with these covenants through 2016. As
a result, we are proactively working with our lenders and evaluating our options which could
include additional covenant amendments, waivers, or forbearances, alternative financing
arrangements, a possible further reduction in the amount of the facility, and a possible reduction
of our outstanding debt including the payment of prepayment penalties. Our continued failure to
comply with these covenants after the waiver expires, or our failure to comply with similar
covenants under the terms of our senior notes after June 30, 2016, will result in an event of
default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding
indebtedness, including the acceleration of our senior notes discussed below and any amounts
outstanding under the credit facility. In May 2016, we entered into an amendment that provides
that the maturity date for the credit facility is the earliest of (1) July 31, 2016, (2) any date on which
the aggregate commitment under the credit facility is reduced to zero, and (3) the effective date
for a new bank credit facility.
The credit facility also has a covenant that requires us to provide to the lenders audited annual
financial statements within 90 days of the end of each year. The audit report must not contain any
going concern modification. The audit report accompanying our financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015, contains a going concern modification, and therefore does not satisfy
the credit facility covenant. The lenders under the facility agreed to waive until July 31, 2016, the
requirement that we deliver audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2015, without any going concern modification. Further, the lenders agreed that the existence of
audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, with a going concern
modification will not constitute a default or event of default under the facility until July 31, 2016.
Our continued failure to comply with this covenant after July 31, 2016, will result in an event of
default that, if not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of all outstanding
indebtedness, including the acceleration of our senior notes discussed below and any amounts
outstanding under the credit facility.
    The financial covenants under the credit facility are calculated as follows:
•
Our maximum leverage ratio (calculated as the ratio of funded indebtedness to adjusted
EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters) is 3.5 to 1, where funded indebtedness is calculated as
total funded indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalent investments on hand up to a
maximum of $75 million. Our leverage ratio at March 31, 2016, was 3.7 to 1.
•
Our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (calculated as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA for the
prior four fiscal quarters, minus maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for income
taxes, to interest expense
12
Table of Contents
plus scheduled principal amortization of long-term funded indebtedness) is 1.3 to 1, where
annual maintenance capital expenditures is set at $20 million. Our fixed charge coverage ratio at
March 31, 2016, was 1.1 to 1.
These ratios and other restrictive covenants under the credit facility could limit our ability to
engage in activities that we believe are in our long-term best interests.
The facility is unsecured and is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries. We occasionally borrow
and repay amounts under the facility for near-term working capital needs. As of March 31, 2016,
we had a $0.5 million letter of credit outstanding under the facility.
Unsecured Senior Notes—In April 2013, we issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of
unsecured senior notes (the "Notes") pursuant to a note purchase agreement entered into in
August 2012. The Notes consist of the following series:
•$60 million of 3.23% Senior Notes, Series A, due April 16, 2020
•$45 million of 4.13% Senior Notes, Series B, due April 14, 2023
•$45 million of 4.28% Senior Notes, Series C, due April 16, 2025
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any other
unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness of ours. The Notes are subject to the same leverage
ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio as apply under the credit facility. In January 2016, we
amended the note purchase agreement to provide that the interest rate for the senior notes will be
increased by 0.25% during any time that our leverage ratio exceeds 2.25 to 1. As we are not in
compliance with our leverage ratio and fixed charge ratio as of March 31, 2016, in accordance
with the terms of the note purchase agreement, the above interest rates are increased by 2%
beginning April 1, 2016, and will continue as long as we are not meeting these ratios. As
described above, these ratios and other restrictive covenants under the Notes could limit our
ability to engage in activities that we believe are in our long-term best interests.
We were not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Notes as of March 31, 2016;
however, the noteholders have agreed to waive until June 30, 2016, the requirement that we
comply with these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Further, the noteholders
agreed that noncompliance with these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, will not
constitute a default or event of default under the Notes until June 30, 2016. If current market
conditions continue, we anticipate that our adjusted EBITDA will not be sufficient for us to return
to compliance with these covenants through 2016. We are proactively working with the
noteholders and evaluating our options, which could include additional covenant amendments,
waivers, or forbearances, alternative financing arrangements, a possible further reduction in the
amount of our credit facility, and a possible reduction of our outstanding debt, including the
payment of prepayment penalties. Our continued failure to comply with these covenants after
June 30, 2016, will result in an event of default under the terms of the senior notes and a cross-
default under the credit facility that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all
outstanding indebtedness, including the acceleration of the Notes and any amounts outstanding
under the credit facility.
The obligations under the Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.
Interest is paid semiannually on April 16 and October 16 of each year. Interest expense is
recorded net of any capitalized interest associated with investments in capital projects. We
incurred gross interest expense of $2.3 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Included in the gross interest expense for the three
months ended March 31, 2016, is the write-off of deferred financing costs of $0.7 million related to
the decrease in our unsecured credit facility as described above. We capitalized $0.1 million and
an immaterial amount of interest during the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015,
respectively.
Note 8 — FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR SUBSIDIARY GUARANTORS OF POSSIBLE
FUTURE PUBLIC DEBT
Intrepid Potash, Inc., as the parent company, has no independent assets or operations, and
operations are conducted solely through its subsidiaries. Cash generated from operations is held
at the parent company level as cash on hand and short- and long-term investments. Cash on
hand and short- and long-term investments totaled $55 million and $64 million at March 31, 2016,
and December 31, 2015, respectively. In the event that one or more of our wholly owned
operating subsidiaries
13
Table of Contents
guarantee public debt securities in the future, those guarantees will be full and unconditional and
will constitute the joint and several obligations of the subsidiary guarantors. Our other
subsidiaries are minor. There are no restrictions on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other
distributions of funds from the subsidiary guarantors, except those imposed by applicable law.
Note 9 — ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION
We recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment and
reclamation of our mining properties. A liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation
and a corresponding increase to the carrying value of the related long-lived asset are recorded
as the mining operations occur or the assets are acquired.
Our asset retirement obligation is based on the estimated cost to abandon and reclaim the mining
operations, the economic life of the properties, and federal and state regulatory requirements.
The liability is discounted using credit adjusted risk-free rate estimates at the time the liability is
incurred or when there are revisions to estimated costs. The credit adjusted risk-free rates used
to discount our abandonment liabilities range from 6.9% to 8.5%. Revisions to the liability occur
due to construction of new or expanded facilities, changes in estimated abandonment costs or
economic lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new requirements regarding the
abandonment or reclamation of mines.
Following is a table of the changes to our asset retirement obligation for the following periods (in
thousands):

Note 10 — COMPENSATION PLANS
Cash Bonus Plans—We have cash bonus plans that allow participants to receive varying
percentages of their aggregate base salary. Any awards under the cash bonus plans are based
on a variety of elements related to our performance in certain production, operational, financial,
and other areas, as well as the participants’ individual performance. We accrue cash bonus
expense related to the current year’s performance. We have suspended our cash bonus
programs for most employees for 2016 as part of our cost savings initiatives.
Equity Incentive Compensation Plan—Our Board of Directors and stockholders adopted a long-
term incentive compensation plan called the Intrepid Potash, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan, as
Amended and Restated (the "Plan"). We have issued common stock, restricted shares of
common stock, performance units, and non-qualified stock option awards under the Plan. As of
March 31, 2016, the following awards were outstanding under the Plan: 233,591 shares of non-
vested restricted shares of common stock; non-vested performance units representing 252,100
shares of common stock; and options to purchase 219,731 shares of common stock. As of
March 31, 2016, approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock remained available for
issuance under the Plan.
Common Stock—On an annual basis, under the Plan, the Compensation Committee of the Board
of Directors (the "Compensation Committee") has approved the award of shares of common
stock to the non-employee members of the Board of Directors as compensation for service for the
period ending on the date of our annual stockholders’ meeting for the following year. These
shares of common stock were granted without restrictions and vested immediately.
Non-vested Restricted Shares of Common Stock—Under the Plan, grants of non-vested
restricted shares of common stock have been awarded to executive officers, other key
employees, and consultants. The awards contain service
14
Table of Contents
conditions associated with continued employment or service. The terms of the non-vested
restricted shares of common stock provide voting and regular dividend rights to the holders of the
awards. Upon vesting, the restrictions on the restricted shares of common stock lapse and the
shares are considered issued and outstanding.
In the first quarter of 2015, the Compensation Committee granted restricted shares of common
stock under the Plan to our executive management team and other selected employees as part of
an annual equity award program. These awards vest ratably over three years. From time to time,
the Compensation Committee grants restricted shares of common stock to newly hired or
promoted employees or other employees or consultants who have achieved extraordinary
personal performance objectives. These restricted shares of common stock generally vest over
one- to four-year periods. No grants of restricted shares of common stock occurred in the first
quarter of 2016.
In measuring compensation expense associated with the grant of non-vested restricted shares of
common stock, we use the fair value of the award, determined as the closing stock price for our
common stock on the grant date. Compensation expense is recorded monthly over the vesting
period of the award. Total compensation expense related to the non-vested restricted shares of
common stock awards was $0.7 million and $0.9 million for the three months ended March 31,
2016, and 2015, respectively. These amounts are net of estimated forfeiture adjustments. As of
March 31, 2016, there was $3.1 million of total remaining unrecognized compensation expense
related to non-vested restricted shares of common stock that will be expensed through 2018.
A summary of activity relating to our non-vested restricted shares of common stock for the three
months ended March 31, 2016, is presented below.

Performance Units—In 2015, the Compensation Committee granted at-risk performance units
under the Plan to a member of our executive team as part of their annual compensation package.
The performance units vest in February 2018, and payout, if any, is based on market-based
conditions relating to one-, two- and three-year performance periods beginning on the grant date.
No shares were earned under the first one-year performance period. A total of 252,100 shares of
common stock are available for future payout under these performance units, subject to
continued employment through the vesting date.
Non-qualified Stock Options—From 2009 to 2011, the Compensation Committee issued non-
qualified stock options under the Plan in the first quarter of each year to our executive
management and other selected employees as part of our annual award program. All outstanding
stock options are fully vested.
Realized tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax
asset attributable to stock compensation for these options are recorded as “excess tax benefits”
when the tax deductions occur.

Note 11 — INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rate is impacted primarily by the amount of taxable income associated with each
jurisdiction in which our income is subject to income tax, permanent differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Effective tax rate
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, our effective tax rate differed from the statutory

The blended state tax rate applied to the deferred tax calculation is subject to change due to
changes in state laws and changes in the mix of our business and the states in which we have a
taxable relationship. This creates fluctuations in the value of our net deferred tax asset.
As of March 31, 2016, we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the
benefit of the deferred tax assets. As such, we increased the valuation allowance by $8.0 million
for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Our deferred tax asset, net of the valuation
allowance, at March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, is zero.

Note 12 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Reclamation Deposits and Surety Bonds—As of March 31, 2016, we had $18.0 million of
security placed principally with the State of Utah and the Bureau of Land Management for
eventual reclamation of our various facilities. Of this total requirement, as of March 31, 2016, $0.5
million consisted of long-term restricted cash deposits reflected in “Other assets, net" on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets, and $17.5 million was secured by surety bonds issued
by an insurer. The surety bonds are held in place by an annual fee paid to the issuer.
We may be required to post additional security to fund future reclamation obligations as
reclamation plans are updated or as governmental entities change requirements.
Legal—We are subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business. While
there are uncertainties in predicting the outcome of any claim or legal action, we believe that the
ultimate resolution of these claims or actions is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Future Operating Lease Commitments—We have operating leases for land, mining and other
operating equipment, offices, and railcars, with original terms ranging up to 20 years. In May
2015, we exercised an option to terminate our existing corporate office lease prior to its original
expiration date. Under the provisions of the lease agreement, we incurred a termination penalty
of $1.1 million, which was included in selling and administrative expense in the second quarter of
2015. In December 2015, we paid $0.5 million of this termination penalty in connection with an
amendment reducing the leased square footage and extending the expiration date to May 2017.
We expect to pay the remaining $0.6 million in May 2017. Our monthly lease commitment is
$83,331 from January 2016 through May 2016, and increases to $85,626 for the period June
2016 to May 2017.
Rental and lease expenses are shown below for the indicated periods:
For the three months ended March 31, 2016 $1,548

Note 13 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We applied the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting
Standards Codification™ (“ASC”) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, for all
financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The topic establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and requires disclosures about fair value measurements.
ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date. The topic establishes market or observable inputs as the preferred sources of
values, followed by assumptions based on hypothetical transactions in the absence of market
inputs. The topic also establishes a hierarchy for grouping these assets and liabilities based on
the significance level of the following inputs, as follows:
•Level 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2—Quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model‑derived valuations
whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
•Level 3—Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.

Financial assets or liabilities are categorized within the hierarchy based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Below is a general description of our
valuation methodologies for financial assets and liabilities, which are measured at fair value and
are included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.
Our available-for-sale investments consist of corporate bonds that are valued using Level 2
inputs. Market pricing for these investments is obtained from an established financial markets
data provider.
The methods described above may result in a fair value estimate that may not be indicative of net
realizable value or may not be reflective of future fair values and cash flows. While we believe
that the valuation methods used are appropriate and consistent with the requirements of ASC
Topic 820 and the methods used by other marketplace participants, we recognize that third
parties may use different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain
financial instruments that could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Financial Instruments—The carrying values and estimated fair values of our financial instruments
as of March 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, were as follows (in thousands):
 
 
Senior notes $ 150,000
For cash and cash equivalents, certificate of deposit and time deposit investments, accounts
receivable, refundable income taxes, and accounts payable, the carrying amount approximates
fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the
senior notes is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current borrowing
rates for debt with similar remaining maturities and ratings (a Level 2 input) and is designed to

Note 14 — RESTRUCTURING CHARGE
In January 2016, in response to declining potash prices, we undertook a number of cost saving
actions that were intended to better align our cost structure with the business environment. These
initiatives included the elimination of approximately 5% of the workforce, elimination of the bonus
programs for most employees, as well as reductions in compensation. For the three months
ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a restructuring expense of $0.4 million, which is
comprised primarily of severance-related payments paid during the quarter ended March 31,
2016.
Note 15 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
In April 2016, we received $1.2 million in insurance proceeds related to a December 2015
snowstorm that damaged a portion of one of our warehouses in New Mexico. In the fourth quarter
of 2015, we recognized a loss of $2.5 million related to the snowstorm, and reflected that loss in
"Other operating income." The insurance proceeds received in April 2016 will be reflected in
"Other operating income" for our second quarter 2016 and will represent a full and final
settlement of the claim.
Note 16 — RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
Pronouncements Issued But Not Yet Adopted—In August 2013, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern," which describes how an entity should assess its ability to meet obligations
and sets rules for how this information should be disclosed in the financial statements. The new
standard applies to all entities for the first annual period in fiscal years ending after December 15,
2016, and interim periods thereafter. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this
standard, and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements and
disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, “Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which requires revenue to be recognized based on the
amount an entity is expected to be entitled to for promised goods or services provided to
customers. The standard also requires expanded disclosures regarding contracts with
customers. The guidance in this standard supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
Topic 605, “Revenue Recognition," and most industry-specific guidance. This guidance is
effective for us beginning January 1, 2018, with retrospective application required, subject to
certain practical expedients. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this standard, and
have not yet determined the impact on our results of operations or financial position.
In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic
330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.” An entity using an inventory method other than
last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method should measure inventory at the lower of cost and
net realizable value. The new guidance clarifies that net realizable value is the estimated selling
prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion,
disposal, and transportation and is effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. We do not expect
the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 , "Leases (Topic
842)," which requires, among other things, lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on
their balance sheets for those leases classified as operating leases under previous generally
accepted accounting principles. These assets and liabilities must be recorded generally at the
present value of the contracted lease payments, and the cost of the lease must be allocated over
the lease term on a straight-line basis. This guidance is effective for us for annual and interim
periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with a modified retrospective
transition method mandated. We are currently evaluating the requirements of this standard and
have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, "Compensation -
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting." This standard changes several aspects of how we account for share-based
payment award transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as
either equity or liabilities, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows,
forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding payments, and classification of employee taxes
paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding
purposes. This standard is effective for us for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption, as specified in the guidance, is permitted in any interim
or annual period provided that the entire standard is adopted. We are currently evaluating the
requirements of this standard and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated
financial statements.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standard—In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2015-03, “Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.” which became
effective for us beginning January 1, 2016, and requires retrospective adoption. In accordance
with this standard, our deferred financing costs associated with outstanding debt balances

have been reclassified from “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Other assets, net"
to "Long-term debt, net." Amortization of such costs continues to be reported as "Interest

Our Company
We are the only producer of potash in the United States and are one of two producers of
langbeinite, which we market and sell as Trio®. We sell potash and Trio® primarily into the
agricultural market as a fertilizer. We also sell these products into the animal feed market as a
nutritional supplement and sell potash into the industrial market as a component in drilling and
fracturing fluids for oil and gas wells and other industrial inputs. Our revenues are generated
exclusively from the sale of potash and Trio®. We also produce salt and magnesium chloride
from our potash mining processes, the sales of which are accounted for as by-product credits to
our cost of sales. These by-product credits represented approximately 2% to 3% of total cost of
goods sold in each of the last three years.
During the first quarter, we produced potash from three solution mining facilities and two
conventional underground mining facilities. Our solution mining production comes from our HB
solar solution mine near Carlsbad, New Mexico, a solar solution mine near Moab, Utah, and a
solar brine recovery mine in Wendover, Utah. Our conventional production of potash came from
our underground West and East mines near Carlsbad, New Mexico. We also operate the North
compaction facility near Carlsbad, New Mexico, which services the West and HB mines. We
produce Trio® from our underground conventional East mine.
In April 2016, we converted our East facility from a mixed-ore facility that produced both potash
and Trio® to a Trio®-only facility. We expect our commissioning activities related to that transition
to continue into the second half of 2016. Since the transition, we no longer produce potash at our
East facility.
In May 2016, we initiated a plan to idle mining operations at our West facility and transition it into
a care-and-maintenance mode due to the decline in potash prices. We expect the transition to
occur in July. After the idling of West, all of our potash will be produced from our three solution
mining facilities.
We have additional opportunities to develop mineralized deposits of potash in New Mexico, as
well as to continue the optimization of our processing plants. These opportunities potentially
include additional solution mining activities, additional recoveries of langbeinite, development of
by-product markets and acceleration of production from our reserves.
We routinely post important information about us and our business, including information about
upcoming investor presentations, on our website under the Investor Relations tab. We encourage
investors and other interested parties to enroll on our website to receive automatic email alerts or
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds regarding new postings. Our website is

Significant Business Trends and Activities
Our financial results have been impacted by several significant trends and activities, which are
described below. We expect that these trends will continue to drive our results of operations,
cash flows, and financial position.
• Idling of our West facility. Due to the current potash pricing environment, in May 2016, we
initiated a plan to idle mining operations at our West facility. We expect operations to continue
until July 2016, after which time the facility will be transitioned to a care-and-maintenance mode.
We expect to lay off approximately 300 employees in connection with the idling of the West
facility. We estimate that we will incur charges of approximately $1 to $3 million in the second
quarter 2016, primarily related to estimated severance payments and other charges in connection
with this decision.
• Conversion of our East facility to Trio®-only. In early April 2016, we transitioned our East facility
from a mixed-ore processing facility to a Trio®-only facility. We expect our commissioning
activities related to that transition to continue into the second half of 2016. As a result of this
conversion, we expect our production of Trio® to increase in the second half of 2016 as
compared to historical levels.
• Potash demand. We sold 218,000 tons of potash in the first quarter of 2016, a decrease of
13,000 tons compared to the first quarter of 2015. The timing of our shipments to customers for
the winter fill program was earlier in 2015 as compared to 2016, despite an early start to the 2016
spring application season, resulting in fewer tons sold in the 2016 period. We continue to expect
lower sales volumes in 2016 into the industrial market as compared to 2015 due to the decrease
in oil and gas drilling in the U.S.
The specific timing of when farmers apply potash remains highly weather dependent and varies
across the numerous growing regions within the U.S. The timing of potash sales is significantly
influenced by the marketing programs of potash producers, as well as storage volumes closer to
the farm gate. The combination of these items results in variability in potash sales and shipments,
thereby increasing volatility of sales volumes from quarter to quarter and season to season.
24
Table of Contents
• Potash prices. Our average net realized sales price for potash decreased to $216 per ton in the
first quarter of 2016 compared to $362 per ton in the first quarter of 2015, as potash prices
declined throughout the second half of 2015 and into early 2016. Potash prices are a significant
driver of profitability for our business. Domestic pricing of our potash is influenced principally by
the price established by our competitors. The significant price decline from the first quarter of
2015 has primarily been caused by global oversupply combined with the impact the strong U.S.
dollar has had on global producers aggressively pricing tonnage imported into the North
American potash market. The interaction of global potash supply and demand, ocean, land, and
barge freight rates, and currency fluctuations also influence pricing. While we are beginning to
see some signs of firmness in potash pricing, global and U.S. potash supply continues to exceed
demand and, commodity prices continue to be pressured.
As we reduce our inventory levels due to the reduction in potash production from our East and
West facilities, we expect to reduce our potash distribution geography, which we expect will
result in increased average net realized sales prices for potash.
• Trio® prices and demand. Sales volumes for Trio® decreased for the three months ended
March 31, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. Trio® demand was also negatively
impacted by the overall softness in the fertilizer market.
    Our average net realized sales price for Trio® was $316 per ton in the first quarter of 2016, a
decrease from $367 per ton in the first quarter 2015. While Trio® pricing has historically
demonstrated more resiliency than potash pricing due to Trio's® unique nutrient make up and
application to high-value crops, we expect to see continued downward pressure on the overall
potassium markets in 2016. We are focusing our efforts on maximizing our returns in the
granular- and premium-sized markets. As we commission our East facility and increase Trio®
production, we plan to not only expand our domestic marketing efforts, but also increase exports
of Trio®. As a result, we expect our average net realized sales price of Trio® to be pressured in
the second half of 2016.
• Costs associated with abnormal production. We routinely evaluate our production levels and
costs to determine if any costs are associated with abnormal production, as described under
generally accepted accounting principles. The assessment of normal production levels is
judgmental and unique to each quarter. During the first quarter of 2016, we temporarily
suspended potash production at our East facility for a total of three days as we performed our
final testing related to the conversion of our East facility to Trio®-only production.
    As a result of the temporary suspension of production, we determined that approximately $0.7
million of production costs at our East facility would have been allocated to additional potash
tons produced, assuming we had been operating at normal production rates. Accordingly, these
costs were excluded from our inventory values and instead directly expensed in the first quarter
2016 as period production costs. We compare actual production levels relative to what we
estimated could have been produced if we had not incurred the temporary production
suspensions and lower operating rates in order to determine the abnormal cost adjustment.
• Weather impact. Our solar facilities experienced below average evaporation rates in 2015. As a
result, fewer potash crystals have formed in our evaporation ponds for harvesting during the
harvest season that began in the second half of 2015, and was completed in April 2016.
Therefore, we expect lower production from these facilities in 2016 as compared to 2015.
Selected Operating and Financial Data
The following table presents selected operations data for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.
Analysis of the details of this information is contained throughout this discussion. We present this
table as a summary of information relating to key indicators of financial condition and operating
performance that we believe are important. We calculate average net realized sales price by
deducting freight costs from gross revenues and then by dividing this result by tons of product
sold during the period.

Amounts presented exclude lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments and costs
associated with abnormal production. Lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments were $41
per ton and $2 per ton of potash sold in the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Costs associated with abnormal production were $3 per ton and $0 per ton
of potash produced in the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Results of Operations
Operating Highlights
Net loss for the first quarter of 2016 was $18.4 million, or $0.24 per basic and diluted share, and
cash flows used by operating activities were $1.1 million. Based on our expectations for potash
pricing for the remainder of the year, we anticipate that we will incur a net loss for the year ending
December 31, 2016.
Potash
The majority of our revenues and gross margin are currently derived from the production and sale
of potash.
We sold 218,000 tons of potash in the first quarter of 2016 compared with 231,000 tons sold in
the first quarter of 2015. Our sales volumes in the first quarter of 2016 were below those in 2015,
driven by the timing of the start of the spring application season as described above, as well as
decreased sales into the industrial market due to decreased oil and gas drilling in the U.S.
The table below shows our potash sales mix for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and
2015.

Our production volume of potash in the first quarter of 2016 decreased to 215,000 tons, compared
with 237,000 tons produced in the first quarter of 2015. Beginning in late December 2015, and
continuing to early February 2016, we curtailed production at our HB facility to manage inventory
levels. As a result, production from our HB facility in the first quarter of 2016 was lower than in
2015. Our lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments have increased in the first quarter of 2016
compared with the same period in 2015. As a result, our potash cash operating cost per ton was
$148 in the first quarter of 2016 as compared with $199 in the first quarter of 2015.
Trio® 
Our Trio® production increased 22% in the first quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2016,
we continued to focus on increasing our Trio® production with the conversion from standard- to
premium-sized Trio®. Our net realized sales price for Trio® in the first quarter of 2016 decreased
as compared to a year ago, as well as sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2015. In April 2016,
we converted our East facility to a Trio®-only facility, and we expect our production of Trio® for
the remainder of 2016 to exceed 2015 levels. This increase in production is expected to put
downward pressure on our average net realized sales price of Trio® for the remainder of 2016.
We expect the incremental production will provide us the opportunity to pursue markets that have
been under-served in previous years and work with our customers to provide a consistent supply
of our Trio® product. Our sales of Trio® decreased to 50,000 tons in the first quarter of 2016 as
compared with 62,000 tons in the first quarter of 2015, as our customers delayed purchases due
to uncertainties in commodities pricing.
In the first quarter of 2016 compared with 2015, our average Trio® gross margin decreased by
$42 per ton. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in average net realized sales price
of $51 per ton mentioned above, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense resulting
from the impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our cash operating costs of
Trio® increased by $14 per ton as we produced more premium-sized product in 2016 as
compared to 2015.
Our export sales of Trio® tend to have more variability as to the timing of those sales. As a result,
the percentage of sales into the export market as compared to the domestic market can fluctuate
significantly from period to period, as shown in the table below.

Average Net Realized Sales Price
Compared with the first quarter of 2015, our average net realized sales price for potash
decreased by $146 per ton in the first quarter of 2016, to $216 per ton, largely a result of declining
commodity prices and potash supply exceeding demand in 2016. Domestically, the potash
market is influenced by global supply and demand, and is impacted by the pricing of imports from
our competitors. The strength of the U.S. dollar has resulted in further pressure on potash pricing.

Specific Factors Affecting Our Results
Sales
Our gross sales are derived from the sales of potash and Trio® and are determined by the
quantities of product we sell and the sales prices we realize. We quote prices to customers both
on a delivered basis and on the basis of pick-up at our plants and warehouses. Freight costs are
incurred on only a portion of our sales as many of our customers arrange and pay for their own
freight directly. When we arrange and pay for freight, our quotes and billings are based on
expected freight costs to the points of delivery. Although our gross sales include the freight that
we bill, we do not believe that gross sales provide a representative measure of our performance
in the market due to variations caused by ongoing changes in the proportion of customers paying
for their own freight, the geographic distribution of our products, and freight rates. Rail freight
rates have been steadily increasing, thereby negatively influencing our net realized sales prices.
We view net sales, which are gross sales less freight costs, as the key performance indicator of
our revenue as it conveys the net sales price of the product that we sold. We manage our sales
and marketing operations centrally, and we work to achieve the highest average net realized
sales price we can by evaluating the product needs of our customers and associated logistics
and then determining which of our production facilities can best satisfy these needs.
The volume of product we sell is determined by demand for our products and by our production
capabilities. We generally intend to operate our facilities at full production levels, which provide
the greatest operating efficiencies; however, at times we have temporarily curtailed production to
manage inventory levels. By having adequate warehouse capacity, we can maintain production
levels during periods of fluctuating product demand and have product inventory positioned closer
to the fields in order to meet peak periods of fertilizer demand.
28
Table of Contents
Cost of Goods Sold
Our cost of goods sold reflects the costs to produce our potash and Trio® products, less credits
generated from the sale of our by-products. Many of our production costs are largely fixed, and,
consequently, our costs of sales per ton on a facility-by-facility basis tend to move inversely with
the number of tons we produce, within the context of normal production levels. We expect to
experience variability in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations in the relative mix of product
that we produce through conventional and solar solution mining. Our cost of goods sold per ton
for our solar solution facilities is less than our cost of goods sold per ton for our conventional
facilities. However, our solar solution production is impacted by weather variability. Our principal
production costs include labor and employee benefits, maintenance materials, contract labor,
materials for operating or maintenance projects, natural gas, electricity, operating supplies,
chemicals, depreciation and depletion, royalties, and leasing costs. A smaller component of our
cost base includes variable costs associated with contract labor, consumable operating supplies,
reagents, and royalties. Our periodic production costs and costs of goods sold will not
necessarily match one another from period-to-period based on the fluctuation of inventory, sales,
and production levels at our facilities.
Our production costs per ton are also impacted when our production levels change, due to factors
such as changes in the grade of ore mined, levels of mine development, plant operating
performance, downtime, and annual maintenance turnarounds. We expect that our labor and
contract labor costs in Carlsbad, New Mexico, will continue to be influenced most directly by the
demand for labor in the local Carlsbad, New Mexico, region where we compete for labor with the
potash, oil and gas, and nuclear waste storage industries. Additionally, the East mine has a
complex mineralogy. Historically, and through the first quarter of 2016, we produced both potash
and Trio® at our East facility using a mixed-ore body and processing the ore through a singular
product flow at the surface facility. The specific grade, volume, and characterization of the ore
that was mined at any particular time was subject to fluctuations due to the nature of the mineral
deposits and influenced the tons of potash and langbeinite ultimately produced from the facility,
which affected our production costs per ton for both products and affected our quarter-to-quarter
results. With the conversion of our East facility to a Trio®-only facility in April 2016, we believe we
have simplified our process flow, which we expect will ultimately lead to a lower cost structure for
our Trio® operations once the plant is fully commissioned.
We pay royalties to federal, state, and private lessors under our mineral leases. These payments
typically equal a percentage of net sales of minerals extracted and sold under the applicable
lease. In some cases, federal royalties for potash are paid on a sliding scale that varies with the
grade of ore extracted. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015 our average
royalty rate was 5.0% and 4.2%, respectively.
Income Taxes
We are subject to federal and state income taxes on our taxable income. Our effective tax rate for
the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015 was zero and 32.0%, respectively. Our
effective income tax rates are impacted primarily by changes in the underlying tax rates in
jurisdictions in which we are subject to income tax and permanent differences between book and
tax income for the period, including the benefit associated with the estimated effect of depletion,
research and development credits, and any changes in valuation allowances. During the three
months ended March 31, 2016, our effective tax rate was impacted primarily by a valuation
allowance placed on the additional deferred tax assets recorded during the period. During the
three months ended March 31, 2015, our effective tax rate was impacted primarily by the benefit
from estimated depletion deductions.
Our federal and state income tax returns are subject to examination by federal and state tax
authorities.
For the three months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized an immaterial amount of income tax
expense. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the total tax expense was $3.1 million.
Total tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015, was comprised of $0.1 million of
current income tax expense and $3.0 million of deferred income tax expense.
We evaluate our deferred tax assets and liabilities each reporting period using the enacted tax
rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset
is expected to be settled or realized. The estimated statutory income tax rates that are applied to
our current and deferred income tax calculations are impacted most significantly by the states in
which we do business. Changing business conditions for normal business transactions and
operations, as well as changes to state tax rate and apportionment laws, potentially alter our
apportionment of income among the states for income tax purposes. These changes in
apportionment laws result in changes in the calculation of our current and deferred income taxes,
including the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The effects of any such changes
are recorded in the period of the adjustment. These adjustments can increase or decrease the
net deferred tax asset on the balance sheet and impact the corresponding deferred tax benefit or
deferred tax expense on the income statement.
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016, and 2015

Table of Contents
Net Sales
Net sales of potash decreased to $47.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, from
$83.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. This decrease in net sales of potash
was primarily the result of a 6% decrease in sales volume, as noted above, and a decrease of
$146 per ton in the average net realized sales price.
Net sales of Trio® decreased to $15.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, from
$22.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, due to a 19% decrease in the volume
of sales and a 14% decrease in the average net realized sales price. Sales volumes for Trio®
decreased in the first quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015, reflecting overall
softness in the fertilizer market as described above.

Depreciation and depletion expense for potash was $12.6 million and $18.1 million in the first
(1)
quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, which equates to $58 and $79 on a per-ton basis.
(2)Depreciation and depletion expense for Trio® was $2.0 million and $3.5 million in the first
quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, which equates to $39 and $58 on a per-ton basis.
Total per ton cost of goods sold of potash, which includes royalties, depreciation, depletion and
amortization, decreased due to the impairment of our West and East facilities that was recorded
in the fourth quarter of 2015, increased production from our HB mine, as well as the direct
expensing of abnormal production costs related to reduced production levels at East as noted
above. We recorded lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments of $9.0 million during the first
quarter of 2016, primarily the result of lower potash prices. We also recorded $0.7 million of
abnormal production costs during the first quarter of 2016. Both our lower-of-cost-or-market
adjustments and abnormal production costs are excluded from our cost of goods sold.
Our total cost per ton of Trio® sold decreased in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the same
period in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and depletion due to the impairment of
our East facility recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Our total cost of goods sold decreased as a result of lower sales volume for both potash and
Trio® in the first quarter of 2016, as well as depreciation and depletion expense resulting from the
impairment of our West and East facilities recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our potash
production costs decreased due to the direct expensing of costs related to reduced production at
East, as noted above, and decreased natural gas and electricity costs.
Lower-of-Cost-or-Market Adjustment
During the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, we recorded charges of
approximately $9.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, as our weighted average finished
goods product inventory cost exceeded the estimated net realizable value of our finished goods
product inventory. The $9.0 million of lower-of-cost-or-market adjustment recorded during the
three months ended March 31, 2016, related to our potash inventories, and resulted from lower
potash prices. We expect additional lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments to continue into the
second quarter of 2016.

Selling and Administrative Expense
Selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.9 million, or 12%, to $6.6 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2016, from $7.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The
decrease is primarily due to decreased administration labor and benefits costs.
Costs Associated with Abnormal Production
During the first quarter of 2016, we temporarily suspended potash production at our East facility
for a total of three days as we performed a langbeinite-only testing run. As a result of the
temporary suspension of production, we determined that approximately $0.7 million would have
been allocated to additional tons produced, assuming we had been operating at normal
production rates. Accordingly, these costs were excluded from our inventory values and instead
expensed in the first quarter of 2016 as period production costs. We compare actual production
relative to what we estimated could have been produced if we had not incurred the temporary
production suspensions and lower operating rates in order to determine the abnormal cost
adjustment.
Restructuring Expense
In January 2016, in response to declining potash prices, we undertook several cost saving
actions that were intended to better align our cost structure with the business environment. These
initiatives included the elimination of approximately 5% of our workforce, suspension of our cash
bonus programs for most employees, and salary decreases for most employees. For the three
months ended March 31, 2016, we recognized a restructuring expense of $0.4 million, which is
comprised primarily of severance-related payments, all of which was paid in the first quarter of
2016.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $0.6 million to $2.2 million or 36% for the three months ended March
31, 2016, from $1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase is due to
the expensing of deferred financing costs associated with the decrease in the maximum amount
available to us under our unsecured credit facility, as discussed in more detail in the "Liquidity
and Capital Resources" section below.
    
Capital Investments
We expect our level of capital investment to be approximately $20 million to $25 million for 2016,
the majority of which we expect to be sustaining capital. We anticipate our 2016 operating plans
and capital programs will be funded out of operating cash flows and existing cash and cash
equivalents.
The above expected capital investment includes amounts to convert our East facility to a Trio®-
only facility, which occurred in April 2016, and our subsequent activities to optimize our
langbeinite recovery techniques and maximize the amount of granular- and premium-sized Trio®
that we produce.
During the first three months of 2016, we paid cash of $6.0 million for capital projects.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of March 31, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $54.9 million. This
amount was made up of the following:
•$11.3 million in cash;
$13.1 million in cash equivalent investments, consisting of money market accounts with banking
institutions that we believe are financially sound; and
•
•$30.0 million and $0.5 million invested in short- and long-term investments, respectively.
Our operations have primarily been funded from cash on hand and cash generated by
operations. We will continue to monitor our future sources and uses of cash, and anticipate that
we will make adjustments to our capital allocation strategies when, and if determined by our
Board of Directors.
The following summarizes our cash flow activity for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and
2015:

2015
Operating Activities
Total cash used in operating activities through March 31, 2016, was $1.1 million, a decrease of
$33.8 million compared with the first three months of 2015. The decrease was driven by lower net
realized sales price per tons in the first three months of 2016 as compared to the same period in
2015.
Investing Activities
Total cash provided by investing activities increased by $50.1 million in the first three months of
2016 compared with the same three month period in 2015 as a result of increased investment
sales and lower capital investment activity.
Financing Activities
Total cash used in financing activities of $1.4 million was due to an increase in debt issuance
costs related to the on-going negotiations with our lenders.
Unsecured Credit Facility
We have an unsecured credit facility, led by U.S. Bank, as administrative agent, and Wells Fargo
Bank, as syndication agent. In February, March, and May 2016, we entered into a series of
amendments that reduced the amount available to us under the credit facility to a maximum of $8
million, which amount may be used only for letters of credit. Any availability of the credit facility is
subject to our compliance with financial covenants that provide that our leverage ratio may not
exceed 3.5 to 1 and our fixed charge coverage ratio may not be below 1.3 to 1. We were not in
compliance with these covenants as of March 31, 2016; however, the lenders under the credit
facility have agreed to waive until July 31, 2016, the requirement that we comply with these
covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Further, the lenders agreed that noncompliance
with these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, will not constitute a default or event
of default under the credit facility until July 31, 2016. However, if the noteholder waiver discussed
below expires before July 31, 2016, as it may be mutually extended, then the waiver under the
credit facility will also expire at that earlier date. If current market conditions continue, we
anticipate that our adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,
amortization, and certain other expenses, as defined in the credit facility) will not be sufficient for
us to return to compliance with these covenants through 2016. As a result, we are proactively
working with our lenders and evaluating our options, which could include additional covenant
amendments, waivers, or forbearances, alternative financing arrangements, a possible further
reduction in the amount of the facility, and a possible reduction of our outstanding debt, including
the payment of prepayment penalties. Our continued failure to comply with these covenants after
the waiver expires, or our failure to comply with similar covenants under the terms of our senior
notes after June 30, 2016, will result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result
in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness, including the acceleration of our senior notes
discussed below and any amounts outstanding under the credit facility. In addition, the amount
available under the credit facility would be reduced to zero. In May 2016, we entered into an
amendment that provides that the maturity date for the credit facility is the earliest of (1) July 31,
2016, (2) any date on which the aggregate commitment under the credit facility is reduced to
zero, and (3) the effective date for a new bank credit facility.
The credit facility also has a covenant that requires us to provide to the lenders audited annual
financial statements within 90 days of the end of each year. The audit report must not contain any
going concern modification. The audit report accompanying our financial statements for the year
ended December 31, 2015, contained a going concern modification, and therefore does not
satisfy the credit facility covenant. The lenders under the facility have agreed to waive until July
31, 2016, the requirement that we deliver audited annual financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015, without any going concern modification. Further, the lenders agreed that the
existence of audited annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, with a
going concern modification will not constitute a default or event of default under the facility until
July 31, 2016. Our continued failure to comply with this covenant after July 31, 2016, will result in
an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all outstanding
indebtedness, including the acceleration of our senior notes discussed below and any amounts
outstanding under the credit facility.
32
Table of Contents
The financial covenants under the credit facility are calculated as follows:
Our maximum leverage ratio (calculated as the ratio of funded indebtedness to adjusted
EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters) is 3.5 to 1, where funded indebtedness is calculated as
total funded indebtedness minus cash and cash equivalent investments on hand up to a
maximum of $75 million. Our leverage ratio at March 31, 2016, was 3.7 to 1.
•
•
Our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (calculated as the ratio of adjusted EBITDA for the
prior four fiscal quarters, minus maintenance capital expenditures and cash paid for income
taxes, to interest expense plus scheduled principal amortization of long-term funded
indebtedness) is 1.3 to 1, where annual maintenance capital expenditures is set at $20 million.
Our fixed charge coverage ratio at March 31, 2016, was 1.1 to 1.
These ratios and other restrictive covenants under the credit facility could limit our ability to
engage in activities that we believe are in our long-term best interests.
The facility is unsecured and is guaranteed by our material subsidiaries. We occasionally borrow
and repay amounts under the facility for near-term working capital needs and may do so in the
future. As of March 31, 2016, we had a $0.5 million letter of credit outstanding under the facility.
Unsecured Senior Notes
In April 2013, we issued $150 million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes (the
"Notes") pursuant to a note purchase agreement entered into in August 2012. The Notes consist
of the following series:
•$60 million of 3.23% Senior Notes, Series A, due April 16, 2020
•$45 million of 4.13% Senior Notes, Series B, due April 14, 2023
•$45 million of 4.28% Senior Notes, Series C, due April 16, 2025
The Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any other
unsubordinated unsecured indebtedness of ours. The Notes are subject to the same leverage
ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants as apply under the credit facility, as described
above. In January 2016, we amended the note purchase agreement to provide that the interest
rate for the senior notes will be increased by 0.25% during any time that our leverage ratio
exceeds 2.25 to 1. As we are not in compliance with our leverage ratio and fixed charge ratio as
of March 31, 2016, in accordance with the terms of the note purchase agreement, the above
interest rates are increased by 2% beginning April 1, 2016, and will continue as long as we are
not meeting these ratios. As described above, these ratios and other restrictive covenants under
the Notes could limit our ability to engage in activities that we believe are in our long-term best
interests.
 
We were not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Notes as of March 31, 2016;
however, the noteholders have agreed to waive until June 30, 2016, the requirement that we
comply with these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Further, the noteholders
agreed that noncompliance with these covenants for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, will not
constitute a default or event of default under the Notes until June 30, 2016. If current market
conditions continue, we anticipate that our adjusted EBITDA will not be sufficient for us to return
to compliance with these covenants through 2016. As a result, we are proactively working with
the noteholders and evaluating our options, which could include additional covenant
amendments, waivers, or forbearances, alternative financing arrangements, a possible further
reduction in the amount of our credit facility, and a possible reduction of our outstanding debt,
including the payment of prepayment penalties. Our continued failure to comply with these
covenants after June 30, 2016, will result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could
result in the acceleration of all outstanding indebtedness, including the acceleration of the Notes
and any amounts outstanding under the credit facility.
The obligations under the Notes are unconditionally guaranteed by our material subsidiaries.    
Interest is paid semiannually on April 16 and October 16 of each year. Interest expense is
recorded net of any capitalized interest associated with investments in capital projects. We
incurred gross interest expense of $2.3 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We capitalized $0.1 million and an immaterial amount of
interest during the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
33
Table of Contents
As of March 31, 2016, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements aside from the operating
leases and bonding obligations described in the accompanying notes to the condensed
consolidated financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, describes the critical
accounting policies that affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements. There have been no significant changes to
our critical accounting policies since December 31, 2015.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in
accordance with GAAP, we use several non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate
our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures include net sales, average net realized
sales price per ton, cash operating costs per ton, and average potash and Trio® gross margin per
ton. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute
for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. In
addition, because the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures varies among
companies, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies.
We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors for
analysis of our business. We use these non-GAAP financial measures as one of our tools in
comparing performance period over period on a consistent basis and when planning, forecasting,
and analyzing future periods. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are widely used
by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and investment
recommendations of companies in the potash mining industry. Many investors use the published
research reports of these professional research analysts and others in making investment
decisions.
Below is additional information about our non-GAAP financial measures, including
reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015.
Net Sales and Average Net Realized Sales Price per Ton
Net sales and average net realized sales price per ton are non-GAAP financial measures. Net
sales are calculated as sales less freight costs. Average net realized sales price per ton is
calculated as net sales, divided by the number of tons sold in the period. We consider net sales
and average net realized sales price per ton to be useful because they remove the effect of
transportation and delivery costs on sales and pricing. When we arrange transportation and
delivery for a customer, we include in revenue and in freight costs the costs associated with
transportation and delivery. However, many of our customers arrange for and pay their own
transportation and delivery costs, in which case these costs are not included in our revenue and
freight costs. We use net sales and average net realized sales price per ton as key performance
indicators to analyze sales and price trends.

Cash Operating Costs per Ton
Cash operating costs per ton is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as total cost of
goods sold divided by the number of tons sold in the period and then adjusted to exclude per-ton
depreciation, depletion, and royalties. Total cost of goods sold is reported net of by-product
credits and does not include warehousing and handling costs. We consider cash operating costs
per ton to be useful because it represents our core, per-ton costs to produce potash and Trio®.
We use cash operating costs per ton as an indicator of performance and operating efficiencies.

Average Potash and Trio® Gross Margin per Ton
Average potash and Trio® gross margin per ton are non-GAAP financial measures that are
calculated by subtracting the sum of per ton total cost of goods sold and per ton warehousing and
handling costs from the average net realized sales price. We believe these measures are useful
because they represent the average margin we realize on each ton of potash and Trio® sold. The
reconciliations of average potash and Trio® net realized sales price to GAAP sales are set forth
separately above under the heading "Net Sales and Average Net Realized Sales Price per Ton."
Amounts presented exclude lower-of-cost-or-market inventory adjustments of $41 per ton and $2
per ton of potash sold for the three months ended March 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Further, our average potash gross margin per ton excludes costs associated with abnormal
production of $3 per ton and $0 per ton of potash produced during the three months ended March
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

ITEM 3.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
Part II, Item 7A., "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk," of our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, describes our exposure to market
risk. There have been no significant changes to our market risk exposure since December 31,
2015.
ITEM 4.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures
are also designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our
management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive offer and principal
financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
March 31, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31,
2016, at the reasonable assurance level.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
three months ended March 31, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not
expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.
Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that
all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Intrepid have been detected. These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be
circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by
management override of the controls. The design of any system of
36
Table of Contents
controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and
there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of
the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may
occur and not be detected.
PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are subject to claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of business. While there are
uncertainties in predicting the outcome of any claim or legal action, we believe that the ultimate
resolution of these claims or actions is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. We maintain liability insurance that
will apply to some claims and actions and believe that our coverage is reasonable in view of the
insurable legal risks to which our business ordinarily is subject.
ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS
Our future performance is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could materially and
adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and the trading price of
our common stock. These risks and uncertainties are described in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors"
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no
material changes to these risks and uncertainties.

ITEM 4.MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
We are committed to providing a safe and healthy work environment. The objectives of our safety
programs are to eliminate workplace accidents and incidents, to preserve employee health, and
to comply with safety- and health-based regulations. We seek to achieve these objectives by
training employees in safe work practices; establishing, following, and improving safety
standards; involving employees in safety processes; openly communicating with employees
about safety matters; and recording, reporting, and investigating accidents, incidents, and losses
to avoid recurrence. As part of our ongoing safety programs, we collaborate with regulators to
identify and implement new accident prevention techniques and practices.
Our East, West and North facilities in New Mexico are subject to regulation by MSHA under the
Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the “Mine Act”) and the New Mexico Bureau of Mine
Safety. MSHA inspects these facilities on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders
when it believes a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Exhibit 95.1 to this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q provides the information concerning mine safety violations and other regulatory
matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K. Our Utah facilities and our HB solar solution mine
are subject to regulation by the Occupational Health and Safety Administration and, therefore,
are not required to be included in the information provided in Exhibit 95.1.
ITEM 5.OTHER INFORMATION
None.
