<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
promotion and protection of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression, Frank La Rue</b>*<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> This report explores key trends and challenges to the right of all individuals to seek, 
receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds through the Internet. The Special 
Rapporteur underscores the unique and transformative nature of the Internet not only to 
enable individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression, but also a 
range of other human rights, and to promote the progress of society as a whole. Chapter III 
of the report underlines the applicability of international human rights norms and standards 
on the right to freedom of opinion and expression to the Internet as a communication 
medium, and sets out the exceptional circumstances under which the dissemination of 
certain types of information may be restricted. Chapters IV and V address two dimensions 
of Internet access respectively: (a) access to content; and (b) access to the physical and 
technical infrastructure required to access the Internet in the first place. More specifically, 
chapter IV outlines some of the ways in which States are increasingly censoring 
information online, namely through: arbitrary blocking or filtering of content; 
criminalization of legitimate expression; imposition of intermediary liability; disconnecting 
users from Internet access, including on the basis of intellectual property rights law; cyber-
attacks; and inadequate protection of the right to privacy and data protection. Chapter V 
addresses the issue of universal access to the Internet. The Special Rapporteur intends to 
explore this topic further in his future report to the General Assembly. Chapter VI contains 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s conclusions and recommendations concerning the main subjects 
of the report.

<p> 
 The first addendum to the report comprises a summary of communications sent by 
the Special Rapporteur between 20 March 2010 and 31 March 2011, and the replies 
received from Governments. The second and third addenda contain the findings of the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s missions to the Republic of Korea and Mexico respectively.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 7/36. In particular, the resolution 
requests the Special Rapporteur &#8220;to continue to provide his/her views, when appropriate, on 
the advantages and challenges of new information and communication technologies, 
including the Internet and mobile technologies, for the exercise of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression, including the right to seek, receive and impart information and the 
relevance of a wide diversity of sources, as well as access to the information society for 
all&#8221;.1 On this basis, the report expands upon the previous mandate holders&#8217; reports on topics 
related to the Internet,2 taking into account recent developments and information gathered 
through five regional consultations organized by the Special Rapporteur in 2010 and 2011.3 
</p>
<p>2. While the Internet has been in existence since the 1960s, its current use throughout 
the world across different age groups, and incorporation into virtually every aspect of 
modern human life, has been unprecedented. According to the International 
Telecommunication Union, the total number of Internet users worldwide is now over 2 
billion.4 Active users of Facebook, an online social networking platform, grew from 150 
million to 600 million between 2009 and 2011. The Special Rapporteur believes that the 
Internet is one of the most powerful instruments of the 21st century for increasing 
transparency in the conduct of the powerful, access to information, and for facilitating 
active citizen participation in building democratic societies. Indeed, the recent wave of 
demonstrations in countries across the Middle East and North African region has shown the 
key role that the Internet can play in mobilizing the population to call for justice, equality, 
accountability and better respect for human rights. As such, facilitating access to the 
Internet for all individuals, with as little restriction to online content as possible, should be a 
priority for all States.  
</p>
<p>3. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur would like to underscore that access to the 
Internet has two dimensions: access to online content, without any restrictions except in a 
few limited cases permitted under international human rights law; and the availability of the 
necessary infrastructure and information communication technologies, such as cables, 
modems, computers and software, to access the Internet in the first place. The first 
dimension is addressed in Chapter IV of the report, which outlines some of the ways in 
which States are restricting the flow of information online through increasingly 
sophisticated means. The second dimension is examined in Chapter IV. The Special 
Rapporteur intends to explore the latter issue further in his future report to the General 
Assembly.

<p><b> II. Activities of the Special Rapporteur 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Communications 
</b></p>
<p>4. Between 20 March 2010 and 31 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent 195 
communications, 188 of which were submitted jointly with other special procedures 
mandate holders. The geographical distribution of the communications was as follows: 29 
per cent for Asia and the Pacific; 26 per cent for the Middle East and North Africa; 16 per 
cent for Africa; 15 per cent for Latin America and the Caribbean; and 14 per cent for 
Europe, Central Asia and North America. The summary of communications sent and replies 
received from Governments can be found in the first addendum to this report 
(A/HRC/17/27/Add.1). 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Participation in meetings and seminars  
</b></p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur, with the support of local organizations, organized a series 
of expert regional consultations, beginning in March 2010 in Stockholm, followed by 
Buenos Aires (18-19 October 2010), Bangkok (18-19 November 2010), Cairo (11-13 
January 2011), Johannesburg (15-16 February 2011), and Delhi (2-3 March 2011). The 
regional consultations concluded on 30 March 2011 with an expert meeting in Stockholm, 
organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sweden. These meetings brought together 
experts and human rights defenders working on a range of Internet and freedom of 
expression-related issues in order to better understand their experience, needs and priorities 
in different countries and regions for the purposes of this report.  
</p>
<p>6. From 14 to 17 September 2010, the Special Rapporteur attended the Fifth Internet 
Governance Forum in Vilnius. 
</p>
<p>7. On 30 November 2010, the Special Rapporteur participated in an expert round table 
entitled &#8220;Equality, Non-discrimination and Diversity: Challenge or Opportunity for the 
Mass Media?&#8221; in Geneva, organized by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR).  
</p>
<p>8. On 9 and 10 February 2011 and on 6 and 7 April 2011, the Special Rapporteur 
participated as an expert in the regional expert workshops on the prohibition of incitement 
to national, racial or religious hatred organized by OHCHR in Vienna and Nairobi 
respectively.   
</p>
<p>9. On 16 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur shared his views regarding the 
compatibility of blocking child pornography on the Internet with the right to freedom of 
expression in the context of discussions on the proposal for a directive of the European 
Parliament and of the Council on combating the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of 
children and child pornography.  
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur also participated in a series of academic events in other 
countries, including Guatemala, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, Sweden and the 
United States of America.  
</p>
<p><b> C.  Country visits  
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur notes that country visits remain central to his mandate. 
Requests sent to Governments to undertake a country mission are based on several factors, 
such as visits undertaken and requested by the former mandate holders, trends that emerge 
from communications sent on alleged violations of the right to freedom of opinion and </p>


<p>expression, and consideration of geographical balance. The Special Rapporteur hopes that 
visit requests will be favourably received by the Governments concerned. 
</p>
<p><b> 1.  Missions undertaken in 2010 and 2011  
</b></p>
<p>12. From 5 to 15 May 2010, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to the Republic 
of Korea. The mission report is included as an addendum to this report 
(A/HRC/17/27/Add.2).  
</p>
<p>13. From 10 to 21 August 2010, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to Mexico, 
together with the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression for the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights, Catalina Botero. The mission report is included as an 
addendum to this report (A/HRC/17/27/Add.3).  
</p>
<p>14. From 3 to 5 April 2011, the Special Rapporteur visited the Republic of Hungary, at 
the invitation of the Government, to provide expert advice to the Government regarding 
Hungarian media legislation. The press release with his conclusions and recommendations 
can be found on the OHCHR website.5 
</p>
<p>15. From 10 to 17 April 2011, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to Algeria. 
The mission report will be presented at a future session of the Human Rights Council in 
</p><p>2012. The press release with his initial conclusions and recommendations can be found on 
the OHCHR website.6 
</p>
<p><b>  2.  Upcoming missions 
</b></p>
<p>16. The visit to Israel and the occupied Palestinian territory, which was scheduled to 
take place in May 2011, has been postponed. The new dates of the visit have yet to be 
agreed upon.  
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Italian Government for its letter 
dated 6 August 2010 in response to his request for a visit. He hopes that a mutually 
convenient set of dates can be agreed upon for a visit in 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> 3.  Pending requests 
</b></p>
<p>18. As of March 2011, the following visit requests from the Special Rapporteur were 
pending: the Islamic Republic of Iran (requested in February 2010), Sri Lanka (requested in 
June 2009), Tunisia (requested in 2009), and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela 
(requested in 2003 and 2009). 
</p>
<p><b> III. General principles on the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression and the Internet 
</b></p>
<p>19. Very few if any developments in information technologies have had such a 
revolutionary effect as the creation of the Internet. Unlike any other medium of 
communication, such as radio, television and printed publications based on one-way 
transmission of information, the Internet represents a significant leap forward as an 
interactive medium. Indeed, with the advent of Web 2.0 services, or intermediary platforms 
that facilitate participatory information sharing and collaboration in the creation of content, 
individuals are no longer passive recipients, but also active publishers of information. Such 
</p>
<p>

 6  Ibid.   </p>


<p>platforms are particularly valuable in countries where there is no independent media, as 
they enable individuals to share critical views and to find objective information. 
Furthermore, producers of traditional media can also use the Internet to greatly expand their 
audiences at nominal cost. More generally, by enabling individuals to exchange information 
and ideas instantaneously and inexpensively across national borders, the Internet allows 
access to information and knowledge that was previously unattainable. This, in turn, 
contributes to the discovery of the truth and progress of society as a whole.  
</p>
<p>20. Indeed, the Internet has become a key means by which individuals can exercise their 
right to freedom of opinion and expression, as guaranteed by article 19 of the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
The latter provides that:  
</p>
<p> (a) Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference;  
</p>
<p> (b) Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall 
include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless 
of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other 
media of his choice;  
</p>
<p> (c) The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries 
with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain restrictions, 
but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:  
</p>
<p> (d) for respect of the rights or reputations of others;  
</p>
<p> (e) for the protection of national security or of public order (<i>ordre public</i>), or of 
public health or morals.  
</p>
<p>21. By explicitly providing that everyone has the right to express him or herself through 
any media, the Special Rapporteur underscores that article 19 of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights and the Covenant was drafted with foresight to include and to 
accommodate future technological developments through which individuals can exercise 
their right to freedom of expression. Hence, the framework of international human rights 
law remains relevant today and equally applicable to new communication technologies such 
as the Internet.  
</p>
<p>22. The right to freedom of opinion and expression is as much a fundamental right on its 
own accord as it is an &#8220;enabler&#8221; of other rights, including economic, social and cultural 
rights, such as the right to education and the right to take part in cultural life and to enjoy 
the benefits of scientific progress and its applications, as well as civil and political rights, 
such as the rights to freedom of association and assembly. Thus, by acting as a catalyst for 
individuals to exercise their right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Internet also 
facilitates the realization of a range of other human rights.  
</p>
<p>23. The vast potential and benefits of the Internet are rooted in its unique characteristics, 
such as its speed, worldwide reach and relative anonymity. At the same time, these 
distinctive features of the Internet that enable individuals to disseminate information in 
&#8220;real time&#8221; and to mobilize people has also created fear amongst Governments and the 
powerful. This has led to increased restrictions on the Internet through the use of 
increasingly sophisticated technologies to block content, monitor and identify activists and 
critics, criminalization of legitimate expression, and adoption of restrictive legislation to 
justify such measures. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur also emphasizes that the 
existing international human rights standards, in particular article 19, paragraph 3, of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, remain pertinent in determining the 
types of restrictions that are in breach of States&#8217; obligations to guarantee the right to 
freedom of expression.  </p>


<p>24. As set out in article 19, paragraph 3, of the Covenant, there are certain exceptional 
types of expression which may be legitimately restricted under international human rights 
law, essentially to safeguard the rights of others. This issue has been examined in the 
previous annual report of the Special Rapporteur.7 However, the Special Rapporteur deems 
it appropriate to reiterate that any limitation to the right to freedom of expression must pass 
the following three-part, cumulative test:  
</p>
<p> (a) It must be provided by law, which is clear and accessible to everyone 
(principles of predictability and transparency); and  
</p>
<p> (b) It must pursue one of the purposes set out in article 19, paragraph 3, of the 
Covenant, namely (i) to protect the rights or reputations of others, or (ii) to protect national 
security or of public order, or of public health or morals (principle of legitimacy); and  
</p>
<p> (c) It must be proven as necessary and the least restrictive means required to 
achieve the purported aim (principles of necessity and proportionality). 
</p>
<p>Moreover, any legislation restricting the right to freedom of expression must be applied by 
a body which is independent of any political, commercial, or other unwarranted influences 
in a manner that is neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, and with adequate safeguards 
against abuse, including the possibility of challenge and remedy against its abusive 
application. 
</p>
<p>25. As such, legitimate types of information which may be restricted include child 
pornography (to protect the rights of children),8 hate speech (to protect the rights of affected 
communities),9 defamation (to protect the rights and reputation of others against 
unwarranted attacks), direct and public incitement to commit genocide (to protect the rights 
of others),10 and advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement 
to discrimination, hostility or violence (to protect the rights of others, such as the right to 
life).11  
</p>
<p>26. However, in many instances, States restrict, control, manipulate and censor content 
disseminated via the Internet without any legal basis, or on the basis of broad and 
ambiguous laws, without justifying the purpose of such actions; and/or in a manner that is 
clearly unnecessary and/or disproportionate to achieving the intended aim, as explored in 
the following sections. Such actions are clearly incompatible with States&#8217; obligations under 
international human rights law, and often create a broader &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; on the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression.  
</p>
<p>27. In addition, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that due to the unique characteristics 
of the Internet, regulations or restrictions which may be deemed legitimate and 
proportionate for traditional media are often not so with regard to the Internet. For example, 
in cases of defamation of individuals&#8217; reputation, given the ability of the individual 
concerned to exercise his/her right of reply instantly to restore the harm caused, the types of 
sanctions that are applied to offline defamation may be unnecessary or disproportionate.

 8  Dissemination of child pornography is prohibited under international human rights law, see e.g. 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, art. 3, para. 1(c). 
</p>
<p> 9  See for example <i>Faurisson v. France</i>, United Nations Human Rights Committee, communication 
550/1993, views of 8 November 1996. The issue of hate speech has also been addressed in previous 
reports, see inter alia E/CN.4/1999/64; E/CN.4/2000/63; E/CN.4/2002/75; and A/HRC/4/27. 
</p>
<p> 10  See for example article 3(c) of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of 
Genocide.  
</p>
<p> 11 See for example article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  </p>


<p>Similarly, while the protection of children from inappropriate content may constitute a 
legitimate aim, the availability of software filters that parents and school authorities can use 
to control access to certain content renders action by the Government such as blocking less 
necessary, and difficult to justify.12 Furthermore, unlike the broadcasting sector, for which  
registration or licensing has been necessary to allow States to distribute limited frequencies, 
such requirements cannot be justified in the case of the Internet, as it can accommodate an 
unlimited number of points of entry and an essentially unlimited number of users.13  
</p>
<p><b> IV.  Restriction of content on the Internet     
</b></p>
<p>28. As outlined under Chapter III, any restriction to the right to freedom of expression 
must meet the strict criteria under international human rights law. A restriction on the right 
of individuals to express themselves through the Internet can take various forms, from 
technical measures to prevent access to certain content, such as blocking and filtering, to 
inadequate guarantees of the right to privacy and protection of personal data, which inhibit 
the dissemination of opinions and information. The Special Rapporteur is of the view that 
the arbitrary use of criminal law to sanction legitimate expression constitutes one of the 
gravest forms of restriction to the right, as it not only creates a &#8220;chilling effect&#8221;, but also 
leads to other human rights violations, such as arbitrary detention and torture and other 
forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.  
</p>
<p><b> A.  Arbitrary blocking or filtering of content  
</b></p>
<p>29. Blocking refers to measures taken to prevent certain content from reaching an end-
user. This includes preventing users from accessing specific websites, Internet Protocol (IP) 
addresses, domain name extensions, the taking down of websites from the web server 
where they are hosted, or using filtering technologies to exclude pages containing keywords 
or other specific content from appearing. For example, several countries continue to block 
access to YouTube,14 a video-sharing website on which users can upload, share and view 
videos. China, which has in place one of the most sophisticated and extensive systems for 
controlling information on the Internet, has adopted extensive filtering systems that block 
access to websites containing key terms such as &#8220;democracy&#8221; and &#8220;human rights&#8221;.15 The 
Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that mechanisms used to regulate and censor 
information on the Internet are increasingly sophisticated, with multi-layered controls that 
are often hidden from the public.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned by the emerging trend of timed (or &#8220;just-
in-time&#8221;) blocking to prevent users from accessing or disseminating information at key 
political moments, such as elections, times of social unrest, or anniversaries of politically or 
historically significant events. During such times, websites of opposition parties, 
independent media, and social networking platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are

 13  However, this does not apply to registration with a domain name authority for purely technical 
</p>
<p>reasons or rules of general application which apply without distinction to any kind of commercial 
operation.

<p>blocked, as witnessed in the context of recent protests across the Middle East and North 
African region. In Egypt, users were disconnected entirely from Internet access.  
</p>
<p>31. States&#8217; use of blocking or filtering technologies is frequently in violation of their 
obligation to guarantee the right to freedom of expression, as the criteria mentioned under 
chapter III are not met. Firstly, the specific conditions that justify blocking are not 
established in law, or are provided by law but in an overly broad and vague manner, which 
risks content being blocked arbitrarily and excessively. Secondly, blocking is not justified 
to pursue aims which are listed under article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights, and blocking lists are generally kept secret, which makes it 
difficult to assess whether access to content is being restricted for a legitimate purpose. 
Thirdly, even where justification is provided, blocking measures constitute an unnecessary 
or disproportionate means to achieve the purported aim, as they are often not sufficiently 
targeted and render a wide range of content inaccessible beyond that which has been 
deemed illegal. Lastly, content is frequently blocked without the intervention of or 
possibility for review by a judicial or independent body.  
</p>
<p>32. The Special Rapporteur notes that child pornography is one clear exception where 
blocking measures can be justified, provided that the national law is sufficiently precise and 
there are effective safeguards against abuse or misuse, including oversight and review by an 
independent and impartial tribunal or regulatory body. However, he is also concerned that 
States frequently rely heavily on blocking measures, rather than focusing their efforts on 
prosecuting those responsible for the production and dissemination of child pornography. 
Additionally, as child pornography is often a by-product of trafficking and prostitution of 
children, the Special Rapporteur urges States to take holistic measures to combat the root 
problems that give rise to child pornography. 
</p>
<p><b> B.  Criminalization of legitimate expression  
</b></p>
<p>33. The types of action taken by States to limit the dissemination of content online not 
only include measures to prevent information from reaching the end-user, but also direct 
targeting of those who seek, receive and impart politically sensitive information via the 
Internet. Physically silencing criticism or dissent through arbitrary arrests and detention, 
enforced disappearance, harassment and intimidation is an old phenomenon, and also 
applies to Internet users. This issue has been explored in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s report to 
the General Assembly under the section on &#8220;protection of citizen journalists&#8221; (A/65/284). 
Such actions are often aimed not only to silence legitimate expression, but also to 
intimidate a population to push its members towards self-censorship.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that legitimate online expression is being 
criminalized in contravention of States&#8217; international human rights obligations, whether it is 
through the application of existing criminal laws to online expression, or through the 
creation of new laws specifically designed to criminalize expression on the Internet. Such 
laws are often justified on the basis of protecting an individual&#8217;s reputation, national 
security or countering terrorism, but in practice are used to censor content that the 
Government and other powerful entities do not like or agree with.  
</p>
<p>35. One clear example of criminalizing legitimate expression is the imprisonment of 
bloggers around the world. According to Reporters without Borders, in 2010, 109 bloggers 
were in prison on charges related to the content of their online expression.16 Seventy-two

<p>individuals were imprisoned in China alone, followed by Viet Nam and Iran, with 17 and 
13 persons respectively.17   
</p>
<p>36. Imprisoning individuals for seeking, receiving and imparting information and ideas 
can rarely be justified as a proportionate measure to achieve one of the legitimate aims 
under article 19, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that defamation should be decriminalized, 
and that protection of national security or countering terrorism cannot be used to justify 
restricting the right to expression unless the Government can demonstrate that: (a) the 
expression is intended to incite imminent violence; (b) it is likely to incite such violence; 
and (c) there is a direct and immediate connection between the expression and the 
likelihood or occurrence of such violence.18  
</p>
<p>37. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates that the right to freedom of 
expression includes expression of views and opinions that offend, shock or disturb. 
Moreover, as the Human Rights Council has also stated in its resolution 12/16, restrictions 
should never be applied, inter alia, to discussion of Government policies and political 
debate; reporting on human rights, Government activities and corruption in Government; 
engaging in election campaigns, peaceful demonstrations or political activities, including 
for peace or democracy; and expression of opinion and dissent, religion or belief, including 
by persons belonging to minorities or vulnerable groups.19 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Imposition of intermediary liability    
</b></p>
<p>38. One of the unique features of the Internet is that the way in which information is 
transmitted largely depends on intermediaries, or private corporations which provide 
services and platforms that facilitate online communication or transactions between third 
parties, including giving access to, hosting, transmitting and indexing content.20 
Intermediaries thus range from Internet service providers (ISPs) to search engines, and from 
blogging services to online community platforms. With the advent of Web 2.0 services, 
individuals can now publish information without the centralized gateway of editorial review 
common in traditional publication formats. The range of services offered by intermediaries 
has flourished over the past decade, mainly due to the legal protection that they have 
enjoyed from liability for third-party content that Internet users send via their services. 
However, the Special Rapporteur notes that in recent years, intermediaries&#8217; protection from 
liability has been eroding.  
</p>
<p>39. Many States have adopted laws which impose liability upon intermediaries if they 
do not filter, remove or block content generated by users which is deemed illegal. For 
example, in Turkey, Law 5651 on the Prevention of Crime Committed in the Information 
Technology Domain, which was enacted in 2007, imposes new obligations on content 
providers, ISPs and website hosts. It also grants authority to an agency to issue 
administrative orders to block websites for content hosted outside of Turkey, and to take 
down eight broad types of unlawful content,21 including &#8220;crimes against Ataturk&#8221;, which

 21  Law 5651, art. 8. </p>


<p>includes &#8220;insulting&#8221; the founder of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk. In 
Thailand, the 2007 Computer Crimes Act imposes liability upon intermediaries that 
transmit or host third-party content and content authors themselves.22 This law has been 
used to prosecute individuals providing online platforms, some of which are summarized in 
the first addendum.  
</p>
<p>40. In other cases, intermediary liability is imposed through privacy and data protection 
laws. For example, a court in Italy convicted three Google executives for violating the 
Italian data protection code after a video depicting cruelty to a disabled teenager was posted 
by a user on the Google video service. Even though the video was taken down within hours 
of notification by Italian law enforcers, the judge found the Google executives guilty.23 The 
Government of China requires ISPs and web platforms to conduct surveillance on their 
users, and they are also held directly responsible for content posted by users.24 Companies 
that fail to comply with this obligation risk losing their business licences. Holding 
intermediaries liable for the content disseminated or created by their users severely 
undermines the enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, because it 
leads to self-protective and over-broad private censorship, often without transparency and 
the due process of the law.  
</p>
<p>41. Several States have sought to protect intermediaries through adopting variations on 
what is known as a &#8220;notice-and-takedown&#8221; regime. Such a system protects intermediaries 
from liability, provided that they take down unlawful material when they are made aware of 
its existence. For example, under the European Union-wide E-Commerce Directive, a 
provider of hosting services for user-generated content can avoid liability for such content 
if it does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity and if it expeditiously removes the 
content in question when made aware of it.25 Similarly, the Digital Millennium Copyright 
Act of the United States of America also provides safe harbour for intermediaries, provided 
that they take down the content in question promptly after notification.26  
</p>
<p>42. However, while a notice-and-takedown system is one way to prevent intermediaries 
from actively engaging in or encouraging unlawful behaviour on their services, it is subject 
to abuse by both State and private actors. Users who are notified by the service provider 
that their content has been flagged as unlawful often have little recourse or few resources to 
challenge the takedown.27 Moreover, given that intermediaries may still be held financially 
or in some cases criminally liable if they do not remove content upon receipt of notification 
by users regarding unlawful content, they are inclined to err on the side of safety by over-
censoring potentially illegal content. Lack of transparency in the intermediaries&#8217; decision-
making process also often obscures discriminatory practices or political pressure affecting 
the companies&#8217; decisions. Furthermore, intermediaries, as private entities, are not best 
placed to make the determination of whether a particular content is illegal, which requires 
careful balancing of competing interests and consideration of defences.

online political speech&#8221; (September 2010).  </p>


<p>43. The Special Rapporteur believes that censorship measures should never be delegated 
to a private entity, and that no one should be held liable for content on the Internet of which 
they are not the author. Indeed, no State should use or force intermediaries to undertake 
censorship on its behalf, as is the case in the Republic of Korea with the establishment of 
the Korea Communications Standards Commission, a quasi-State and quasi-private entity 
tasked to regulate online content (see A/HRC/17/27/Add.2). The Special Rapporteur 
welcomes initiatives taken in other countries to protect intermediaries, such as the bill 
adopted in Chile, which provides that intermediaries are not required to prevent or remove 
access to user-generated content that infringes copyright laws until they are notified by a 
court order. 28 A similar regime has also been proposed in Brazil.29  
</p>
<p><b>  Responsibility of intermediaries  
</b></p>
<p>44. Given that Internet services are run and maintained by private companies, the private 
sector has gained unprecedented influence over individuals&#8217; right to freedom of expression 
and access to information. Generally, companies have played an extremely positive role in 
facilitating the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. At the same time, 
given the pressure exerted upon them by States, coupled with the fact that their primary 
motive is to generate profit rather than to respect human rights, preventing the private 
sector from assisting or being complicit in human rights violations of States is essential to 
guarantee the right to freedom of expression.   
</p>
<p>45. While States are the duty-bearers for human rights, private actors and business 
enterprises also have a responsibility to respect human rights. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur highlights the framework of &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; which has been 
developed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises. The framework rests 
on three pillars: (a) the duty of the State to protect against human rights abuses by third 
parties, including business enterprises, through appropriate policies, regulation and 
adjudication; (b) the corporate responsibility to respect human rights, which means that 
business enterprises should act with due diligence to avoid infringing the rights of others 
and to address adverse impacts with which they are involved; and (c) the need for greater 
access by victims to effective remedy, both judicial and non-judicial.30  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur notes that multi-stakeholder initiatives are essential to deal 
effectively with issues related to the Internet, and the Global Network Initiative serves as a 
helpful example to encourage good practice by corporations.31 Although only three 
corporations, namely Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo!, have participated in this initiative so 
far, the Special Rapporteur welcomes their commitment to undertake a human rights impact 
assessment of their decisions, including before entering a foreign market, and to ensure 
transparency and accountability when confronted with situations that may undermine the 
rights to freedom of expression and privacy. Google&#8217;s Transparency Report32 is an outcome 
of such work, and provides information on Government inquiries for information about 
users and requests for Google to take down or censor content, as well as statistical 
information on traffic to Google services, such as YouTube. By illustrating traffic patterns 
for a given country or region, it allows users to discern any disruption in the free flow of 
information, whether it is due to Government censorship or a cable cut.

<p>47. The Special Rapporteur commends such initiatives to enhance the responsibility of 
Internet intermediaries to respect human rights. To avoid infringing the right to freedom of 
expression and the right to privacy of Internet users, the Special Rapporteur recommends 
intermediaries to: only implement restrictions to these rights after judicial intervention; be 
transparent to the user involved about measures taken, and where applicable to the wider 
public; provide, if possible, forewarning to users before the implementation of restrictive 
measures; and minimize the impact of restrictions strictly to the content involved. Finally, 
there must be effective remedies for affected users, including the possibility of appeal 
through the procedures provided by the intermediary and by a competent judicial authority. 
</p>
<p>48. More generally, the Special Rapporteur encourages corporations to establish clear 
and unambiguous terms of service in line with international human rights norms and 
principles, increase transparency of and accountability for their activities, and continuously 
review the impact of their services and technologies on the right to freedom of expression 
of their users, as well as on the potential pitfalls involved when they are misused.   
</p>
<p><b> D.  Disconnecting users from Internet access, including on the basis of 
violations of intellectual property rights law 
</b></p>
<p>49. While blocking and filtering measures deny access to certain content on the Internet, 
States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. The Special 
Rapporteur is deeply concerned by discussions regarding a centralized &#8220;on/off&#8221; control over 
Internet traffic.33 In addition, he is alarmed by proposals to disconnect users from Internet 
access if they violate intellectual property rights. This also includes legislation based on the 
concept of &#8220;graduated response&#8221;, which imposes a series of penalties on copyright 
infringers that could lead to suspension of Internet service, such as the so-called &#8220;three-
strikes-law&#8221; in France34 and the Digital Economy Act 2010 of the United Kingdom.35 
</p>
<p>50. Beyond the national level, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) has 
been proposed as a multilateral agreement to establish international standards on 
intellectual property rights enforcement. While the provisions to disconnect individuals 
from Internet access for violating the treaty have been removed from the final text of 
December 2010, the Special Rapporteur remains watchful about the treaty&#8217;s eventual 
implications for intermediary liability and the right to freedom of expression.  
</p>
<p><b> E.  Cyber-attacks  
</b></p>
<p>51. Cyber-attacks, or attempts to undermine or compromise the function of a computer-
based system, include measures such as hacking into accounts or computer networks, and 
often take the form of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. During such attacks, a 
group of computers is used to inundate a web server where the targeted website is hosted 
with requests, and as a result, the targeted website crashes and becomes inaccessible for a 
certain period of time. As with timed blocking, such attacks are sometimes undertaken 
during key political moments. The Special Rapporteur also notes that websites of human

<p>rights organizations and dissidents are frequently and increasingly becoming targets of 
DDoS attacks, some of which are included in the first addendum to this report.  
</p>
<p>52. When a cyber-attack can be attributed to the State, it clearly constitutes inter alia a 
violation of its obligation to respect the right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
Although determining the origin of cyber-attacks and the identity of the perpetrator is often 
technically difficult, it should be noted that States have an obligation to protect individuals 
against interference by third parties that undermines the enjoyment of the right to freedom 
of opinion and expression. This positive obligation to protect entails that States must take 
appropriate and effective measures to investigate actions taken by third parties, hold the 
persons responsible to account, and adopt measures to prevent such recurrence in the future.  
</p>
<p><b> F.  Inadequate protection of the right to privacy and data protection  
</b></p>
<p>53. The right to privacy is essential for individuals to express themselves freely. Indeed, 
throughout history, people&#8217;s willingness to engage in debate on controversial subjects in the 
public sphere has always been linked to possibilities for doing so anonymously. The 
Internet allows individuals to access information and to engage in public debate without 
having to reveal their real identities, for example through the use of pseudonyms on 
message boards and chat forums. Yet, at the same time, the Internet also presents new tools 
and mechanisms through which both State and private actors can monitor and collect 
information about individuals&#8217; communications and activities on the Internet. Such practices 
can constitute a violation of the Internet users&#8217; right to privacy, and, by undermining 
people&#8217;s confidence and security on the Internet, impede the free flow of information and 
ideas online.  
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by actions taken by States against 
individuals communicating via the Internet, frequently justified broadly as being necessary 
to protect national security or to combat terrorism. While such ends can be legitimate under 
international human rights law, surveillance often takes place for political, rather than 
security reasons in an arbitrary and covert manner. For example, States have used popular 
social networking sites, such as Facebook, to identify and to track the activities of human 
rights defenders and opposition members, and in some cases have collected usernames and 
passwords to access private communications of Facebook users.  
</p>
<p>55. A number of States are also introducing laws or modifying existing laws to increase 
their power to monitor Internet users&#8217; activities and content of communication without 
providing sufficient guarantees against abuse. In addition, several States have established a 
real-name identification system before users can post comments or upload content online, 
which can compromise their ability to express themselves anonymously, particularly in 
countries where human rights are frequently violated. Furthermore, steps are also being 
taken in many countries to reduce the ability of Internet users to protect themselves from 
arbitrary surveillance, such as limiting the use of encryption technologies.  
</p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur also notes that there are insufficient or inadequate data 
protection laws in many States stipulating who is allowed to access personal data, what it 
can be used for, how it should be stored, and for how long. The necessity of adopting clear 
laws to protect personal data is further increased in the current information age, where large 
volumes of personal data are collected and stored by intermediaries, and there is a worrying 
trend of States obliging or pressuring these private actors to hand over information of their 
users. Moreover, with the increasing use of cloud-computing services, where information is 
stored on servers distributed in different geographical locations, ensuring that third parties 
also adhere to strict data protection guarantees is paramount.  </p>


<p>57. The right to privacy is guaranteed by article 12 of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
The latter provides that &#8220;(1) no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference 
with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour 
and reputation; (2) everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such 
interference or attacks.&#8221; Although &#8220;correspondence&#8221; primarily has been interpreted as 
written letters, this term today covers all forms of communication, including via the 
Internet.36 The right to private correspondence thus gives rise to a comprehensive obligation 
on the part of the State to ensure that e-mails and other forms of online communication are 
actually delivered to the desired recipient without interference or inspection by State organs 
or by third parties.37  
</p>
<p>58. In addition, the protection of personal data represents a special form of respect for 
the right to privacy.38 States parties are required by article 17(2) to regulate, through clearly 
articulated laws, the recording, processing, use and conveyance of automated personal data 
and to protect those affected against misuse by State organs as well as private parties. In 
addition to prohibiting data processing for purposes that are incompatible with the 
Covenant, data protection laws must establish rights to information, correction and, if need 
be, deletion of data and provide effective supervisory measures. Moreover, as stated in the 
Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general comment on the right to privacy, &#8220;in order to have the 
most effective protection of his private life, every individual should have the right to 
ascertain in an intelligible form, whether, and if so, what personal data is stored in 
automatic data files, and for what purposes. Every individual should also be able to 
ascertain which public authorities or private individuals or bodies control or may control 
their files.&#8221;39 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur notes that the right to privacy can be subject to restrictions 
or limitations under certain exceptional circumstances. This may include State surveillance 
measures for the purposes of administration of criminal justice, prevention of crime or 
combating terrorism. However, such interference is permissible only if the criteria for 
permissible limitations under international human rights law are met. Hence, there must be 
a law that clearly outlines the conditions whereby individuals&#8217; right to privacy can be 
restricted under exceptional circumstances, and measures encroaching upon this right must 
be taken on the basis of a specific decision by a State authority expressly empowered by 
law to do so, usually the judiciary, for the purpose of protecting the rights of others, for 
example to secure evidence to prevent the commission of a crime, and must respect the 
principle of proportionality.40   
</p>
<p><b> V. Access to the Internet and the necessary infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p>60. The Internet, as a medium by which the right to freedom of expression can be 
exercised, can only serve its purpose if States assume their commitment to develop 
effective policies to attain universal access to the Internet. Without concrete policies and

<p>plans of action, the Internet will become a technological tool that is accessible only to a 
certain elite while perpetrating the &#8220;digital divide&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>61. The term &#8220;digital divide&#8221; refers to the gap between people with effective access to 
digital and information technologies, in particular the Internet, and those with very limited 
or no access at all. In contrast to 71.6 Internet users per 100 inhabitants in developed States, 
there are only 21.1 Internet users per 100 inhabitants in developing States.41 This disparity 
is starker in the African region, with only 9.6 users per 100 inhabitants.42 In addition, digital 
divides also exist along wealth, gender, geographical and social lines within States. Indeed, 
with wealth being one of the significant factors in determining who can access information 
communication technologies, Internet access is likely to be concentrated among socio-
economic elites, particularly in countries where Internet penetration is low. In addition, 
people in rural areas are often confronted with obstacles to Internet access, such as lack of 
technological availability, slower Internet connection, and/or higher costs. Furthermore, 
even where Internet connection is available, disadvantaged groups, such as persons with 
disabilities and persons belonging to minority groups, often face barriers to accessing the 
Internet in a way that is meaningful, relevant and useful to them in their daily lives.  
</p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur is thus concerned that without Internet access, which 
facilitates economic development and the enjoyment of a range of human rights, 
marginalized groups and developing States remain trapped in a disadvantaged situation, 
thereby perpetuating inequality both within and between States. As he has noted previously, 
to combat situations of inequality it is critical to ensure that marginalized or disadvantaged 
sections of society can express their grievances effectively and that their voices are heard. 43 
The Internet offers a key means by which such groups can obtain information, assert their 
rights, and participate in public debates concerning social, economic and political changes 
to improve their situation. Moreover, the Internet is an important educational tool, as it 
provides access to a vast and expanding source of knowledge, supplements or transforms 
traditional forms of schooling, and makes, through &#8220;open access&#8221; initiatives, previously 
unaffordable scholarly research available to people in developing States. Additionally, the 
educational benefits attained from Internet usage directly contribute to the human capital of 
States. 
</p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur notes that several initiatives have been taken in an attempt 
to bridge the digital divide. At the international level, Target 8f of the Millennium 
Development Goals calls upon States, &#8220;in consultation with the private sector, [to] make 
available the benefits of new technologies, especially information and communications.&#8221; 
The necessity of achieving this target was reiterated in the 2003 Plan of Action adopted at 
the Geneva World Summit on the Information Society, which outlines specific goals and 
targets to &#8220;build an inclusive Information Society; to put the potential of knowledge and 
[information communication technologies] (ICTs) at the service of development; to 
promote the use of information and knowledge for the achievement of internationally 
agreed development goals.&#8221;44 To implement this plan of action, in 2005, the International 
Telecommunication Union launched the &#8220;Connect the World&#8221; project.45 Another initiative 
to spread the availability of ICTs in developing countries is the &#8220;One Laptop Per Child&#8221;

<p>project that has been supported by the United Nations Development Programme. This 
project distributes affordable laptops that are specifically customized for the learning 
environment of children. Since this project was mentioned in the previous mandate holder&#8217;s 
report in 2006, 2.4 million laptops have been distributed to children and teachers 
worldwide.46 In Uruguay, the project has reached 480,000 children, amounting to almost all 
children enrolled in primary school.47 States in Africa lag behind, but in Rwanda, over 
56,000 laptops have been distributed, with plans for the figure to reach 100,000 by June 
2011.48 
</p>
<p>64. At the national level, the Special Rapporteur notes that a number of initiatives have 
also been taken by States to address the digital divide. In India, Common Service Centres, 
or public &#8220;e-Kiosks&#8221;, have been established by the Government in collaboration with the 
private sector as part of the National E-Governance Plan of 2006. As of January 2011, over 
87,000 centres have reportedly been established,49 although the Special Rapporteur notes 
that the majority of the country&#8217;s population still remains without Internet access. In Brazil, 
the Government has launched a &#8220;computers for all&#8221; programme which offers subsidies for 
purchasing computers.50 Additionally, over 100,000 publicly sponsored Internet access 
centres, known as &#8220;Local Area Network (LAN) Houses&#8221; with fast broadband Internet 
connections, have been established.51 Such public access points are particularly important 
to facilitate access for the poorest socio-economic groups, as they often do not have their 
own personal computers at home.  
</p>
<p>65. In some economically developed States, Internet access has been recognized as a 
right. For example, the parliament of Estonia passed legislation in 2000 declaring Internet 
access a basic human right.52 The constitutional council of France effectively declared 
Internet access a fundamental right in 2009, and the constitutional court of Costa Rica 
reached a similar decision in 2010.53 Going a step further, Finland passed a decree in 2009 
stating that every Internet connection needs to have a speed of at least one Megabit per 
second (broadband level).54 The Special Rapporteur also takes note that according to a

<p>survey by the British Broadcasting Corporation in March 2010, 79% of those interviewed 
in 26 countries believe that Internet access is a fundamental human right.55 
</p>
<p>66. Given that access to basic commodities such as electricity remains difficult in many 
developing States, the Special Rapporteur is acutely aware that universal access to the 
Internet for all individuals worldwide cannot be achieved instantly. However, the Special 
Rapporteur reminds all States of their positive obligation to promote or to facilitate the 
enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression and the means necessary to exercise this 
right, including the Internet. Hence, States should adopt effective and concrete policies and 
strategies &#8211; developed in consultation with individuals from all segments of society, 
including the private sector as well as relevant Government ministries &#8211; to make the 
Internet widely available, accessible and affordable to all.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Unlike any other medium, the Internet enables individuals to seek, receive and 
impart information and ideas of all kinds instantaneously and inexpensively across 
national borders. By vastly expanding the capacity of individuals to enjoy their right 
to freedom of opinion and expression, which is an &#8220;enabler&#8221; of other human rights, 
the Internet boosts economic, social and political development, and contributes to the 
progress of humankind as a whole. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages 
other Special Procedures mandate holders to engage on the issue of the Internet with 
respect to their particular mandates.  
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that there should be as little restriction as 
possible to the flow of information via the Internet, except in few, exceptional, and 
limited circumstances prescribed by international human rights law. He also stresses 
that the full guarantee of the right to freedom of expression must be the norm, and 
any limitation considered as an exception, and that this principle should never be 
reversed. Against this backdrop, the Special Rapporteur recommends the steps set out 
below. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Restriction of content on the Internet  
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Rapporteur is cognizant of the fact that, like all technological 
inventions, the Internet can be misused to cause harm to others. As with offline 
content, when a restriction is imposed as an exceptional measure on online content, it 
must pass a three-part, cumulative test: (1) it must be provided by law, which is clear 
and accessible to everyone (principles of predictability and transparency); (2) it must 
pursue one of the purposes set out in article 19, paragraph 3, of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , namely: (i) to protect the rights or reputations 
of others; (ii) to protect national security or public order, or public health or morals 
(principle of legitimacy); and (3) it must be proven as necessary and the least 
restrictive means required to achieve the purported aim (principles of necessity and 
proportionality). In addition, any legislation restricting the right to freedom of 
expression must be applied by a body which is independent of any political, 
commercial, or other unwarranted influences in a manner that is neither arbitrary 
nor discriminatory. There should also be adequate safeguards against abuse, 
including the possibility of challenge and remedy against its abusive application.

<p><b> 1.  Arbitrary blocking or filtering of content on the Internet 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by increasingly sophisticated 
blocking or filtering mechanisms used by States for censorship. The lack of 
transparency surrounding these measures also makes it difficult to ascertain whether 
blocking or filtering is really necessary for the purported aims put forward by States. 
As such, the Special Rapporteur calls upon States that currently block websites to 
provide lists of blocked websites and full details regarding the necessity and 
justification for blocking each individual website. An explanation should also be 
provided on the affected websites as to why they have been blocked. Any 
determination on what content should be blocked must be undertaken by a competent 
judicial authority or a body which is independent of any political, commercial, or 
other unwarranted influences. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>With regard to child pornography, the Special Rapporteur notes that it is one 
clear exception where blocking measures are justified, provided that the national law 
is sufficiently precise and there are sufficient safeguards against abuse or misuse to 
prevent any &#8220;mission creep&#8221;, including oversight and review by an independent and 
impartial tribunal or regulatory body. However, the Special Rapporteur calls upon 
States to focus their efforts on prosecuting those responsible for the production and 
dissemination of child pornography, rather than on blocking measures alone.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 2.  Criminalization of legitimate expression  
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that legitimate online expression is 
being criminalized in contravention of States&#8217; international human rights obligations, 
whether it is through the application of existing criminal laws to online expression, or 
through the creation of new laws specifically designed to criminalize expression on the 
Internet. Such laws are often justified as being necessary to protect individuals&#8217; 
reputation, national security or to counter terrorism. However, in practice, they are 
frequently used to censor content that the Government and other powerful entities do 
not like or agree with. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The Special Rapporteur reiterates the call to all States to decriminalize 
defamation. Additionally, he underscores that protection of national security or 
countering terrorism cannot be used to justify restricting the right to expression 
unless it can be demonstrated that: (a) the expression is intended to incite imminent 
violence; (b) it is likely to incite such violence; and (c) there is a direct and immediate 
connection between the expression and the likelihood or occurrence of such violence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 3.  Imposition of intermediary liability  
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>Intermediaries play a fundamental role in enabling Internet users to enjoy their 
right to freedom of expression and access to information. Given their unprecedented 
influence over how and what is circulated on the Internet, States have increasingly 
sought to exert control over them and to hold them legally liable for failing to prevent 
access to content deemed to be illegal.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>The Special Rapporteur emphasizes that censorship measures should never be 
delegated to private entities, and that intermediaries should not be held liable for 
refusing to take action that infringes individuals&#8217; human rights. Any requests 
submitted to intermediaries to prevent access to certain content, or to disclose private 
information for strictly limited purposes such as administration of criminal justice, 
should be done through an order issued by a court or a competent body which is 
independent of any political, commercial or other unwarranted influences.  </b></p>


<p>76. <b>In addition, while States are the primary duty-bearers of human rights, the 
Special Rapporteur underscores that corporations also have a responsibility to respect 
human rights, which means that they should act with due diligence to avoid infringing 
the rights of individuals. The Special Rapporteur thus recommends intermediaries to: 
only implement restrictions to these rights after judicial intervention; be transparent 
to the user involved about measures taken, and, where applicable, to the wider public; 
provide, if possible, forewarning to users before the implementation of restrictive 
measures; and minimize the impact of restrictions strictly to the content involved. 
Finally, there must be effective remedies for affected users, including the possibility of 
appeal through the procedures provided by the intermediary and by a competent 
judicial authority. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>The Special Rapporteur commends the work undertaken by organizations and 
individuals to reveal the worldwide status of online impediments to the right to 
freedom of expression. He encourages intermediaries in particular to disclose details 
regarding content removal requests and accessibility of websites. Additionally, he 
recommends corporations to establish clear and unambiguous terms of service in line 
with international human rights norms and principles and to continuously review the 
impact of their services and technologies on the right to freedom of expression of their 
users, as well as on the potential pitfalls involved when they are misused. The Special 
Rapporteur believes that such transparency will help promote greater accountability 
and respect for human rights.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 4.  Disconnecting users from Internet access, including on the basis of intellectual 
property rights law 
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>While blocking and filtering measures deny users access to specific content on 
the Internet, States have also taken measures to cut off access to the Internet entirely. 
The Special Rapporteur considers cutting off users from Internet access, regardless of 
the justification provided, including on the grounds of violating intellectual property 
rights law, to be disproportionate and thus a violation of article 19, paragraph 3, of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.   
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>The Special Rapporteur calls upon all States to ensure that Internet access is 
maintained at all times, including during times of political unrest. In particular, the 
Special Rapporteur urges States to repeal or amend existing intellectual copyright 
laws which permit users to be disconnected from Internet access, and to refrain from 
adopting such laws.  
</b></p>
<p><b> 5.  Cyber-attacks  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned that websites of human rights 
organizations, critical bloggers, and other individuals or organizations that 
disseminate information that is embarrassing to the State or the powerful have 
increasingly become targets of cyber-attacks.  
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>When a cyber-attack can be attributed to the State, it clearly constitutes, inter 
alia, a violation of its obligation to respect the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. Although determining the origin of cyber-attacks and the identity of the 
perpetrator is often technically difficult, it should be noted that States have an 
obligation to protect individuals against interference by third parties that undermines 
the enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. This positive 
obligation to protect entails that States must take appropriate and effective measures 
to investigate actions taken by third parties, hold the persons responsible to account, 
and adopt measures to prevent such recurrence in the future. </b></p>


<p><b> 6.  Inadequate protection of the right to privacy and data protection  
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, while users can enjoy relative 
anonymity on the Internet, States and private actors have access to technology to 
monitor and collect information about individuals&#8217; communications and activities on 
the Internet. Such practices can constitute a violation of Internet users&#8217; right to 
privacy, and undermine people&#8217;s confidence and security on the Internet, thus 
impeding the free flow of information and ideas online.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The Special Rapporteur underscores the obligation of States to adopt effective 
privacy and data protection laws in accordance with article 17 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Human Rights Committee&#8217;s general 
comment No. 16. This includes laws that clearly guarantee the right of all individuals 
to ascertain in an intelligible form whether, and if so what, personal data is stored in 
automatic data files, and for what purposes, and which public authorities or private 
individuals or bodies control or may control their files. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>He also calls upon States to ensure that individuals can express themselves 
anonymously online and to refrain from adopting real-name registration systems. 
Under certain exceptional situations where States may limit the right to privacy for 
the purposes of administration of criminal justice or prevention of crime, the Special 
Rapporteur underscores that such measures must be in compliance with the 
international human rights framework, with adequate safeguards against abuse. This 
includes ensuring that any measure to limit the right to privacy is taken on the basis of 
a specific decision by a State authority expressly empowered by law to do so, and must 
respect the principles of necessity and proportionality.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Access to the Internet and the necessary infrastructure  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>Given that the Internet has become an indispensable tool for realizing a range 
of human rights, combating inequality, and accelerating development and human 
progress, ensuring universal access to the Internet should be a priority for all States. 
Each State should thus develop a concrete and effective policy, in consultation with 
individuals from all sections of society, including the private sector and relevant 
Government ministries, to make the Internet widely available, accessible and 
affordable to all segments of population.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>At the international level, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his call on States, 
in particular developed States, to honour their commitment, expressed inter alia in the 
Millennium Development Goals, to facilitate technology transfer to developing States, 
and to integrate effective programmes to facilitate universal Internet access in their 
development and assistance policies.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>Where the infrastructure for Internet access is present, the Special Rapporteur 
encourages States to support initiatives to ensure that online information can be 
accessed in a meaningful way by all sectors of the population, including persons with 
disabilities and persons belonging to linguistic minorities.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>States should include Internet literacy skills in school curricula, and support 
similar learning modules outside of schools. In addition to basic skills training, 
modules should clarify the benefits of accessing information online, and of responsibly 
contributing information. Training can also help individuals learn how to protect 
themselves against harmful content, and explain the potential consequences of 
revealing private information on the Internet.
