<p><b>I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b>1. I visited the Central African Republic from 31 January to 7 February 2008.  I met with key 
officials including the President, the Prime Minister, the minister reporting to the Minister for 
Defence, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, the Director of the Office Central pour la 
r&#233;pression du banditisme, and other officials, including judges, magistrates, prosecutors, 
gendarmes and police officers.  In addition to Bangui, I traveled to Bossangoa and Paoua. In all 
three cities, I received detailed briefings from a wide range of civil society representatives, 
victims, witnesses and the families of people who had been killed.  
 
2. I am grateful to the Government for the full cooperation it extended to me.  I am also 
grateful to United Nations Peacebeilding Support Office in the Central African Republic 
(BONUCA) and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Ambassador Fran&#231;ois Fall, 
for having facilitated my mission. I received helpful briefings from the United Nations country 
team, the diplomatic community and others.  
 
3. Up until very recently, Government forces were burning entire villages to the ground and 
summarily executing large numbers of people. Today, these abuses have fallen dramatically.  
While President Boziz&#233; has shown that he has the power to prevent the military from committing 
human rights abuses, however, it is still too early to conclude that the Government has 
definitively turned a new page. The key finding of my mission is that, to ensure that the near 
future does not reprise the nightmare of the recent past, the Government must extend and 
institutionalize its efforts to respect human rights and to eliminate impunity.  
 
</p>
<p><b>II.  Typology of killings 
 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Killings by the military  
</b> 
4. The purpose of my visit was to inquire into extrajudicial executions of all kinds, including 
but not limited to the widely reported and often very detailed allegations of such killings by 
government security forces in the north-west and north-east of the country. In one such report, 
Human Rights Watch documented 119 extrajudicial executions, mostly in the north-west.<b>1</b> of 
those, 51 have occurred since late 2005 and been attributed to the Presidential Guard unit based 
in Bossangoa.  
 
5. The number of extrajudicial executions carried out by the armed forces in the north has 
fallen dramatically since the summer of 2007. This assessment is based upon witness interviews, 
documented cases and the estimates of informed interlocutors. This is not to say that all 
executions have ceased. However, despite continuing problems, which I shall detail in my final 
report, there has been a genuine, significant and encouraging improvement in the situation with 
respect to extrajudicial executions.  
 
6. What accounts for this dramatic decrease in extrajudicial executions related to the armed 
conflicts in the north? First, most of the fighting has ceased. In the north-east, the ceasefire 
                                                 
<b>1</b> Human Rights Watch, &#8220;State of anarchy: rebellion and abuses against civilians&#8221; (September 
2007). </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.5 
   page 3 
</p>
<p> 
provided for in the Birao accord has largely held even as the Government has failed to fulfil its 
other obligations. In the north-west, a de facto ceasefire prevails in many areas, with 
Government and forces of the Popular Army for the Restoration of the Republic and Democracy 
(APRD) generally avoiding movement into each other&#8217;s areas of control. Second, President 
Fran&#231;ois Boziz&#233; has taken significant steps to end abuses by his troops. After visiting the north-
west in person and witnessing the villages that his troops had burned to the ground, he ordered 
that such scorched-earth tactics must end. He told both his regular troops and the Republican 
Guard that attacks on civilians would not be tolerated, and withdrew the Republican Guard from 
the north-west after reports of brutality. While the Republican Guard has resumed periodic 
operations in the north-west, past levels of human rights abuse have not returned.  
 
<b>B. Other killings  
</b> 
7. While there has been a dramatic decline in executions related to armed conflicts in the 
north, individual soldiers have not been prosecuted. It is not unsurprising, then, that this 
impunity has allowed soldiers to continue to use lethal violence for a range of personal and 
corrupt ends. I received a range of reports of killings by members of the Republican Guard and 
the Central African Armed Forces (FACA) that appear to have been committed in the context of 
efforts to extort or steal, to avenge a personal grievance or to carry out &#8216;private justice&#8217;. The 
problem of security officials of various kinds extorting money from the public at legal and illegal 
checkpoints and elsewhere has reached major proportions. The consequences are grave. People&#8217;s 
free movement is obstructed, commerce is undermined and the Government is deeply resented. 
The confrontations inevitably produce a significant risk of executions.  
 
8. I received credible reports from civil society, officials and detainees that torture and 
extrajudicial executions occur on a regular basis while suspects are in police custody or detention 
facilities. I have received a range of detailed accounts of prison guards, gendarmes and soldiers 
beating or torturing inmates to death. In other cases, detention facility officials fail to intervene 
to prevent inmates from killing each other. Too often those who are able to afford a bribe are 
released while others are killed. When there is a death in custody, it is simply reported that the 
prisoner died of an illness. Only in exceptional cases does a genuine investigation follow.  
 
9. There is a particular problem with the killing of those accused of witchcraft (&#8216;sorcery&#8217; or 
&#8216;charlatanism&#8217;). In some instances, Government forces have accepted payment to carry out such 
killings. In other instances, the criminal justice system &#8212; police, gendarmes and prosecutors &#8212; 
has failed to respond to cases in which private citizens have killed persons purported to have 
practiced witchcraft.  
 
</p>
<p><b>III. The way forward:  change of perspective and approach 
</b> 
</p>
<p>10. I met with various officials who are clearly trying very hard to put an end to abuses and to 
ensure that the limited infrastructure that exists is effective in at least some cases. Their hands 
need to be strengthened. This requires several initial steps.  
<b> 
 
 
 </b></p>

<b>A. Developing a human rights consciousness  
</b> 
11. When confronted with allegations of serious human rights violations, many interlocutors 
have responded by suggesting that the Central African Republic is too poor, too beset by 
rebellions from within and external aggression from without, and generally facing too many 
social and economic challenges to be held to human rights standards. In response, I must 
emphasize that the relevant standards are African as much as international. The Central African 
Republic has ratified both United Nations and African Union treaties, as well as the universally 
accepted Geneva Conventions. In terms of results, the fight against the rebels is greatly 
undermined when the military alienates the population by committing atrocities. Furthermore, it 
is a misunderstanding of human rights law to think that it poses an obstacle to providing security 
to the people. Indeed, human rights law requires Governments to protect individuals from 
murderers and other criminals just as it prohibits Governments from allowing their own forces to 
kill unlawfully. The right to life must be both respected and protected, and the two obligations 
are not incompatible. The Governments that drafted the relevant treaties faced a range of 
economic, social and security challenges, yet they recognized that these fundamental rights could 
and must be fulfilled by all Governments claiming legitimacy.  
 
<b>B. Official acknowledgement of killings  
</b> 
12. While the President has taken some important steps and even issued a limited apology, the 
Government as a whole has generally been in denial about killings by security forces. In my 
discussions with them, official after official has acknowledged only that mistakes occasionally 
happen but has categorically rejected the well-documented allegations contained in a series of 
damning human rights reports covering the period from 2005 through the first half of 2007. I 
repeatedly pressed officials to respond to the allegations in particular terms; none were willing to 
do so. This leaves both the people of the Central African Republic and the international 
community with the sense that, while there has been a lull in hostilities, human rights policies 
have not changed fundamentally. To dispel this impression the Government should publicly 
acknowledge the State&#8217;s responsibility for past abuses.  
 
<b>C. Ending impunity  
</b> 
13. The Government must also begin to prosecute those who bear individual criminal 
responsibility for killings. At present, soldiers know that if they kill someone, they will almost 
certainly not be prosecuted. While there is a permanent military tribunal, it has dealt with a very 
limited number of cases and, as far as I have been informed, with none of the most prominent 
cases of extrajudicial executions.  
 
14. To take one notable example, although there are literally scores of credible allegations of 
killings by Lieutenant Eug&#232;ne Nga&#239;koss&#233; or those under his command, he continues to command 
troops and to lead Republican Guard operations throughout the north-west. The populations of 
entire towns evacuate to the bush upon news of his impending arrival, and they do so with good 
reason.

<p> 
<b>IV. Broader reform challenges: building institutions to protect human rights</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 
A. Security sector reform  
</b> 
15. It is also crucial to meaningfully reform the security sector &#8212; including FACA, the 
Republican Guard, the Gendarmarie and the Police &#8212; and regain the trust of the population. 
None of the rebel movements has a separatist or even revolutionary agenda. Most of their 
members are principally interested in development opportunities, in greater representation in 
Government and in defending their communities against the bandits (<i>coupeurs de route)</i>, who 
routinely kidnap and ransom travellers and herders, destroying the possibilities of commerce and 
causing people to live in constant fear. Indeed, a key demand of rebel groups has been that the 
Government provide real security to the communities from which their members are drawn. 
While they rightly distrust the current armed forces, they desperately want the presence of 
disciplined and accountable security forces. What is needed is real security sector reform that is 
not only purely technical but that also reflects the concerns and interests that can only be 
discovered and clarified in the course of meaningful political dialogue.  
<b> 
B. Economic reform  
 
</b>16. Some Government officials with whom I spoke suggested that the country simply lacks the 
resources to put in place security forces that protect and respect the human rights of the people. 
Indeed, in 2007, the Central African Republic ranked 171 out of 177 countries on the human 
development index. In fact, one of the key underlying problems, in terms of both the 
Government&#8217;s inability to protect and promote human rights and its failure to provide the 
essential security and social sector support to the population, is the chronic lack of resources. 
This can be only remedied through a mix of internal and external measures. Internally, there is a 
need for fiscal reforms and, particularly, for measures to track revenues and expenditures in the 
natural resources sector. In the past, the diamond industry generated significant revenue for the 
nation. In order to return to that situation, the Government must follow through on its 
commitment to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative and to undertake an 
audit of the mining sector (with World Bank support). A total of 17 other African countries, 
including Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Equatorial Guinea, 
Gabon, and Guinea, and have committed to pursue the Initiative. The advantage is that 
investment, both domestic and foreign, will be easier to attract, a positive signal will be sent to 
international financial and development assistance agencies, and the amount of money available 
for development and security sector reform will be significantly increased. The problem of 
corruption needs to be discussed openly. Journalists who address public concerns must not be 
punished for doing so.  
<b> 
C. Human rights monitoring  
</b> 
17. The lack of reliable and systematic information in the public domain about human rights 
violations makes it difficult for the Government itself to know exactly what is going on. In 
addition, international agencies and sources of development assistance are deterred from 
expanding their support for the Government by their inability to verify that the human rights 
situation is being improved in a systematic and deliberate manner. It is especially unfortunate </p>

<p>A/HRC/8/3/Add.5 
page 6 
 
that, as a result of the absence of public monitoring, even the improvements of the past six 
months have not been widely documented.  
 
18. BONUCA has a vital role to play, and the current Special Representative of the Secretary-
General is clearly a very positive force in the country. Nevertheless, the human rights office of 
BONUCA is widely considered to have been ineffectual. In the Central African Republic, there 
is an urgent need for the United Nations to take steps to establish a more effective human rights 
monitoring and assistance presence. In my view, this can only be achieved if the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights establishes an office in the country.  
 
19. It is also essential that a national human rights commission be established. Existing 
arrangements are unsatisfactory, in large part because they lack the necessary independence from 
other organs of Government. They are also radically under-resourced and unable to carry out 
almost any human rights functions effectively.  
 
</p>
<p><b>V. Interim recommendations 
</b> 
20. <b>The general instructions given by the President to the security forces to end 
extrajudicial executions and other abuses against the civilian population should be 
specifically reflected in internal regulations, orders, training and other practices so as to 
prevent abuses from recurring in the future.  
 
</b>21. <b>Soldiers should be instructed that they must obey international human rights and 
humanitarian law and that they have the obligation to disobey manifestly illegal orders and 
that they will be prosecuted otherwise. Commanders should be instructed that they are 
criminally responsible when they know or have reason to know that their subordinates are 
going to commit crimes and do not take all reasonable and necessary measures to prevent 
and punish those crimes.  
 
</b>22. <b>The Government should effectively investigate the range of serious allegations of 
human rights abuse that have been made regarding the conduct of its security forces and 
provide a detailed public response, acknowledging abuses and identifying errors.  
 
</b>23. <b>All members of the security forces implicated in human rights and humanitarian law 
violations must be suspended from duty, investigated and prosecuted.  
 
</b>24. <b>The Government should begin the effort to end impunity by investigating and 
prosecuting Lieutenant Eug&#232;ne Nga&#239;koss&#233; for his individual actions as well as for the 
actions of subordinates for which he has command responsibility.  
 
</b>25. <b>Donors should continue to provide assistance to increase the effectiveness of the 
security sector. It should be accompanied, however, by efforts to provide human rights 
training, ensure effective monitoring, promote respect for human rights and respond to 
violations. Security sector reform also needs to be premised on a system of democratic 
accountability and regularized command and control.

<p> 
26. <b>In the context of national dialogue and in consultation with communities in the north-
east and the north-west, the Government must develop arrangements to deploy security 
forces that have the trust of the people and that will effectively protect them from bandits, 
cross-border raids and other threats to their lives and livelihoods.  
 
</b>27. <b>The current arrangement for international human rights monitoring and assistance is 
unsatisfactory. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights 
should open an office in the Central African Republic.  
 
</b>28. <b>The Government should establish a national human rights commission that is 
independent and that that fully complies with all relevant international standards, 
including the Principles relating to the Status of National Institutions for the Promotion 
and Protection of Human Rights (the Paris Principles). Such a commission should also be a 
priority for development assistance agencies.  
 
</b>29. <b>The Penal Code should be amended to abolish the criminalization of witchcraft. 
Educational efforts should be made to ensure that those accused of witchcraft are not 
victimized or killed.  
 
</b>30. <b>Local civil society organizations need to be strengthened. They play an indispensable 
role but are severely under-resourced and lack necessary technical expertise and facilities.
