<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> Human Rights Council resolution 8/4 of 18 June 2008 and recalling all 
other Council resolutions on the right to education, the most recent of which is resolution 
20/7 of 5 July 2012, and the resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on 
the subject,  
 <i>Reaffirming also</i> the human right of everyone to education, which is enshrined in, 
inter alia, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and other relevant international 
instruments, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> General Assembly resolution 67/18 of 28 November 2012 on 
education for democracy, 
</p>
<p> <i>Deeply concerned</i> that, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and 
Cultural Organization, progress towards many of the Education for All goals set for 2015 is 
slowing down, and that most of these goals are unlikely to be met, although progress in 
some of the world&#8217;s poorest countries shows what can be achieved with the commitment of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>

</p>

<p>national Governments and aid donors, including greater numbers of children attending pre-
school, completing primary school and making the transition to secondary education,  
</p>
<p> <i>Mindful</i> of the role that the full realization of the right to education for all plays in 
helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, noting in this regard the 
commitments relating to education contained in the outcome document of the High-level 
Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, 
including to ensure quality education and progression through the school system, and the 
need to ensure that the right to education is central in the context of the post-2015 agenda,  
</p>
<p> <i>Aware </i>of the role that communications procedures can play to promote the 
justiciability of the right to education, and welcoming in this regard the entry into force of 
the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights on 5 May 2013,  
</p>

quality of education and fostering global citizenship;

enforceability of the right to education and available mechanisms to enforce this right at the 
national, regional and international levels;  
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Encouraging the development and use of appropriate indicators on the right 
to education;
