<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to resolution 23/18 of 13 June 2013, in which the 
Human Rights Council requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to submit to the Council at its twenty-fifth session a report evaluating the needs for 
technical assistance and capacity-building in the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p>2. On 27 September 2013, the Human Rights Council adopted resolution 24/34, in 
which it decided to appoint an independent expert to monitor the situation of human rights 
in the Central African Republic and make recommendations concerning technical 
assistance and capacity-building in the field of human rights. 
</p>
<p>3. At its seventeenth session, the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review 
reviewed the Central African Republic (25 October 2013) and, at its 17th meeting, held on 
31 October 2013, adopted its report on the Central African Republic (A/HRC/25/11). Of the 
178 recommendations made to the Central African Republic, 93 received the support of the 
transitional authorities, 81 were considered to have already been implemented or to be in 
the process of implementation, 3 need to be considered by the Central African Republic, 
which will provide responses to them no later than the twenty-fifth session of the Human 
Rights Council in March 2014 (e.g., the recommendation requesting ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), 
and only 1 recommendation (concerning the establishment of a functioning judicial system 
based on an independent police force and judiciary) was rejected by the Central African 
Republic. 
</p>
<p>4. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
has been involved since 2000 in activities to promote and protect human rights in the 
Central African Republic within the framework of the United Nations Peacebuilding 
Support Office in the Central African Republic (BONUCA) and, since 2010, in the 
activities carried out by the Human Rights and Justice Section of the United Nations 
Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA). 
</p><p>5. OHCHR wishes to thank the Minister of Justice, who is responsible for judicial 
reform, the Minister for Human Rights and Coordination of Humanitarian Action and civil 
society representatives for their contribution to the report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p>6. In her previous report of September 2013 to the Human Rights Council 
(A/HRC/24/59 and Corr.1), which covered the events that had occurred between December 
2012 and 11 July 2013, the High Commissioner concluded that, during the conflict that had 
taken place between 10 December 2012 and 23 March 2013, violations of international 
humanitarian law and international human rights law had been committed by Government 
forces under the regime of former President Boziz&#233; and the S&#233;l&#233;ka armed group. The High 
Commissioner also pointed out that, since 24 March 2013, when the S&#233;l&#233;ka came to power, 
its members had continued to commit serious human rights violations, thereby engaging the 
responsibility of the State. 
</p>
<p>7. The dissolution of the S&#233;l&#233;ka by Decree No. 13.334 of 12 September 2013 did not 
prevent the emergence of armed self-defence groups, the anti-balaka militias,1 who sought

<p><b>4</b> GE.14-11122 
</p>
<p>to respond to the violence committed by those who may now be referred to as the former 
S&#233;l&#233;ka. In its resolution 23/18, the Human Rights Council had expressed concern about the 
risk of intercommunity and interreligious confrontations. These fears proved to be justified, 
as the anti-balaka responded to the abuses committed by the former S&#233;l&#233;ka against the non-
Muslim civilian population by carrying out attacks not only on the ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka but also on the 
Muslim civilian population. 
</p>
<p>8. The September 2013 attacks by the anti-balaka against the former S&#233;l&#233;ka and the 
Muslim communities living in villages in Ouham prefecture2 marked the beginning of an 
armed conflict between the anti-balaka and the former S&#233;l&#233;ka that plunged the country into 
a cycle of intercommunity violence. 
</p>
<p>9. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, anti-balaka militias attacked the 
Muslim neighbourhood of Z&#233;r&#233; village, 25 kilometres from Bossangoa in Ouham 
prefecture, killing 56 people of the Muslim faith and burning down the houses in the 
Muslim neighbourhood and the mosque.3 According to this report, other Muslim 
communities (including Bodora and Ouham-Bac) were also attacked by anti-balaka 
militias. 
</p>
<p>10. In the following days, ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka reportedly engaged in reprisals and, according to 
the Human Rights and Justice Section BINUCA, which conducted a mission to Bossangoa 
from 19 to 21 September 2013, ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka killed 61 people between 8 and 20 September in 
and around Bossangoa. Between the end of September and the beginning of October, it is 
reported that ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka also carried out reprisals in localities around the town of 
Bossangoa. In the Wikamo area, on 10 October 2013, for example, they killed four people, 
including a 12-year-old child, and burned down the whole village. 
</p>
<p>11. This cycle of violence, consisting of armed clashes between ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka and anti-
balaka, on the one hand, and reprisals against the Muslim and Christian civilian 
populations, on the other, hit the Nana-Mamb&#233;r&#233;, Ombella-M&#8217;Poko, Ouham and Ouham-
Pend&#233; prefectures before reaching the capital.  
</p>
<p>12. On 5 December 2013, at about 4 a.m., anti-balaka militias attacked Bangui. For a 
short period they managed to take control of Camp Kasai, held by ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka, but were 
eventually repelled. The attackers then scattered throughout the city. This led to a wave of 
killings by both ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka and anti-balaka. The latter are reported to have gone from house 
to house killing Muslims, and ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka allegedly took reprisals against Christian civilians. 
By 6 December 2013, the attacks had left 300 people dead and4 several hundred people 
injured5 and had resulted in the displacement of 52,000 people in Bangui.6 
</p><p>13. Following the adoption of Security Council resolution 2127 (2013) on 5 December 
2013, which authorized French forces in the Central African Republic to take the necessary 
measures to support the African-led International Support Mission in the Central African

<p>Republic (MISCA), France deployed additional military personnel as part of Operation 
Sangaris. That increased the number of French troops in the Central African Republic from 
600 to 1,600 by 8 December 2013.7 Since 9 December 2013, military personnel taking part 
in the Mission for the Consolidation of Peace in the Central African Republic (MICOPAX)8 
and Operation Sangaris have patrolled the capital in order to prevent unauthorized troops 
from moving around with weapons. Since that date, the former S&#233;l&#233;ka have restricted their 
movements in the city and some semblance of calm has been restored. However, the abuses 
have continued: on 10 December 2013, 35 injured were admitted to Bangui Community 
Hospital, and two mosques in the Fouh and Combattant districts were destroyed, bringing 
the number of mosques destroyed since 5 December 2013 to four. 
</p>
<p>14. Renewed clashes occurred in Bangui on 19 and 20 December 2013. Bangui 
Community Hospital admitted 54 injured on 20 December 2013 and 60 deaths were 
registered between 20 and 22 December. All this violence has taken a heavy toll: according 
to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), by 30 December 2013, 
the number of deaths had reached 728 in Bangui alone and the number of displaced persons 
had reached 370,000 in the capital and 785,000 nationwide.9 
</p>
<p>15. In the face of the abuses committed against the civilian population and the 
seriousness of the humanitarian situation, the evaluation of the needs for technical 
assistance and capacity-building presents a challenge, as the need to provide protection and 
assistance to the civilian population should be considered a priority by the national 
authorities and the international community. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Major challenges for the protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Permanent lack of security 
</b></p>
<p>16. The lack of security has resulted from several factors: the structural weakness of the 
national security forces, the emergency and proliferation of armed groups, the problem of 
highway robbery, the formation of self-defence groups and the free movement of small 
arms and light weapon. 
</p>
<p>17. The national security forces have not been well served by the practice of recruiting 
along ethnic lines, as a means of bolstering the ruling powers. Under the regime of former 
President Kolingba, his own ethnic group, the Yakoma, though a minority group in the 
country, had a dominant position in the Central African Armed Forces and was prominent 
in the Presidential Guard. 
</p>
<p>18. Under the regime of former President Patass&#233;, the Sara-Kaba ethnic group to which 
he belonged replaced the Yakoma in the Presidential Guard, and the Yakoma were 
transferred to the Central African Armed Forces. The influence of the Yakoma in the 
Armed Forces declined thereafter as troops were cut by 25 per cent and the north-south 
balance between soldiers was restored.

</p>
<p>19. These recruitment practices did not help the Central African Armed Forces to 
coalesce into a single unit, and they were reorganized several times. They were also 
weakened by the internal divisions between Patass&#233; and Boziz&#233; supporters, after Boziz&#233; 
was sacked as Chief of Staff under Patass&#233; in 2001. 
</p>
<p>20. On coming to power, former President Boziz&#233; too tried to control the security forces, 
though to a lesser extent, by favouring members of his own ethnic group, the Gbaya, within 
the Presidential Guard. 
</p>
<p>21. The army, gendarmerie and national police had similar problems, with, for example, 
an ageing and inadequate workforce and a lack of logistical resources and infrastructure.10 
Their ability to respond to insecurity was also limited by the fact that they were deployed 
mainly in the capital.11 
</p>
<p>22. Taking advantage of the climate of impunity that prevailed under the successive 
regimes, the security forces committed many serious human rights violations, which were 
reported by the United Nations human rights protection mechanisms12 and international 
NGOs. 
</p>
<p>23. The ineffectiveness of the security forces has been a factor in the persistence of 
domestic threats such as national and foreign armed groups and highwaymen. It has also 
encouraged the formation of self-defence groups. 
</p>
<p>24. The attempt by Boziz&#233; supporters to overthrow the Patass&#233; regime on 25 October 
2002 sparked a rebellion and was followed by several clashes between the Patass&#233; and 
Boziz&#233; forces, until Boziz&#233; seized power on 15 March 2003. 
</p>
<p>25. After Boziz&#233;&#8217;s election as President of the Republic in 2005, various rebel 
movements sprang up. The Arm&#233;e Populaire pour la Restauration de la R&#233;publique et de la 
D&#233;mocratie (APRD), made up of members of Patass&#233;&#8217;s old Presidential Guard and village 
self-defence committees, established itself in the north-west, former President Patass&#233;&#8217;s 
region, and in the northern central area. In Ouham prefecture (northern-central region), a 
military figure close to former President Patass&#233;, Abdoulaye Miskine, formed the Front 
D&#233;mocratique du Peuple Centrafricain (FDPC). 
</p><p>26. In September 2006, a rebel movement, the Union des Forces D&#233;mocratiques pour le 
Rassemblement (UFDR), emerged in the north-east (Vakaga and Haute-Kotto prefectures); 
this was formed from three groups, the Mouvement des Lib&#233;rateurs Centrafricains pour la 
Justice, (MLCJ)13 the Groupe d&#8217;Action Patriotique de Lib&#233;ration de la Centrafrique 
(GAPLC) and the Front D&#233;mocratique Centrafricain (FDC). In 2008 another rebel 
movement, the Convention des Patriotes pour la Justice et la Paix (CPJP), established itself 
in the north-east of the country (Bamingui-Bangoran prefecture). 
27. The former S&#233;l&#233;ka, which took power in March 2013, is a diverse coalition of armed 
groups whose members are apparently predominantly Muslim. It comprises various armed 
groups such as UFDR and CPJP, less well-known ones such as the Union des Forces

<p>R&#233;publicaines (UFR) and the Alliance pour la Refondation (A2R), and also the Convention 
Patriotique du Salut du Kodro (CPSK), formed in June 2012 by General Moussa Dhaffane, 
a former commander in CPJP, which he left because of a major political disagreement. 
</p><p>28. The former S&#233;l&#233;ka committed many unlawful acts during their offensive in 
December 2012 and after seizing power in March 2013, including pillaging and killings, 
targeting members of the security forces of the former regime and administration officials 
perceived to be supporters of the Boziz&#233; regime.14 
</p>
<p>29. According to some Central Africans, the unlawful acts committed by the former 
S&#233;l&#233;ka on seizing power went far beyond anything seen before in that country. By attacking 
Christian communities and sparing Muslims, they helped to destroy the relations between 
the two communities. 
</p>
<p>30. According to some sources, the first incursions of the Lord&#8217;s Resistance Army 
(LRA) in the north-east of the Central African Republic were observed in 200615 and it has 
been in the south-east of the country since 2008.16 In his 2011 report on his mission to the 
Central African Republic, the Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights 
of internally displaced persons deplored the fact that the international community had not 
paid adequate attention to LRA atrocities (A/HRC/16/43/Add.4, para. 80). In 2012, the 
LRA committed many abuses against the civilian population, including abductions (see 
S/2012/374, para. 13), and continues to pose a threat to national security. 
</p><p>31. The problem of highway robbers, also known as zaraguinas, apparently dates back 
to the 1980s but became more acute in the mid-1990s. They seem to operate more or less 
everywhere in the Central African Republic. Zaraguinas have committed numerous 
criminal acts against the civilian population, from attacking travellers and cattle farmers, to 
pillaging (S/2001/660, para. 20) and kidnapping for ransom. They are apparently well 
armed and operate in groups of various kinds: part-time bandits (members of the security 
forces using their service weapons for criminal purposes), cattle farmers, and former 
foreign mercenaries who helped President Boziz&#233; to seize power in 2003.17 
</p>
<p>32. The formation of self-defence groups, or village militias, can be explained by the 
need to fill the security vacuum resulting from the security forces&#8217; failure to do anything 
about the threat from highway robbers, particularly in the north-west of the country. 
However, action by these groups has not always been a matter of defending themselves 
from bandits. Self-defence groups, or village committees, have sometimes sided with a 
rebel movement &#8212; APRD, for example &#8212; and sometimes with the army. In 2008, the 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, in his report on the situation in the Central 
African Republic, noted that, in Ouham-Pend&#233; prefecture, some self-defence groups had 
supported government forces against rebel movements (see S/2008/733, para. 17). The self-
defence groups did nothing when the former S&#233;l&#233;ka took power and it was in reaction to the 
abuses by ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka that they resurfaced. 
</p>
<p>33. An important factor in the prevailing insecurity in the Central African Republic is 
the circulation of small arms and light weapons. The number of weapons available to the 
security forces (mainly the Central African Armed Forces, the gendarmerie, the police and

to some sources, when the former S&#233;l&#233;ka arrived in Bangui in March 2013, weapons were 
stolen from military camps and other weapons handed out by the Boziz&#233; regime.

<p>34. Over the past 20 years, the Central African Republic has experienced a number of 
mutinies, rebellions and coups d&#8217;&#233;tat, along with gross violations of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law. Despite these serious and recurring human 
rights violations, few of the suspected perpetrators have been prosecuted. The enactment of 
several amnesty laws, such as those of 30 May 1996, 15 March 1997 and 13 October 2008, 
has strengthened this de facto impunity. 
</p>
<p>35. In the 2009 universal periodic review, it was noted that impunity was also a feature 
of the measures adopted by the Government, which were not commensurate with the 
seriousness of the acts. To transfer members of the armed forces from one region to 
another, for example, or impose purely administrative or disciplinary sanctions on the 
perpetrators of human rights violations, does not reflect a genuine desire to combat 
impunity (see A/HRC/WG.6/5/CAF/2, para. 35). 
</p><p>36. However, it should be noted that proceedings have occasionally been taken against 
perpetrators, as happened in 2009, when 250 cases of human rights violations were brought 
before the courts, resulting in 80 convictions (A/HRC/14/24/Add.5, para. 45). 
37. A mixed commission of inquiry was established by Decree No. 13-100 of 20 May 
2013 to investigate crimes, offences and other human rights violations, and also crimes 
against property, committed since 2004. While this measure represents a positive step, a 
number of reservations should be made with regard to this initiative. 
</p>
<p>38. The mixed commission of inquiry lacks the necessary resources to carry out its 
mandate. It still does not have its own office but is based at the Court of Cassation, and it 
has no premises outside the capital. According to Human Rights Watch, the mixed 
commission of inquiry has no vehicles or logistical means of conducting investigations.20 
Moreover, its independence is not guaranteed, as under article 9 of the Decree it is required 
to submit the original version of its report to the President of the Republic. 
</p>
<p>39. The issue of past human rights violations has still not been settled, though it has 
been addressed on various occasions in attempts at national reconciliation. The National 
Dialogue, held from 9 September to 27 October 2003, recommended that one of the six 
commissions of the National Dialogue Preparatory Committee &#8212; the commission on truth 
and reconciliation &#8212; should carry on working after the end of the Dialogue. However, this 
recommendation was not acted upon and, given that Security Council resolution 2127 
(2013) requests the Secretary-General to establish an international commission of inquiry, it

<p>is important that transitional justice mechanisms be put in place to address not only the 
numerous human rights violations committed in the past, but also the root causes of the 
coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and mutinies, that form the backdrop to these violations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Non-functioning judicial and prison systems  
</b>40. The seizure of power by the former S&#233;l&#233;ka was followed by many abuses which, 
among other things, affected the functioning of the judicial system. In Bambari (Ouaka 
prefecture), for instance, the local leader of the former S&#233;l&#233;ka moved into the residence of 
the president of the court of appeal. The climate of insecurity resulting from the actions of 
the former S&#233;l&#233;ka forced judges to leave their jurisdiction in the provinces and take refuge 
in Bangui. In November 2013, many of these judges were still in the capital. However, the 
security finally failed in Bangui too and, on 16 November 2013, judge Modeste Martineau 
Bria, Director-General of Judicial Services, and his assistant were killed by persons 
unknown. 
</p>
<p>41. Systematic and widespread looting and the destruction of property by the former 
S&#233;l&#233;ka have not spared the judicial and prison systems. The inventory of judicial and prison 
system infrastructure and equipment drawn up in August 2013 by the Ministry of Justice is 
particularly instructive. Courts, prisons, detention facilities and staff accommodation have 
been looted and ransacked. According to the Prison Administration Directorate, out of 38 
prisons, 4 were still functioning in Bangui, Bimbo, Berb&#233;rati and Bouar. During the anti-
balaka attack on the former S&#233;l&#233;ka in Bangui on 5 December 2013, the Ngaraba prison was 
looted and ransacked and the prisoners released. 
</p>
<p>42. In the emergency relief and sustainable development programme for 2013&#8211;2015 that 
it prepared in July 2013, the Government estimated that 150 million CFA francs (CFAF) 
would be needed to restore and equip courts, tribunals and gendarmerie stations in 2013, 
and CFAF 400 million in 2014 to build prisons. Tax revenues, which are already low, will 
not cover these needs. 
</p>
<p>43. In these circumstances, the aims of making justice accessible to all, restoring the 
credibility of the judicial system and ensuring the application of the law to prevent &#8220;mob 
justice&#8221;, among others, will once again be unattainable without funding from the donor 
community. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Interreligious tension and violence 
</b></p>
<p>44. Many Central Africans consider the present climate of tension between Muslims and 
Christians to be unprecedented. None of the many coups d&#8217;&#233;tat and rebellions that have 
marked the history of the Central African Republic since independence were motivated by 
religion. 
</p>
<p>45. A religious dimension has been grafted onto an existing political conflict because of 
the numerous abuses by the former S&#233;l&#233;ka against the mainly Christian civilian population. 
They have attacked non-Muslim communities and similarly discriminated against places of 
worship, looting churches but sparing mosques. 
</p>
<p>46. Moreover, the presence within the former S&#233;l&#233;ka of combatants from Chad and the 
Sudan has persuaded some Central Africans that the conflict is between Christians and 
Muslims. The actions of ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka have provoked a reaction from the anti-balaka who, as 
well as attacking ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka, have also targeted Muslim civilians, attacking the people of 
Bossangoa, in September 2013. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.14-11122 
</p>
<p>47. This is now no longer just a conflict between the former S&#233;l&#233;ka and the anti-balaka: 
every Muslim and every Christian has become a target because they are supposedly linked 
to one of the armed groups. 
</p>
<p>48. The longer the abuses by the former S&#233;l&#233;ka and the reprisals by the anti-balaka &#8212; 
and vice versa &#8212; go on, the wider the divide between the religious communities becomes. 
</p>
<p>49. In December 2012, an interfaith platform21 was established in response to an attempt 
by former President Boziz&#233; to incite Christians to use violence against the Muslims by 
raising the spectre of the Islamization of the country.22 It still provides a framework for 
dialogue, allowing action to be taken to stem the tide of interreligious violence.23 
</p>
<p>50. The Community of Sant&#8217;Egidio has become involved, organizing the signing on 9 
September 2013 of the Rome Appeal for the Central African Republic &#8211; an appeal for peace 
and national reconciliation that was signed by representatives of civil society, the 
Transitional National Council,24 the Government and religious groups. The signing of this 
document was followed by the signing of the eight-point Republican Pact.25 
</p>
<p><b> E. Discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin, &#8220;race&#8221; or nationality 
</b></p>
<p>51. Little information is available on this subject. The Central African Republic has not 
submitted a report to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination since 1985 
and the 2003 National Dialogue did not address the issue. Yet ethnic background has 
played a key role in the administration of power. Under the regime of General Kolingba, for 
example, members of his ethnic community, the Yakoma, made up 70 per cent of army 
personnel even though they represented only 5 per cent of the population and, according to 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, they also dominated the 
machinery of public administration (A/48/18, para. 148). 
</p><p>52. Alongside such ethnic favouritism, de facto discrimination, while perhaps not 
intentional, has led to exclusion. Indeed, the dearth of government services in some parts of 
the country, especially in the north-east, where the population is mostly Muslim, has led to 
profound inequalities in terms of access to resources and services, constituting a major 
obstacle to the full enjoyment of many rights. The discrimination suffered by the 
inhabitants of that region is the basis of one of the demands of the UFDR, which includes 
many members of the Goula minority.

<p> 23 For instance, a visit was made to Bossangoa and Z&#233;r&#233;, in September 2013, to meet members of the 
communities affected by the violence, anti-balaka and ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka, and to spread a message of peace. 
</p>
<p> 24 The Transitional National Council was established pursuant to Act No. 13.001 of 18 July 2013 on the 
Transitional Constitutional Charter. It has legislative powers and among other things, is required to 
develop and adopt a draft Constitution which will be submitted to the people for referendum. 
</p>
<p> 25 The eight points are: (1) the disarmament of militias and the return to the normal activity of the State; 
(2) the return of displaced persons and refugees to their homes and help with reintegration; (3) the 
rejection of violence as a means of gaining power; (4) constructive dialogue between the political 
parties and the rejection of confrontation; (5) the strengthening of institutions during a two-year 
transition period to prepare the country and its structures for representative democracy, to ensure full 
freedom for all citizens; (6) the fight against corruption and the protection of public and private 
property; (7) action for the common good in favour of the people; (8) continuation of the work of the 
Community of Sant&#8217;Egidio to promote peace and dialogue in Central Africa. </p>


<p>GE.14-11122 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p><b> IV. Priority areas for technical assistance on human rights 
</b></p>
<p>53. The seizure of power in March 2013 by the former S&#233;l&#233;ka plunged the country into a 
period of great instability. The former S&#233;l&#233;ka constitute a loose, motley coalition that is 
therefore intrinsically fragile and liable to fall apart at any time. 
</p>
<p>54. The country is exhausted and divided. What little infrastructure there was outside 
Bangui has been destroyed by ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka and the State&#8217;s ability to maintain law and order, 
which was already limited, has been wiped out. The State has virtually ceased to exist in 
Bangui and the provinces; there is no rule of law. 
</p>
<p>55. Moreover, the abuses committed by ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka against the non-Muslim population 
have created a divide that, if it is not bridged, could inflame tensions and violence. 
</p>
<p>56. Given the critical security situation and the state of the institutions, it would seem 
reasonable initially to set limited and realistic goals with regard to technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>57. In that context, it is important to recall the recommendations made at the universal 
periodic review of the Central African Republic in October 2013, and those issued by the 
treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council special procedures. 
</p>
<p>58. To the extent that it is feasible, the following actions and initiatives should be 
implemented by the end of February 2015. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Re-establishing community ties 
</b></p>
<p>59. The rebuilding of ties and trust between the different communities is a matter of 
urgency. Although self-defence groups and former S&#233;l&#233;ka units have been demobilized and 
disarmed, the fear and resentment that have built up could still lead to acts of revenge. 
There is an urgent need to end the cycle of violence. To that end, peace initiatives and 
attempts to establish dialogue undertaken by key players, including Muslim and Christian 
clerics and the NGOs that support them, should be backed up with the necessary logistical, 
material and financial support. 
</p>
<p>60. A needs analysis should be conducted with those same key players in order to 
develop an awareness-raising programme to encourage communities to live together. A 
fund could also be set up to finance microprojects for reconstruction and planning aimed at 
encouraging members of a given community or neighbouring villages to work together 
again, especially in those areas where tensions have been greatest, such as Bouar and 
Bossangoa. There should be a special focus on projects proposed by women&#8217;s groups. 
</p><p>61. The Human Rights and Justice Section of BINUCA should consult representatives 
of religious communities in order to assess the chances of launching such initiatives and 
promoting a common comprehensive plan. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Helping to forge a strategy to combat impunity 
</b></p>
<p>62. At its universal periodic review in 2009, the Central African Republic freely 
undertook to combat the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of human rights violations, 
but this has remained a dead letter (A/HRC/12/2 para. 77). None of the recommendations, 
urging the Central African Republic to combat impunity, including those made by the 
United Nations, have been acted on. The creation of the Mixed Commission of Inquiry falls 
short of what is required to meet the country&#8217;s international obligations, given the 
seriousness and persistence of human rights violations. </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.14-11122 
</p>
<p>63. The declaration of intent made during the National Dialogue to shed light on events 
that have taken place in the Central African Republic since 1960 and to create a truth 
commission should form the basis for a broader debate on how to institute transitional 
justice. 
</p><p>64. Given that a process of national reconciliation is unthinkable unless it involves 
everyone, people must be informed, especially about what transitional justice actually is 
and how it might be put into practice. 
</p>
<p>65. Between now and the third quarter of 2014, a round table could be organized in 
Bangui in order to explain to participants what constitutes transitional justice, illustrating it 
with the relevant experience of other countries. This would provide an opportunity to make 
participants aware of the need to inform the public about transitional justice. 
</p><p>66. It would appear to be too early at this stage to make recommendations or 
contemplate the creation of transitional justice mechanisms, since the available options will 
emerge only after nationwide consultation. Moreover, the emergence of new leaders after 
elections due to take place in 2015 should enable debate on how to institute transitional 
justice, which would be a test of their willingness to tackle the problem of impunity and, 
more broadly, their commitment to human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Restoring the judiciary and prison system 
</b>67. As part of the process of re-establishing the rule of law, the judiciary and prison 
system must be restored. The challenges are considerable and donors will again be asked to 
contribute. In that regard, everything should be done to put in place a national consultation 
framework involving all stakeholders in the area of justice in the Central African Republic. 
Such a mechanism, which could be placed under the Ministry of Justice, would have the 
advantage of channelling funds to the areas of greatest need, in other words to the 
restoration of the courts and prisons. 
</p>
<p>68. Meanwhile, donors should fund the organization of as many mobile courts as 
possible in order to enable the justice system to continue to work. Given the degree of 
insecurity prevailing in the country, forcing judges to leave their jurisdictions, funding for 
mobile courts should contain a security component to cover the costs involved in moving 
and housing security forces to protect, among others, court staff. 
</p>
<p>69. Four ministers of justice have come and gone in the space of three years. Given that 
the Ministry of Justice must have stability if viable measures are to be developed and 
implemented, an expert could be assigned to work with it as a management and 
organization consultant. 
</p>
<p>70. In line with the mandate accorded to it under Security Council resolution 2121 
(2013), BINUCA should continue capacity-building in the justice system by organizing 
training sessions on human rights and the administration of justice. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Reforming the security forces with a human rights perspective 
</b></p>
<p>71. Reform of the security forces in a manner that takes human rights into account will 
require that a number of principles be upheld. Firstly, diversity is needed among personnel 
in order to forestall the kind of abuses that have taken place in the past, when the security 
forces served the interests of a particular ethnic group, and to increase the public&#8217;s trust in 
them. Recruitment should be open to all, regardless of ethnic, religious or social 
background. The authorities should also promote the recruitment of women, if need be by 
means of quotas. </p>


<p>GE.14-11122 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>72. Moreover, the security forces must be accountable. Internal regulations or 
disciplinary codes must therefore provide for a range of disciplinary sanctions, without 
prejudice to eventual criminal prosecution. Those codes must be made known to those to 
whom they apply. In addition, procedures for internal inquiries that safeguard the rights of 
those under investigation should be put in place. It would be worthwhile appointing an 
expert to review the current disciplinary procedures with a view to making 
recommendations on how they can be improved. 
</p>
<p>73. Security Council resolution 2127 (2013) states that respect for human rights should 
be a criterion for selecting personnel in the process of reconstituting the security forces of 
the Central African Republic. In order to implement that key point of the resolution, it is 
important to help the authorities to set up a vetting procedure when restructuring the 
security forces. The Human Rights and Justice Section, working with OHCHR, could 
consider recruiting an expert to assist the authorities in that matter. 
</p>
<p>74. The vetting procedure will make it possible, on the one hand, to ensure that those 
selected have the required degree of integrity to carry out their duties, which is a 
prerequisite for an institution which itself is expected to have integrity, and, on the other, to 
include transitional justice in the process of security sector reform by preventing 
perpetrators of human rights violations from serving in the security forces. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Demobilizing armed groups and militias, and decommissioning 
weapons 
</b></p>
<p>75. It will be impossible to guarantee security or curb the rate of human rights violations 
unless the armed groups are demobilized and the quantity of arms in circulation is 
drastically reduced. It is therefore incumbent on the authorities to launch a clear plan to 
demobilize and disarm armed groups and militias. 
</p>
<p>76. Bearing in mind that &#8220;conscripting or enlisting children under the age of 15 years 
into armed forces or groups or using them to participate actively in hostilities&#8221; constitutes a 
violation of article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which has 
been ratified by the Central African Republic, and with a view to implementing the 
recommendations made at the 2009 and 2013 universal periodic reviews, the authorities 
should carry out a programme for the demobilization and reintegration of children 
associated with the armed forces and armed groups, taking into account the rules set forth 
in the February 2007 Principles and Guidelines on Children Associated with Armed Forces 
or Armed Groups. 
</p>
<p>77. As far as the collection of small arms and light weapons is concerned, the authorities 
should apply paragraph 11 of Security Council resolution 2117 (2013) and launch an 
operation to decommission weapons in the possession both of ex-combatants and civilians. 
Donors, who will be aware of the positive human rights impact that such a programme 
could have, should do all in their power to see that it is carried out. They could help recruit 
an expert to report on the disarmament options, in particular those requiring funding for 
microprojects. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Strengthening the national system for the protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. State institutions for the protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p>78. The Ministry of Human Rights would benefit from technical assistance to set up a 
mechanism to follow up on recommendations made by United Nations human rights 
bodies. </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.14-11122 
</p>
<p>79. In order to help the Central African Republic prepare the reports it is required to 
submit under its international obligations, it would be useful to make provision for Ministry 
of Human Rights staff to attend training seminars on the subject. 
</p><p>80. During the universal periodic review in 2009, the Government, at the time under the 
Boziz&#233; regime, gave a unilateral undertaking to revive the National Human Rights 
Commission.26 By the time of the 2013 universal periodic review, the draft bill making the 
commission operative had still not been passed into law. OHCHR should approach the 
competent authorities again, through the BINUCA Human Rights and Justice Section, in 
order to rectify the situation. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Civil society stakeholders 
</b></p>
<p>81. Human rights NGOs require capacity-building on the technical front (i.e., 
investigations, submission of reports, lobbying and the protection of human rights) and the 
organizational front (i.e., NGO management, presentation of projects and fundraising). 
Civil society actors should also be trained to play a role in following up recommendations 
made at the universal periodic review and in the preparation of the national reports that the 
Central African Republic is required to submit in compliance with its international 
obligations. 
</p>
<p>82. Given that presidential and national elections are due to take place in February 2015, 
the Human Rights and Justice Section of BINUCA should, in the first instance, assist the 
National Human Rights Commission or, in its stead, the Ministry of Human Rights, to run a 
campaign to raise public awareness of people&#8217;s voting rights and encourage women and 
people from marginalized groups to vote. The Section could then help the Commission or 
the Ministry of Human Rights to recruit and train human rights monitors for the elections. 
These steps should be taken in the course of 2014. 
</p>
<p>83. Moreover, the Section should plan to train those members of the security forces who 
will be assigned to maintain security during the election process. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>84. <b>The Government is still unable to guarantee security and ensure access to 
justice in many parts of the country, and earlier progress was wiped out in the seizure 
of power by the former S&#233;l&#233;ka. Lack of security and impunity remain two major 
problems that should be dealt with as soon as possible in order to re-establish the rule 
of law. Moreover, the Central African Republic is now in the grip of sectarian violence 
whose long-term effects are difficult to predict. All actors and stakeholders must 
endeavour to find solutions to this crisis. In light of the foregoing, the High 
Commissioner recommends the following to the transitional authorities, the 
international community and BINUCA.
