the vagina of AS, an 8 year old girl, with his finger.

Majority of the assessors found accused guilty of the above count.

3.      
I direct myself in accordance with the law and the evidence which I discussed in my summing up to the assessors.

4.      
Considering the nature of the evidence before the court, I am convinced that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt.

Accordingly, I convict Vijay Kumar for Rape contrary to Section 207 (1) and (2) (b) and (3) of the Crimes Decree, No.44 of 2009.
