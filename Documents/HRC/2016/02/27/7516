<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its nineteenth session 
from 28 April to 9 May 2014. The review of Bhutan was held at the 6th meeting, on 30 
April 2014. The delegation of Bhutan was headed by Lyonpo Damcho Dorji, Minister for 
Home and Cultural Affairs. At its 10th meeting, held on 2 May 2014, the Working Group 
adopted the report on Bhutan. 
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Bhutan: Maldives, Peru and South Africa. 
</p><p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
Bhutan: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with

</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High

(A/HRC/WG.6/19/BTN/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/19/BTN/3). 
</p><p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
was transmitted to Bhutan through the troika. Those questions are available on the extranet

</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation of Bhutan reiterated the State&#8217;s unremitting commitment 
to further protecting and promoting the fundamental rights and freedoms of its people as 
enshrined in the Constitution. He added that many provisions of the Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights had been incorporated into the Constitution and that they had immensely 
influenced provisions relating to human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. An example of the independence of the judiciary was the country&#8217;s first 
constitutional case, brought by the opposition against the Government in August 2010, in 
which the Supreme Court had ruled that the Government had erred in revising certain tax 
rates without following due legislative process. 
</p>
<p>7. As had been recommended during the previous UPR of Bhutan, the State had made 
concerted efforts to achieve the adoption of the Domestic Violence Prevention Act, the 
Child Adoption Act and the Child Care and Protection Act. Those acts provided the 
necessary legal framework for the protection and promotion of women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s 
rights in accordance with the country&#8217;s national policies as well as its commitments under 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All 
Forms of Discrimination against Women, to which Bhutan was a party. The rules and 
regulations for the acts in question were being finalized. </p>


<p><b>4</b> <b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. Bhutan&#8217;s democratic process had been further consolidated under the reigning 
monarch with the successful holding of local government elections in 2011 and the second 
parliamentary elections in 2013. 
</p>
<p>9. In recognition of the importance of a strong and professional press, the Bhutan 
Media Foundation had been established by royal charter in 2010. The monthly &#8220;Meet the 
Press&#8221; events with the participation of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet ensured access to 
the Government at the highest level. 
</p>
<p>10. The National Commission for Women and Children, an autonomous agency, 
coordinated and monitored policies and activities related to the protection and promotion of 
the rights of women and children. 
</p>
<p>11. The Government of Bhutan continued to attach great importance to the social sectors 
and to its pro-poor policies. More than 20 per cent of the total budget of the eleventh Five-
Year Plan was allocated to education and health. 
</p>
<p>12. The Government was also ensuring that under the Five-Year Plan more emphasis 
was placed on gender issues and women&#8217;s empowerment in all policies and national plans. 
The Government had also pledged to explore the adoption of a quota system for women&#8217;s 
participation in the electoral process. 
</p>
<p>13. Bhutan was fully committed to ensuring gender equality in all aspects of electoral 
and other democratic participation. 
</p>
<p>14. Bhutan had benefited from constructive dialogue with expert bodies in the past, and 
in that spirit the Special Rapporteur on the right to education had been invited to visit 
Bhutan in May 2014. 
</p>
<p>15. In order to protect and promote the inherent dignity of all, and particularly the rights 
of persons with disabilities, Bhutan had signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities in 2010. 
</p>
<p>16. With regard to the recommendations received in the previous UPR of Bhutan on 
acceding to the core human rights instruments, Bhutan first needed to establish the 
necessary legal framework, social institutions and human and financial resources to assume 
the obligations associated with those treaties and to abide by them in letter and spirit. As its 
capacity became enhanced, Bhutan would consider acceding to additional international 
human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>17. The head of delegation elaborated on the numerous initiatives undertaken by the 
Government in addition to the recommendations received during the first UPR, such as the 
open-air prison system and the weekly &#8220;Meet the People&#8221; programme involving the Prime 
Minister, the Cabinet and the public. 
</p>
<p>18. Following up on the recommendation made during the first UPR of Bhutan in 2009 
that it share its concept of &#8220;gross national happiness&#8221;, Bhutan had initiated General 
Assembly resolution 65/309 entitled &#8220;Happiness: towards a holistic approach to 
development&#8221;, which had been adopted by consensus in 2011. Bhutan had hosted a very 
successful high-level meeting on well-being and happiness in New York in April 2012. A 
subsequent report on the subject had been submitted to the United Nations Secretary-
General in December 2013 as his country&#8217;s contribution to the post-2015 development 
agenda. 
</p>
<p>19. Bhutan faced numerous challenges, such as a high rate of youth unemployment, 
uneven poverty rates across districts and regions and the problem of destitute economic 
migrants entering Bhutan illegally through open borders. In addition, Bhutan had been 
subjected to terrorist acts. </p>


<p>20. Bhutan looked forward to an open and constructive dialogue. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review

instability. There were more than 130,000 non-Bhutanese workers in Bhutan &#8211; more than in
