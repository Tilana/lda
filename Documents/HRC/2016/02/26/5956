</p>
<p> <i>Underlining</i> the importance of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted 
</p>
<p>by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related 
</p>
<p>Intolerance, which constitutes a solid foundation for the elimination of all scourges and 
</p>
<p>manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that the successful implementation of the Programme of Action requires 
</p>
<p>political will and adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels and 
</p>
<p>international cooperation, </p>

<p>page 2 
 
<i> Acknowledging</i> the significant role played by the Durban Declaration and Programme of

</p>
<p>between them and of avoiding duplication and overlapping, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes and acknowledges</i> the importance and significance of the work of the 
</p>

</p>
<p>African descent in the judiciary and other areas of the justice system, without prejudice to the 
</p>
<p>principle of meritocracy, and calls upon States to identify factors that have resulted in the 
</p>
<p>disproportionate number of arrests, sentencing and incarceration of Africans and people of 
</p>
<p>African descent, particularly young men, and to take immediate and appropriate measures to 
</p>
<p>eliminate those factors and to adopt crime-prevention strategies and programmes that include 
</p>
<p>alternatives to incarceration; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes </i>the need to establish methods by which disaggregated information may 
</p>

</p>
<p>criminal justice system, political participation and representation, with regard to, inter alia, 
</p>
<p>Africans and people of African descent, and that such information provide the basis for the 
</p>
<p>creation and monitoring of policies and practices that address any discrimination found; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Also emphasizes </i>the importance of collecting disaggregated information and urges 
</p>
<p>the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide support to the

</p>
<p>inter alia, the following activities:
