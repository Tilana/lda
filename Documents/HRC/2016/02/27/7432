<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twentieth session from 
</p>
<p>27 October to 7 November 2014. The review of the Islamic Republic of Iran was held at the 
</p>
<p>9th meeting on 31 October 2014. The delegation of the Islamic Republic of Iran was 
</p>
<p>headed by Mohammad Javad Ardeshir Larijani, Secretary of the High Council for Human 
</p>
<p>Rights and advisor to the Chief of the Judiciary on International Affairs. At its 14th 
</p>
<p>meeting, held on 4 November 2014, the Working Group adopted the report on the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran.  
</p>
<p>2. On 15 January 2014, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the Islamic Republic of Iran: Argentina, 
</p>
<p>Romania and the Philippines. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of the 
</p>
<p>Islamic Republic of Iran: 
</p>
<p>(a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
</p>
<p>paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/20/IRN/1);  
</p>
<p>(b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/IRN/2); 
</p>
<p>(c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/20/IRN/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, 
</p>
<p>Finland, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Spain, 
</p>
<p>Sweden, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States 
</p>
<p>of America was transmitted to the Islamic Republic of Iran through the troika. These 
</p>
<p>questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The head of the delegation stated that the Islamic Republic of Iran highly 
</p>
<p>appreciated the UPR as a cooperative mechanism that considered human rights situations in 
</p>
<p>all United Nations Member States on an equal footing, avoiding selectivity. It was essential 
</p>
<p>to respect different values, traditions and cultures and to refrain from imposing specific 
</p>
<p>lifestyles on others. He reiterated his country&#8217;s solid commitment to the principles of 
</p>
<p>multicultural universality in the domain of human rights. 
</p>
<p>6. Several ministries, relevant commissions of the Islamic Consultative Assembly and the 
</p>
<p>judiciary had been actively involved in preparing the national report. Representatives of civil society 
</p>
<p>had also been thoroughly consulted, and their comments had received due consideration. 
</p>
<p>7. The Islamic Republic of Iran had worked constantly, since the first cycle of the UPR, to 
</p>
<p>further promote and protect human rights, inter alia, through cultural universalism. It had 
</p>
<p>promulgated major policies, adopted new laws and regulations and set up new mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>Human rights courses had been incorporated in public education programmes, and courses on </p>


<p>human rights themes had been organized for judges, judiciary staff, prison aid workers, the police 
</p>
<p>force, families and civil servants. 
</p>
<p>8. Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, 35 nationwide democratic elections had been held 
</p>
<p>with a view to involving nationals in governance, without any discrimination on grounds of 
</p>
<p>race, colour, sex, language or religion. Opportunities had been provided for the promotion of 
</p>
<p>NGOs, political parties and associations. 
</p>
<p>9. Economic, social and cultural rights had been promoted through the Global Health 
</p>
<p>Scheme, the Mother and Child Care Plan, the National Health and Medication Network, the 
</p>
<p>Family Doctors System and the National Immunity Programme. Almost 95 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>rural population had access to free educational services.  
</p>
<p>10. Measures to protect the rights of vulnerable groups included the development of the Family 
</p>
<p>Protection Law of 2013, the establishment of the Vice-Presidency Bureau for Women and Family 
</p>
<p>Affairs, the Women&#8217;s Employment Fund and the Women&#8217;s Entrepreneurship and Self- 
</p>
<p>Employment Grant Scheme. Women had also been provided with additional protection against 
</p>
<p>violence and abuse. 
</p>
<p>11. In the area of children&#8217;s rights, the head of the delegation highlighted the establishment of 
</p>
<p>the National Focal Point on the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), in 2012, the 
</p>
<p>development of the Child and Adolescent National Statute, the Law on the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Children Without Guardian and the Law on the Protection of the Rights of the Family, in 2014, 
</p>
<p>and the signing of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the 
</p>
<p>involvement of children in armed conflict (OP-CRC-AC), in 2011. 
</p>
<p>12. The judicial system was based on the principles of presumption of innocence, 
</p>
<p>prohibition of any form of torture, court transparency, impartiality of judges, legality, 
</p>
<p>compensation liability for faulty judgements, separation of political and press offences from 
</p>
<p>ordinary crimes, in the interests of due process, and prohibition of arbitrary arrests. The 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary was also secured through: constant and regulated supervision of 
</p>
<p>the courts and other organizations affiliated to the judiciary; further strengthening of the Legal 
</p>
<p>and Judicial Deputy Offices; establishment of the Deputy Office for the Prevention of Crime, the 
</p>
<p>Deputy Office for Cultural Affairs, to promote a culture of respect for the law, and the Deputy 
</p>
<p>Office for Information Technology and Communication, to ensure easy and rapid access to 
</p>
<p>judicial bodies and to promote e-justice; additional specialized training courses for judges; and 
</p>
<p>the establishment of free telephone-operated legal aid consultancy centres. The principle of due 
</p>
<p>process of law, irrespective of race, religion, gender, ethnicity and other attributes, had been 
</p>
<p>reiterated in the Constitution, the Code of Criminal Procedure and other laws. 
</p>
<p>13. The Islamic Republic of Iran continued to maintain that the appointment of a Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran constituted a political, selective and unjust 
</p>
<p>decision. Moreover, the imposition of sanctions and unilateral coercive measures impeded 
</p>
<p>citizens&#8217; full enjoyment of human rights and were incompatible with the letter and spirit of 
</p>
<p>human rights instruments. 
</p>
<p>14. The Islamic Republic of Iran renounced, as a victim of terrorism, all forms of violence, and 
</p>
<p>called for more concerted international efforts to combat all forms of terrorism and extremism. 
</p>
<p>The country cooperated closely with United Nations mechanisms and other States in the 
</p>
<p>international campaign against drugs. The war on drug-trafficking had claimed the lives of 
</p>
<p>nearly 4,000 Iranian border guards and members of the security forces over the past 
</p>
<p>34 years.  
</p>
<p>15. The Islamic Republic of Iran had provided sanctuary for more than 4 million 
</p>
<p>refugees from neighbouring countries. </p>

</p>
<p>stated that the Islamic Republic of Iran had issued permits to 230 political parties, 400 
</p>
<p>labour and professional associations, and 60 minority religious associations. The 
</p>
<p>organization of peaceful rallies and meetings was permissible under article 27 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution. On average, 300 gatherings and rallies were organized each year. Religious 
</p>
<p>minorities could apply for permits for the establishment of associations to serve a variety of </p>


<p>purposes. To date, 53 associations had obtained permits. A total of 17,000 permits had been 
</p>
<p>issued under administrative bylaws to NGOs working in a variety of areas.  
</p>
<p>58. President Rouhani had appointed a special assistant for ethnic and religious minority 
</p>
<p>affairs. In addition, 335 members of ethnic communities had been appointed as high-
</p>
<p>ranking State, provincial and local officials and as ministers, vice-ministers, deputy 
</p>
<p>ministers, governors general and local governors.  
</p>
<p>59. The Leader was chosen by the Council of Experts, while the members of the 
</p>
<p>Council, the President, and members of Parliament and of city and village councils were 
</p>
<p>chosen by direct popular vote. The average rate of participation in elections was 60 per 
</p>
<p>cent. Votes had been cast by 72.8 per cent of eligible voters in the June 2013 presidential 
</p>
<p>elections. All elections were conducted in accordance with article 25 of the International 
</p>
<p>Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). 
</p>
<p>60. Considerable progress in promotion of the press had been achieved since the 
</p>
<p>Government of Hassan Rouhani had assumed office. Article 4 of the Press Law stipulated 
</p>
<p>that no governmental or non-governmental authority had the right to exert pressure on the 
</p>
<p>press to publish material or articles or to otherwise exercise censorship and control over the 
</p>
<p>press. The Law guaranteed freedom of expression provided that the rights of the general 
</p>
<p>public were protected against insults, accusations and other infringements.  
</p>
<p>61. The Constitution provided for the participation of a jury in the proceedings of the 
</p>
<p>press and media courts. Article 10 of the Press Law entrusted supervision of the press, news 
</p>
<p>agencies and websites to a seven-member body whose composition was designed to prevent 
</p>
<p>the Government from exerting pressure on the press. About 6,100 publications were 
</p>
<p>currently registered and there were 400 news agencies and websites. About 30 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the publications were distributed at border regions, and some of them were printed in local 
</p>
<p>languages. 
</p>
<p>62. The 2013 Islamic Criminal Code incorporated many innovative ideas aimed at 
</p>
<p>guaranteeing the rights of all. Female officers had been trained in investigation and 
</p>
<p>interrogation. NGOs could be involved in hearings and attorneys were present at all stages 
</p>
<p>of the investigations and hearings. Judges were required to take full account of the 
</p>
<p>reasoning of female defence counsel. A Family Protection Law had been enacted.  
</p>
<p>63. No one in the Islamic Republic of Iran was arrested and detained on account of their 
</p>
<p>views and beliefs. Where persons were arrested, they were given a fair hearing in the 
</p>
<p>presence of defence counsel and the charges against them were quashed in many cases. 
</p>
<p>Statistics showed that rates of conviction were quite low, compared with many other 
</p>
<p>countries, and that the accused enjoyed better treatment.  
</p>
<p>64. Referring to religious minorities, the delegation stated that Iranians of all religious 
</p>
<p>and social minorities enjoyed the right to profess and practise their culture and religion and 
</p>
<p>to speak their language. Although religious minorities accounted for less than 0.2 per cent 
</p>
<p>of the population, they were represented by five members of Parliament, who held 
</p>
<p>guaranteed seats for minorities. Subsidies were allocated from the annual budget to 
</p>
<p>religious minority associations to promote their beliefs and traditions. 
</p>
<p>65. In accordance with article 13 of the Constitution, members of all minorities were 
</p>
<p>granted freedom to practise their creed and traditions, to receive education in their 
</p>
<p>language, to publish books and newspapers and to exercise other civil liberties.  
</p>
<p>66. The Constitution provided for equal opportunities for men and women in 
</p>
<p>employment and administration of the State&#8217;s governance. The Law on the Rights and 
</p>
<p>Responsibilities of Women and the Law on the Protection of the Family both provided for 
</p>
<p>the promotion and protection of women&#8217;s rights. Article 230 of the Fifth Economic </p>


<p>Development Plan called for the development of a Global Plan for the Promotion of Family 
</p>
<p>and Women Affairs.  
</p>
<p>67. Maternity leave for women had been increased to nine months. Forced marriage was 
</p>
<p>subject to imprisonment and such marriages were legally null and void. A bill on Protecting 
</p>
<p>the Security of Women against Violence had been submitted to Parliament; its aim was to 
</p>
<p>reduce sporadic violence against women. Women police and specialized consultants were 
</p>
<p>being trained for the same purpose. 
</p>
<p>68. There were currently nine women members of Parliament and a marked increase had 
</p>
<p>been recorded in the candidacy rate for women.  
</p>
<p>69. Chad condemned the economic sanctions imposed on the country, which required 
</p>
<p>assistance from the international community. 
</p>
<p>70. Chile was concerned by the lack of adequate protection and promotion for some 
</p>

</p>
<p>76. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea commended the achievements 
</p>
<p>regarding economic, social and cultural rights. 
</p>
<p>77. Denmark was concerned by reported threats and discrimination towards minorities, 
</p>
<p>particularly the Baha&#8217;i community. 
</p>
<p>78. Djibouti welcomed the fruitful exchanges between OHCHR and the Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of Iran. 
</p>
<p>79. The State of Palestine noted the measures to combat poverty, yet regretted poor 
</p>
<p>health insurance coverage. 
</p>
<p>80. Eritrea noted the ongoing challenges, including economic sanctions that impacted on 
</p>
<p>citizens&#8217; well-being and economic rights.

</p>
<p>protect children&#8217;s rights. </p>

<p>133. The head of the Iranian delegation said that the Islamic Republic of Iran would take 
</p>
<p>all recommendations seriously and would submit a written reply to States that had asked 
</p>
<p>specific questions.  
</p>
<p>134. With regard to the recent execution of Reyhaneh Jabbari, the head of delegation 
</p>
<p>stated that the accused had been indicted with first-degree murder entailing the death 
</p>
<p>penalty, after about seven years of legal proceedings at all levels, during which she had 
</p>
<p>been defended by counsel. Pursuant to the <i>qisas</i> system under Islamic criminal law, the 
</p>
<p>closest relatives of the victim determined whether the death penalty should be executed. 
</p>
<p>The judicial authorities had persistently attempted to persuade the victim&#8217;s son to forgive 
</p>
<p>the perpetrator, but he had refused, largely on account of the media propaganda, which had 
</p>
<p>accused his father of violent rape, while the claim by the defence has not been established 
</p>
<p>by the court.  
</p>
<p>135. With regard to homosexuality, he pointed out that homosexuality had been subject 
</p>
<p>to prosecution in most Western countries in the not too distant past.  
</p>
<p>136. Minorities, including Baha&#8217;is, enjoyed a full range of opportunities and privileges 
</p>
<p>under citizenship contracts. It was a paradoxical situation that certain States were perfectly 
</p>
<p>willing to deprive the whole nation of Iran of basic rights through unwarranted and 
</p>
<p>discriminatory sanctions, but were deeply concerned about the status of Baha&#8217;i citizens.  
</p>
<p>137. The head of delegation reiterated his objection to the imposition of specific lifestyles 
</p>
<p>under the banner of human rights. The UPR should be based on impartiality and respect for 
</p>
<p>multiculturalism. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Conclusions and/or recommendations</b>**<b>
