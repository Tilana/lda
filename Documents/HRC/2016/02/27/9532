<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> This report contains my findings as Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its 
causes and consequences following my official mission to the Netherlands (2-12 July 2006).  It 
focuses especially on three areas:  domestic/intimate-partner violence, violence in the context of 
prostitution, and the situation of immigrant, asylum-seeking and refugee women.  The last has 
gained particular visibility in recent years, in the context of the wider debates on immigration 
taking place in the Netherlands. 
</p>
<p> The Netherlands has become a multi-ethnic society with a considerable portion of 
immigrants of non-Western origin.  Although many of these persons have integrated into the 
middle class, the overall socio-economic position of the immigrants is substantially worse than 
that of the average native Dutch population as revealed by unemployment, poverty and welfare 
dependency levels.  These trends are highly gendered, with women of immigrant backgrounds 
suffering greater marginalization. 
</p>
<p> Gender equality within native Dutch society has advanced considerably over the last 
decade.  Many of the authorities assume that the remaining challenges concern only women 
belonging to immigrant communities.  This is not the case.  Native Dutch women are still 
underrepresented both in decision-making positions and in the labour market in general. 
</p>
<p> Women in the Netherlands face various types of gender-based violence.  While the 
Government is committed to combating the problem, it has identified it mainly as an integration 
problem to be addressed within a law and order framework.  Such an approach fails to recognize 
the gendered nature of the problem.  This not only hampers the overall effectiveness of the State 
response to violence against women, but it also results in a selective response whereby some 
forms of violence become normalized and others are perceived as a cultural problem. 
</p>
<p> The socio-economic disparities between the native Dutch and immigrant populations, 
coupled with culturally essentialized perceptions, have indirectly served to isolate women with a 
non-Western background.  Moreover, with the tightening of national immigration laws, certain 
groups of foreign women have been left in precarious situations, dependant on their male 
partners for residency permits and hesitant to approach the authorities when faced with violence. 
</p>
<p> On the basis of my findings, I make the following recommendations to the Government 
of the Netherlands:  improve the gender-equality policy and institutional frameworks; eliminate 
all forms of discrimination; investigate and punish perpetrators of violence against women and 
protect women at risk of violence; and expand the knowledge base on violence against women, 
its causes and consequences.<b> </b></p>

<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. At the invitation of the Government, I carried out an official fact-finding mission to the 
Netherlands<b>1</b> from 2-12 July 2006.  I was especially interested in focusing on three areas:  
domestic/intimate-partner violence, violence in the context of prostitution, and the situation of 
immigrant, asylum-seeking and refugee women.  In recent years, the last has gained particular 
visibility within the context of the wider debates on immigration taking place in the Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>2. During the course of my mission, I consulted with national and municipal authorities in 
The Hague, Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht and also visited a departure centre for rejected 
asylum-seekers.  In addition, I met with independent experts, women&#8217;s rights groups and 
migrants&#8217; organizations.  I would like to thank the Government and civil society actors for their 
excellent cooperation and support. 
</p>
<p>3. In order to put my observations into context, the report starts with a review of the 
country&#8217;s immigration experience and continues with an assessment of the gender-equality 
policy and practices in the Netherlands.  My specific findings on violence against women and the 
State response to such violence are presented with respect to the three areas mentioned above:  
intimate-partner violence, violence against immigrant, asylum-seeking or refugee women and 
violence in the context of prostitution.  The final section of the report contains my conclusions.  
It sets out a number of recommendations to the Government and the municipalities on how to 
better address violence against women, its causes and consequences. 
</p>
<p><b>II. A SOCIAL LANDSCAPE CHANGING TOWARDS INCREASED 
DIVERSITY 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Netherlands has become a multi-ethnic society:  1.7 million inhabitants (10 per cent 
of the total population) are first- and second-generation immigrants of non-Western origin.<b>2</b>  
Every third resident of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague (and more than half of all 
children younger than 14 years) has a non-Western ethnic background. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The recent history of immigration 
</b></p>
<p>5. The migratory flows resulting in the present ethnic composition of the population began 
in the 1940s and 1950s with migration from Indonesia (the former Dutch Indies).  In the 1960s, 
male labourers from Turkey, Morocco and Southern Europe were actively recruited to work as 
industrial workers and help rebuild the Dutch economy.  Originally recruited on a temporary 
basis as &#8220;guest workers&#8221;, many permanently settled in the Netherlands and were joined by their 
families.  Today, 364,000 persons of Turkish and 323,000 persons of Moroccan origin live in the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The report focuses only on the European territory of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  In official statistics the category of non-Western immigrants includes immigrants from Turkey, 
</p>
<p>Africa, Latin America and Asia with the exception of Indonesia and Japan. </p>

</p>
<p>Netherlands.  They are joined by immigrants from former Dutch colonies in Suriname (331,000) 
and the Dutch Antilles and Aruba (129,000).  The 1990s were characterized by a large inflow of 
asylum-seekers, especially from Iraq, Afghanistan, the former Yugoslavia and countries of the 
former Soviet Union.  Between 1995 and 2001, around 250,000 people applied for asylum in the 
Netherlands. 
</p>
<p>6. Although many individuals of non-Western background have managed to &#8220;integrate&#8221; into 
the middle class, the overall socio-economic position of immigrants, as revealed by 
unemployment, poverty and welfare dependency levels, is substantially worse than that of the 
average native population.  While this situation is closely associated with low education levels of 
the first- and second-generation immigrants - although they are gradually catching up in this 
field - the persistence of ethnic discrimination is also an important factor.  Illustrative is a 
2005 study, commissioned by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment, which found that 
a quarter of the small and medium-sized enterprises in the Netherlands preferred not to employ a 
person of non-native Dutch origin.<b>3</b>  According to the Monitor on Racial Discrimination, the 
majority of the population remains of the opinion that native Dutch and immigrants should have 
equal chances and rights.  The native Dutch population has, however, become more negative 
with regard to living together with immigrants, especially with the Muslim population. 
</p>
<p>7. There are also significant socio-economic differences between and within immigrant 
groups.  Turks and Moroccans, as well as certain smaller refugee communities, are lagging far 
behind other ethnic groups with regard to education, employment and income.<b>4</b>  The situation of 
women of Turkish and Moroccan origin with respect to these indicators is particularly 
worrisome.  A 2006 study comparing native Dutch women and women from the four main 
immigrant groups found that women of Turkish and Moroccan origin have the lowest education 
level, the lowest labour market participation rate, the lowest level of economic independence, the 
lowest rate of participation in leisure activities and the lowest rate of activity in community 
organizations of all five groups of women.<b>5</b>  First-generation immigrant women from Turkey and 
Morocco, who went to the Netherlands on the basis of a marriage with Dutch nationals or 
permanent residents, often have a particularly marginal integration status, not least due to 
language problems.

</p>
<p><b>B.  Shifts in the policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. Dutch society has long prided itself on a history of tolerance of ethnic and religious 
diversity.  After the Second World War, a seemingly successful paradigm of coexistence 
emerged.  Provided that they obeyed the laws and respected the way of life in the host country, 
newcomers were allowed to retain their group identity and live in accordance with their own 
cultural norms, side by side with the native population. 
</p>
<p>9. During the initial decades of labour migration, full integration was not expected, nor 
actively promoted.  Instead, there was a widespread assumption that the &#8220;guest workers&#8221; would 
one day return to their countries of origin.  It soon became clear that a large number of migrant 
workers, joined by their families, had already permanently settled in the Netherlands.  In the 
absence of an active integration policy the State concentrated on taking non-discriminatory 
measures to close socio-economic gaps between different immigrant groups.  Efforts to 
encourage active engagement between native Dutch and newcomers were less pronounced.  
Accordingly, &#8220;tolerance&#8221; of immigrants with a different ethnic and/or religious background 
never quite transformed into engagement and &#8220;acceptance&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>10. During the 2000s the debate on integration of immigrants has undergone a radical 
change.  The post-11 September environment, which created a general sense of mistrust of 
Muslims, due also to the participation of some seemingly integrated immigrants in Western 
countries in terrorist attacks, caused a large part of the Dutch population to question &#8220;tolerance&#8221; 
of diversity in the Netherlands.  Pim Fortuyn, a populist politician who also campaigned on an 
anti-immigrant and Islamophobic platform, emerged as a prominent figure in Dutch politics 
before he was murdered in May 2002.<b>6</b>  In the subsequent parliamentary elections, the List 
Pim Fortuyn emerged as the second strongest political party, winning 26 out of 150 seats. 
</p>
<p>11. One year later the lower house of parliament appointed a commission headed by 
Stef Blok to study the Netherlands&#8217; integration policies.  In its final report, the Blok Commission 
demanded that the State pursue a much more active integration policy that also places more 
demands on the immigrant population. 
</p>
<p>12. On 2 November 2004, Theo van Gogh, a film-maker who had made a controversial film 
on violence against women in Islamic societies, was murdered by a young Dutch Islamist 
extremist of Moroccan origin.  The murder galvanized public attention.  Subsequently, the 
Government reformed the immigration policy framework combining mandatory integration 
requirements to enhance social cohesion with new restrictions on immigration, especially for the 
purpose of family reunification.  The policy focus shifted from socio-economic to sociocultural 
integration of first- and second-generation immigrants. 
</p>
<p>13. Applicants for a residence permit on family reunification grounds from non-Western 
countries are now obliged to complete a civic integration examination which determines 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>6
</b>  On 6 May 2002, Fortuyn was murdered by a young, native Dutch man, who testified in court 
</p>
<p>that he committed the crime to stop Fortuyn and his politics. </p>

</p>
<p>fundamental knowledge of the Dutch language and Dutch society before they are allowed to 
enter the Netherlands.   The draft legislation, pending in parliament, would require immigrants 
from non-European Union countries, including immigrants who are already in the Netherlands, 
to take part in mandatory integration courses before they are granted permanent residence status. 
</p>
<p>14. The enhancement of the social participation of immigrant women, especially Muslim 
women, constitutes a central plank of the reoriented integration policy.  A number of measures 
and initiatives have been introduced which aim to protect these women from gender 
discrimination (including gender-based violence) and marginalization within their own 
communities and facilitate their integration into wider society. 
</p>
<p>15. While the objective is praiseworthy, its credibility even among immigrant women is 
undermined by two shortcomings.  Firstly, there is a tendency to conflate women&#8217;s emancipation 
measures with immigration restriction measures.  For example, a foreigner who marries a Dutch 
national or permanent resident is no longer entitled to join the spouse in the Netherlands as long 
as the incoming foreigner is younger than 21 years (even though the legal age of marriage is 
18 years).  This drastic and discriminatory limitation of the human right to marry and found a 
family,<b>7</b> apparently aims to prevent marriage migration by poor and less educated women who 
need more support to integrate into Dutch society.  Some officials also perceive the norm as an 
effective way to prevent forced marriages.  However, it is more likely that it would merely 
increase the age of victims of a forced marriage. 
</p>
<p>16. Secondly, the Government&#8217;s approach often does not sufficiently place discrimination 
against immigrant women in the wider context of gender discrimination experienced by women 
of all ethnicities.  A false dichotomy between emancipated native Dutch women and oppressed 
immigrant women is hereby fostered in the public perception.  Women and men of immigrant 
background are categorically stigmatized, either as victims or perpetrators, which only increases 
their marginalization and polarizes the society between &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;them&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. One manifestation of this trend is the increasing discrimination against Muslim women 
who wear a headscarf at the workplace and in other areas of public life, because the headscarf is 
increasingly viewed as a symbol of submission and unwillingness to integrate, without paying 
attention to the motivation of the individual woman wearing it.  In November 2006, the Cabinet 
adopted a proposal to prepare a bill regarding a general ban on wearing a burka or other 
garments covering the face in public space.  The Government referred to &#8220;considerations of 
public order, security and the protection of (fellow) citizens&#8221; (sic)<b>8</b> to justify the measure.  This 
proposal could foster the stigmatization and marginalization of Muslim women without 
providing any meaningful support to those women who may be facing extreme patriarchal 
oppression.

</p>
<p><b>III.  EMANCIPATION POLICY AND PRACTICE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Gender mainstreaming 
</b></p>
<p>18. Since 1974, the Netherlands has pursued an active emancipation policy.  The Multiyear 
Emancipation Policy Plan (2000-2010) established four interlinked objectives:  economic 
independence and labour-force participation of women; establishment of favourable conditions 
to combine paid work and family responsibilities; progress towards equal representation of 
women and men in decision-making positions; and respect for women&#8217;s rights, especially in the 
context of violence against women.  Recently, the Government added the enhancement of the 
social participation of women as a fifth objective that is specifically aimed at women from 
immigrant communities (see above).<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>19. Initially, the emancipation policy consisted of a two-track approach.  Firstly, a specific 
policy is to be pursued to promote change for women&#8217;s emancipation, place new issues on the 
political agenda and stimulate strategic alliances with social partners and non-governmental 
organizations.  Secondly, a gender perspective is to be integrated in all areas and at all levels of 
policymaking as part of gender mainstreaming. 
</p>
<p>20. In practice, the focus seems to have gradually shifted from the two-track approach to one 
of almost exclusive focus on gender mainstreaming.  At the same time, the structures to 
implement gender mainstreaming remain underdeveloped, a concern also expressed by the 
Government&#8217;s Auditing/Inspection Committee on Emancipation in its interim report.<b>10</b>  Entities 
embedding a gender perspective within each government agency, such as a Gender Steering 
Committee, do not exist.  Furthermore, a strong national machinery to monitor and coordinate 
the gender-related work done by different government agencies is also lacking.  The Minister of 
Social Affairs and Employment has the responsibility to coordinate emancipation policy and has 
an Equality Policy Coordination Department for this purpose.  However, even officials from that 
Department acknowledged that the Department does not have the resources to fully engage with 
and coordinate the gender-mainstreaming activities of the different departments.  Instead, the 
Department sees its role as that of a &#8220;stimulator&#8221; or &#8220;initiator&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>21. There is also a tendency to &#8220;downstream&#8221; gender mainstreaming.  Gender-sensitive 
policy issues are delegated to the municipal level without equipping the municipalities with the 
necessary know-how to incorporate a gender perspective.  Coherence with central government 
policy is not adequately monitored.  The decentralized Dutch prostitution policy, discussed 
below, is a case in point.

</p>
<p>22. While the competences of municipalities are expanded, the Government has limited the 
role of non-governmental organizations and expertise centres for gender equality and women&#8217;s 
human rights.  A number of institutions have seen their core funding cut.  Remaining budgets 
were often shifted into project-based support that is linked to the Government&#8217;s political 
priorities in the gender field.<b>11</b> 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The current situation 
</b></p>
<p>23. The weaknesses in the institutional framework for the promotion of gender equality may 
to some extent be a reflection of a widespread yet erroneous perception that the emancipation of 
native Dutch women has been successfully completed and is now self-sustainable.  Many of the 
authorities assume that remaining challenges concern only women belonging to immigrant 
communities.  This is not the case. 
</p>
<p>24. In the Netherlands, all women remain underrepresented in decision-making positions<b>12</b> 
and the labour force in general.  For example, women make up only 4 per cent of all members 
of boards of directors and other senior business managers.  The percentage of women among 
senior government officials is a mere 16.7 per cent in the salary scales 14-16 and just 11 per cent 
in the salary scales 17 and higher.  Only 9 per cent of all professors are women (compared to 
30-40 per cent of PhD students).  While the Netherlands has a relatively strong representation of 
women in the national parliament, the percentage of women in municipal councils stagnates at 
around 23 per cent.  In the provincial councils it is even declining. 
</p>
<p>25. Over the last years, the participation of women in the labour force has hardly advanced.  
Women&#8217;s net labour participation rate stood at 54.1 per cent in 2005 compared to 53.2 per cent 
in 2001.  The figures for men were 72.1 per cent in 2005 and 76.5 per cent in 2001.  Moreover, 
employed women often still hold low-paying jobs and are very likely to work flexible hours or 
part-time, especially after they have children.  Women now work fewer hours on the average 
than a decade ago.  Due to these factors, only 44 per cent of all women could be considered 
economically independent.  It is most unlikely that the Government will reach its self-proclaimed 
targets to increase the workforce participation rate of women to 65 per cent and the proportion of 
economically independent woman to 60 per cent by 2010. 
</p>
<p>26. Many of my interlocutors, including some government officials, suggested that the low 
representation of women in the labour force and among decision makers resulted from lifestyle 
preferences of individual women.  Structural obstacles such as the absence of a long, 
uninterrupted school day and insufficient numbers of public childcare places as well as the 
persistence of gender ideologies that prioritize women&#8217;s reproductive roles were often 
insufficiently acknowledged.

</p>
<p><b>IV. MANIFESTATIONS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
AND STATE RESPONSE 
</b></p>
<p>27. Women in the Netherlands face various types of gender-based violence.  While the 
Government is committed to combating the problem, in practice, it seems to have identified it 
mainly as an integration problem to be addressed within a law and order framework.  Such an 
approach fails to recognize the gendered nature of the problem.  This not only hampers the 
overall effectiveness of the State response to violence against women (VAW), but it also results 
in a selective response whereby some forms of violence become normalized and others are 
essentialized within a cultural explanation. 
</p>
<p>28. VAW, in order to avoid a fragmented and gender-neutralized perception, must be viewed 
as a continuum of acts emanating from unequal gender hierarchies that intersect with other 
hierarchical systems, creating multiple and diverse manifestations of violence.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Intimate-partner violence 
</b></p>
<p>29. Domestic violence committed by a current or former male intimate partner remains the 
most prevalent form of VAW in the Netherlands:  57,000 cases of domestic violence, domestic 
harassment and stalking in the domestic sphere were reported to the police in the course 
of 2005.<b>13</b>  Most domestic violence cases (41.1 per cent) concerned physical assault.  Women 
were the primary victims of the violence reported.  Three out of every four victims of all 
reported cases (76.1 per cent) are women.  In comparison, male victims are most likely to be 
found in age groups with inherent vulnerabilities:  boys, teenagers and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>30. The reported cases represented only the tip of the iceberg since most cases go unreported.  
No up-to-date national prevalence survey on intimate-partner violence is available,<b>14</b> but a 
1997 survey estimated that only about 12 per cent of all cases of domestic violence are 
reported.<b>15</b>  Applied to the 2005 police figures on reported domestic violence, this would mean 
that there are 325,000 cases annually in which women are subjected to violence, harassment or 
stalking in the domestic sphere.  In 133,000 of these cases, women would be subjected to 
physical violence. 
</p>
<p>31. It is also estimated that 100,000 children in the Netherlands witness domestic violence 
each year.  According to professionals, children witnessing violence between parents may suffer

<p>development.  Children who grow up in a violent environment are more likely to become victims 
of child abuse themselves and are also more likely to continue the cycle of domestic violence (as 
perpetrators or victims) when they grow up.<b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>32. According to the 2005 police figures, domestic violence is primarily committed by 
former or current intimate partners (71.2 per cent of all reported cases).  It is estimated that 
four out of every five perpetrators of domestic violence are men.<b>17</b> 
</p>
<p>33. The Government seems genuinely committed to addressing domestic violence, ending 
impunity and protecting victims.  In 2002, it launched an ongoing interdepartmental project 
against domestic violence, which is coordinated by the Ministry of Justice and involves a range 
of other stakeholders.  The project foresees the implementation of more than 50 concrete 
measures designed to improve the existing approach to preventing and curbing domestic 
violence.  An estimated &#8364;14 million will be spent on the project. 
</p><p>34. A number of positive measures have already been implemented.  In 2003, the Board of 
the Procurators General, which sets government policy on the investigation and prosecution of 
crimes, issued new guidelines on domestic violence to the law enforcement authorities that are 
based on a zero-tolerance approach.  The Government reports that the guidelines are already well 
implemented, but the National Police Commissioner responsible for the project on domestic 
violence has acknowledged continued problems.  According to her, 45 per cent of all criminal 
complaints related to domestic violence are eventually dropped.  Perpetrators are often not 
prosecuted because the police reports submitted to the prosecution are inadequate or there are 
problems in the documentation of evidence, including with regard to victims&#8217; testimonies.  The 
Government has pledged to extend a project of the police that aims to improve the quality of 
minutes of testimonies. 
</p>
<p>35. Data management has also been cited as a recurrent problem.  It is therefore a positive 
development that a single registration protocol for cases of domestic violence has been put in 
place.  Women&#8217;s groups have also expressed concern that too many cases do not result in a 
conviction because prosecutors overemphasize reconciliation between the partners and voluntary 
treatment programmes for offenders. 
</p>
<p>36. The Government has also taken steps to enhance the existing protective framework.  
Women who are Dutch nationals or legally reside in the Netherlands have the right to guaranteed 
admission to any of the country&#8217;s 100 women&#8217;s shelters regardless of whether they have reported 
their case to the police; 4,600 women use the protection of a shelter every year.  Also, the 
Government has set up a grant scheme to create 35 Advice and Support Centres on Domestic 
Violence that provide guidance to victims, perpetrators and others on how to escape or end 
domestic violence.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>16
</b>  The Government developed the Kindsporen (child trails) protocol on steps to be taken by law 
</p>
<p>enforcement and youth care institutions in case children witness domestic violence.

</p>
<p>37. These funds have also helped to support long-term protection measures.  The Amsterdam 
Violence Centre, for example, has implemented a safe accompanied return project for battered 
women, considering that about half of all battered women eventually return to their partners.  In 
several counselling sessions with the woman, her partner and the couple together, the return is 
prepared.  The Centre follows up on each case to ensure that violence does not recur. 
</p>
<p>38. Furthermore, legislation is pending in parliament which would authorize mayors to 
impose temporary restraining orders against persons who threaten their partners, children or 
others in the domicile with violence.  The restraining order can be extended to a maximum 
period of four weeks.  Since it is a preventive safety measure and not a criminal sanction, the 
restraining order is to be based on a future-oriented risk assessment.  Persons subject to a 
restraining order are not allowed to enter into contact with the person they have threatened and 
they are barred from entering the joint domicile.  The police are tasked with monitoring 
compliance with the restraining orders issued and the courts may sanction breaches with up to 
two years of imprisonment or a community service order. 
</p>
<p>39. Unfortunately, however, the effectiveness of these positive measures is undermined by 
serious flaws in the Government&#8217;s strategic framework to combat domestic violence, which is 
defined in a gender-neutral manner as &#8220;violence committed by a member of the domestic circle 
of the victim&#8221;.  While no distinction is made between different types or victim groups, policy 
documents stress that domestic violence is not confined to women and that boys and men are 
often also victims.<b>18</b> 
</p>
<p>40. This approach fails to acknowledge that the vast majority of domestic violence cases 
concern violence committed by men against their current or former female partners.  Such 
violence is treated within the same framework as violence against inherently vulnerable groups 
(children and the elderly) and the odd case of violence committed by an adult woman against her 
adult partner that may also occur.  The strategic framework thereby misses the specificity of 
violence of men against women, which is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations 
between men and women and constitutes one of the social mechanisms by which women are 
forced into a subordinate position.<b>19</b>  As a result, the Dutch domestic violence policy tends to 
focus on individualized interventions to support victims and treat or punish perpetrators, but 
largely neglects the root causes of violence suffered by women:  lack of socio-economic 
empowerment, the perpetuation of stereotypical gender roles, and the unequal gender power 
relations interlinked with both factors. 
</p>
<p>41. The justifications underlying the gender-neutral approach to domestic violence are less 
than convincing.  The then Minister of Justice emphasized in our discussions that everyone is

</p>
<p>equal before the law, which is why all forms of domestic violence ought to be treated alike.  Law 
enforcement agencies and judicial organs should indeed pursue all individual perpetrators of 
violence, whether they are men or women, with equal dedication.  Yet, this does not prevent the 
adoption of a policy framework, which, firstly, acknowledges the fact that three distinct 
categories (men&#8217;s violence against women, violence against children, violence against the 
elderly) constitute the vast majority of domestic violence cases and, secondly, takes a 
differentiated approach towards each category, bearing in mind its specificities. 
</p>
<p>42. Other interlocutors offered a more practical justification, explaining that a gender-neutral 
understanding of the problem would be more acceptable to the wider population.  If this is 
indeed true (hopefully not), the Government should urgently increase public awareness of the 
gender dimension of domestic violence rather than accommodate uninformed views that do not, 
or do not want to, acknowledge this basic fact.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Violence against immigrant, refugee and asylum-seeking women 
</b></p>
<p>43. It is widely assumed in the Dutch society that women with a foreign background face 
higher levels of violence than native Dutch women.  While it is reported that 60 per cent of all 
women seeking refuge in Dutch shelters are of foreign background,<b>20</b> a 2002 survey on domestic 
violence in the Surinamese, Antillean, Aruban, Moroccan and Turkish communities found that 
27 per cent of the women interviewed reported to have been the victim of domestic violence.<b>21</b>  
This figure is actually lower than the figures emerging from older surveys on domestic violence 
in the general population, leading the authors of the 2002 survey to believe that this resulted 
from underreporting. 
</p>
<p>44. Official police statistics generally do not record the ethnicity of perpetrators or victims.  
In a pilot initiative, two police regions have been asked to record the ethnicity of perpetrators and 
victims in reported domestic violence cases during the first half of 2006.  The results were not 
available at the time I finalized my report. 
</p>
<p>45. The uncertainties about the overall levels of violence noted, some categories of violence 
are prevalent in the Netherlands which primarily or exclusively affect women with a foreign 
background.  These acts of violence, which gained visibility over the last few years, particularly 
in association with the Turkish and the Moroccan immigrant communities, are referred to 
as &#8220;honour&#8221;-related violence (HRV).  This visibility led some to link HRV with Islam.  
Consequently, efforts to eliminate HRV have become intimately linked with the Government&#8217;s 
integration and immigration strategy.

</p>
<p>46. According to a working definition used by the Ministry of Justice, the term HRV denotes 
&#8220;any form of mental or physical violence committed in response to a (threatened) violation of the 
honour of a man or woman and therefore that of his and her family, of which the outside world is 
aware or may become aware of&#8221;.  This definition disregards both the gendered nature of HRV as 
well as its intersections with other systems of inequality.  No comprehensive, sex-disaggregated 
statistics on HRV have been compiled in the Netherlands.  Most of the known cases involve 
situations where the regulation of the conduct of young women or girls seems to have failed, 
which prompts the family to take severe action, including - in the most extreme cases - murder. 
</p>
<p>47. Although boys and men may also become targets,<b>22</b> HRV serves to ensure women&#8217;s 
conformity with group norms and sustain control over their sexuality, as honour is seen to reside 
in the bodies of women.  The family&#8217;s attempt to force a woman into a marriage or to cause her 
to end an unacceptable relationship is often a central theme leading to HRV.  Sometimes the 
mere perception of dishonourable behaviour within the community can lead to HRV. 
</p>
<p>48. Public attention has strongly focused on several murders that are said to be honour 
related.  At the same time, the continuum of related acts of violence has probably remained 
invisible, because HRV tends to be incremental.  It typically begins with emotional pressure, 
restriction of movement, systematic social isolation and veiled threats of violence before 
achieving its distinct form if the victim continues to be &#8220;defiant&#8221;.  The immense emotional 
pressure often exercised on victims can affect their mental health and even lead to suicide.  
Dutch law enforcement officials informed me about cases in which immigrant girls had been 
driven to suicide in order to cleanse a supposed stain on the family&#8217;s honour.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>49. Cases of HRV are characterized by various specificities.  They often involve a collective 
threat as several family members (sometimes including women) collude to subjugate the victim.  
A violent escalation can occur quite unexpectedly or take place long after the honour crisis was 
seemingly resolved.  The ability to reclaim honour through enforced compliance necessarily 
makes these acts demonstrative and dependent upon approval.  Due to these specificities, the 
protection framework established for conventional forms of intrafamily violence has proven to 
be inadequate. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  Men can become targets of HRV if they refuse to take part in the punishment of female family 
</p>
<p>members or for being an accomplice to the dishonourable act.  Experts in the Netherlands also 
tend to view homosexual or bisexual immigrant men suffering violence at the hands of 
homophobic family or community members through the prism of HRV.  Defining honour as a 
general trait of certain groups and considering all related acts of violence as HRV conceals its 
particularities as a form of VAW. 
<b>23
</b></p>
<p>  While some have claimed that the suicide rate among immigrant girls is three to four times 
higher than among their Dutch counterparts, the official suicide statistics for 1996-2004 do not 
support such claims:  see http://www.cbs.nl/en-gb/menu/themas/mens-maatschappij/ 
gezondheid-welzijn/publicaties/artikelen/2006-2042-wm.htm. </p>

</p>
<p>50. The Government, in recognition of the protection gap, has adopted a strategy on HRV 
that prioritizes the protection and safety of the victim, foresees more engagement with immigrant 
communities and aims to strengthen the capacity of the law enforcement bodies to investigate 
and prosecute perpetrators of HRV.  Several projects are already under way to operationalize this 
strategy.  The Haaglanden police region, for instance, has set up a Multiethnic Policing Unit, 
staffed with specialized personnel.  The Unit is charged with the investigation of crimes 
occurring within immigrant communities and, in practice, often also serves as a sort of national 
expertise centre on HRV. 
</p>
<p>51. Female genital mutilation (FGM) has become another priority concern for the 
Government.  According to Pharos, a national expertise centre on FGM, an estimated 
16,000-20,000 girls and young women with roots in countries where the practice is prevalent are 
considered to be at risk.  Due to the nature of the practice, it is difficult to ascertain how many 
FGMs are actually carried out in or organized from the Netherlands.  In 2005, a commission of 
the Dutch Council for Public Health and Health Care estimated that at least 50 girls living in the 
Netherlands are subjected to FGM annually.<b>24</b> 
52. The Government has adopted a zero-tolerance policy towards FGM.  It is considered to 
be a form of violence against women and children and a protocol has been introduced requiring 
health-care professionals to report detected cases to the Dutch Child Abuse Agency.  Even 
though there is no specific criminal provision on FGM, perpetrators can be prosecuted for assault 
or aggravated assault under the Criminal Code.  Dutch nationals can also be prosecuted if they 
perpetrate FGM in another country regardless of whether that country has criminalized the 
practice.  So far there have not been any prosecutions.  In addition to repressive measures, the 
Government and municipalities support a range of preventive measures that aim to reach out to 
immigrant communities in which FGM is assumed to be prevalent.  In six regions, the 
Government is funding a project to introduce and implement a protocol on preventing FGM. 
53. In Rotterdam, the municipality funds the AMBER-Programme which engages various 
communities of African origin through information events, personal visits, training for religious 
leaders and other activities. 
</p>
<p>54. Representatives of immigrant women&#8217;s organizations with whom I met during the 
mission emphasized violence-related concerns which were significantly different than those 
prioritized by the Government.  While immigrant women generally welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
commitment to tackle VAW within their communities, they often felt that the authorities 
selectively focused on special phenomena such as HRV or FGM, without adequately addressing 
immigrant status and the<b> </b>general vulnerabilities of immigrant women with respect to violence. 
</p>
<p>55. Increasingly restrictive immigration laws and regulations have produced a number of 
negative side effects that disproportionately affect immigrant women and thereby undercut the

</p>
<p>Government&#8217;s initiatives to further their emancipation.  In addition, the framing of various forms 
of violence experienced by immigrant women as a cultural problem complicates the individual 
and collective struggles of these women to counter VAW within their own communities.  
Immigrant women who have not yet attained permanent residence status are most affected. 
</p>
<p>56. According to Dutch immigration law, a foreign woman who comes to the Netherlands to 
join her spouse who is a Dutch national or permanent resident only receives a dependant 
residence permit, which lapses in case the couple divorces or otherwise separates.  She can apply 
for a temporary independent residence permit only after having lived for three years with her 
spouse.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>57. These rules apply to men as well, but they have particular, adverse consequences for 
women.  They create a long-term dependency relationship between the incoming wife and her 
husband, who controls the legality of her residence in the Netherlands and can choose whether to 
abuse this control or not. 
</p>
<p>58. The dependant residence permit system has trapped many immigrant women in the 
dilemma of either staying in abusive relationships or become undocumented immigrants once 
they leave the abuser.  Since 17 October 2003, Dutch law offers a legal way out of the dilemma; 
a woman escaping her husband&#8217;s violence can apply for a special independent residence 
permit.<b>26</b>  However, she will only receive the permit if:  (i) she formally reports her abusive 
partner to the police; or (ii) the perpetrator is being prosecuted and the victim also submits a 
medical report documenting violence.  Other evidence - for instance, reports from women&#8217;s 
shelters or medical reports on their own - does not provide the same entitlement.  In these cases it 
is entirely up to the immigration authorities whether or not to grant an independent residence 
permit. 
</p>
<p>59. These evidentiary requirements, which are meant to prevent fraudulent abuse of the 
domestic violence provision, undermine the norm&#8217;s utility because the vast majority of women 
do not dare, or do not want to, report their abusive partners to the police.  As highlighted above, 
only an estimated 12 per cent of all domestic violence victims in the Netherlands (whether 
immigrants or natives) report the crime to the police.  For women with dependant residence 
permits the stakes are even higher because they are risking the relationship on which their permit 
depends by denouncing their partner to the law enforcement authorities.  Immigrant women who 
find themselves in abusive relationships therefore often try to live through three years of abuse 
and only go to the police when the violence reaches unbearable levels. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>25
</b>  An exception applies if the spouse passes away during the three years or in cases involving 
</p>
<p>domestic violence (see below). 
<b>26
</b></p>
<p>  A total of 97 independent residence permits were issued on the basis of the domestic violence 
exception between July 2005 and November 2006. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/34/Add.4 
 page 17 
 
</p>
<p>60. Undocumented migrant women (including a substantial number of women whose 
dependant residence permit lapsed when they separated from their husbands) are in an even more 
vulnerable situation.  Because of their irregular administrative position, they are often afraid to 
report violence to the police.  This fear may not always be unfounded.  Civil society 
organizations have told me about cases in which undocumented immigrant women were 
themselves arrested when they reported violence to the police. 
</p>
<p>61. Furthermore, Dutch law largely excludes undocumented immigrant women from access 
to social welfare benefits.  This also means that undocumented immigrant women facing 
violence are not legally entitled to a shelter paid by the Government.  Many shelters therefore 
refuse to accept undocumented immigrant women with an unclear immigration status.  The 
Government has acknowledged the problem, but so far has only partially addressed it.  I was 
informed that special funds are now available to finance shelter space for those undocumented 
immigrant women who face &#8220;honour&#8221;-related violence, provided that the women formally apply 
for a residence permit. 
</p>
<p>62. The precarious situation of domestic migrant workers in the Netherlands, the vast 
majority of whom are women, is also noteworthy.  The demand for domestic migrant workers, 
who perform housekeeping chores or provide care services in private homes, has sharply 
increased over the last decades.  While domestic work is not legally recognized as a category for 
which work permits are issued to non-European Union nationals, women from Asia, 
Latin America, Africa and Eastern Europe are increasingly meeting this demand.  At best, a 
domestic migrant worker from outside the European Union can register as an au pair and obtain 
a one-year residence permit that falls short of a work permit.<b>27</b>  In practice, most domestic 
migrant workers do not hold any work permit and are recruited informally, which makes them 
vulnerable to unfair labour practices that can in extreme cases amount to exploitation.  Cases of 
verbal abuse, sexual and racist harassment and isolated instances of physical and sexual abuse 
against domestic migrant workers have also been reported. 
</p>
<p>63. Asylum-seeking women also have specific concerns that relate to gender-based violence.  
Asylum-seekers have to show a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of race, 
religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion to be 
recognized as a refugee under Dutch Law.  Gender-related persecution is not explicitly 
recognized as a ground for asylum.  However, under certain circumstances gender-based 
violence (e.g. sexual violence) can substantiate fear of persecution on one of the aforementioned 
grounds and give rise to a refugee claim. 
</p>
<p>64. In practice, it is often difficult for asylum-seeking women to gain refugee status if their 
persecution claim stems from a traumatic experience of gender-based violence.  Most asylum 
cases are disposed of under the Accelerated Procedure, which allows for a dismissal of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>27
</b>  Considered as a form of cultural exchange rather than work, the au pair status ties the permit 
</p>
<p>holder to one particular employer and limits her work to 30 hours per week. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.4 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p>manifestly unfounded claims within the first 48 hours of the process.  In order to maintain her 
claim, an asylum-seeking woman has to at least mention the persecution experience in the 
second interview upon arrival (the <i>nader gehoor</i>).  In the Accelerated Procedure this interview 
may take place very soon after arrival, when the asylum-seeker is often still very tired, confused, 
and lacks trust in the authorities. 
</p>
<p>65. Under these circumstances, women are often unable to relate experiences of rape or other 
traumatic incidents to the interviewer, which means that they will be precluded from basing a 
claim on these experiences at a later stage of the process.  An exception only applies if the 
woman can adduce sufficient evidence proving that she was medically unable (e.g. due to 
trauma) to relate her persecution experience.  According to legal experts this evidentiary burden 
is often very hard to meet.  The Government was not in a position to provide me with 
information on how many women successfully invoked this exception. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Violence in the context of prostitution 
</b></p>
<p>66. There are about 20,000 women in prostitution in the Netherlands (8,000 in Amsterdam 
alone).  An estimated two thirds of them are immigrant women from developing countries or 
Eastern Europe.  In addition, there are smaller numbers of men and transgender persons in 
prostitution.  
</p>
<p>67. VAW occurring in the context of prostitution remains a significant problem.  In 2004 
alone, 405 cases of trafficking in women were registered by the Dutch Foundation against 
Trafficking in Women, which organizes shelter and other support for victims.  The vast majority 
of detected trafficking cases relate to the sexual exploitation of women, although trafficking of 
women (and men) for the purpose of labour exploitation has also become increasingly more 
visible.  
</p>
<p>68. Minor girls are also among the victims of trafficking into sexual exploitation.  The 
National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, an independent monitoring institution established 
by the Government, has reported that some of these girls are trafficked into the Netherlands by 
being made to pose as unaccompanied underage asylum-seekers.<b>28</b>  There are also strong 
indications that pimps deliberately seek to recruit minor girls (and sometimes also boys) at 
asylum-seeker centres.<b>29</b>  In this context, it is a subject of grave concern that a number of minors 
disappear from asylum-seeker centres every year and their whereabouts cannot be traced.

<p>  One teacher working in such a centre informed me about a case of a 15-year-old 
asylum-seeker girl who was approached by a known pimp and only saved from exploitation due 
to the teacher&#8217;s intervention. </p>

<p> A/HRC/4/34/Add.4 
 page 19 
 
</p>
<p>69. Trafficking and sexual exploitation of women or girls within the Netherlands is also an 
issue of concern.<b>30</b>  In this context, the issue of so-called &#8220;lover boys&#8221; has attracted much 
attention.  The term, an unfortunate euphemism, refers to criminal pimps who deliberately seek 
out vulnerable girls and women and pose as their boyfriends before pushing them into 
prostitution through manipulation and/or violence.  The victims are typically minors when they 
are first forced into prostitution.  Using available victim data, the Rotterdam Health Authority 
has calculated that the victims&#8217; average age of recruitment is only 15.5 years.  It is estimated that 
&#8220;lover boys&#8221; are involved in almost half of all cases of youth prostitution.<b>31</b>  
</p>
<p>70. Women in prostitution also face a substantial risk of violence.  A survey among 
prostitutes conducted by the Intermediary Project for Prostitutes in Amsterdam indicated that 
more than one fifth of all respondents (22 per cent) had been subjected to assault in the course of 
their prostitution activities. 
</p>
<p>71. The Government pursues a model of legalized and regulated prostitution to curb VAW in 
prostitution and improve these women&#8217;s social situation in general.  Neither persons engaging in 
prostitution nor sex buyers are criminalized.  Since October 2000, the operation of brothels and 
the organization of prostitution, which had only been tolerated before, have been formally 
legalized.  The model enjoys widespread support among the general public.  Most Dutch 
women&#8217;s organizations are also in favour as they regard prostitution as sex work and want to see 
the issue destigmatized.  
</p>
<p>72. The Dutch approach to prostitution rests on three interlinked and interdependent tenets.  
First, a distinction is drawn between legalized prostitution involving consenting adults on the one 
hand and involuntary prostitution, prostitution of minors (regardless of their consent) and human 
trafficking on the other hand.  With regard to the latter issues the Government pursues a zero 
tolerance strategy.  Second, the Dutch municipalities have been mandated to regulate and 
monitor the sex sector on the basis of a licence system.  Third, the Government is committed to 
protecting and improving the social position of women in prostitution.  These issues are 
discussed in greater detail in the following paragraphs.

<p><b>30
</b>  It should be emphasized that sexual violence remains a general problem even outside the 
</p>
<p>context of prostitution, especially for younger women and girls.  A survey conducted in 2005 
found that 18 per cent of a sample of women and girls aged 12-25 years had experienced some 
form of sexual coercion (compared to 4 per cent of men in the same age range).  H. de Graaf, 
S. Meijer, J. Poelman and I. van Wesenbeeck.  2005.  <i>Seks onder je 25e.  Seksuele gezondheid 
van jongeren in Nederland anno 2005</i>.  Utrecht:  Rutgers Nisso Groep.  Among less-educated 
females this figure reached 21 per cent.  In this context, several interlocutors highlighted 
shortcomings in school sex education, which is often limited to a discussion of &#8220;easy&#8221; issues 
such as sexual skills, safer sex and contraception, but does not sufficiently reflect upon problem 
areas such as harmful sexual attitudes or abuse of power in interpersonal relationships.

</p>
<p>73. In implementing its zero-tolerance strategy, the Government has stepped up efforts to 
combat human trafficking.  In 2005, new legislation entered into force that criminalizes all forms 
of trafficking recognized under the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in 
Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention on 
Transnational Organized Crime.  The same year, an Expertise Centre on Human Trafficking and 
People Smuggling, to serve as a national focal point for the collection and analysis of 
information on trafficking, was set up.  Efforts are also being made to make investigations more 
victim-sensitive by requiring that police officers complete a special training programme before 
interviewing potentially traumatized victims of trafficking, forced labour or sexual exploitation.  
Law enforcement agents are also encouraged to pursue investigation strategies that make 
prosecutions less dependant on evidence based on the testimonies of victims, who are usually 
traumatized and frightened. 
</p>
<p>74. Improvements must still be made with regard to the protective framework available to 
victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation.  Women&#8217;s shelters are often hesitant to 
take in victims of trafficking, not least due to increased security risks.  I was told about cases in 
which women had to shuttle from shelter to shelter in order to avoid detection by the trafficking 
network they escaped from.  The authorities are also confronted with the dilemma of former 
victims who often return to &#8220;lover boys&#8221; due to a continued emotional dependency.  In these 
cases, courts can order the girls placed in an institution for their protection.  In practice, this 
often means that the girls are placed in penal institutions alongside girls with criminal 
convictions because there are not enough specialized institutions for exploited minors.  The 
Government plans to create by 2008 closed facilities for up to 400 young people who need care 
and treatment in a secure environment. 
</p>
<p>75. Victims of transnational trafficking often do not report to the police because they fear 
deportation followed by reprisals or public shame in their country of origin.  In response to this 
problem, the authorities have established a comprehensive set of human trafficking indicators.  If 
a possible trafficking case matches a certain number of indicators, the person in question is 
considered to be a prima facie victim and she is given a period of up to three months to recover 
and reflect on whether to cooperate with the law enforcement authorities.  If she cooperates, she 
will receive a temporary residence permit for the duration of the investigation and prosecution in 
accordance with section B-9 of the Aliens Act Implementation Guidelines.<b>32</b>  A permanent 
residence permit will be issued if:  (i) the trafficker is convicted; (ii) the criminal proceedings 
have not led to a conviction but, on the date of the judgement, the victim has been in possession 
of a temporary B-9 permit for at least three years; or (iii) the victim has a just fear of reprisal. 
76. If the victim chooses not to cooperate, she will be deported unless she proves that it 
would be unsafe for her to return to her country of origin.  The linkage between protection and 
cooperation has been criticized by experts and non-governmental organizations, since many 
victims have a well-founded fear of reprisals against themselves or their families, without being 
in a position to prove it.  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>32
</b>  In 2005, 65 B-9 permits were issued.  This figure increased to 116 for the period between 
</p>
<p>January and November 2006. </p>

</p>
<p>77. Concerning the role of the municipalities, they are responsible for licensing and 
regulating the sex industry within their boundaries, but are not allowed to outlaw prostitution 
altogether.  In the absence of a national law on prostitution, almost all municipalities adopted 
regulations that more or less follow a model General Municipal By-Law drawn up by the 
Association of Dutch Municipalities.  The municipalities can appoint officials to monitor the 
operation of brothels or street prostitution who have full access to sex establishments.  Officials 
can demand that women in prostitution identify themselves (allowing, for example, the 
identification of minors), but they are not permitted to permanently register data on women in 
prostitution. 
</p>
<p>78. Under the Promotion of Integrity Reviews by the Public Administration Act, the 
municipalities can ask a special administrative body to withdraw a sex establishment&#8217;s licence if 
there is serious risk that its operators are involved in other criminal activities.  
</p>
<p>79. Women in the legalized and regulated sex sector are now better protected against 
violence, exploitation or unsafe working conditions since access by health or law enforcement 
authorities is assured and the activities in the regulated sector are more visible to the authorities.  
The legalization of brothels has also given brothel operators the opportunity to break criminal 
ties and with practices they maintained while operating in a situation of tolerated illegality. 
</p>
<p>80. At the same time, however, the legalization legislation also appears to have unintended, 
negative side effects.  A grey sex sector continues to exist that escapes regulation.  So-called 
escort services, for example, are often not covered by municipal licensing schemes or it is 
unclear which municipality has jurisdiction over them, since they do not operate from a fixed 
address.  Some municipalities are also pursuing de facto abolitionist policies (contrary to 
national legislation), thereby pushing prostitution within their boundaries once again into an 
unregulated illegality.<b>33</b>   
</p>
<p>81. Many of the women in the grey sex sector come from countries outside the 
European Union, since they are generally not entitled to work permits under Dutch law and are 
therefore not engaged in the regulated sex sector.  This legislation is controversial among 
experts.  Some interlocutors argued that these women responded to an existing demand for 
&#8220;migratory sex work&#8221; and should therefore be provided with a work permit and the formal labour 
protection this entails.  Others feared that formal legalization could facilitate human trafficking 
from abroad, since the women were typically recruited in countries with no regulatory protective 
framework for prostitution.  
</p>
<p>82. Furthermore, a substantial number of women who would be legally entitled to engage in 
prostitution seem to have shifted into the unregulated sector to avoid taxation or municipal 
regulations they consider overly intrusive. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>33
</b>  In some cases, municipalities also seem to have closed sex venues for public order purposes.  
</p>
<p>In this context, women&#8217;s organizations have heavily criticized the closure of designated street 
prostitution zones.  See CEDAW shadow report, supra at note 10, at 89. </p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.4 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p>83. Due to the semi-illegality of the grey sector and the absence of regulation and 
monitoring, women in the grey sex sector face a higher risk of violence.  The exploitation of 
minor girls and trafficked women also appears to take place mainly in grey sector sex 
establishments.  In 2002, an official evaluation of the lifting of the brothel ban found &#8220;a lack of 
supervision and poor accessibility for social and health workers [in the grey sector], as the result 
of which these prostitutes are extra vulnerable to exploitation and their position has worsened 
rather than improved.&#8221;<b>34</b>  Four years later, the government authorities are still struggling to get 
control of the grey sex sector, especially the escort agencies.  The authorities now require 
newspapers to record the names and addresses of persons placing advertisements for prostitution.  
The law enforcement authorities also launch sting operations against suspicious escort services 
by posing as potential buyers.  Amsterdam plans to introduce a licensing system for escort 
agencies which is expected to enter into force in 2007.  However, other municipalities still fail to 
assume their legal responsibility to regulate the entire sex sector operating within their 
boundaries.  
</p>
<p>84. Improving the position of women in prostitution is by far the least developed tenet of the 
prostitution policy.  It is still very apparent that the sex sector is organized by men for men.  
Women who operate independently of male pimps are still the exception, not the norm.  Efforts 
of women to open independent establishments have also been hampered by the fact that many 
municipalities have limited the number of licences issued and prioritized existing establishments.  
Women&#8217;s organizations report that many women are still badly informed about their rights 
vis-&#224;-vis brothel owners.  They criticize the Government for focusing mainly on regulation, 
therefore not devoting enough attention to this problem.  This issue needs to be urgently 
addressed if the Dutch approach to prostitution is to successfully reduce violence and 
exploitation on a sustainable, long-term basis. 
</p>
<p>85. The Government reported that it is currently evaluating its prostitution policy, which 
could lead to some policy adjustments. 
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Gender equality has considerably advanced in the Netherlands over the last decades 
thanks to an active emancipation policy driven by the Government and civil society.  
Contrary to widely held beliefs, however, the emancipation project is not yet completed, let 
alone self-sustainable.  This is indicated by the fact that women in the Netherlands, 
including native Dutch women, are still strongly underrepresented in decision-making 
positions and the labour market in general.  Moreover, a majority of women are not 
economically independent. </b> 
</p>
<p>87. <b>The Government&#8217;s gender-mainstreaming strategy does not effectively address 
remaining inequalities since it delegates fragments of the problem associated with gender

<p><b>inequality to various entities, often as gender-neutral tasks.  Overall coordination, 
monitoring and accountability mechanisms for different government agencies as well as 
gender-budgeting practices are lacking.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Domestic violence is the most prevalent form of violence against women in the 
Netherlands.  While significant efforts to address the issue exist, they are typically 
formulated as a gender-neutral security issue.  VAW in the private sphere is lumped 
together with violence against inherently vulnerable groups, thereby de-linking the 
problem from its root causes and prevailing power dynamics. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>Women belonging to immigrant communities face particular problems of gender 
inequality that also translate into violence.  Culturally essentialized perceptions of violence 
experienced by these women have increased stigmatization and discrimination against 
women and men of immigrant backgrounds, which is making the efforts to eradicate 
gender discrimination within these communities more difficult.  These women&#8217;s 
vulnerability to violence is fostered by increasingly restrictive immigration laws that have 
unequal consequences for women. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>Women in prostitution still face violence, despite the legalization and regulation 
approach and the Government&#8217;s efforts to enforce a zero-tolerance policy towards 
trafficking and sexual exploitation.  Additionally, a grey sex sector continues to escape 
regulation and monitoring.  Furthermore, the overtly regulation-oriented policy has failed 
to enhance the ability of women in prostitution to effectively pursue their interests in the 
sex sector. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Overall, without a comprehensive policy on violence against women that is defined 
within the context of gender inequality, a fragmented, gender-neutral and &#8220;law and 
order&#8221;-focused approach prevails, which undermines the effectiveness of the many 
commendable programmes in place to address the problem. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>In view of my findings, I would like to make the following recommendations to the 
Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Improve the gender-equality policy and institutional framework by:  
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Providing institutional oversight to the gender-mainstreaming initiatives 
within a holistic gender-equality paradigm.  In this regard, the mandate 
and competence of the Department for the Coordination of Emancipation 
Policy should be strengthened.  All government agencies should also 
consider establishing internal gender steering committees that monitor 
and coordinate gender-mainstreaming work with a gender-equality 
perspective; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Reviewing and consolidating existing policy and practice on all forms of 
VAW into a comprehensive gender-sensitive policy.  The Government 
should also consider developing a national action plan to eradicate VAW;  </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/4/34/Add.4

</p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Considering ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on Action 
against Trafficking in Human Beings; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Further reforming the social security and the taxation system to foster 
and facilitate the participation of women in the labour market; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensuring adequate funding to non-governmental organizations and 
independent expert institutions working on gender equality and women&#8217;s 
rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Eliminate all forms of discrimination by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Implementing fully the recommendations contained in the concluding 
observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination 
against Women of 2001 on the Netherlands&#8217; second and third report to 
the Committee (see A/56/38); 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Addressing and challenging through media campaigns and school 
curricula unequal gender-based power relations in the private sphere by 
promoting male and female identities that break with notions of 
domination and use of force.  Sexual education in schools should address 
harmful sexual attitudes and abuse of power in interpersonal 
relationships; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensuring the norm of equal opportunity and non-discrimination on the 
basis of sex and ethnic or religious origin in the labour market, the justice 
sector and other key institutions.  Special measures should be considered 
to facilitate the equal participation of women and men with an immigrant 
or refugee background in the educational system and the labour market.  
In this regard, the Government should consider signing and ratifying the 
International Convention on the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families; 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Acknowledging the diverse voices within different cultural groups and 
supporting those that respect and promote women&#8217;s rights.  To counter 
cultural essentialism and stigmatization, the Government should promote 
gender equality as a universal culture that has emerged in response to a 
universal history of gender inequality;

<p>&#8226; <b>Promoting a new social consensus that is inclusive and participatory and 
that aims at achieving integration based on equal participation and 
mutual respect; </b></p>

<p><b> (c) Investigate and punish perpetrators of VAW and protect women at risk of 
violence by: 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Pursuing a policy of zero tolerance of gender-based violence and sexual

</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Ensuring that restraining orders against potential perpetrators of VAW

should be made available to ensure that all undocumented immigrant 
women exposed to violence (whether &#8220;honour&#8221;-related or not) can access
