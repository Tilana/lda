<p><b>  23/&#8230;</b> <b>National policies and human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided also</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard 
of achievement for all peoples and all nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>all relevant international human rights treaties, including the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also</i> that States emphasized in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
Action and the 2005 World Summit Outcome1 that they bear the responsibility, in 
conformity with the Charter, to develop and encourage<b> </b>respect for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms for all, without distinction of any kind such as race, colour, sex, 
language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or 
other status,  
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind </i>that States should integrate their obligations under international 
human rights law into their national legislation in order to ensure that State action at the 
national level is effectively directed towards the promotion and protection of all human 
rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> that State action aimed at the promotion, protection and full realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national level is most effective when fully 
integrated into national policies based on a human rights perspective, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> * Non-member State of the Human Rights Council. 
 
</p>

<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>that all human rights are inalienable, universal, indivisible, 
interdependent and interrelated, and that, therefore, national policies aimed at their 
promotion and protection will also have a mutually reinforcing effect on their realization, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that each State has the right to choose the framework that is best suited 
to its particular needs at the national level, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>the importance of international cooperation to support States in the 
process of integrating their obligations under international human rights law into national 
legislation, and drawing up and carrying out national policies aimed at the full realization of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing </i>the important and constructive role that national human rights 
institutions and civil society can play in the process of drawing up and assessing the impact 
of national policies aimed at the promotion, protection and full realization of human rights 
and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Recognizes</i> that State action aimed at the full realization of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms at the national level is made most effective by drawing up and 
putting into practice national policies in conformity with obligations under international 
human rights law; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Stresses</i> the importance of the resolution of Heads of State and Government 
to integrate the promotion and protection of human rights into national policies as reflected 
in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Recognizes</i> the importance of developing, strengthening and implementing, 
as appropriate, national systems for collecting, monitoring and evaluating relevant 
disaggregated national data as a useful tool for drawing up and assessing the impact of 
national policies aimed at the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to prepare a report on technical assistance and capacity-building options for 
integrating human rights into national policies, drawing from worldwide best practices in 
this field, with a view to support States in developing and applying suitable methodologies 
to that end, upon request and according to their own particular needs and priorities; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also</i> <i>requests</i> the Office of the High Commissioner to submit the above-
mentioned report to the Human Rights Council at its twenty-seventh session. 
</p>
