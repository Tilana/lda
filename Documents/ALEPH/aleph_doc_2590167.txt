INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
Board of Directors
Arête Industries, Inc.
Westminster, Colorado
We have audited the accompanying statements of operating revenues and direct operating
expenses (the “Statements”) of the oil and gas working interests acquired by Arête Industries, Inc.
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. The Statements are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Statements based on
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with Standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
The accompanying Statements are prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission as described in Note 2 and are not
intended to be a complete presentation of the Properties’ revenues and expenses.
In our opinion, the Statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
operating revenues and direct operating expenses of the oil and gas working interests acquired
by Arête Industries, Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1.   SUMMARY OF ACQUISITION AGREEMENT:
On December 30, 2015, the Company completed an asset acquisition pursuant to a purchase
and sale agreement executed on November 25, 2015, but effective December 1, 2015 (the
"Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement ") with Wellstar Corporation (the "Seller"), an
unaffiliated corporation. The assets acquired were producing oil and gas leases in Sumner
County, Kansas and Kimball County, Nebraska (collectively, the "Properties" and individually,
the "Padgett Properties" and the "Nebraska Properties"). The Company acquired 51% of Seller's
interest (ranging from 47% to 100% of the working interests) in the Padgett Properties and
acquired 100% of the Seller's interest (100% of the working interests) in the Nebraska Properties
for aggregate consideration of $1,100,000 and the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of the
Company's restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share at the date of closing, or
$100,000.

2.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION:
The accompanying statements of operating revenues and direct operating expenses (the
“Statements”) of the working interests in Oil and Gas Properties (“Properties”) acquired by the
Company were prepared by the Sellers based on carved out financial information and data from
the Properties’ historical accounting records. The Statements exclude the operating revenues
and direct operating expenses of the Separate Interests described in Note 1. Historical financial
statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have never
been prepared for the Properties.
Because the Properties are not separate legal entities, the accompanying Statements vary from a
complete income statement in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America in that they do not reflect certain expenses that were incurred in
connection with the ownership and operation of the Properties including, but not limited to,
general and administrative expenses, interest expense, and other expenses. These costs were
not separately allocated to the Properties in the accounting records of Sellers. In addition, these
allocations, if made using historical general and administrative structures and tax burdens, may
not produce allocations that would be indicative of the historical performance of the Properties
had they been the Company’s properties due to the differing size, structure, operations and
accounting policies of the Sellers and the Company.
The accompanying Statements also do not include provisions for depreciation, depletion,
amortization and accretion, as such amounts would not be indicative of the costs which the
Company will incur upon the allocation of the purchase price paid for the Properties.
Furthermore, no balance sheet has been presented for the Properties, because not all of the
historical cost and related working capital balances are segregated or easily obtainable, nor has
information about the Properties operating, investing and financing cash flows been provided for
similar reasons. Accordingly, the accompanying Statements are presented in lieu of the financial
statements required under Rule 8-04 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X.
3.   USE OF ESTIMATES IN PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:
The preparation of the Statements of Operating Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses of the
Properties acquired by the Company in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of operating revenues and direct operating expenses during the respective
reporting periods. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the
preparation of the Statements of Operating Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses of the
Properties acquired by the Company.

4.   CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
The Sellers record revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas in the month that delivery to
the purchaser occurs and title has transferred. The impact of gas imbalances is not material.
Direct Operating Expenses include overhead charges, contract pumper services, salt water
disposal, utilities, repairs, maintenance, and other direct costs. All Direct Operating Expenses,
including the cost of workovers and repairs to well equipment, are charged to expense in the
period incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Sellers did not drill any
wells on the properties acquired by the Company and, accordingly, all costs incurred to operate
the wells have been included in lease operating expense.
5.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:
Pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement, there are no known claims, litigation
or disputes pending as of the effective date of the Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement, or any
matters arising in connection with indemnification, and the parties to the agreement are not
aware of any legal, environmental or other commitments or contingencies that would have a
material adverse effect on the Operating Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses of the
Properties acquired by the Company.
6.   SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION (Unaudited):
The reserve information presented below is based on estimates of net proved reserves of the
Properties as of December 31, 2015 that were prepared by the Company’s independent
petroleum engineering firm, and information for 2014 provided by the Company's independent
petroleum engineering firm, in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC.
Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which
geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions (i.e., prices
and costs as of the date the estimate is made). Proved developed oil and gas reserves are
reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
and operating methods. Estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and are
continually subject to revision based on production history, results of additional exploration and
development, price changes and other factors. All of the Properties’ proved reserves are located
in the continental United States.
The following table sets forth information for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 with
respect to changes in the Properties’ proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves:
Crude Oil
 
(Bbl)

  (36,350 )

 Certain information concerning the assumptions used in computing the valuation of proved
reserves and their inherent limitations are discussed below. The Company believes such
information is essential for a proper understanding and assessment of the data presented.

As of December 31, 2015, future cash inflows were computed by applying the 12 month
arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December 31, 2015, which
resulted in benchmark prices of $50.28 per barrel for crude oil. Prices were further adjusted for
transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in an average price used as of
December 31, 2015 of $46.74 per barrel of oil.
As of December 31, 2014, future cash inflows were computed by applying the 12 month
arithmetic average of the first of month price for January through December 31, 2014, which
resulted in benchmark prices of $94.99 per barrel for crude oil. Prices were further adjusted for
transportation, quality and basis differentials, which resulted in an average price used as of
December 31, 2014 of $91.45 per barrel of oil.
The assumptions used to compute estimated future cash inflows do not necessarily reflect the
Company’s expectations of actual revenues or costs, nor their present worth. In addition,
variations from the expected production rate also could result directly or indirectly from factors
outside of the Company’s control, such as unexpected delays in development, changes in prices
or regulatory or environmental policies. The reserve valuation further assumes that all reserves
will be disposed of by production. However, if reserves are sold in place, additional economic
considerations could also affect the amount of cash eventually realized.
Future production costs are computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in producing
2014
the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year, based on year-end costs and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions.
Future income tax expenses are computed by applying the appropriate year-end statutory tax
rates, with consideration of future tax rates already legislated, to the future pre-tax net cash flows
relating to the Company’s proved oil and gas reserves.
A 10% annual discount rate was used to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to
proved oil and gas reserves.
Standardized Measure
The following table presents the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of
December 31, 2015 and 2014 related to proved oil and gas reserves for the oil and gas working
interests acquired by the Company on December 30, 2015:

Future cash inflows
Future production costs
Future development costs

Future net cash flows
10% annual discount
 
Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows $589,190
The present value (at a 10% annual discount) of future net cash flows from proved reserves is not
necessarily the same as the current market value of such oil and gas reserves. The estimated
discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves is based on average prices realized in the
preceding year and on costs in effect at the end of the year for such properties. However, actual
future net cash flows from these oil and gas properties will also be affected by factors such as
actual prices received for oil and gas, the amount and timing of actual production, supply of and
demand for oil and gas and changes in governmental regulations or taxation.
The timing of both the production of oil and gas and the incurrence of expenses in connection
with the development and production of oil and gas properties will affect the timing of actual
future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the
10% annual discount factor used to calculate discounted future net cash flows may not be the
most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks
associated with the properties, or the oil and gas industry in general.

Estimates of net proved reserves as of December 31, 2013, in accordance with SEC guidelines
were not prepared. Accordingly, the changes in the standardized measure for 2014 do not
include revisions in prior estimates, net changes in prices and production costs, accretion of
discount or timing and other differences. No acquisition, drilling or other development activities
occurring on the Properties during 2015 and 2014 and, accordingly, no amounts are shown for
these activities in computing the changes in the standardized measure for 2015 and 2014.

ARÊTE INDUSTRIES, INC.
NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS
1.   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
On December 30, 2015, the Company completed an asset acquisition pursuant to a purchase
and sale agreement executed on November 25, 2015, but effective December 1, 2015 (the
"Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement ") with Wellstar Corporation (the "Seller"), an
unaffiliated corporation. The assets acquired were producing oil and gas leases in Sumner
County, Kansas and Kimball County, Nebraska (collectively, the "Properties" and individually,
the "Padgett Properties" and the "Nebraska Properties"). The Company acquired 51% of Seller's
interest (ranging from 47% to 100% of the working interests) in the Padgett Properties and
acquired 100% of the Seller's interest (100% of the working interests) in the Nebraska Properties
for aggregate consideration of $1,100,000 and the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of the
Company's restricted common stock valued at $0.10 per share at the date of closing, or
$100,000.
The unaudited pro forma balance sheet presents the acquisition of the Properties as if those
transactions occurred on January 1, 2014. The pro forma unaudited statements of operations
present the acquisition of the Properties as if they occurred at the beginning of the periods
covered by the unaudited pro forma statements of operations.
These unaudited pro forma financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the financial
position or results of operations that would have occurred had the acquisition been effected on
the assumed dates. Additionally, future results may vary significantly from the results reflected in
the unaudited pro forma statements of operations due to normal production declines, changes in
prices, future transactions, and other factors. The Company currently has provided a full valuation
allowance against net deferred tax assets. The Company believes that the acquisition would not
result in an immediate change in the Company’s assessment regarding the valuation allowance.
As such, no income tax adjustments from the acquisition have been reflected in the unaudited
pro forma financial information.
For financial accounting purposes, the acquisition of the working interests is not considered a
business combination under Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards
Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. This determination was arrived at by
considering key processes that were not acquired as part of the acquisition. No employees were
acquired as part of the acquisition. Specifically, after the acquisition the Company will require
highly specialized employees and/or consulting resources to manage and replicate key elements
related to the Properties that were previously provided by the Sellers. Key processes that were
not acquired include the geological, geophysical and engineering expertise directly related to
these specific properties that will be needed to fully exploit the drilling and recompletion potential
for the Properties.
These unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the Statements of Operating
Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.
2.   PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF
OPERATIONS
The Wellstar Purchase and Sale Agreement closed on December 30, 2015. The purchase of the
assets are included in the balance sheet at December 31, 2015, therefore there are no pro forma
adjustments presented for the balance sheet at December 31, 2015.
3.   PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF
OPERATIONS
Presented below is an explanation of the pro forma adjustments to the accompanying unaudited
pro forma consolidated statements of operations:
a)
b)
The actual oil and gas revenues for the acquired working interest properties are included as a
pro forma adjustment as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period.
The actual direct operating expenses for the acquired working interest properties are included
as a pro forma adjustment as if the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the period.
Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion are based on historical production and
estimated reserves for the acquired working interest properties. The cost assigned to each field
is based upon the preliminary purchase price allocation.
