<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in 
accordance with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its thirteenth 
session from 21 May to 4 June 2012.  The review of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
and Northern Ireland was held at the 7th meeting, on 24 May 2012. The delegation the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was headed by Lord McNally, 
Minister of State, Ministry of Justice. At its 13th meeting, held on 30 May 2012, the 
Working Group adopted the report on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern 
Ireland. 
</p>
<p>2. On 3 May 2012, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland: Angola, Indonesia and Norway. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1<b> </b>and 
paragraph 5 of the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the 
review of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/13/GBR/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/GBR/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/13/GBR/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the 
Netherlands was transmitted to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the UPR. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the thirteenth session, on 24 May 2012, the Minister of State for the United 
Kingdom introduced its national report.  He explained he was leading the United Kingdom 
delegation, supported by officials from within the Coalition Government and the Devolved 
Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>6. The United Kingdom said it was proud of its human rights record but there was 
always room for improvement.  One of the strengths of universal periodic review was to 
learn from a wide variety of perspectives and experiences and make enjoyment of human 
rights a reality in people&#8217;s everyday lives throughout the world.  The United Kingdom was 
looking forward to hearing the views, perspectives and recommendations of other States.  
The United Kingdom&#8217;s review came in the midst of the world&#8217;s worst financial crisis for 
</p>
<p>over half a century.  In order to reduce the deficit and restore economic stability some very 
difficult decisions have had to be made to reduce public spending. In doing so, the United 
Kingdom had tried to protect the most vulnerable in society. 
</p>
<p>7. The United Kingdom reaffirmed its long-standing commitment to advancing human 
rights both at home and internationally.  The United Kingdom&#8217;s aim for the second UPR 
</p>
<p>cycle was to strengthen this unique mechanism, preserving its universality and constructive </p>


<p>spirit.  The United Kingdom believed it was for States to lead the way in establishing best 
practice and hoped to work with others to achieve this.  The Government had consulted 
broadly with civil society in all four nations of the United Kingdom and had engaged them 
in a frank and constructive discussion. The United Kingdom said information on the 
implementation of recommendations from the first round was in its national report. 
</p>
<p>8. The Coalition Government was firmly committed to promoting and protecting 
human rights and in its Programme for Government had reaffirmed its commitment to the 
European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).  The Government had established a 
Commission on a Bill of Rights to provide an opportunity to review how best to enshrine 
the Convention into domestic law, protecting and extending British liberties.  The 
Commission was due to report by the end of 2012. 
</p>
<p>9. The United Kingdom Government was committed to the effective operation of the 
European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and therefore proud of the substantial reform 
package achieved last month in the Brighton Declaration, under its Chairmanship of the 
Council of Europe<b>.  </b>The purpose of the reform was to ensure that more cases were resolved 
at the national level enabling the Court to focus more quickly on more important cases and 
helping it to better address the abuse of human rights in Europe. 
</p>
<p>10. Referring to questions posed by Norway and Sweden about pre-charge detention, 
terrorism prevention and investigation measures and the policy of deportation of terrorist 
suspects, the United Kingdom said that the first duty of any Government was to protect life 
and secure prosperity for all its people.  It was essential that the various arms of the State 
had the powers and ability to meet threats from terrorism but was equally necessary for the 
British justice system to be able to administer justice in a way that safeguards civil liberties 
and human rights.  The United Kingdom acknowledged that reconciling the demands of 
these two fundamentally important objectives is one of its greatest challenges. 
</p>
<p>11. The United Kingdom said it had recently undertaken a review of six of its counter-
terrorism powers to ensure a correct balance between the State&#8217;s security powers and civil 
liberties.  As a result, the maximum period for pre-charge detention had been reduced from 
28 to 14 days. To deal with exceptional circumstances, the review recommended 
publication of draft fast-track legislation which could be introduced where more than 14 
days might be necessary. It would be a matter for Parliament to agree whether the 
maximum period could be extended to 28 days and a matter for a court to decide whether it 
was necessary in each individual case.  The review had also concluded that control orders 
should be replaced by a system of terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPIM).  
A TPIM notice can only be imposed if the statutory tests for its imposition have been met &#8211; 
including that the individual is reasonably believed to be involved in terrorism-related 
activity and that it is necessary to protect the public from a risk of terrorism.  There was an 
automatic, in-depth review of the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision to impose the TPIM notice 
by the High Court. The court considered the necessity and proportionality of each measure 
and its compliance with the ECHR. The court also ensures protection of the individual&#8217;s 
right to a fair hearing in accordance with article 6. 
</p>
<p>12. The United Kingdom said it would not deport a terrorist suspect where there were 
substantial grounds for believing that there was a real risk the individual will face torture or 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. However, they believed that Government-
to-Government assurances are a valid way of achieving its aim of protecting the public in 
accordance with international obligations. Arrangements are in place to verify that 
assurances are respected and in its ruling on Abu Qatada, the European Court of Human 
Rights has found that the United Kingdom&#8217;s policy is compatible with article 3, the 
prohibition of torture. </p>


<p>13. Responding to the Netherlands, the United Kingdom Government reaffirmed its 
commitment to the right to peaceful protest.  It said it supported the targeted and 
proportionate use of containment by the police as a key tactic to manage risks of violence 
and disorder at protests and its use in a way that minimized the impact on those protesting 
peacefully.  The European Court of Human Rights&#8217; recent <i>Austin</i> judgment found that the 
use of containment as a police tactic was lawful if used proportionately. 
</p>
<p>14. Referring to questions from Sweden, Norway and Slovenia about policies on 
children&#8217;s rights, the United Kingdom believed that all children should be protected from 
</p>
<p>violence and abuse.  Any punishment that constituted violence or abuse was unlawful.  In 
2004 the law for England and Wales was amended so that parents could no longer use the 
&#8220;reasonable punishment&#8221; defence if prosecuted for assaults on their children which 
involved cruelty, or caused actual or grievous bodily harm. Similar measures had been 
taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.  Research showed that fewer parents now used 
physical punishment, and the Government hoped the trend would continue. 
</p>
<p>15. Regarding its commitment to end child poverty, the United Kingdom Government 
had published its first-ever child poverty strategy, which set out action to tackle the 
complex causes of poverty, including unemployment and welfare dependency, family 
breakdown, low educational achievement, poor health and disability and financial 
insecurity.  The Devolved Administrations had their own strategies which complement each 
other. 
</p>
<p>16. Replying to Slovenia, the United Kingdom said it recognized the importance of 
supporting children of offenders, both for their own sake and to prevent intergenerational 
crime.  The statutory framework set out in the Children&#8217;s Act 2004 required public bodies 
to make arrangements to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, including children 
of offenders. 
</p>
<p>17. The Minister for State made statements on behalf of the Scottish and Welsh 
Governments and Northern Ireland.  The Scottish Government was committed to creating a 
modern, inclusive Scotland that respects and realizes human rights.  Scotland&#8217;s devolved 
institutions must observe and implement obligations entered into by the United Kingdom 
under the European Convention on Human Rights and other international treaties. The 
Scottish Government had been positively engaged in the UPR process and had sought to 
reflect Scottish best practice in particular areas.  Internationally, the Scottish Government 
had been at the forefront of championing climate justice. Scotland had its own national 
human rights institution (the Scottish Human Rights Commission), which currently chairs 
the European Group of National Human Rights Institutions. 
</p>
<p>18. The Welsh Government was committed to making Wales a fairer, more inclusive 
society, where all of its diverse communities could thrive. The universal periodic review 
(UPR) provided an opportunity to demonstrate the unique approach that has been 
developed in Wales to meet its international obligations and the needs of the Welsh people.  
Since the 2008 review, there had been a number of successes in Wales, such as embedding 
the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) into Welsh law and development of its 
first strategic national policy to ensure equality of opportunity for the Gypsy Traveller 
community. 
</p>
<p>19. The United Kingdom Government was pleased to report that since its last review, 
Northern Ireland had enjoyed a period of political stability not seen in a generation. But, as 
in any society undergoing the transition from conflict, there remained difficult issues to 
resolve.  The United Kingdom Government would continue to play a role, but believed the 
best way to resolve such issues was through solutions from within Northern Ireland. </p>


<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>20. During the interactive dialogue, 60 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>21. The Philippines welcomed the statement released by the United Kingdom 
guaranteeing protection for overseas workers. It enquired if the Domestic Violence Rule 
would provide access to legal, financial and shelter assistance for abused women and 
domestic helpers while pursuing cases against employers. The Philippines made a 
recommendation. 
</p>
<p>22. Qatar commended the United Kingdom on its implementation of recommendations 
from the first UPR cycle and ratification of a number of international conventions on 
human rights. Qatar requested information on measures used to strengthen efforts to combat 
human trafficking. Qatar made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>23. Romania congratulated the United Kingdom on its balance between various rights 
and the security of its citizens in the context of the fight against terrorism. Romania 
commended the many initiatives promoting gender equality but requested more detailed 
information on measures to advance gender equality, especially in rural areas. 
</p>
<p>24. The Russian Federation voiced concern about human rights problems in the United 
Kingdom despite its efforts to implement recommendations from the first UPR. It cited 
frequent cases of excessive use of force by British police in cities during mass 
demonstrations in 2011. It also expressed concern over the conditions of detention. It made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Slovakia congratulated the United Kingdom on the adoption of Equality Act in 2010 
and the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2009 
and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings in 
</p><p>2008. Slovakia made three recommendations. 
</p>
<p>26. Slovenia commended the United Kingdom on the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography, and for the withdrawal of its last two reservations to the 
Convention. Slovenia raised the issue of children of incarcerated parents and enquired 
about steps taken to support these children. Slovenia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Spain congratulated the United Kingdom on the adoption of the Equality Act in 
2010 to ensure equal opportunities regardless of race, gender or economic situation. With 
respect to deportation of terrorism suspects without guarantees that they will not be 
tortured, Spain enquired about the extent of bilateral agreements that contain independent 
monitoring. Spain made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Sudan asked the United Kingdom about measures taken to ensure equal pay for men 
and women. It expressed concern over the low age (10) for criminal responsibility of 
children. Sudan also enquired about criteria for juvenile justice questioning its compliance 
with the Rights of the Child. Sudan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. Sweden welcomed the United Kingdom&#8217;s decision to prohibit the use of corporal 
punishment of children in schools. However, it referred to the Committee on the Rights of 
the Child&#8217;s concluding observation of 2002 that the United Kingdom should prohibit all 
corporal punishment of children. Sweden made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>30. Referring to Switzerland&#8217;s recommendation in the 2008 review that the United 
Kingdom shorten the detention period for terror suspects, Switzerland welcomed the efforts 
to limit this detention period from 28 to 14 days. Switzerland considered any person 
arrested or detained by the armed forces of a state to be covered by that state&#8217;s jurisdiction </p>


<p>and that State should respect its international obligations. Switzerland made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>31. Thailand commended the United Kingdom&#8217;s establishment of the three A-status 
national human rights institutions. It expressed satisfaction about efforts made to strengthen 
the rights of women and children but noted, however, the observation made by the 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women on the absence of a 
comprehensive policy for the management of women in prison. Thailand suggested that 
investigations be undertaken into allegations concerning detention facilities in Afghanistan 
and Iraq. Thailand made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>32. Timor-Leste welcomed policy and legislative measures taken by the United 
Kingdom to combat discrimination and hate crimes. It also welcomed proposals to abolish 
the migrant workers visa and the plan to provide protection for overseas domestic workers 
from abuse. Timor-Leste enquired about measures to ensure the safety of migrant workers 
and whether the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families (ICRMW) would be ratified. 
</p>
<p>33. Trinidad and Tobago commended the United Kingdom for the acceptance of 
recommendations from the first cycle of UPR.  It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Turkey welcomed the establishment of an independent, judicial-led inquiry into 
allegations that the United Kingdom was implicated in the improper treatment of detainees 
held by other countries in the aftermath of 9/11. Turkey made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. Ukraine welcomed measures undertaken at the national level to combat violence 
against women and girls; particularly the Action Plan launched in 2011 and encouraged the 
British Government to strengthen its efforts for the protection and rehabilitation of the 
victims of violence. Ukraine made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>36. The United States of America welcomed recent steps taken to reform the defamation 
law in England and Wales. It expressed concern about inconsistencies in differing 
trafficking laws in the devolved authorities of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. It 
applauded the creation of the Hate Crime Action Plan and expected agencies to work 
together to address violence against women, immigrants, religious minorities, the disabled 
and children. The United States made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Uruguay appreciated the task performed by the three NHRIs and noted with 
satisfaction measures adopted for the protection of domestic workers who have been 
victims of abuse in the United Kingdom.  Uruguay made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Uzbekistan voiced concern about the United Kingdom&#8217;s independent investigations 
into deaths under suspicious circumstances and torture, referring to the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child&#8217;s concern about deaths under suspicious circumstances of six children 
in detention since the last review. Uzbekistan noted that the Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women requested the United Kingdom to fully implement laws 
preventing disfiguring operations on female genitals and that gender equality was still an 
issue in certain State bodies. Uzbekistan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>39. Viet Nam voiced concern regarding the impact of current austerity measures 
imposed by the United Kingdom Government, which will unfairly affect vulnerable groups 
such as women, children, the impoverished, disabled and migrants. Viet Nam made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>40. Algeria commended the ratification of two human rights instruments since the last 
review and noted steps taken to implement accepted recommendations. Algeria expressed 
concern about the continuing issue of gender wage inequalities, the provisions in the Race </p>


<p>Relations Act which allow for public officials to discriminate, and reiterated its call for 
adherence to the ICRMW. Algeria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>41. Angola welcomed the establishment of the human rights commissions of Scotland 
and Northern Ireland.  Angola commended the ratification of new international instruments 
such as the CRPD and the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. 
Angola recognized the United Kingdom&#8217;s efforts to implement accepted recommendations. 
</p>
<p>Angola made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Argentina congratulated the United Kingdom on the adoption of the Equality Act to 
combat discrimination. It expressed its opposition to the inclusion of the Falkland Islands 
(Malvinas)1 in the list of overseas territories in paragraph 140 of the national report, and 
reaffirmed the wording of the note verbale presented by Argentina. Argentina made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. The Minister of State noted that many of the contributions from States mirrored 
debates taking place in the United Kingdom. Regarding Argentina&#8217;s intervention, the 
</p>
<p>United Kingdom&#8217;s position relating to the Falklands (Malvinas) had not changed, and was 
based on the principle of self-determination. 
</p>
<p>44. As outlined in the opening statement, the United Kingdom Government was 
committed to the promotion and implementation of children&#8217;s rights.  It noted that there had 
been significant developments since its last review, including the formal removal of the 
final two reservations to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and it had ended the 
detention of children for immigration purposes in 2011. 
</p>
<p>45.  In England, the Government had given a commitment to Parliament to give due 
consideration to the Convention when making new policy and legislation. It was also 
introducing legislation to strengthen the role of the Children&#8217;s Commissioner for England.  
In 2011 the Welsh Government enacted legislation which places a duty on its Ministers to 
have due regard to the CRC when making policies and legislation and the Scottish 
Government have consulted on introducing a similar duty. 
</p>
<p>46. Responding to Sweden&#8217;s question about prison overcrowding, the United Kingdom 
stated that it was committed to providing safe and well ordered establishments in which it 
treated prisoners humanely, decently and lawfully.  The United Kingdom would always 
need to have enough accommodation for those sentenced to custody by the courts, 
including maintaining a sufficient margin to enable us to manage population fluctuations. 
However, the United Kingdom&#8217;s focus was on trying to break the cycle of criminality by 
</p>
<p>addressing the underlying causes including illiteracy, mental illness and alcohol and drug 
dependency. 
</p>
<p>47. The United Kingdom rejected absolutely the Russian Federation&#8217;s assertion that 
conditions in United Kingdom prisons amounted to torture. Prisons were subject to regular 
inspection by an independent inspectorate accountable to Parliament.  In the context of the 
2011 summer disturbances, the United Kingdom said it was important that responses to 
public order situations were swift and targeted so they did not escalate, the public were 
protected and reassurances to communities could be given. The Home Secretary had asked 
Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectorate of Constabulary to review the response to the disorder and they 
</p>
<p>had made a number of recommendations to the police to consider. 
</p>
<p>  
 1 A dispute exists between the Governments of Argentina and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland concerning sovereignty over the Falkland Islands (Malvinas) (see 
ST/CS/SER.A/42). </p>


<p>48. Responding to Spain&#8217;s question about the right to water and sanitation, the United 
Kingdom said that it was committed to addressing the impact that inadequate water and 
poor sanitation has on the full enjoyment of human rights. This was shown by its recent 
announcement to double the commitment on water and sanitation results that were made 
last year. 
</p>
<p>49. In response to Qatar&#8217;s question, the United Kingdom said it was fully aware that it 
was a destination for trafficking.  In July 2011 the British Government launched its new 
strategy on trafficking, which takes a comprehensive approach to tackling this issue with a 
renewed focus on preventing human trafficking overseas. The Scottish Government had 
changed the law to tackle trafficking and was meeting European standards.  They were 
committed to working with other jurisdictions to ensure effective enforcement. 
</p>
<p>50. With regard to migrant and domestic workers, the United Kingdom said that the 
rights of migrant workers were already protected in domestic legislation, including in the 
Human Rights Act and it believed that the right balance had been struck between the need 
for a firm, fair and effective immigration system and for protection of the interests and 
rights of migrant workers and their families. 
</p>
<p>51. In response to Thailand&#8217;s question about changes affecting overseas domestic 
workers (ODWs), the United Kingdom said it had not seen convincing evidence that the 
changes made would lead to an increase in trafficking.  The protections already in place to 
minimize the risk of ODWs being subject to forced labour would remain, including the new 
offence of holding someone in slavery or servitude, introduced in 2009. 
</p>
<p>52. In response to Sudan&#8217;s question about the gender pay gap, the United Kingdom said 
that there were a number of causes and that they were using a range of approaches to close 
the gap, including extending the right to request flexible working and promoting a new 
system of flexible parental leave.  The new voluntary framework for gender equality 
reporting, &#8220;Think, Act, Report&#8221;, would improve transparency on pay and wider workplace 
equality. 
</p>
<p>53. Australia commended the United Kingdom on the ratification of the CRPD and the 
Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. It welcomed efforts to reform 
the European Court of Human Rights aimed at expediting applications and commended the 
establishment of a Commission in 2012 to investigate the creation of a United Kingdom 
Bill of Rights. Australia also welcomed the establishment of Commissions in Scotland and 
Northern Ireland. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>54. Austria noted the changes made to the &#8220;Terrorism Prevention and Investigation 
Measures Act 2011&#8221; but expressed concern about the possibility of pre-charge detention 
and the admissibility of &#8220;secret evidence&#8221;. Austria enquired how the Government could 
guarantee a fair trial in all terrorism-related cases. Austria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. Bangladesh commended the United Kingdom on the ratification of the CRPD and 
noted its commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on overseas 
development assistance by 2013. It requested details on these plans. Bangladesh expressed 
concerns about reports of negative public attitudes towards Muslims and voiced concern 
over the use of detention in immigration control. Bangladesh made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Belarus appreciated the national report of the United Kingdom.  Belarus voiced 
concern over the systematic use of torture by the British forces vis-&#224;-vis detainees outside 
the country, lengthy secret detentions, reservations placed on human rights treaties, the age 
of criminal responsibility, and children in custody.  Belarus made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>57. Botswana welcomed the addition of a third NHRC of Scotland and the review of 
counter terrorism and security powers. Botswana also welcomed United Kingdom&#8217;s 
endeavours to establish the cause of the 2011 summer riots and congratulated the United </p>


<p>Kingdom on its commitment to implement most of the recommendations from the first 
UPR cycle. 
</p>
<p>58. Brazil welcomed the revisions made to the Race Relations Act of 2000 following its 
comments on racial profiling in 2008. Brazil commended the United Kingdom on the 
withdrawals of the last two reservations to the CRC expecting this to also protect children 
in custody. Brazil voiced concern that the Equality Act of 2010 still permits public officials 
to discriminate on the grounds of nationality, ethnic and national origin. Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Burkina Faso commended the United Kingdom on the establishment of a third 
NHRC, the ratification of several international instruments, the adoption of the Equality 
Act in 2010 and initiatives to protect migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. It noted that 
some of the recommendations from the first review were still to be implemented and 
encouraged the ratification of the ICRMW and the ILO Convention of 2011 on Decent 
Work for Domestic Workers. 
</p>
<p>60. Chile appreciated the ratification of the CRPD, the withdrawal of reservations to the 
CRC and the legislative enshrinement of the right to the assistance of a lawyer for detainees 
within 48 hours following arrest. Chile congratulated the United Kingdom on the adoption 
of the Equality Act and the establishment of a Committee that will study a Rights Charter. 
Chile enquired about the potential impact that budgetary cuts made to free legal aid 
programmes will have on vulnerable sectors. Chile made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. China was concerned with the existence of discrimination against Muslims, Roma 
people and migrant workers and increased cases of racist incidents. China also asked the 
United Kingdom to elaborate on the measures taken to protect the fundamental freedom 
during the 2011 riots, especially those of the ordinary people who fell victim to the riots. 
China made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>62. Colombia welcomed the recognition of sexual orientation as a ground for seeking 
asylum, as well as the equality strategy to promote gender equality. Regarding the 
promotion of the rights of migrants, Colombia hoped that the United Kingdom would 
consider the possibility of ratifying the ICRMW. Colombia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Costa Rica was concerned that it was still legal to inflict corporal punishment on 
children. It would like to know in what way the rights provided for in the human rights 
Conventions ratified by the United Kingdom were enforceable, if there had not yet been 
incorporated in national legislation. Costa Rica made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Cuba was concerned that the national report did not contain enough information on 
the protection and promotion of economic, social and cultural rights, and stated that such 
basic rights had been affected by public cuts. Cuba added that children, persons with 
disabilities, women, migrants, minorities and indigenous populations were marginalized 
and disadvantaged on a daily basis. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Despite the progress made, Ecuador was concerned about reports on the supposed 
involvement of British officials in arbitrary detention, forced disappearances and torture of 
citizens of other countries through rendition flights and secret detention centres. Ecuador 
also expressed concern at the announcement of the possibility of changing the Security and 
Justice Act. Ecuador made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>66. Egypt was concerned about the persistence of racial and religious profiling and 
requested clarifications on the exceptional circumstances under which the police &#8220;stop and 
</p>
<p>search&#8221; powers without suspicion could be exercised. It regretted the fact that the Equality 
</p>
<p>Act of 2010 permitted public officials to discriminate on the basis of nationality, ethnic and 
national origins. Egypt made recommendations. </p>


<p>67. Estonia commended the United Kingdom on implementing the policy suggestions 
made during the previous review, particularly regarding the rights of the vulnerable. 
Furthermore, Estonia recognized the United Kingdom&#8217;s commitment to safeguarding the 
freedom of expression, to international development aid and the reforms of the European 
Court of Human Rights. Estonia made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>68. Finland welcomed the commitment of the United Kingdom to the rights of child; 
however, according to the Committee on the Rights of the Child and other treaty bodies, it 
had not explicitly prohibited all corporal punishment of children. Finland noted that women 
in Northern Ireland did not have same access to all sexual and reproductive health care as 
women in other parts of the United Kingdom. Finland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>69. France noted with satisfaction the United Kingdom&#8217;s intention to draft a &#8220;Bill of 
Rights&#8221; that would guarantee human rights. France welcomed the withdrawal of the 
reservations to the CRC and noted the United Kingdom&#8217;s position regarding the Council of 
Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic 
violence. France made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>70. In response to China&#8217;s question, the United Kingdom said that the riots that took 
place in some English towns and cities in 2011 were shocking acts of criminality which 
ruined business, brought destruction to its streets and made people feel unsafe in their own 
homes.  But the law-abiding majority had reclaimed the streets and helped with the 
recovery, with many examples of positive social action.  The United Kingdom was learning 
long-term lessons from these events.  Victims who had suffered loss or damage to property 
could claim under a compensation scheme. 
</p>
<p>71. The Russian Federation and others asked about children in armed conflict. The 
minimum age for entry into the armed forces reflects the normal school-leaving age of 16 
and formal written consent is required from the parents of those under 18.  Under-18s are 
not deployed to operations outside the United Kingdom, except where the operation does 
not involve personnel being exposed to hostilities.  The country regards itself as compliant 
with the CRC. 
</p>
<p>72. Responding to Turkey, the United Kingdom said that the Government was fully 
committed to tackling hate crime as it had no place in a civilized society.  The UK had one 
of the strongest legislative frameworks in the world, including a new offence of stirring up 
hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation, alongside a cross-Government action plan to 
prevent hate crime happening in the first place.  The Welsh Government was currently 
developing a hate crime framework and the Scottish Government was providing over 
&#163; 9 million to organizations and projects working on the ground to help deliver race 
equality. 
</p>
<p>73. Responding to Brazil&#8217;s question about the proportionate use of stop-and-search, the 
United Kingdom said that unless the police had a description of a suspect, a person&#8217;s race, 
age or appearance could not be used alone or in combination as the reason for searching 
someone.  The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 made clear that stop-and-search 
must not be conducted in a discriminatory way and in particular that a person&#8217;s religion 
should never be considered a reason to stop and search them. 
</p>
<p>74. Responding to Switzerland&#8217;s question about pre-charge detention, the United 
Kingdom said the law was applied consistently across the country.  However, those 
suspected of terrorism offences could be detained for up to 14 days before charge to reflect 
the particular complexity and the international nature of modern counter-terrorism 
investigations.  There were a range of safeguards in place and the British courts had 
recently confirmed these provisions were compliant with human rights obligations. </p>


<p>75. Regarding questions from Austria and Ecuador on the use of secret evidence in 
closed proceedings, the United Kingdom said that in a small number of cases highly 
relevant national security evidence if heard in public would jeopardize the methods or 
identities of its security services or those with whom it collaborates. It was trying to put in 
place a system that enabled those cases to go to court in accordance with the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>76. Regarding questions from Switzerland and Belarus about rendition and torture, the 
United Kingdom said that it unreservedly condemned any practice of extraordinary 
rendition to torture and it did not render people in breach of its legal obligations.  Robust 
processes were in place to deal with allegations of any form of mistreatment by United 
Kingdom armed forces and appropriate action was taken when there was a case to answer. 
</p>
<p>77. Responding to Angola&#8217;s question, the United Kingdom said that it wasn&#8217;t possible to 
comment further about the case of Jimmy Mubenga whilst investigations were outstanding 
but that his death was currently the subject of three investigations. 
</p>
<p>78. In response to questions about the International Convention for the Protection of All 
Persons against Enforced Disappearance (CPED), the United Kingdom said that it was keen 
to move towards ratification but that it did not sign international treaties unless it knew it 
could ratify them quickly. The undertaking would require considerable resource and 
parliamentary time; as a minimum the United Kingdom would need to create a new 
criminal offence. 
</p>
<p>79. The United Kingdom said that it would ensure that the recommendation by the 
United States regarding greater resources for the Historic Enquiries Team, were 
communicated to the Devolved Administration in Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>80. In regard to Chile&#8217;s question about the impact of the legal-aid reforms on vulnerable 
groups, the United Kingdom said that reforms in England and Wales had been subject to 
considerable amendments during the passage of the legislation in response to concerns 
raised by NGOs and Parliament.  Public funding for the most vulnerable groups had been 
preserved but the impact would remain under review.  The Scottish Government&#8217;s reforms 
to legal aid were also designed to maintain access to justice as much as possible. 
</p>
<p>81. Germany asked about the United Kingdom&#8217;s response to concerns regarding reports 
on regular screening of personal data and house searches of Muslims solely because of their 
religious affiliation, several seemingly overly broad and vaguely worded provisions in 
counter-terrorism legislation, and the use of racial profiling in the exercise of the so-called 
&#8220;stop and search&#8221; powers. Germany asked for information on how the interim results of the 
European Union study on the effects that the imprisonment of a parent had on a child had 
been assessed, and what steps were taken to improve support for children with parents in 
prison. Germany asked what had been done to address the recommendation to introduce a 
procedure for determining stateless claims. Germany stated that its strong recommendations 
remained, making reference to the &#8220;Blue Group&#8221;. Germany made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>82. Greece wanted to know measures taken to alleviate the impact of the financial crisis 
on women and measures to be undertaken to eliminate racial discrimination in policing. 
Greece welcomed the establishment of a National Referral Mechanism for victims of 
trafficking. Greece made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>83. Guatemala congratulated the United Kingdom for its withdrawal of two reservations 
to CRC and its ratification to the Optional Protocol to CRC on the sale of children and the 
CRPD. Regarding the issue of discrimination, Guatemala asked what exceptions were 
allowed by the 2010 Equality Act. Guatemala also wanted to know the main elements of 
the Action Plan on Domestic Violence, since when it had been enforced, and what the 
results were. Guatemala made a recommendation. </p>


<p>84. Honduras noted particularly the implementation of the Equality Act and the body of 
laws prohibiting direct or indirect discrimination, harassment, victimization and other 
specific conducts. Honduras made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>85. Hungary asked about the legal reasons for not explicitly prohibiting corporal 
punishment of children, the problem of the growing number of women prisoners, and 
measures taken to ensure that human rights education is provided everywhere in the 
country. Hungary also asked about the timeline to enact the Defamation Bill, and what were 
the most debated questions in connection with this law. Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>86. India noted concerns that many public bodies faced difficulties in mainstreaming 
gender equality into policies and on the continuing prevalence of racial prejudice, 
discrimination against ethnic minorities, immigrants and asylum seekers. On the issue of 
immigrants and asylum seekers, India would like to know what the situation on the ground 
is, and what could be the basis for those concerns. India made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>87. Indonesia noted positively the efforts taken by the United Kingdom in the promotion 
of equality, its good practices in tackling hate crimes at the international level and in 
interfaith dialogue. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>88. The Islamic Republic of Iran was alarmed by reports indicating the United 
Kingdom&#8217;s complicity in the secret detention of persons as well as torture and punishment 
</p>
<p>in detention facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>89. Iraq asked about the outcome of discussions on the draft Defamation Bill and its 
impact on the rights of freedom of expression and opinion. The second question concerned 
the mandate and competencies of the Scottish Committee of Human Rights. Iraq made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>90. Japan greatly appreciated the measures taken to protect freedom of expression on-  
and off-line. Moreover, Japan asked what sort of self-regulatory mechanisms had been in 
place in order to strike a balance between challenges such as infringement of individual 
privacy and violation of intellectual property rights and protecting human rights online. 
Japan made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>91. Malaysia was concerned at the negative public attitudes towards minority groups, 
including Muslims, and with the reports on abuse or attacks against schoolchildren owing 
to their religious affiliation. Furthermore, Malaysia expressed concern that the powers 
regarding terrorism prevention and investigation were exercised in a discriminatory 
manner. Malaysia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>92. Mexico reiterated its recognition of the United Kingdom&#8217;s contribution in the rule of 
law and in the legal framework for protecting individuals, particularly international human 
rights law. Mexico made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>93. Morocco asked about the follow-up to the work of the Independent Commission of 
Inquiry in charge of determining whether the Government had participated in ill-treatment 
as part of counter-terrorism operations abroad. Morocco also asked about national strategies 
in combating violence against women and girls as well as the policies in relation to women 
and children in prison. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>94. Mozambique noted with appreciation the implementation of the majority of the 
provisions of the Equality Act. Mozambique also encouraged the United Kingdom to 
pursue its target of spending 0.7 per cent of the gross national income on development 
cooperation and assistance by 2013. 
</p>
<p>95. Nepal commended the United Kingdom for the establishment of national human 
rights institutions and the enactment of the Equality Act. Nepal noted with appreciation the </p>


<p>overarching approach to advancing gender equality and the strategic vision to tackle 
violence against women and to promote their rights. Nepal made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>96. The Netherlands recognized the contribution of the United Kingdom to make the 
UPR process more effective in general, and noted the obligation to respect individual rights 
when pursuing important public goods such as security. The Netherlands made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>97. New Zealand asked the United Kingdom to provide information on its reservations

</p>

encouraged the country to strengthen the criminal justice system. Nicaragua expressed

prohibited in the country. Nicaragua made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>99. Norway welcomed the United Kingdom&#8217;s commitment to repeal control orders 
legislation and to replace control orders with a more focused system of terrorism prevention 
and investigations systems. Regarding the rights of the child, Norway noted the 
introduction of new measures to get a broader understanding of causes and consequences of 
poverty. Norway made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>100. Pakistan asked the United Kingdom about the measures taken to improve the 
situation of schoolchildren in Northern Ireland who were often targets of abuse or attacks

recommendations. 
</p>
<p>101. Paraguay welcomed the establishment of new NHRIs. Paraguay was concerned 
about information regarding a significant increase in the detention of adults because they 
were immigrants, and asked about the measures taken to prevent this situation. Paraguay 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>102. In regard to the position of Muslim communities, the United Kingdom Government 
was working closely with Muslim communities to ensure that they continued play a key 
role in British society and in finding solutions to the problems we face. 
</p>
<p>103. The United Kingdom reassured Trinidad and Tobago that it would continue to 
provide support to the Overseas Territories to help them meet international human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>104. Regarding New Zealand&#8217;s question, the United Kingdom said that its reservations

they will be removed. 
</p>
<p>105. In response to a question by Uzbekistan regarding arms exports, the United

</p>
<p>106. Regarding Australia&#8217;s question, the United Kingdom said that it was determined to

<p>to ensure that the legislation struck the right balance between the right to freedom of 
expression and the protection of reputation. 
</p>
<p>108. The United Kingdom thanked the President of the Human Rights Council for her 
careful stewardship of the session and thanked other member states for their interventions 
which were thought provoking and challenging but delivered in a spirit of cooperation.  
Due to the time constraints it was not possible to cover all the questions raised but the 
United Kingdom undertook to send written responses. The United Kingdom Government 
now looked forward to discussing the recommendations both at state level and with the 
Devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  There would also be
