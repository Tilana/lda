<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report provides an update of the activities undertaken by the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) since its reports in 
2010 to the Human Rights Council (A/HRC/13/26) and to the General Assembly (A/65/36). 
It focuses on implementation of the six thematic priorities established by the Office for 
2010/11.  
</p>
<p>2. In 2010, I conducted missions to: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and 
the United Arab Emirates; the Plurinational State of Bolivia and Mexico; the Central 
African Republic; Iceland; Italy; Japan; Jordan; Kenya; Sweden, as well as Uganda. The 
Deputy High Commissioner visited Kenya and Somalia; Kyrgyzstan; Mexico and Panama; 
as well as Cambodia and Thailand. These were important opportunities for engagement 
with member States and other stakeholders to discuss human rights issues and promote 
progress towards improving the human rights situation including in the areas of OHCHR 
strategic priorities.  
</p>
<p>3. In December 2010, OHCHR was running and supporting 56 field presences: 12 
regional presences,1 of which 5 have gender advisers,2 12 offices at the country level3, 15 
human rights components in United Nations peace missions,4 and 17 human rights advisers 
within United Nations country teams5. In May 2010, I signed an agreement with the 
Government of Guinea to establish an OHCHR country office which was officially 
inaugurated in August 2010 and is now fully operational. In December 2010, the OHCHR 
country office in Mauritania started functioning.  
</p>
<p>4. Field presences are key to refining our strategic priorities and implementing them on 
the ground. Trends and practices that we observe at the national or regional level assist in 
identifying needs and developing tools, policies and guidance to provide technical support 
to Governments, national institutions, civil society, regional organizations and the United 
Nations system.  
</p>
<p>  
 1 Regional presences included the OHCHR Regional Offices for: Southern Africa (Pretoria); East 
</p>
<p>Africa (Addis Ababa); West Africa (Dakar); Southeast Asia (Bangkok); the Pacific (Suva); the 
Middle East (Beirut); Central Asia (Bishkek); Europe (Brussels); Central America (Panama City) and 
Latin America (Santiago), as well as the United Nations Sub-Regional Centre for Human Rights and 
Democracy in Central Africa (Yaound&#233;) and the United Nations Human Rights Training and 
Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region (Doha).  
</p>
<p> 2 West Africa, the Pacific, the Middle East, Central America and Central Africa. Another gender 
advisor is based in the OHCHR New York Office. 
</p>
<p> 3 OHCHR Country Offices in: Togo, Uganda, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Cambodia, Colombia, 
Guatemala, Guinea, Mauritania, Mexico and Nepal, as well as two stand-alone presences, in the 
Kosovo and Occupied Palestinian Territory. 
</p>
<p> 4 BINUB (Burundi), BONUCA (Central African Republic), MINURCAT (Chad and the Central 
African Republic &#8211; to be terminated on 31 December 2010), MONUSCO (Democratic Republic of 
the Congo), UNMIS and UNAMID (the Sudan), UNMIL (Liberia), UNIOSIL (Sierra Leone), 
UNPOS (Somalia), UNOCI (C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire), UNOGBIS (Guinea-Bissau), UNAMA (Afghanistan), 
UNMIT (Timor-Leste); UNAMI (Iraq); MINUSTAH (Haiti), UNOWA (West Africa). In addition, 
OHCHR works in close cooperation with the Human Rights Officer of the UNRCCA based in 
Tajikistan. 
</p>
<p> 5 The Great Lakes Region of Africa (Bujumbura, Burundi), Ecuador, Georgia (covering the Southern 
Caucasus), Guinea, Kenya, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Republic of Moldova, 
Nicaragua (to be terminated on 31 December 2010), Niger, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, the 
Russian Federation, Rwanda, Serbia, Sri Lanka and Tajikistan.  </p>


<p>5. OHCHR continued to strengthen its partnership with other United Nations 
departments, programmes and specialized agencies, as well as regional organizations. This 
covered areas such as tackling racial discrimination, implementing the Millennium 
Development Goals (MDGs), HIV/AIDS, sexual violence in conflict, women&#8217;s rights, 
human rights of persons with disabilities including having joint workplans with some of 
these United Nations partners. The arrival of the Assistant Secretary-General in OHCHR-
New York became one key element in strengthening these links. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Thematic priorities of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Strengthening human rights mechanisms and the progressive 
development of international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Strengthening human rights mechanisms  
</b></p>
<p><i> (a) Human Rights Council  
</i></p>
<p>6. I continued to share my thoughts with the Council and its member States on the key 
principles and objectives of the review and submitted a substantive written contribution to 
the working group with some of my recommendations permeating into the discussions. A 
key benchmark of the Council&#8217;s success is its ability to address chronic and urgent human 
rights situations and to make a difference on the ground.  To this end, I have been 
encouraging the Council to be creative and take full advantage of various opportunities for 
discussion.  
</p>
<p>7. I am pleased to observe that the trend of resorting to alternative modalities for 
debates in the Council has continued, with the active support of my office. At its fifteenth 
session, the Council held its first-ever country-specific dialogue on Somalia with the 
participation of key stakeholders. The &#8220;urgent debate&#8221; feature was another initiative 
introduced to the Council&#8217;s toolbox of working methods at its fourteenth session, to 
consider the Israeli raid on the flotilla of ships carrying humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>8. Besides its annual discussions on women&#8217;s rights, the rights of the child and 
integrating a gender perspective into its work, the Council continued to hold panel 
discussions on a broad range of human rights issues, such as the adverse effects of the 
movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of 
human rights; the protection of journalists in armed conflict; maternal mortality and 
morbidity; and the elimination of discrimination against women in law and practice. 
Notably, the panel debate on trafficking in persons, especially women and girls, involved 
victims and survivors providing them a platform to share their views and perspective.  
</p>
<p><i> (b) Universal periodic review 
</i></p>
<p>9. By the end of December 2010, 143 out of 192 member States have been reviewed, 
with all States under review participating, and their peers being fully engaged at the various 
stages of the process. The 100 per cent participation rate should be commended. It reflects 
the importance and seriousness with which States participate in the universal periodic 
review (UPR), as well as the continued efforts made by my Office to provide information 
on the modalities of the mechanism through regional briefings and regular information 
sessions for representatives of permanent missions and other stakeholders in Geneva and 
New York.  </p>


<p>10. A broad range of recommendations relating to all areas of human rights were made 
during each review. Devising practical mechanisms to follow-up and ensure 
implementation of these recommendations remains a considerable challenge, in particular 
in view of the second cycle fast approaching. The Voluntary Fund for Financial and 
Technical Assistance for implementation of the universal periodic review has become 
operational and has been used in the organization of field-based follow-up briefings which 
should assist States in identifying road maps for implementation of recommendations.  
</p>
<p>11. Although responsibility for implementation rests primarily with States, a diverse 
array of national stakeholders can help Governments in this demanding task. Wide 
participation in this process will also ensure that the UPR debate moves from the 
international stage to the national level. 
</p>
<p><i> (c) Special procedures 
</i></p>
<p>12. The contribution of the special procedures to the work of the Council was widely 
acknowledged in 2010. Interactive dialogues at the Council and the General Assembly 
allowed mandate holders to highlight human rights concerns requiring follow-up at the 
national level, and provide early warning on situations and emerging trends requiring the 
urgent attention of the international community. All opportunities should be used to draw 
on mandate holders&#8217; expertise. I support proposals to enhance the dialogues to allow for 
broader and more interactive discussions. 
</p>
<p>13. I welcome States issuing standing invitations and the increase of these to 73 in 2010.  
Greater efforts should be made to provide timely and substantive responses to special 
procedures&#8217; communications. The direct accessibility of special procedures to victims and 
human rights defenders has been a hallmark of their work, and I am concerned at 
continuing reports of reprisals. The Council should consider the adoption of additional 
measures to protect engagement between experts and all stakeholders, as free interaction is 
an indicator of cooperation.  
</p>
<p>14. The Office has continued to support the independence of the special procedures, 
encouraging States to engage constructively and focus on the substance of human rights 
issues. Procedures are in place to address issues relating to working methods or the conduct 
of mandate holders, and I acknowledge the contributions made by the Coordination 
Committee and individual mandate holders in this regard. 
</p>
<p>15. With the creation of two new thematic mandates in 2010, on the elimination of 
discrimination of women in law and in practice, and on the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and association, there are now 41 mandates with 61 mandate holders.  One third 
of current mandate holders are women. The Council will have an opportunity to improve 
gender balance, with 16 appointments to be made in 2011. I support the suggested 
improvements to the Council&#8217;s selection procedure that will strengthen the appointment and 
induction of mandate holders possessing the highest qualifications.  
</p>
<p>16. Special procedures have continued their collaboration with Council mechanisms, 
contributing to thematic panels and to the Forum on Minority Issues, the Expert Mechanism 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the Social Forum and the Advisory Committee. Better 
use could be made of potential synergies with UPR.  
</p>
<p><i> (d) Treaty bodies 
</i></p>
<p>17. With the welcome entry into force on 23 December 2010 of the International 
Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, a tenth treaty 
body will be established in 2011. Consequently, since 2004, the treaty body system will 
have almost doubled in size with the addition of new treaty bodies, such as the Committee 
on Migrant Workers, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the </p>


<p>Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture. Three new individual complaints procedures 
were created (under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the 
Convention on Enforced Disappearance above, and the International Covenant on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, though the latter has not yet entered into force) and 
one more complaints procedure is under discussion under the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child.  
</p>
<p>18. There have been increases in membership for the three committees above, bringing 
the total number of treaty body experts to 141 (versus 116 at the end of 2009). The meeting 
time has also been on the rise (68 weeks in session for 2010) and additional requests for 
meeting time were approved/extended by the Fifth Committee of the General Assembly in 
the end of 2010 for both the Committee against Torture and the Committee on the 
Elimination of Racial Discrimination (70 weeks of session in 2011).  
</p>
<p>19. In addition, and also as a positive side-effect of UPR, States have increased 
ratification and reporting. In 2010, the eight human rights treaty bodies with a reporting 
procedure covered some 120 country reviews and considered over 100 individual 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>20. This significant growth has prompted me to request all stakeholders to rethink the 
future of treaty bodies with innovative and creative ideas. I am pleased that in response to 
my call, a number of stakeholders have organized consultations: in Dublin (meeting of 
treaty bodies members), in Marrakesh, Morocco (meeting of national human rights 
institutions) and in Poznan, Poland (meeting of treaty bodies&#8217; Chairpersons and experts). In 
addition, retreats with all treaty body experts, when Committees are in session in Geneva, 
are also being organized to brainstorm in preparation for discussions at upcoming meetings 
of Chairpersons (June 2011) and Inter-Committee Meetings (in January and June 2011). 
We have been informed that other consultations, including by civil society, academics and 
with other parts of the United Nations system, are in the making. Some 20 non-
governmental organizations have already made a written contribution to the process. States 
parties will be invited by the Chairpersons of the treaty bodies and myself to a technical 
expert consultation in the spring of 2011.  
</p>
<p>21. I look forward to the culmination of this process of reflection. It is my intention to 
compile the outcomes of these reflections and present them to treaty body experts, States 
parties and all other stakeholders at an appropriate time in 2011. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Progressive development of international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>22. OHCHR continued to support standard-setting related activities undertaken by 
Governments, the Human Rights Council Advisory Committee, the Social Forum, the 
human rights treaty bodies and special procedures. 
</p>
<p>23. OHCHR supports the Open-ended Working Group on an Optional Protocol to the 
Convention of the Rights of the Child to provide a communication procedure, which held 
its second session in December 2010. It also supports the intergovernmental Open-ended 
Working Group on the Right to Development, including in the conclusion of the 2008&#8211;
2010 work plan of its expert mechanism - the high-level task force on the implementation 
of the right to development - resulting in the development of three substantive reports. The 
Working Group on Mercenaries has put forward elements for a possible draft convention on 
the activities of private military and security companies and the Council established an 
open-ended intergovernmental working group to consider the possibility of elaborating an 
international regulatory framework on the regulation, monitoring and oversight of the 
activities of private military and security companies. Also, the General Assembly in its 
resolution 65/182 established an open-ended working group to review how the human </p>


<p>rights of older persons can be better protected, including through the consideration of new 
instruments and measures. 
</p>
<p>24. OHCHR supported the work of the Council&#8217;s Advisory Committee in the 
development and adoption of the Principles and Guidelines on the elimination of 
discrimination against persons affected by leprosy and their family members<b>.</b> These 
guidelines were adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 65/215 of 21 December 
2010. OHCHR continues to facilitate the Council&#8217;s initiative, led by its cross-regional 
governmental Platform for Human Rights Education and Training, to develop a United 
Nations declaration on human rights education and training. 
</p>
<p>25. OHCHR also facilitated the organization of the 2010 Social Forum, with the report 
(A/HRC/16/62) available for this session of the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>26. With OHCHR support, treaty bodies held a number of days of general discussions 
with a view to developing general comments: the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights discussed the right to sexual and reproductive health, and the Committee on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities discussed accessibility. Within the context of the 
twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families, the related Committee discussed &#8220;Protecting 
rights, building cooperation&#8221;.  The Human Rights Committee developed further a first draft 
of a general comment on the interpretation of articles 19 and 20 of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women adopted general recommendations on older women and 
protection of their human rights and on the core obligations of States parties under article 2 
of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. On 2 
December 2010, the Committee on Migrant Workers adopted its first general comment, 
focusing on the rights of migrant domestic workers. Some 120 decisions on individual 
communications were adopted in 2010 by five of the Committees which have an individual 
communications procedure, which furthered jurisprudence in this regard.  
</p>
<p>27. Special procedures have also continued to contribute to the development of 
international human rights law. The work of the independent expert on water and sanitation 
in clarifying the legal content of the human rights obligations related to access to safe 
drinking water and sanitation directly contributed to the recognition of this right by the 
General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. The Working Group on Enforced or 
Involuntary Disappearances adopted a general comment on enforced disappearance as a 
continuous crime and a general comment on the right to the truth in relation to enforced 
disappearances.  OHCHR also provided support to the efforts of the Special Representative 
of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and 
other business enterprises to develop Guiding Principles for the implementation of the 
&#8220;Protect, Respect, Remedy&#8221; framework for business and human rights. OHCHR continued 
to work with the United Nations Global Compact Office and provided ongoing technical 
and policy advice on the human rights component of the Global Compact, including 
through participation in its Human Rights Working Group and the Compact inter-agency 
group, and through my participation in the Global Compact&#8217;s Leaders Summit. 
</p>
<p>28. In 2010, the Office commenced work on the holding of four regional workshops on 
the prohibition of incitement to hatred. Four consultants have prepared regional studies on 
relevant legislation, jurisprudence and policies and contributions from Member States, 
United Nations programmes and agencies, regional organizations, national human rights 
institutions and civil society were sought. The workshops are to be held in 2011 at United 
Nations Offices in Vienna (February), Nairobi (April), Bangkok (July) and Santiago 
(October). </p>


<p><b> B. Countering discrimination, in particular racial discrimination, 
discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion and against others who 
are marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Racial discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>29. In order to help States fulfil their commitments under the Durban Declaration and 
Programme of Action (DDPA), the Outcome Document of the Durban Review Conference 
and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, 
my Office provided technical assistance in the elaboration of national action plans against 
racial discrimination in Bolivia and Uruguay. OHCHR also organized seminars in Costa 
Rica and Benin to exchange good practices on national action plans against racial 
discrimination. Regional workshops, including most recently in Ethiopia, have been held 
for Governments, NHRIs and civil society on development and implementation of national 
action plans against racial discrimination. To further assist States, OHCHR will develop a 
technical guidance note for the development of national action plans.  
</p>
<p>30. OHCHR has also pursued thematic work on challenging issues such as data 
collection and the promotion of racial equality and structural discrimination. OHCHR 
organized a regional seminar for Latin American and Caribbean countries on data 
collection and the use of indicators to promote and monitor racial equality and non-
discrimination, with the collaboration of the Government of Brazil.  
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR supported the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent and 
the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the DDPA in 
organizing thematic discussions on combating structural discrimination. It adopted 
conclusions and recommendations on the issues of migration, protection of children, 
employment, on the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the DDPA and 
national action plans. During its last session, the Working Group of Experts on People of 
African Descent discussed a programme of activities in the context of the International 
Year for People of African Descent, which was launched by the Secretary General on the 
2010 Human Rights Day. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination is to 
hold a day of general discussion on people of African descent during its seventy-eighth 
session in February-March 2011. 
</p>
<p>32. As part of the global information campaign <i>Embrace Diversity, End Discrimination</i> 
on Human Rights Day, events were organized. The International Day for the Elimination of 
Racial Discrimination focused on the theme of racism in sports and an opinion piece 
entitled &#8220;Racism and the football World Cup&#8221; attracted specific attention. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Indigenous and minority issues 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Office continued to deploy strong efforts to promote and protect the rights of 
minorities through sustained engagement with relevant partners, guided by the United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious 
and Linguistic Minorities. For example, in Lebanon OHCHR organized its third regional 
consultation to gather information about effective practices in policing and minority 
communities.  My Office also delivered a training workshop on minority rights for our staff 
in the region to help strengthen strategies to better promote minority rights. 
</p>
<p>34. OHCHR continued to support the Forum on Minority Issues. My Office helped 
organize, in partnership with the Inter-Parliamentary Union, an international conference on 
the representation of minorities and indigenous peoples in Parliaments, held in November 
in Mexico. </p>


<p>35. We continued to promote cooperation and coordination within the United Nations 
system and between the three mandates devoted to indigenous issues. In support of the 
Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, OHCHR organized a workshop 
and other activities to facilitate the preparation of its study on indigenous peoples and the 
right to participate in decision-making. 
</p>
<p>36. Support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
continues to widen, with the recent endorsement by Canada and New Zealand. OHCHR 
organized activities aimed at enhancing the implementation of this key instrument, 
including a regional consultation held in December in Auckland on &#8220;The operationalization 
of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples by national human 
rights institutions&#8221;. This contributed to the elaboration of a practical manual for NHRIs on 
how to use the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>37. OHCHR also continued to offer a Fellowship Programme for minority and 
indigenous human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Gender equality and women&#8217;s human rights 
</b></p>
<p>38. My Office prepared a report to the Human Rights Council on discrimination against 
women (A/HRC/15/40), which informed the discussion leading to the adoption of a 
resolution by the Council at its fifteenth session establishing a special mechanism in the 
form of a Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice. 
</p>
<p>39. My report on &#8220;Preventable maternal mortality and morbidity and human rights&#8221; 
(A/HRC/14/39) demonstrated how a human rights-based approach is necessary to achieve 
the MDGs, including the goal on maternal health. Since then, the Council has requested 
OHCHR to prepare a second report on effective human rights-based practices in this area.   
</p>
<p>40. In August 2010, I convened a high-level panel6 to hear directly from and engage in a 
dialogue with victims of sexual violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
regarding their needs and their perceptions of remedies and reparations available to them. 
The panel was also to make recommendations as to additional mechanisms that might be 
established, particularly to provide access to remedies for victims whose perpetrators are 
not known and whose claims therefore cannot be pursued through the formal justice 
system. From 30 September to 10 October, the panel travelled in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo and met in closed session individually or in groups with 61 victims ranging 
from 3 to 61 years of age, including four male victims. 
</p>
<p>41. In November 2010, coinciding with the International Day to Eliminate Violence 
against Women,7 OHCHR organized an expert workshop on the elimination of violence 
bringing together experts from different regions of the world to identify challenges, good 
practices and opportunities.8  
</p>
<p>  
 6 The Panel was chaired by the Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights, and comprised of 
</p>
<p>Elisabeth Rehn, former Minister of Defence of Finland and currently Chair of the Board of Directors 
of the International Criminal Court Trust Fund for Victims, and Dr. Denis Mukwege, Medical 
Director of Panzi Hospital in Bukavu (South Kivu), Democratic Republic of the Congo.  
</p>
<p> 7 Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 11/2 
 8 A summary report will be presented to the Council at its seventeenth session and the findings of the 
</p>
<p>workshop will also feed into the OHCHR report on good practices in preventing violence against 
women to be presented to the Council at that same session. </p>


<p><b> 4. Discrimination against persons with disabilities, older persons, and persons affected 
by leprosy and HIV/AIDS  
</b></p>
<p>42. The Council has before it my third Thematic Study on the Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities (A/HRC/16/38), which this year focuses on international 
cooperation. OHCHR analysed the duties of States parties to cooperate internationally and 
compiled examples of experience in this field.  Bringing about the change envisaged in the 
Convention requires mainstreaming disability rights effectively into broader international 
cooperation, including both development and humanitarian assistance. 
</p>
<p>43. OHCHR has stepped up its advocacy for the protection of the human rights of older 
persons.  OHCHR and the Department of Economic and Social Affairs organized an Expert 
Group Meeting on the human rights of older persons in Geneva, in May 2010. OHCHR 
also contributed to the report of the Secretary-General entitled &#8220;Follow-up to the Second 
World Assembly on Ageing to the 2010 General Assembly Comprehensive Overview&#8221; 
(A/65/157) on the social situation, well-being, development and human rights of older 
persons at the national and regional levels. The report of the independent expert on the 
question of human rights and extreme poverty to the HRC on social pensions and older 
persons (A/HRC/14/31); and the general recommendation No. 27 of the Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women on older women and protection of their 
human rights have also benefited from my Office&#8217;s support.  
</p>
<p>44. In the area of HIV/AIDS and human rights, I have continued to advocate for the 
elimination of discrimination and stigmatization, the persistence of which has impacted 
negatively on human rights and undermined national HIV responses. Key activities 
included a regional workshop in Bangkok on HIV/AIDS and human rights for national 
institutions in Asia and the Pacific. The conclusions of this and related regional workshops 
were presented at a special session on HIV and human rights during the March 2010 
meeting of the International Coordinating Committee of the National Human Rights 
Institutions. OHCHR assisted in the production and dissemination of a revised version of 
the joint OHCHR/WHO/UNAIDS HIV cartoon entitled &#8220;Stand up for your human rights.&#8221; 
OHCHR also organized a consultation in Geneva on &#8220;the promotion and protection of 
human rights in the context of HIV and AIDS&#8221;.9 
</p>
<p><b> C. Pursuing economic, social and cultural rights and combating 
inequalities and poverty, including in the context of the economic, food 
and climate crises 
</b></p>
<p>45. OHCHR has pursued the promotion of economic, social and cultural rights and 
continued strengthening its capacity to contribute to the protection and monitoring of these 
rights at national and international level, including through its cooperation with WHO, 
FAO, UNESCO, UN-Habitat and others. OHCHR has developed tools and training 
materials, and trained its staff on strategies and skills to monitor implementation of 
economic, social and cultural rights. OHCHR staff undertook over 20 missions to offer 
assistance and support to Governments, parliaments, United Nations country teams, field 
presences and civil society on rights such as the right to the highest attainable standard of 
physical and mental health, adequate housing, adequate food, education, social security, 
cultural rights and on the legal protection and justiciability of economic, social and cultural 
rights.  
</p>
<p>  
 9 Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/27 and the report of which is before the sixteenth 
</p>
<p>session of the Council. </p>


<p>46. In relation to the global food crisis, OHCHR actively participated in the Secretary-
General&#8217;s High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis and contributed to the 
update of the Comprehensive Framework for Action for United Nations agencies and 
Bretton Woods Institutes by integrating the right to food and a human rights-based 
approach as one of the strategic entry points to address world food and nutrition security.  
</p>
<p>47. OHCHR also continued to advocate for bringing the human rights dimension to the 
centre of the climate-change debate,<b> </b>highlighting that climate change-related effects are felt 
not only by States and economies, but also &#8211; and more fundamentally &#8211; by individuals and 
communities. A human rights-based approach demands the participation of affected 
communities, attention to non-discrimination, and accountability of all duty-bearers to the 
rights-holders who experience the consequences of policies and practices. The importance 
of considering the human rights implications of climate change-related effects has been 
emphasized by my Office through a number of public statements, including during the 
sixteenth Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change, held in Cancun, Mexico, in December 2010. 
</p>
<p>48. OHCHR organized a consultation on land and human rights in November as an 
emerging issue. The outcome of this consultation will guide our work in the coming years. 
In addition, OHCHR published three new fact sheets: on the right to adequate food, with 
FAO; on the right to water, with WHO and UN- Habitat, and on the right to adequate 
housing with UN-Habitat. Since 2009, OHCHR issues an ESCR Bulletin for internal 
circulation and in October 2010, OHCHR launched a public edition for external partners, to 
inform on the work of the Office on these rights and provide useful materials, tools and 
case law.  
</p>
<p>49. Consistent with Member States&#8217; commitments in the 2005 World Summit Outcome 
and 2010 Millennium Development Goals Summit Outcome, OHCHR has been leading 
interagency efforts under the United Nations Development Group (UNDG) to further 
integrate human rights in United Nations operational activities for development and to 
strengthen policy coherence, coordination and capacity in the United Nations system to 
better respond to national priorities.. Such a holistic approach to the United Nations mission 
would help to bring together the three pillars of the United Nations work, in line with 
relevant intergovernmental agreements, and uphold the indivisibility of human rights 
including the right to development.  
</p>
<p>50. OHCHR contributed to the preparatory processes of the High-Level Plenary 
Meeting on the Millennium Development Goals in New York, which supported Member 
States&#8217; in achieving the inclusive catalogue of human rights commitments in the Summit 
Outcome document. The commitments covered a wide range of issues affecting duty-
bearers at all levels, including in relation to maternal mortality and morbidity, the rights to 
food and health, the right to development and the important action agenda on trade, aid and 
debt relief. At the Summit itself, I was honored to participate in and address Roundtable 
Five on &#8216;addressing the special needs of the most vulnerable&#8217;, as well as side events on 
maternal mortality and smarter global partnerships under Goal 8. 
</p>
<p>51. In the lead-up to the Summit, OHCHR contributed substantively to 
intergovernmental discussions, research and policy work on the MDGs, through convening 
an expert seminar in March 2010, extending strengthened support to special procedure 
mandate holders on MDG issues within their mandates, and increased engagement with and 
contributions to the UNDG MDG Task Force&#8217;s preparatory work and thematic reports on 
MDGs. Supporting States in the implementation of their Summit commitments, and 
strengthening partnerships between human rights and development actors, will be important 
priorities in the future. </p>


<p>52. As one example, OHCHR has been working with WHO to develop a policy 
assessment tool on &#8220;Human rights and gender equality in health sector strategies - How to 
assess policy coherence&#8221;, which will be finalized during the first quarter of 2011. Building 
upon rights-based budget monitoring work carried out in Haiti and Liberia in 2009, 
OHCHR is also developing a learning package on budget processes and human rights, to 
provide more effective support to Member States and national partners in their efforts to 
integrate human rights in their national development and poverty reduction strategies and is 
currently supporting a number of Governments, at their request, to integrate human rights 
into national development processes. Inspired by these examples, during the course of my 
Roundtable Five intervention at the MDGs Summit, I offered the support of OHCHR to all 
Member States willing to show their leadership in integrating human rights within their 
national development plans.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Human rights in the context of migration 
</b></p>
<p>53. In the second half of 2010, I chaired the Global Migration Group (GMG), a 
collective of 14 United Nations agencies, the International Organization for Migration and 
the World Bank. Through leadership of the GMG, OHCHR promoted a human rights-based 
approach to migration within the United Nations system and beyond, thus contributing to 
the international community&#8217;s increased responsiveness to migrants&#8217; rights.  
</p>
<p>54. Under OHCHR chairpersonship, the focus of GMG on the human rights of migrants, 
particularly those in an irregular situation, led to increased awareness of migrants&#8217; rights 
among senior Government representatives and the public at large. A case in point is the 
landmark joint statement on the human rights of irregular migrants adopted by the GMG 
Principals on 30 September 2010. A full-day GMG experts meeting on the same subject 
organized by OHCHR in October also generated policy recommendations that were widely 
disseminated.  
</p>
<p>55. The Office highlighted key migration and human rights themes at the regional and 
international levels, notably at the WHO, IOM and the Government of Spain&#8217;s Global 
Consultation on Migrants&#8217; Health, held in Madrid in March 2010, as well as at the fourth 
Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) held in Mexico in November 2010. 
</p>
<p>56. There, I drew attention to human rights and the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families throughout 
the Forum. A side event was organized to mark the twentieth anniversary of the 
Convention, at which I advocated for ratification and concerted efforts at implementation. 
Commemorative events to mark the twentieth anniversary of the Convention on 18 
December 2010 took place in various parts of the world. 
</p>
<p>57. The Office has continued to support compliance of migration policies, legislation 
and measures with international human rights standards, through its support to various 
human rights mechanisms, such as the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants 
and the universal periodic review, as well as the Committee on Migrant Workers.  It is my 
view, shared by all the GMG Principals in our joint statement, that, although States have 
legitimate interests in securing their borders and exercising immigration controls, such 
concerns do not trump the obligations of the State to respect the internationally guaranteed 
rights of all persons, to protect those rights against abuses and to fulfil the rights necessary 
for them to enjoy a life of dignity and security. 
</p>
<p>58. The Office has begun a project to develop a set of training modules to support a 
human rights-based approach to migration., aimed at ensuring that migrants enjoy human 
rights without  discrimination.  </p>


<p>59. OHCHR country and regional offices have played a key role in advocating for the 
human rights of migrants and the ratification of the Convention, have contributed to a draft 
instrument on decent work for domestic workers by the International Labour Organization 
(ILO), and to the development of a unified contract for migrant domestic workers to 
address the plight of many migrants in Lebanon who constitute a significant proportion of 
the labour force, but who did not enjoy the same rights as nationals in comparable 
occupations. OHCHR regional offices have also worked to foster subregional collaboration 
in protecting migrants&#8217; rights and combating trafficking in persons. Seminars, meetings and 
dialogues on migration and human rights were held in several regions.  
</p>
<p>60. Migrants, especially those in an irregular situation, are easy prey to traffickers. 
OHCHR worked to advance rights-based responses to trafficking in persons, including 
through publishing the <i>Commentary on the Recommended Principles and Guidelines on 
Human Rights and Human Trafficking. </i>It aims to elaborate the substantive content of the 
international law on trafficking and provides a comprehensive analysis of the Principles and 
Guidelines, in addition to serving as a practical tool on the rights-based approach to 
addressing trafficking in persons. In May 2010, OHCHR organized an expert seminar for 
members of the HRC, seeking to identify opportunities and challenges in developing human 
rights-based responses to trafficking and promoting the application of the Recommended 
Principles and a Council plenary panel also gave voice to victims and survivors of 
trafficking. 
</p>
<p>61. OHCHR will take over the rotating chair of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group 
against Trafficking in Persons for 2011. In this capacity, OHCHR will organize activities to 
raise awareness on issues related to human trafficking, in addition to furthering inter-
agency coordination and cooperation. It will conduct several national and regional human 
rights capacity-building activities for law enforcement officials. </p>
<p><b> E. Combating impunity and strengthening accountability, the rule of law 
and democratic society 
</b></p>
<p>62. OHCHR led the process of elaboration of the &#8220;Guidance Note of the Secretary-
General on United Nations Approach to Transitional Justice&#8221;, which provides a right-based 
perspective on transitional justice and offers three approaches for further strengthening of 
United Nations activities in this area, including: (a) striving to take into account the root 
causes of conflict or repressive rule, and addressing the related violations of all rights, 
including economic, social and cultural rights; (b) taking human rights and transitional 
justice considerations into account during peace processes; and (c) coordinating 
disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) initiatives with transitional justice 
processes and mechanisms in a positively reinforcing manner.   
</p>
<p>63. OHCHR organized the Expert Workshop on Experiences of Transitional Justice 
Processes in Dealing with Violations of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in October 
</p><p>2010. In March 2010, OHCHR assisted in convening the Council&#8217;s panel discussion on the 
right to the truth.10 The right to the truth for victims of human rights violations and their 
families has continued to evolve as a legal concept and panelists saw its development as a 
fundamental element in combating impunity.  
</p>
<p>64. In December2010, OHCHR organized the Expert Workshop on Maximizing 
Opportunities for Coordination between DDR and Transitional Justice to map and assess 
selected experiences of DDR initiatives as they relate to transitional justice processes, to 
</p>
<p>  
 10 Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 9/11. </p>


<p>identify lessons learned, and to discuss and analyse the prospects for coordination in order 
to develop deeper understanding of how the two processes could positively reinforce each 
other. 
</p>
<p>65. In addition, OHCHR has provided advice and assistance on accountability and 
transitional justice issues. In Burundi, OHCHR supported the successful conduct and 
completion of national consultations on transitional justice in April 2010. In Togo, OHCHR 
provided advice on the design of national consultations and the subsequently established 
truth commission, as well as training and capacity-building for commissioners. Other 
activities were carried out with respect to Colombia, Darfur, the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, Guatemala, Kosovo, Moldova, Nepal, Senegal, Somalia, Timor Leste and Uganda. 
</p>
<p>66. OHCHR continued its work on the protection of witnesses and victims involved in 
judicial as well as quasi or non-judicial proceedings to ensure accountability. In particular, 
OHCHR provided technical support for the development of frameworks for witness and 
victim protection in Argentina, Nepal, Togo and Uganda. Furthermore, based on the 
framework for the protection of witnesses and victims presented in my report on the right to 
truth to the Council (A/HRC/15/33), OHCHR  held two meetings in 2010: a high-level 
expert seminar in Uganda organized in partnership with the Ugandan Law Reform 
Commission and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in November and a 
regional seminar in Nepal in December 2010, with the participation of stakeholders from 
seven countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka).  
</p>
<p>67. An expert meeting was organized on the right of peoples to peace,11 to examine the 
relationship between peace and human rights, and another expert meeting12 was organized 
in March 2010 to discuss the experience of various human rights mechanisms in the 
implementation of human rights in situations of armed conflict. OHCHR organized an 
expert meeting on human rights and traditional justice in December in South Africa.    
</p>
<p>68. In September 2010 OHCHR organized a subregional training seminar on human 
rights and elections, in cooperation with the Senate and National Assembly of Gabon and 
the Network of Central African Parliamentarians of the Economic Community of Central 
African States, for parliamentarians from seven Central African countries. A human rights 
seminar was jointly organized with United Nations Mission in Liberia in November 2010 
for members of parliaments and NHRIs from six African countries (Nigeria, Gambia, 
Liberia, Uganda, Sierra Leone and the United Republic of Tanzania).  
</p>
<p>69. The establishment of professional, human rights compliant and accountable security 
agencies, armed forces, police and law enforcement agencies, whether in post conflict, 
early recovery and development contexts, is central. OHCHR is committed to ensuring that 
such initiatives are grounded in international human rights law and to ensure that all 
individuals can fully enjoy conditions of security in which to realize their human rights. 
The work of the Office on legal, policy and practical issues related to the security sector 
includes monitoring and reporting, advising on and advocating for reform where needed, as 
well as capacity-building and training. In some situations, sustainable protection of civilians 
will require vetting of security forces as part of broader reform efforts. In inter-agency 
processes, OHCHR is also undertaking a mapping of existing activities of OHCHR field 
presences in this area, which will enable headquarters and field presences to more 
effectively engage with security sector reform processes.  
</p>
<p>70. Human rights education is also essential to combating impunity and strengthen 
accountability, the rule of law and democratic society. My Office has implemented human 
</p>
<p>  
 11 Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 11/4. 
 12 Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 12/5. </p>


<p>rights education and training programmes, developed related tools and provides assistance 
to Governments, institutions and civil society.13 OHCHR has continued to develop effective 
human rights education and training methodologies based on best practices. OHCHR 
finalized &#8220;Evaluating Human Rights Training Activities: A Handbook for Human Rights 
Educators&#8221;, a forthcoming joint publication with EQUITAS - The International Centre for 
Human Rights Education. From 2008 to 2010, through the &#8220;Assisting Communities 
Together&#8221; Project, OHCHR supported 95 grassroots human rights education and training 
projects in 28 countries. 
</p>
<p>71. OHCHR also continued to coordinate the World Programme for Human Rights 
Education. In August, on behalf of the United Nations Inter-Agency Coordinating 
Committee on Human Rights Education in the School System, OHCHR submitted to the 
General Assembly the final evaluation report (A/65/322) of the first phase of the 
Programme (2005&#8211;2009), which focused on human rights education in the school system.  
</p>
<p>72. In July, OHCHR submitted to the Council the draft plan of action (A/HRC/15/28) 
for the second phase (2010&#8211;2014), focusing on human rights in higher education and on 
human rights training for teachers and educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials 
and military personnel, which was adopted by the Council in September in resolution 
15/11. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Human rights in situations of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Human rights, peace and security 
</b></p>
<p>73. OHCHR has continued to work in close cooperation with the Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), the Department of Political Affairs and the Department 
of Field Support (DFS) to strengthen the integration of human rights in the United Nations 
peace and security agenda, including through the development of policies and operational 
guidance for peacekeeping and special political missions, active participation in mission 
planning, as well as substantive and operational support through human rights components 
of peace missions. In the 17 peacekeeping and special political missions with human rights 
components, OHCHR provides substantive and human resources support, including policy 
and planning related advice from headquarters, ensuring the quality of human rights 
specialists serving in or applying to missions, professional training to human rights staff.  
</p>
<p>74. OHCHR was involved in efforts to enhance the implementation of Security Council 
mandates for the protection of civilians. As I have emphasized in my July and November 
addresses to the Security Council, effective human rights monitoring and reporting are 
central to the protection of civilians in order to prevent the commission of violations and to 
ensure accountability for violations. OHCHR contributed to the DPKO/DFS Operational 
Concept for the Protection of Civilians in United Nations Peacekeeping Operations, and to 
the development of a framework for mission-wide strategies for the protection of civilians. 
Globally, OHCHR is also contributing to a broader inter-agency review of United Nations 
experiences of providing support to non-United Nations security forces, with the aim to 
ensure that it is based on respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. In 
the Democratic Republic of Congo, OHCHR played an essential role in devising a full 
range of measures to adhere to the Security Council&#8217;s request that United Nations 
Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) 
support to military operations of the Congolese army be strictly conditioned on compliance 
with international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law. OHCHR is also actively 
</p>
<p>  
 13 More information is available from www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/education/training/index.htm. </p>


<p>engaged in United Nations efforts to better protect women and children from sexual 
violence in conflicts. In addition to monitoring, investigation and reporting in the field to 
protect women from sexual violence and ensure accountability where it occurs, OHCHR 
has actively participated in the implementation of Security Council resolution 1888 (2009) 
through the recruitment of a human rights officer to be a member of the team of experts, 
and looking at the possible inclusion of woman protection advisers within human rights 
components of peace missions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Rapid response capacity 
</b></p>
<p>75. The OHCHR Rapid Response Unit has continued to support and contribute to short-
term missions, fact-finding missions and commissions of inquiry aimed at ensuring 
accountability and providing technical advice in the aftermath of crises as well as in the 
implementation of resolutions of the Council in this area.  
</p>
<p>76. In the immediate aftermath of emergencies, OHCHR supported field presences 
through the deployment of temporary surge capacity missions. In January 2010, OHCHR 
developed a comprehensive strategy to support the Human Rights Section of the United 
Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to respond to the protection crisis that 
erupted as a result of the earthquake in Haiti. A total of 15 staff were deployed over a 
period of six months to monitor the human rights situation in camps for internally displaced 
persons and to lead the Protection Cluster. In February 2010, as a result of the deteriorating 
human rights situation in Togo, OHCHR deployed a team of three human rights officers 
and one logistician to assist the field office to monitor the human rights situation and 
enhance national capacity for monitoring human rights in the context of the presidential 
election. In response to the outbreak of violence in the south of Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, 
OHCHR deployed eight staff in the immediate aftermath of the crisis to monitor the human 
rights situation in the area. In this context, OHCHR has been leading the Protection 
Cluster&#8217;s Human Rights Sub-Group in the South of Kyrgyzstan.  
</p>
<p>77. In July 2010, OHCHR provided operational and technical support to the Committee 
of independent experts established by Council resolution 13/9 &#8220;to monitor and assess any 
domestic, legal or other proceedings undertaken by both the Government of Israel and the 
Palestinian side, in the light of General Assembly resolution 64/254, including the 
independence, effectiveness, genuineness of these investigations and their conformity with 
international standards&#8221;. OHCHR subsequently appointed a secretariat to support the 
Committee. The final report of the Committee was submitted to the Council&#8217;s fifteenth 
session on 23 September 2010. 
</p>
<p>78. From June to September 2010, the Rapid Response Unit provided the same type of 
operational and technical assistance to the independent, international fact-finding mission 
established by the Council resolution 14/1. OHCHR established a secretariat to support the 
fact-finding mission. The final report of the fact-finding mission was submitted to the 
Council&#8217;s fifteenth session on 27 September 2010. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. OHCHR and humanitarian action 
</b></p>
<p>79. Mainstreaming human rights in humanitarian action is central to the OHCHR 
mandate &#8212; promoting and protecting the effective enjoyment by all of all civil, cultural, 
economic, political and social rights, in situations of armed conflict, violence and insecurity 
including in the context of natural disasters. Key to this is the Office&#8217;s engagement with 
humanitarian partners and, in particular, with United Nations agencies in view of its role to 
coordinate the human rights promotion and protection activities throughout the United 
Nations system.  </p>


<p>80. OHCHR continued to work closely with humanitarian partners at all levels of 
different humanitarian processes, notably as a standing invitee to the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee (IASC). OHCHR is an active member of the IASC Sub-Working Group on 
Preparedness and contributes to the latter&#8217;s four-monthly &#8220;IASC Early-Warning Early-
Action&#8221; report. OHCHR monitoring, reporting and advocacy has been used to highlight 
deteriorating human rights situations and emerging crises to enable preventive measures to 
be taken by country teams, agencies and non United Nations partners. OHCHR is in this 
way supporting partners through analysis and recommendations of strategic options to 
mitigate emerging situations in for example Guinea, Kyrgyzstan and the Sudan. 
</p>
<p>81. In addition, the Office supports the Humanitarian Reform Process led by the Office 
for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, in particular in the context of the 
Humanitarian Coordination Strengthening Project and the Cluster Approach, especially the 
Protection Cluster. OHCHR is a core member of the Global Protection Cluster Working 
Group and its various task forces including on natural disasters and learning. The Office 
also sits in the Steering Committee of the Protection Standby Capacity Project (ProCap), an 
inter-agency standby roster of protection officers that provides support to United Nations 
agencies in their protection response to crises.  
</p>
<p>82. Within the context of the cluster approach, the Office leads Protection Clusters in Haiti, Nepal, the occupied Palestinian territory and the Pacific region, and plays a key 
supporting role in other countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Uganda.  
</p>
<p>83. In order to enhance the expertise and capacity of OHCHR to deploy staff on 
humanitarian assignments, a number of staff participated in an OHCHR pilot training 
course on human rights and humanitarian action.   
</p>
<p><b> III. Conclusion  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The year 2011 marks a number of anniversaries, such as the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the Declaration on the Right to Development and the tenth anniversary 
of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action. The year 2011 is also the 
International Year for People of African Descent and marks the conclusion of the 
Human Rights Council review and first cycle of UPR, setting the stage for the second 
cycle focusing on implementation of previous recommendations. In 2011, I will be 
submitting a compilation of recommendations for the strengthening of the treaty body 
system. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>By definition, human rights work is a collective effort in a historic movement 
and strategic priorities are long term. The year 2011 will include a number of 
landmarks on which we will build to deepen our engagement in the six priority areas 
of our work. They will remain our priorities for the biennium 2012-2013. We will do 
so against the background of an untenable financial situation stemming from the gap 
between increased requests for mandated activities, zero growth of the regular budget 
and shrinking extrabudgetary resources.
