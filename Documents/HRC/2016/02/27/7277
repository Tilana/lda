<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 23 July 2014, the Human Rights Council, by resolution S-21/1, decided to 
</p>
<p>urgently dispatch an independent, international commission of inquiry to investigate all 
</p>
<p>violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, particularly in the occupied Gaza 
</p>
<p>Strip, in the context of the military operations conducted since 13 June 2014, whether 
</p>
<p>before, during or after. Pursuant to resolution S-21/1, the President of the Council 
</p>
<p>appointed three experts to the commission: William Schabas (Chair), Mary McGowan 
</p>
<p>Davis and Doudou Di&#232;ne.  
</p>
<p>2. The commission formally began its work on 16 September 2014. Following the 
</p>
<p>resignation of Professor Schabas on 2 February 2015, the President of the Council 
</p>
<p>designated Justice Davis as Chair. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner 
</p>
<p>for Human Rights (OHCHR) established a secretariat to support the commission. 
</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the urgency expressed by the Council to dispatch the commission, the 
</p>
<p>secretariat was not fully constituted until the end of November 2014.  
</p>
<p>3. The commission repeatedly requested Israel to cooperate, including by granting it 
</p>
<p>access to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including the West Bank, East 
</p>
<p>Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip (see annex I). Regrettably, Israel did not respond to these 
</p>
<p>requests. Subsequently, the commission learned from a press release1 that no such 
</p>
<p>cooperation would be forthcoming. The Government of Egypt, when requested to facilitate 
</p>
<p>entry into the Gaza Strip through the Rafah crossing, responded that it was not possible 
</p>
<p>owing to the prevailing security situation. The commission thanks the Government of 
</p>
<p>Jordan for facilitating its two visits to Amman.  
</p>
<p>4. The commission received full cooperation from the State of Palestine, including the 
</p>
<p>Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United Nations Office at 
</p>
<p>Geneva. It met with representatives of Palestinian ministries in Amman, who provided a 
</p>
<p>range of documents. The commission also spoke to members of the authorities in Gaza, 
</p>
<p>who submitted several reports.  
</p>
<p>5. The commission addressed to the Government of Israel and the Government of the 
</p>
<p>State of Palestine a list of questions relating to specific incidents and legal and policy 
</p>
<p>issues. A comparable list was sent to Hamas. Only the State of Palestine responded. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Mandate and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>6. The commission interpreted its mandate as requiring it to examine alleged violations 
</p>
<p>of international human rights and humanitarian law occurring between 13 June and 
</p>
<p>26 August 2014 across the Occupied Palestinian Territory, in particular in Gaza, and in 
</p>
<p>Israel, and to determine whether such violations had been committed. It examined existing 
</p>
<p>accountability mechanisms and their effectiveness, and the immediate and continuing 
</p>
<p>impact of the military operations on the affected populations and their enjoyment of human 
</p>
<p>rights. The commission considered that the victims and their human rights were at the core 
</p>
<p>of its mandate. Its activities were thus informed by the wish to ensure that the voices of all 
</p>
<p>victims are heard, and that the commission&#8217;s recommendations will strengthen the 
</p>
<p>protection of the civilian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and in Israel.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, &#8220;Israel will not cooperate with UNHRC investigative committee&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>press release, 13 November 2014. </p>


<p>7. The commission is grateful to the many victims and witnesses who shared their 
</p>
<p>experiences and other relevant information. The fact that, despite its repeated requests, the 
</p>
<p>commission was not granted access to the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel posed a 
</p>
<p>challenge for conducting interviews in person with victims and witnesses and made 
</p>
<p>viewing the sites where violations were alleged to have been committed impossible. Owing 
</p>
<p>to the restrictions on movement preventing victims and witnesses from leaving Gaza, the 
</p>
<p>commission obtained first-hand testimony by means of interviews conducted via Skype, 
</p>
<p>videoconference and telephone. It conducted confidential interviews with victims and 
</p>
<p>witnesses from the West Bank in Jordan (in November 2014 and January 2015) and with 
</p>
<p>victims and witnesses from Israel in Geneva (in January 2015).  
</p>
<p>8. The commission and its secretariat conducted more than 280 interviews with victims 
</p>
<p>and witnesses and received more than 500 written submissions and other documentation 
</p>
<p>from a wide range of sources (see annexes II and III). It reviewed information publicly 
</p>
<p>available, including on official websites of the Government of Israel. The commission used 
</p>
<p>all the information gathered in making its assessments while carefully considering the 
</p>
<p>credibility and reliability of sources. It gave particular weight to first-hand testimonies, 
</p>
<p>recognizing the limitations resulting from the fact that the interviews were conducted 
</p>
<p>remotely, the lapse in time since the incidents, and the possibility of reprisals. 
</p>
<p>9. Some sources requested that their submissions be treated confidentially for fear of 
</p>
<p>possible consequences of testifying before the commission, including for their safety. 
</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for protecting victims, witnesses and other persons cooperating with 
</p>
<p>the commission rests with their States of residence and nationality. The commission 
</p>
<p>appreciated the valuable contributions made to its work by OHCHR, United Nations 
</p>
<p>agencies and programmes, non-governmental organizations and experts.  
</p>
<p>10. Consistent with established practice, the commission employed a &#8220;reasonable 
</p>
<p>ground&#8221; standard of proof in its factual assessment of the incidents investigated and legal 
</p>
<p>analysis of the patterns found. Such a standard is lower than that required in criminal trials; 
</p>
<p>the commission therefore does not make any conclusions with regard to the responsibility 
</p>
<p>of specific individuals for alleged violations of international law.  
</p>
<p>11. Given its restricted access, its limited resources and the short time frame available 
</p>
<p>for its inquiry, the commission selected incidents on the basis of certain criteria, in 
</p>
<p>particular, the gravity of the allegations of violations of international humanitarian law and 
</p>
<p>international human rights law; their significance in demonstrating patterns of alleged 
</p>
<p>violations; access to victims, witnesses and supporting evidence; and the geographic 
</p>
<p>location of the incident.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>12. All parties to the conflict are bound by the relevant provisions and rules of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian and human rights treaty and customary law. The commission 
</p>
<p>considers that, in situations of armed conflict or occupation, international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>and international human rights law apply concurrently,2 and shares the position of United 
</p>
<p>Nations human rights treaty bodies and the International Court of Justice, according to 
</p>
<p>which Israel bears responsibility for implementing its human rights treaty obligations in the 
</p>
<p>Occupied Palestinian Territory.3 The State of Palestine is bound by the obligations 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the construction 
</p>
<p>of a wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, 9 July 2004, para. 106. 
</p>
<p> 3 Ibid., paras. 111&#8211;113. See also CCPR/C/ISR/CO/4, para. 5. </p>


<p>contained in the treaties to which it has acceded. The authorities in Gaza must respect and 
</p>
<p>ensure human rights norms because of their exercise of government-like functions.  
</p>
<p>13. A number of core principles of international humanitarian law govern the conduct of 
</p>
<p>hostilities. Firstly, the principle of distinction requires that parties to a conflict distinguish 
</p>
<p>between civilians and civilian objects on the one hand, and combatants4 and military 
</p>
<p>objectives on the other. Attacks may only be directed against the latter. Secondly, the 
</p>
<p>principle of proportionality prohibits attacks that are expected to cause incidental loss of 
</p>
<p>life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects, which would be excessive in relation 
</p>
<p>to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Thirdly, the principle of 
</p>
<p>precautions in attack requires all parties to take all feasible measures to avoid and in any 
</p>
<p>event to minimize incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians and damage to civilian 
</p>
<p>objects.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Context 
</b></p>
<p>14. The hostilities of 2014 erupted in the context of the protracted occupation of the 
</p>
<p>West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, and of the increasing number of 
</p>
<p>rocket attacks on Israel. In the preceding months, there were few, if any, political prospects 
</p>
<p>for reaching a solution to the conflict that would achieve peace and security for Palestinians 
</p>
<p>and Israelis and realize the right to self-determination of the Palestinian people.  
</p>
<p>15. The blockade of Gaza by Israel, fully implemented since 2007 and described by the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General as &#8220;a continuing collective penalty against the population in Gaza&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/45, para. 70), was strangling the economy in Gaza and imposed severe 
</p>
<p>restrictions on the rights of the Palestinians. Two previous rounds of hostilities in the Strip 
</p>
<p>since 2008 had not only led to loss of life and injury but also weakened an already fragile 
</p>
<p>infrastructure. Palestinians have demonstrated extraordinary resilience in recent years, 
</p>
<p>living in an environment scarred by physical destruction and psychological trauma. In the 
</p>
<p>West Bank, including East Jerusalem, settlement-related activities and settler violence 
</p>
<p>continued to be at the core of most of the human rights violations against Palestinians. In 
</p>
<p>the absence of any progress on the political front, the risk of a flare-up of the situation was 
</p>
<p>evident.  
</p>
<p>16. In the meantime, threats to the security of Israel remained all too real. Palestinian 
</p>
<p>armed groups increasingly launched rockets during June and July 2014. The discovery of 
</p>
<p>tunnels leading into Israel added to the sense of insecurity. According to one witness, 
</p>
<p>residents of her kibbutz experienced regular panic attacks after the discovery of a tunnel in 
</p>
<p>March 2014 and the explosion of an alleged tunnel exit on 8 July. Several other infiltration 
</p>
<p>attempts were thwarted by the army during July and August.   
</p>
<p>17. The events of summer 2014 were preceded by an agreement, reached on 23 April 
</p>
<p>2014 between the Palestinian Liberation Organization and Hamas, which sought to end 
</p>
<p>Palestinian divisions. On 2 June 2014, President Abbas declared the formation of a 
</p>
<p>Government of national consensus. The Government had yet to assume its full 
</p>
<p>responsibilities in Gaza when active hostilities broke out in the Strip in July 2014, thereby 
</p>
<p>leaving Hamas exercising government-like functions, as had been the case since June 2007.  
</p>
<p>18. On 12 June 2014, three Israeli teenagers were kidnapped and brutally murdered in 
</p>
<p>the West Bank. In response, Israel launched an extensive search and arrest operation, which 
</p>
<p>lasted until their bodies were found, on 30 June. On 2 July, a 16-year-old Palestinian 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 4 For the purposes of distinction, the term &#8220;combatants&#8221; includes members of the armed forces and of 
</p>
<p>organized armed groups with a continuous combat function.  </p>


<p>teenager from East Jerusalem was viciously murdered &#8211; burned alive &#8211; and his body 
</p>
<p>discovered in West Jerusalem in what appeared to be an act of revenge for the murdered 
</p>
<p>Israeli teenagers. Tensions in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, ran high, and were 
</p>
<p>further fuelled by a rise in extreme anti-Palestinian rhetoric. Widespread protests and 
</p>
<p>violent clashes ensued between Palestinians and the Israel Defense Forces. 
</p>
<p>19. On 7 July 2014, the Israel Defense Forces commenced operation &#8220;Protective Edge&#8221; 
</p>
<p>in the Gaza Strip, with the stated objective of stopping the rocket attacks by Hamas and 
</p>
<p>destroying its capabilities to conduct operations against Israel. After an initial phase 
</p>
<p>focused on airstrikes, on 17 July 2014, Israel launched a ground operation, which it 
</p>
<p>declared sought to degrade &#8220;terror organisations&#8217; military infrastructure, and [&#8230; neutralize] 
</p>
<p>their network of cross-border assault tunnels&#8221;.5 A third phase began on 5 August, and was 
</p>
<p>characterized by alternating ceasefires and ongoing air strikes. The operation concluded on 
</p>
<p>26 August, when both Israel and Palestinian armed groups adhered to an unconditional 
</p>
<p>ceasefire. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Principal findings and conclusions  
</b></p>
<p>20. Palestinians and Israelis were profoundly shaken by the events of the summer of 
</p>
<p>2014. In Gaza, in particular, the scale of the devastation was unprecedented. The death toll 
</p>
<p>alone speaks volumes: 2,251 Palestinians were killed, including 1,462 Palestinian civilians, 
</p>
<p>of whom 299 women and 551 children;6 and 11,231 Palestinians, including 3,540 women 
</p>
<p>and 3,436 children, were injured (A/HRC/28/80/Add.1, para. 24), of whom 10 per cent 
</p>
<p>suffered permanent disability as a result. While the casualty figures gathered by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations, Israel, the State of Palestine and non-governmental organizations differ, regardless 
</p>
<p>of the exact proportion of civilians to combatants, the high incidence of loss of human life 
</p>
<p>and injury in Gaza is heartbreaking.  
</p>
<p>21. The death of six civilians in Israel and 67 soldiers and the injury of up to 
</p>
<p>1,600 others were also the tragic result of the hostilities. According to official Israeli 
</p>
<p>sources, rockets and mortars hit civilian buildings and infrastructure, including schools and 
</p>
<p>houses, causing direct damage to civilian property amounting to almost $25 million.7The 
</p>
<p>hostilities caused immense distress and disruption to the lives of Israeli civilians, especially 
</p>
<p>those living in the southern regions. In addition to the constant threat of rocket and mortar 
</p>
<p>attacks, the Israelis interviewed by the commission expressed particular anxiety about the 
</p>
<p>new threat of assaults from tunnels penetrating into Israel. One Israeli woman said that &#8220;the 
</p>
<p>tunnels are scarier than the rockets because there&#8217;s no chance of being warned&#8221;. The sense 
</p>
<p>of panic among many Israelis was exacerbated by the short, often insufficient, time to 
</p>
<p>conduct effective emergency procedures.  
</p>
<p>22. In Gaza, as Palestinians struggled to find ways to save their own lives and those of 
</p>
<p>their families, they were confronted with intense attacks, with no way of knowing which 
</p>
<p>locations would be hit and which might be considered safe. People began to move from one 
</p>
<p>place to another, only to encounter attacks in the new neighbourhood, and they would have 
</p>
<p>to move on. Closed into the Strip, with no possibility to exit at times, 44 per cent of Gaza 
</p>

<p>was either a no-go area or the object of evacuation warnings.8<b> </b>These terrifying 
</p>
<p>circumstances created a sense of entrapment, of having &#8220;no safe place&#8221; to go. 
</p>
<p>23. Alongside the toll on civilian lives, there was enormous destruction of civilian 
</p>
<p>infrastructure in Gaza: 18,000 housing units were destroyed in whole or in part;9 much of 
</p>
<p>the electricity network and of the water and sanitation infrastructure were incapacitated; 
</p>
<p>and 73 medical facilities and many ambulances were damaged.10 Many Palestinians were 
</p>
<p>uprooted from their homes or temporary shelters multiple times; at the height of the 
</p>
<p>hostilities, the number of internally displaced persons reached 500,000, or 28 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>population. The effects of this devastation had a severe impact on the human rights of 
</p>
<p>Palestinians in Gaza that will be felt for generations to come. The West Bank, including 
</p>
<p>East Jerusalem, witnessed a period of heightened tensions and widespread human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, including the fundamental right to life, which were overshadowed by the tragic 
</p>
<p>events in Gaza.  
</p>
<p>24. The impact of the hostilities in Gaza cannot be assessed separately from the 
</p>
<p>blockade imposed by Israel. The blockade and the military operation have led to a 
</p>
<p>protection crisis and chronic, widespread and systematic violations of human rights, first 
</p>
<p>and foremost the rights to life and to security, but also to health, housing, education and 
</p>
<p>many others. According to international human rights law, Israel has obligations in relation 
</p>
<p>to these rights and must take concrete steps towards their full realization. In that context, 
</p>
<p>while fully aware of the need for Israel to address its security concerns, the commission 
</p>
<p>believes that the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, put in place with the assistance of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations to accelerate efforts to rebuild destroyed houses and infrastructure, is not a 
</p>
<p>substitute for a full and immediate lifting of the blockade.  
</p>
<p>25. Palestinian and Israeli children were savagely affected by the events. Children on 
</p>
<p>both sides suffered from bed-wetting, shaking at night, clinging to parents, nightmares and 
</p>
<p>increased levels of aggressiveness.11 In addition, according to the United Nations Children&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Fund, in Gaza, more than 1,500 children were orphaned.12 Anas &#8220;Bader&#8221; Qdeih, aged 7, 
</p>
<p>was seen pleading for help from people fleeing Khuza&#8217;a while holding his intestines, which 
</p>
<p>were coming out of his abdomen, &#8220;I don't want to die. Don&#8217;t leave me.&#8221; He died soon 
</p>
<p>afterwards, after his medical evacuation was delayed. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>26. In the section below, the commission summarizes its main findings and conclusions, 
</p>
<p>emphasizing the key characteristics of the hostilities of 2014. It focuses on areas that reflect 
</p>
<p>new patterns, notably attacks by Israel on residential buildings resulting in the death of 
</p>
<p>entire families; Israel&#8217;s ground operations, which levelled urban neighbourhoods; and 
</p>
<p>violations by Palestinian armed groups and authorities in Gaza, including their reliance on 
</p>
<p>attack tunnels. Other incidents &#8211; namely, attacks by Israel on United Nations shelters,

<p>medical facilities, ambulances, and other critical infrastructure &#8211; are considered less 
</p>
<p>thoroughly, because these patterns have been a recurring reality in this and prior conflicts.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Rocket, mortar and tunnel attacks against locations in Israel  
</b></p>
<p><b>  (a) Rocket and mortar attacks 
</b></p>
<p>27. Between 7 July and 26 August 2014, Palestinian armed groups fired 4,881 rockets 
</p>
<p>and 1,753 mortars towards Israel, killing six civilians and injuring as many as 1,600 people, 
</p>
<p>including 270 children. A mother from Israel described the situation experienced: &#8220;We have 
</p>
<p>45 seconds to run. You just have to wait and see if it&#8217;s going to fall on you.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>28. Owing to the lack of cooperation by Israel and its denial of access to its territory, the 
</p>
<p>commission faced difficulties in identifying victims who had been injured in rocket attacks 
</p>
<p>and was unable to examine individual cases in detail. The commission was, however, able 
</p>
<p>to speak with witnesses and victims of a number of mortar attacks, the cause of the majority 
</p>
<p>of Israeli civilian deaths.  
</p>
<p>29. On 22 August 2014, Daniel Tregerman, aged 4, was killed in his home at Kibbutz 
</p>
<p>Nahal Oz, about 2 km from Gaza. While he was playing, a siren sounded, followed by an 
</p>
<p>explosion three seconds later, when a mortar hit the family car and shrapnel struck Daniel. 
</p>
<p>Given the short time, he had been unable to reach the protected room with the rest of his 
</p>
<p>family.<b> </b>In another incident, on 26 August, Ze&#8217;ev Etzion and Shahar Melamed were killed 
</p>
<p>by a mortar. Gad Yarkoni suffered injuries to his legs, which were later amputated. He 
</p>
<p>informed the commission that the attack occurred as the three men were repairing 
</p>
<p>electricity lines damaged by Palestinian projectiles in Kibbutz Nirim. The Al-Qassam 
</p>
<p>Brigades announced that they had targeted Kibbutz Nirim and various other communities 
</p>
<p>with 107 mm mortars on the day of the attack.13  
</p>
<p>30. Palestinian armed groups released statements indicating that they intended to attack 
</p>
<p>Israeli civilians and population centres in Israel. In some instances, Palestinian armed 
</p>
<p>groups in Gaza reportedly attempted to warn civilians in Israel of imminent attacks. For 
</p>
<p>instance, on 20 August 2014, the Al-Qassam Brigades warned communities near Gaza to 
</p>
<p>avoid returning home or to remain inside shelters.14  
</p>
<p>31. While some Palestinian armed groups made efforts to direct projectiles, especially 
</p>
<p>mortars, at military objectives, in other cases they targeted villages near Gaza. The majority 
</p>
<p>of projectiles fired by Palestinian armed groups were rockets without guidance systems so 
</p>
<p>they could not be directed at specific military objectives. Many of the rockets were 
</p>
<p>launched in the direction of major cities, including Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Ashkelon, and 
</p>
<p>one landed in the vicinity of Ben Gurion airport.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Tunnels 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Israel Defense Forces found 32 tunnels, 14 of which extended beyond the Green 
</p>
<p>Line into Israel.15 The discovery of the tunnels and their use by Palestinian armed groups 
</p>
<p>during the hostilities caused great anxiety among Israelis fearing that the tunnels might be 
</p>
<p>used to attack civilians. One witness recalled, &#8220;When it&#8217;s quiet, we are even more afraid

<p>because we don&#8217;t know what things can come from the ground. Since April, everyone was 
</p>
<p>afraid and uncomfortable about the tunnels.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>33. The use of rockets in the possession of Palestinian armed groups, indiscriminate in 
</p>
<p>nature, and any targeted mortar attack against civilians constitute violations of international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, in particular of the fundamental principle of distinction, which may 
</p>
<p>amount to a war crime. The intent of some Palestinian armed groups to direct attacks 
</p>
<p>against civilians is demonstrated by statements indicating that their intended targets were 
</p>
<p>civilians or large population centres in Israel. While certain Palestinian armed actors cited 
</p>
<p>the limits of their military arsenals as a reason for failing to attack military targets precisely, 
</p>
<p>the military capacity of a party to the conflict is irrelevant to its obligation to respect the 
</p>
<p>prohibition against indiscriminate attacks. 
</p>
<p>34. The absence of any possible military advantage resulting from rockets that cannot be 
</p>
<p>directed at a military objective, coupled with statements by Palestinian armed groups, 
</p>
<p>strongly suggest that the primary purpose of the rocket attacks was to spread terror among 
</p>
<p>the civilian population, in violation of international humanitarian law.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Air strikes on residential buildings in Gaza 
</b></p>
<p>35. During the 51-day operation, the Israel Defense Forces carried out more than 
</p>
<p>6,000 air strikes in Gaza,16 many of which hit residential buildings. The Office for the 
</p>
<p>Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs found that at least 142 Palestinian families had three 
</p>
<p>or more members killed in the same incident, amounting to a total of 742 fatalities.17 
</p>
<p>Tawfik Abu Jama, a Gazan father of eight, recalled: &#8220;I was sitting with my family at the 
</p>
<p>table, ready to break the fast. Suddenly we were sucked into the ground. Later that evening, 
</p>
<p>I woke up in the hospital and was told my wife and children had died&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>36. The commission investigated 15 cases of strikes on residential buildings across 
</p>
<p>Gaza, in which a total of 216 people were killed, including 115 children and 50 women. On 
</p>
<p>the basis of all available information, including research by non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations,18 it identified patterns of strikes by Israeli forces on residential buildings and 
</p>
<p>analysed the applicable law in relation to individual incidents. 
</p>
<p>37. The commission found that the fact that precision-guided weapons were used in all 
</p>
<p>cases indicates that they were directed against specific targets and resulted in the total or 
</p>
<p>partial destruction of entire buildings. This finding is corroborated by satellite imagery 
</p>
<p>analysis.19 Many of the incidents took place in the evening or at dawn, when families 
</p>
<p>gathered for <i>iftar </i>and<i> suhhur</i>, the Ramadan meals, or at night, when people were asleep. 
</p>
<p>The timing of the attacks increased the likelihood that many people, often entire families, 
</p>
<p>would be at home. Attacking residential buildings rendered women particularly vulnerable 
</p>
<p>to death and injury.20

<p>38. In six of the cases examined, and in most cases reported on by non-governmental 
</p>
<p>organizations, there is little or no information available to explain why residential 
</p>
<p>buildings, which are <i>prima facie</i> civilian objects immune from attack, were considered to 
</p>
<p>be legitimate military objectives.<b> </b>In relation to each attack on residential buildings that 
</p>
<p>resulted in significant destruction and civilian deaths or injuries, the onus is on Israel to 
</p>
<p>explain the factual elements that rendered the houses or the person(s) present inside a 
</p>
<p>military target. Israel should provide specific information on the effective contribution of a 
</p>
<p>given house or inhabitant to military action and the clear advantage to be gained by the 
</p>
<p>attack. Should a strike directly and intentionally target a house in the absence of a specific 
</p>
<p>military objective, this would amount to a violation of the principle of distinction.21 It may 
</p>
<p>also constitute a direct attack against civilian objects or civilians, a war crime under 
</p>
<p>international criminal law.22  
</p>
<p>39. Although the commission found indications of possible military objectives in the 
</p>
<p>remaining nine cases examined, it is not in a position to determine whether they actually 
</p>
<p>motivated the attacks in question. It appears that the potential targets were mostly 
</p>
<p>individuals who were or who could have been present in the building at the time it was hit, 
</p>
<p>presumably on account of their alleged links to the police, Hamas or an armed group. In 
</p>
<p>that regard, international law provides that persons may be targeted only if they participate 
</p>
<p>directly in hostilities or are members of organized armed groups with a continuous combat 
</p>
<p>function.  
</p>
<p>40. With regard to proportionality, given the circumstances, a reasonable commander 
</p>
<p>would have been aware that these attacks would be likely to result in a large number of 
</p>
<p>civilian casualties and the complete or partial destruction of the building. Such 
</p>
<p>circumstances differ from case to case, and include the residential nature of the targeted 
</p>
<p>buildings; their location in densely populated areas; the timing of the attacks; and the 
</p>
<p>frequent use of large bombs that were apparently meant to cause extensive damage. Given 
</p>
<p>the absence of information suggesting that the anticipated military advantage at the time of 
</p>
<p>the attack was such that the expected civilian casualties and damage to the targeted and 
</p>
<p>surrounding buildings were not excessive, there are strong indications that these attacks 
</p>
<p>could be disproportionate, and therefore amount to a war crime.23  
</p>
<p>41. Regarding precautions, the Israel Defense Forces stated repeatedly that its measures 
</p>
<p>were more stringent than those required by international humanitarian law.24 In many 
</p>
<p>incidents, however, the weapons used, the timing of attacks, and the fact that the targets 
</p>
<p>were located in densely populated areas indicate that the Israel Defense Forces may not 
</p>
<p>have done everything feasible to avoid or limit civilian casualties.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>42. Warnings are one means of precaution. International humanitarian law requires that 
</p>
<p>&#8220;effective advance warning be given of attacks which may affect the civilian population, 
</p>
<p>unless circumstances do not permit.&#8221;25 The fact that many residential buildings were 
</p>
<p>destroyed without causing deaths suggests that, where specific warnings were conveyed via 
</p>
<p>telephone or text messages, they may have been effective in minimizing civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>In other cases, the Israel Defense Forces used so-called &#8220;roof-knock&#8221; warnings, strikes by 
</p>
<p>small missiles before the real strike. In a number of incidents examined, the concerned 
</p>
<p>persons either did not understand that their house had been the subject of a &#8220;roof-knock&#8221;, or 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 21 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and relating to the Protection of 
</p>
<p>Victims of International Armed Conflicts (Protocol I), arts. 51 and 52.1. 
</p>

</p>
<p> 23 Ibid. 
</p>
<p> 24 IDF MAG Corps, &#8220;Aerial Strikes against Terrorists: Some Legal Aspects&#8221;.  
</p>
<p> 25 Protocol I, art. 57, para. 3. </p>


<p>the time given for evacuation between the warning and the actual strike was insufficient. In 
</p>
<p>one case examined by the commission, a 22-member family, including nine children, were 
</p>
<p>given just a few minutes to evacuate their home after a &#8220;roof knock&#8221; in the early hours of 
</p>
<p>the morning, while they were asleep; 19 of the 22 people present in the house died. The 
</p>
<p>commission concluded that &#8220;roof knocks&#8221; cannot be considered an effective warning given 
</p>
<p>the confusion they often cause to building residents and the short time allowed to evacuate 
</p>
<p>before the actual strike. 
</p>
<p>43. The limited effectiveness of the above-mentioned precautionary measures must have 
</p>
<p>become abundantly clear in the early days of the operation, given that many buildings were 
</p>
<p>destroyed, together with their inhabitants. The apparent lack of steps to re-examine these 
</p>
<p>measures in the light of the mounting civilian toll suggests that Israel did not comply with 
</p>
<p>its obligation to take all feasible precautions before the attacks. 
</p>
<p>44. Furthermore, the large number of targeted attacks against residential buildings and 
</p>
<p>the fact that such attacks continued throughout the operation, even after the dire impact of 
</p>
<p>these attacks on civilians and civilian objects became apparent, raise concern that the 
</p>
<p>strikes may have constituted military tactics reflective of a broader policy, approved at least 
</p>
<p>tacitly by decision-makers at the highest levels of the Government of Israel.26  
</p>
<p>45. The commission also considered air strikes against <i>prima facie </i>residential buildings 
</p>
<p>that did not cause deaths because the buildings had been vacated. These included attacks 
</p>
<p>against houses of senior political figures and high-ranking members of armed groups in 
</p>
<p>their absence, and against three high-rise buildings in the last days of the conflict. Without 
</p>
<p>precise information about the possible military use of these premises, the commission is 
</p>
<p>unable to make a conclusive assessment regarding Israel&#8217;s respect of the principle of 
</p>
<p>distinction. These attacks raise concerns that Israel&#8217;s interpretation of what constitutes a 
</p>
<p>&#8220;military objective&#8221; may be broader than the definition provided for by international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law.27  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Ground operations 
</b></p>
<p>46. With regard to operations by Israel, the commission investigated attacks in three 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods: in Shuja&#8217;iya (on 19, 20 and 30 July); in Khuza&#8217;a (from 20 July to 
</p>
<p>1 August); and in Rafah (from 1 to 3 August), large areas of which were levelled to the 
</p>
<p>ground. After an assessment of all available information, the commission identified five 
</p>
<p>key patterns with respect to the ground operations.  
</p>
<p><b> (a) Use of artillery and other explosive weapons in densely populated areas 
</b></p>
<p>47. Talal Al Helo, a man from Shuja&#8217;iya, recalled &#8220;I am not a fighter, I am a civilian and 
</p>
<p>I care about the well-being of my family. The attacks were everywhere. Everything was 
</p>
<p>coming under attack, the roads and buildings; there was no safe haven in Shuja&#8217;iya. We 
</p>
<p>walked as the missiles kept arriving. We saw bodies of people in the streets. We came 
</p>
<p>across the [&#8230;] bodies of young and old people, women and children.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>48. During the ground operations, the Israel Defense Forces used explosive weapons 
</p>
<p>extensively in densely populated areas of Gaza. These weapons included artillery and tank 
</p>
<p>shells, mortars and air-dropped high-explosive munitions. The Forces reported that, during 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 26 See the judgement of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on Kupre&#353;ki&#263; <i>et 
</i></p>
<p><i>al</i> of 14 January 2000; Amnesty International, &#8220;Families Under the Rubble&#8221; (see footnote 19), pp. 6 
</p>
<p>and 42; and FIDH, &#8220;Trapped and Punished: The Gaza Civilian Population under Operation Protective 
</p>
<p>Edge&#8221;, October 2014, pp. 29&#8211;30.  
</p>
<p> 27 See Protocol I, art. 52, para. 2.  </p>


<p>the operation, 5,000 tons of munitions were supplied,28 and that 14,500 tank shells and 
</p>
<p>approximately 35,000 artillery shells had been fired.29 One non-governmental organization 
</p>
<p>reported a 533 per cent-increase in highly explosive artillery shells used in 2014 in 
</p>
<p>comparison to the hostilities in 2008 and 2009.30 Many explosive weapons, in particular 
</p>
<p>artillery and mortars, have a wide-area effect, meaning that anyone or anything within a 
</p>
<p>given area is likely to be killed, injured or damaged, owing to the scale of their blast and 
</p>
<p>their imprecise nature. While not illegal as such, the use of these weapons in densely 
</p>
<p>populated areas poses a high risk to the civilian population.31  
</p>
<p>49. According to official Israeli sources, artillery was used in urban areas only on an 
</p>
<p>exceptional basis, when these areas were known to have been largely evacuated.32 The 
</p>
<p>incidents examined by the commission, however, demonstrate that artillery and other heavy 
</p>
<p>weapons were widely used in residential neighbourhoods, resulting in a large number of 
</p>
<p>casualties and extensive destruction.33 For instance, in Shuja&#8217;iya, the sheer number of 
</p>
<p>155 mm shells fired, the reported dropping of 120 one-ton bombs in a short amount of time 
</p>
<p>in a densely populated area,34 and the use of a creeping artillery barrage raise questions with 
</p>
<p>regard to the respect by the Israel Defense Forces of the rules of distinction, precaution and 
</p>
<p>proportionality.  
</p>
<p>50. The extensive use by the Israel Defense Forces of explosive weapons with wide-area 
</p>
<p>effects, and their probable indiscriminate effects in the built-up neighbourhoods of Gaza, 
</p>
<p>are highly likely to constitute a violation of the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks.35 Such 
</p>
<p>use may, depending on the circumstances, qualify as a direct attack against civilians,36 and 
</p>
<p>may therefore amount to a war crime.37  
</p>
<p>51. In addition, the fact that the Israel Defense Forces did not modify the manner in 
</p>
<p>which they conducted their operations after initial episodes of shelling resulted in a large 
</p>
<p>number of civilian deaths indicates that their policies governing the use of artillery in 
</p>
<p>densely populated areas may not be in conformity with international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>52. The commission examined several additional incidents, including attacks on 
</p>
<p>shelters, hospitals and critical infrastructure, in which artillery was used. The use of 
</p>
<p>weapons with wide-area effects against targets in the vicinity of specifically protected 
</p>
<p>objects (such as medical facilities and shelters) is highly likely to constitute a violation of 
</p>
<p>the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks. Depending on the circumstances, indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>attacks may qualify as a direct attack against civilians,38 and may therefore amount to a war 
</p>
<p>crime.39

<p><b> (b) Destruction 
</b></p>
<p>53. Information gathered by the commission, including from witness accounts, United 
</p>
<p>Nations reports, video and photographic materials, observations by the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Institute for Training and Research Operational Satellite Applications Programme 
(UNITAR-UNOSAT)40 and anecdotal testimonies by soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces, 
indicates that destruction by artillery fire, air strikes and bulldozers<b> </b>may have been adopted 
</p>
<p>as a tactic of war. Some destruction may arguably be the result of the legitimate attempts of 
</p>
<p>the Israel Defense Forces to dismantle tunnels and to protect its soldiers. The concentration 
</p>
<p>of destruction in localities close to the Green Line, in some areas amounting to 100 per 
</p>
<p>cent, and the systematic way in which these areas were flattened one after the other, 
</p>
<p>however, raise concerns that such extensive destruction was not required by imperative 
</p>
<p>military necessity.41 If confirmed, this would constitute a grave breach of article 147 of the 
</p>
<p>Fourth Geneva Convention, which is a war crime.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Warnings and the continued protected status of civilians  
</b></p>
<p>54. In many cases during the ground operations, the Israel Defense Forces warned the 
</p>
<p>population of impending attacks by means of leaflets, loudspeaker announcements, 
</p>
<p>telephone calls, text messages and radio announcements.42 In many instances, however, 
</p>
<p>inhabitants did not leave their homes.43 For instance, the Office for the Coordination of 
</p>
<p>Humanitarian Affairs reported on 20 July that the majority of the 92,000 inhabitants of 
</p>
<p>Shuja&#8217;iya had remained in their neighbourhood despite repeated warnings to evacuate.44 
</p>
<p>Witnesses pointed to several reasons for staying, including not knowing in which direction 
</p>
<p>to go, given that intense shelling and air strikes were under way in many parts of Gaza; lack 
</p>
<p>of clarity of and unclear time frames indicated by the warnings; the fact that many places 
</p>
<p>considered safe were already overcrowded; and the poor conditions in shelters, which 
</p>
<p>themselves came under attack.  
</p>
<p>55. Statements by officials of the Israel Defense Forces indicated that, in some cases, 
</p>
<p>warnings to evacuate were meant to create &#8220;sterile combat zones&#8221;, and the people 
</p>
<p>remaining in the area would no longer be considered civilians and thus benefit from the 
</p>
<p>protection afforded by their civilian status. For example, the Head of the Doctrine Desk at 
</p>
<p>the Infantry Corps Headquarters, Major Amitai Karanik, reportedly stated: &#8220;We try to 
</p>
<p>create a situation whereby the area where we are fighting is sterile, so any person seen there 
</p>
<p>is suspected of engaging in terrorist activity. At the same time, we make the utmost effort to 
</p>
<p>remove the population, whether this means dropping flyers or shelling [.] We don&#8217;t want to 
</p>
<p>confuse the troops [&#8230;] In peacetime security, soldiers stand facing a civilian population, 
</p>
<p>but in wartime, there is no civilian population, just an enemy.&#8221;45 The commission is aware 
</p>
<p>of the assertions made by the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &#8220;although Hamas 
</p>
<p>authorities actively encouraged civilians to ignore the IDF&#8217;s warnings and refrain from 
</p>
<p>evacuating, the IDF did not regard civilians who heeded such advice as voluntary human 
</p>
<p>shields and thus legitimate targets for attack. Nor did the IDF discount such civilians for 
</p>
<p>purposes of its proportionality analyses.&#8221;46 It is the view articulated by Major Karanik that 
</p>
<p>appears, however, to have prevailed in at least two of the neighbourhoods examined by the

<p>commission and to have had implications for the way in which Israeli soldiers on the 
</p>
<p>ground viewed those who remained. On the basis of soldier testimony, one non-
</p>
<p>governmental organization concluded that &#8220;the soldiers were briefed by their commanders 
</p>
<p>to fire at every person they identified in a combat zone, since the working assumption was 
</p>
<p>that every person in the field was an enemy.&#8221;47  
</p>
<p>56. The commission recognizes that the general warnings issued by the Israel Defense 
</p>
<p>Forces saved lives. At the same time, these warnings were often used in a context where 
</p>
<p>people fleeing were unable to identify a safe place to go owing to the unpredictability of 
</p>
<p>many attacks over a lengthy period of time. Most importantly, inferring that anyone 
</p>
<p>remaining in an area that has been the object of a warning is an enemy or a person engaging 
</p>
<p>in &#8220;terrorist activity&#8221;, or issuing instructions to this effect, contributes to creating an 
</p>
<p>environment conducive to attacks against civilians. Those civilians choosing not to heed a 
</p>
<p>warning do not lose the protection granted by their status. The only way in which civilians 
</p>
<p>lose their protection from attack is by directly participating in the hostilities.48 Merely 
</p>
<p>issuing a warning does not absolve the Israel Defense Forces of their legal obligations to 
</p>
<p>protect civilian life.  
</p>
<p><b> (d) </b>Protection of civilians, force protection and the &#8220;Hannibal directive&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>57. An examination of actions by the Israel Defense Forces in Shuja&#8217;iya in July and 
</p>
<p>Rafah on 1 August indicates that the protection of Israeli soldiers significantly influenced 
</p>
<p>the conduct of the Israel Defense Forces in these operations, at times overriding any 
</p>
<p>concern for minimizing civilian casualties. While force protection is a legitimate objective, 
</p>
<p>the commission has the distinct impression that, when soldiers&#8217; lives were at stake or there 
</p>
<p>was a risk of capture, the Forces disregarded basic principles on the conduct of hostilities. 
</p>
<p>One of the witnesses recalled that &#8220;every time an Israeli soldier dies or is kidnapped, we 
</p>
<p>feel the consequences&#8221;. In Rafah, following the killing of two Israeli soldiers and the 
</p>
<p>apparent capture of one, who was later found to be dead, entire areas were closed off, in 
</p>
<p>particular through the use of shelling and air strikes, presumably to prevent the captors from 
</p>
<p>leaving the area with the captive soldier. Reports indicate that a procedure, known as the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hannibal directive&#8221;, was activated in Rafah and possibly in Shuja&#8217;iya, where there were 
</p>
<p>similar fears that a soldier had been captured. It reportedly gives considerable leeway to 
</p>
<p>Israeli commanders in deciding how to prevent their soldiers from being captured by armed 
</p>
<p>groups,49 and is widely perceived as having led to intensified shelling. In Rafah, every 
</p>
<p>moving vehicle or person became a potential target, with the most intensive fire reported 
</p>
<p>over the first four hours.  
</p>
<p>58. The Government of Israel has stated that the requirement to respect the principle of 
</p>
<p>proportionality continues to apply whenever the Hannibal directive is invoked,50 and some 
</p>
<p>have argued that the proportionality test may take into account strategic considerations in 
</p>
<p>determining the military advantage. The commission emphasizes that policy considerations 
</p>
<p>and remote strategic objectives informed by political goals &#8211; such as denying armed groups 
</p>
<p>the leverage they could obtain over Israel in negotiations for the release of a captured 
</p>
<p>soldier &#8211; are not valid considerations in conducting the proportionality analysis required 
</p>
<p>under international humanitarian law. The commission believes that the military culture 
</p>
<p>created by such policy priorities may have been a factor contributing to the decision to 
</p>
<p>unleash massive firepower in Rafah and Shuja&#8217;iya, in utter disregard of its devastating 
</p>
<p>impact on the civilian population. Moreover, applying this protocol in the context of a

<p>densely populated environment through the use of heavy weaponry predictably leads to 
</p>
<p>violations of the principles of distinction and proportionality. 
</p>
<p><b> (e) Targeting of civilians  
</b></p>
<p>59. The commission examined several cases in which the people or groups of people 
</p>
<p>targeted were civilians, at times children, who were not directly participating in the 
</p>
<p>hostilities and did not represent any threat to the Israeli soldiers present in the area. For 
</p>
<p>instance, Salem Shamaly, whose death was recorded on video, was shot several times while 
</p>
<p>looking for a relative during a humanitarian pause, even after he had been felled by the first 
</p>
<p>shot (A/HRC/28/80/Add.1, para. 43). The commission examined two other incidents in 
</p>
<p>which civilians allegedly carrying white flags were targeted by soldiers in Khuza&#8217;a. The 
</p>
<p>first case pertained to a large group of people, including children, who were attacked in 
</p>
<p>front of a clinic while attempting to leave the village holding white flags. In the second 
</p>
<p>case, a man in a house carrying a white flag was shot at point-blank range in front of some 
</p>
<p>30 other people, including women, children and elderly persons, who had sought shelter in 
</p>
<p>the house. 
</p>
<p>60. Directing attacks against civilians constitutes a violation of the principle of 
</p>
<p>distinction and may amount to a war crime. These acts may also constitute wilful killings. 
</p>
<p>Such acts are also a violation of the right to life, as guaranteed by article 6 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Impact on the population in Gaza of the conduct of Palestinian armed groups  
</b></p>
<p>61. The commission examined the conduct of Palestinian armed groups in a densely 
</p>
<p>populated environment, and what measures, if any, were taken by the authorities in Gaza to 
</p>
<p>protect civilians in Gaza from the effects of the attacks conducted by Israel.  
</p>
<p>62. The commission regrets that it was unable to verify allegations made by Israel on the 
</p>
<p>use of civilian buildings by Palestinian armed groups51 owing to the denial by Israel of 
</p>
<p>access to Gaza; fears by Palestinian witnesses of reprisal by armed groups and local 
</p>
<p>authorities, in particular when providing information remotely; and challenges faced by 
</p>
<p>Palestinian human rights organizations in documenting alleged violations by Palestinian 
</p>
<p>armed groups. 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Conducting military operations from within or near densely populated areas 
</b></p>
<p>63. Palestinian armed groups allegedly often operated from densely populated 
</p>
<p>neighbourhoods, including by firing rockets, mortars and other weapons from built-up 
</p>
<p>areas. In addition, they were alleged to have frequently placed command and control 
</p>
<p>centres and firing positions in residential buildings and to have stockpiled weapons and 
</p>
<p>located tunnel entrances in <i>prima facie</i> civilian buildings. They also reportedly conducted 
</p>
<p>military operations within or in close proximity to sites benefiting from specific protection 
</p>
<p>under international humanitarian law, such as hospitals, shelters and places dedicated to 
</p>
<p>religion and education, including within or in the vicinity of schools operated by the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East. The Secretary-
</p>
<p>General expressed his dismay that Palestinian militant groups would put United Nations 
</p>
<p>schools at risk by using them to hide their arms. &#8220;The three schools in which weaponry was 
</p>
<p>found were empty at the time and were not being used as shelters. However, the fact that 
</p>
<p>they were used by those involved in the fighting to store their weaponry and, in two cases, 
</p>
<p>probably to fire from is unacceptable&#8221; (S/2015/286, p. 3). Israel made specific allegations 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 51 Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs (see footnote 5), &#8220;Hamas&#8217; Violations of the Law&#8221;.  </p>


<p>with regard to the use of schools, mosques and hospitals and the areas in their immediate 
</p>
<p>vicinity for military purposes. By firing rockets from densely populated areas, Palestinian 
</p>
<p>armed groups also put Gazans in danger; for example, on 28 July 2014, 13 civilians, 
</p>
<p>including 11 children, were killed in Al-Shati camp when a rocket appears to have fallen 
</p>
<p>short of its target.  
</p>
<p>64. The commission recognizes that the obligation to avoid locating military objectives 
</p>
<p>within densely populated areas is not absolute. The small size of Gaza and its population 
</p>
<p>density make it difficult for armed groups to always comply with this requirement. While 
</p>
<p>the commission was unable to verify independently the specific incidents alleged by Israel, 
</p>
<p>the frequency of reports of Palestinian armed groups carrying out military operations in the 
</p>
<p>immediate vicinity of civilian objects and specially protected objects suggests that such 
</p>
<p>conduct could have been avoided on a number of occasions. In those instances, Palestinian 
</p>
<p>armed groups may not have complied, to the maximum extent feasible, with their legal 
</p>
<p>obligations. In cases where their goal may have been to use the presence of civilians to 
</p>
<p>protect military assets from attack, this would constitute a violation of the customary law 
</p>
<p>prohibition against the use of human shields.52 With regard to the alleged use of medical 
</p>
<p>facilities and ambulances for military purposes, if verified, and if the buildings or 
</p>
<p>ambulances bore distinctive emblems of the Geneva Conventions, such as the Red 
</p>
<p>Crescent, such actions would amount to an improper use of a distinctive emblem, in 
</p>
<p>violation of customary international humanitarian law.<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>65. Regardless of the case-by-case legality of the actions of Palestinian armed groups, 
</p>
<p>the military use of civilian buildings and densely populated areas from which to conduct 
</p>
<p>military operations increases the risk to the civilian population and civilian objects. The 
</p>
<p>questionable conduct of these armed groups does not, however, modify Israel&#8217;s own 
</p>
<p>obligations to abide by international law.  
</p>
<p><b> (b) Measures to facilitate the removal of the civilian population from the vicinity 
</b></p>
<p><b>of military objectives 
</b></p>
<p>66. The authorities in Gaza stated that they had taken measures to facilitate evacuation 
</p>
<p>from areas most affected by the hostilities, including by setting up shelters for internally 
</p>
<p>displaced persons and conducting more than 4,450 evacuation missions in Beit Hanoun, 
</p>
<p>Shuja&#8217;iya and Khuza&#8217;a. Nevertheless, the commission is concerned that, in some cases, the 
</p>
<p>authorities in Gaza reportedly encouraged residents not to heed the warnings given by the 
</p>
<p>Israel Defense Forces.53 If confirmed, and depending on the circumstances, such 
</p>
<p>declarations may indicate that the authorities in Gaza did not take all the precautions 
</p>
<p>necessary to protect the civilian population under their control as required by international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p><b> (c) Executions of suspected </b>&#8220;<b>collaborators</b>&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>67. The commission found that 21 alleged &#8220;collaborators&#8221; were executed between 5 and 
</p>
<p>22 August 2014. Sixteen of them were taken from Al-Katiba prison where they had been 
</p>
<p>held in the custody of the local authorities in Gaza and shot by firing squad.54 The Al-
</p>
<p>Qassam Brigades claimed responsibility for the executions, in some cases claiming that the 
</p>
<p>persons executed had been &#8220;found guilty of giving information on the whereabouts of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 52 Protocol I, art. 51, para. 7.  
</p>

<p>fighters and civilian houses&#8221;.55 The local authorities in Gaza informed the commission that 
</p>
<p>the executions had been carried out by Palestinian factions operating in secrecy, without 
</p>
<p>instructions from the authorities. They have purportedly created a body to investigate 
</p>
<p>allegations of extrajudicial killings. The Government of the State of Palestine likewise 
</p>
<p>pledged to investigate such cases once it regains control over Gaza. 
</p>
<p>68. Owing to the link to the armed conflict, these extrajudicial executions constitute a 
</p>
<p>violation of article 3 common to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and therefore amount to a 
</p>
<p>war crime. In addition, the commission found that the executions appear to have been 
</p>
<p>carried out with the knowledge of the local authorities in Gaza, in violation of their human 
</p>
<p>rights obligation to protect the right to life and security of those in their custody. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the commission is concerned that the families of those executed have been 
</p>
<p>stigmatized by being labelled the relatives of &#8220;collaborators&#8221;.  
</p>
<p><b> B. West Bank, including East Jerusalem 
</b></p>
<p>69. The period of June to September 2014 was marked by heightened tensions in the 
</p>
<p>West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Israeli security forces allegedly conducted more than 
</p>
<p>1,400 raids on Palestinian homes and other civilian buildings, often at night, and reportedly 
</p>
<p>arrested more than 2,050 Palestinians, including children (see A/HRC/28/80/Add.1).56 As at 
</p>
<p>the end of August 2014, 473 persons were said to be held in administrative detention.57 
</p>
<p>Cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, including of children, was widely reported.58 
</p>
<p>Israel also imposed severe restrictions on the movement of Palestinians within and out of 
</p>
<p>the West Bank, as well as on their access to Al-Aqsa Mosque.59 These measures prevented 
</p>
<p>Palestinians from having access to services, markets, education and workplaces, and 
</p>
<p>generated significant economic losses.60 In addition, Israel resumed its practice of punitive 
</p>
<p>home demolitions. Incidents of settler violence and settlement-related activity, including 
</p>
<p>reportedly as a response to the abduction and killing of the three Israeli youths, were 
</p>
<p>recorded. 
</p>
<p>70. There was also a stark rise in deaths and injuries of Palestinians by Israeli security 
</p>
<p>forces. Between 12 June and 26 August 2014, 27 Palestinians, including five children, were 
</p>
<p>allegedly killed and more than 3,100, Palestinians were injured by the Israeli security forces 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/28/80/Add.1, para. 10).61 This figure reportedly rose to 36 Palestinians, including 
</p>
<p>11 children, by the end of September 2014.62 The victims included Hashem Abu Maria, a 
</p>
<p>well-known child rights activist who worked for the non-governmental organization 
</p>
<p>Defence for Children International who was killed in circumstances where he presented no

<p>threat to the security forces. United Nations data indicate that the number of those killed 
</p>
<p>within this period was equivalent to the total number of Palestinian fatalities in similar 
</p>
<p>circumstances throughout 2013 (ibid.). These data further show that the large number of 
</p>
<p>deaths and injuries was a direct result of the regular recourse to live ammunition by the 
</p>
<p>Israeli security forces63 and the apparent rising trend in the use of 0.22 inch calibre bullets 
</p>
<p>in crowd-control situations. The increased use of live ammunition, combined with the spike 
</p>
<p>in casualties, appears to reflect a change in policy guiding the law enforcement operations 
</p>
<p>of the Israel Defense Forces in the West Bank.64  
</p>
<p>71. The commission is particularly concerned that the pervasive use of live ammunition 
</p>
<p>inevitably raises the risk of death or serious injury. The use of firearms against those not 
</p>
<p>posing a threat to life or serious injury constitutes a violation of the prohibition of the 
</p>
<p>arbitrary deprivation of life,65 and may, depending on the circumstances, amount to an act 
</p>
<p>of wilful killing. The unjustified recourse to firearms by law enforcement officials may be 
</p>
<p>considered a war crime when it takes place in the context of an international armed conflict, 
</p>
<p>including a situation of military occupation, and that the person killed was a protected 
</p>
<p>person. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Accountability 
</b></p>
<p>72. The commission notes the steps taken by Israel to investigate alleged violations of 
</p>
<p>the law of armed conflict by the Israel Defense Forces during operation &#8220;Protective Edge&#8221;66 
</p>
<p>and towards bringing its system of investigations into compliance with international 
</p>
<p>standards. Flaws remain, however, with respect to the State&#8217;s adherence to international 
</p>
<p>standards. Further significant changes are required to ensure that Israel adequately fulfils its 
</p>
<p>duty to investigate, prosecute and hold perpetrators accountable for violations of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law and international human rights law. One of the measures 
</p>
<p>needed is to enhance the independence and impartiality of the Military Advocate General 
</p>
<p>and to ensure the robust application of international humanitarian law in his decisions 
</p>
<p>regarding criminal investigations. For example, the definition of &#8220;military objectives&#8221; has 
</p>
<p>implications for both for the Military Advocate General&#8217;s operational guidance of troops on 
</p>
<p>the ground and his subsequent assessment of whether to refer a case for criminal 
</p>
<p>investigation. Moreover, the investigations process followed by the Israel Defense Forces 
</p>
<p>focuses on possible individual criminal responsibility at the level of the soldier on the 
</p>
<p>battlefield. Even where the behaviour of soldiers and low-ranking officers during hostilities 
</p>
<p>has come into question, however, this has rarely resulted in criminal investigations. At the 
</p>
<p>policy level, the commission looks forward to reading the report of the State Comptroller&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>inquiry into the procedure of decision-making by the military and political echelons during 
</p>
<p>operation &#8220;Protective Edge&#8221;. The Comptroller&#8217;s inquiry should be supplemented by 
</p>
<p>mechanisms &#8211; including criminal proceedings67 and disciplinary measures &#8211; that aim to 
</p>
<p>hold to account individuals who may have played a role in wrongdoing. In addition, 
</p>
<p>Palestinian victims face significant obstacles that impede their right to benefit from 
</p>
<p>effective remedies, including reparations.  
</p>
<p>73. The commission concludes that investigations by Palestinian authorities are 
</p>
<p>woefully inadequate, despite allegations of violations of international humanitarian law by

<p>Palestinian actors, leaving Israeli victims without an effective remedy. With respect to the 
</p>
<p>local authorities in Gaza, no steps appear to have been taken to ensure effective 
</p>
<p>investigations into actions by Palestinian armed groups, seemingly owing to a lack of 
</p>
<p>political will. The Palestinian Authority claims that its failure to open investigations results 
</p>
<p>from insufficient means to carry out investigations in a territory over which it has yet to re-
</p>
<p>establish unified control.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Concluding observations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The commission was deeply moved by the immense suffering of Palestinian and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Israeli victims, who have been subjected to repeated rounds of violence. The victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>expressed their continued hope that their leaders and the international community 
</b></p>
<p><b>would act more resolutely to address the root causes of the conflict so as to restore 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights, dignity, justice and security to all residents of the Occupied Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Territory and Israel. In relation to this latest round of violence, which resulted in an 
</b></p>
<p><b>unprecedented number of casualties, the commission was able to gather substantial 
</b></p>
<p><b>information pointing to serious violations of international humanitarian law and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international human rights law by Israel and by Palestinian armed groups. In some 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases, these violations may amount to war crimes. The commission urges all those 
</b></p>
<p><b>concerned to take immediate steps to ensure accountability, including the right to an 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective remedy for victims.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>With regard to Israel, the commission examined carefully the circumstances of 
</b></p>
<p><b>each case, including the account given by the State, where available. Israel has, 
</b></p>
<p><b>however, released insufficient information regarding the specific military objectives of 
</b></p>
<p><b>its attacks. The commission recognizes the dilemma that Israel faces in releasing 
</b></p>
<p><b>information that would disclose in detail the targets of military strikes, given that such 
</b></p>
<p><b>information may be classified and jeopardize intelligence sources. Be that as it may, 
</b></p>
<p><b>security considerations do not relieve the authorities of their obligations under 
</b></p>
<p><b>international law. The onus remains on Israel to provide sufficient details on its 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeting decisions to allow an independent assessment of the legality of the attacks 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducted by the Israel Defense Forces and to assist victims in their quest for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>truth.  
</b></p>
<p>76. <b>The commission is concerned that impunity prevails across the board for 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegedly committed by Israeli forces, whether it be in the context of active hostilities 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Gaza or killings, torture and ill-treatment in the West Bank. Israel must break with 
</b></p>
<p><b>its recent lamentable track record in holding wrongdoers accountable, not only as a 
</b></p>
<p><b>means to secure justice for victims but also to ensure the necessary guarantees for 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-repetition.  
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>Questions arise regarding the role of senior officials who set military policy in 
</b></p>
<p><b>several areas examined by the commission, such as in the attacks of the Israel Defense 
</b></p>
<p><b>Forces on residential buildings, the use of artillery and other explosive weapons with 
</b></p>
<p><b>wide-area effects in densely populated areas, the destruction of entire neighbourhoods 
</b></p>
<p><b>in Gaza, and the regular resort to live ammunition by the Israel Defense Forces, 
</b></p>
<p><b>notably in crowd-control situations, in the West Bank. In many cases, individual 
</b></p>
<p><b>soldiers may have been following agreed military policy, but it may be that the policy 
</b></p>
<p><b>itself violates the laws of war.  </b></p>


<p>78. The commission&#8217;s investigations also raise the issue of why the Israeli 
</p>
<p><b>authorities failed to revise their policies in Gaza and the West Bank during the period 
</b></p>
<p><b>under review by the commission. Indeed, the fact that the political and military 
</b></p>
<p><b>leadership did not change its course of action, despite considerable information 
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding the massive degree of death and destruction in Gaza, raises questions about 
</b></p>
<p><b>potential violations of international humanitarian law by these officials, which may 
</b></p>
<p><b>amount to war crimes. Current accountability mechanisms may not be adequate to 
</b></p>
<p><b>address this issue.  
</b></p>
<p>79. <b>With regard to Palestinian armed groups, the commission has serious concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b>with regard to the inherently indiscriminate nature of most of the projectiles directed 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards Israel by these groups and to the targeting of civilians, which violate 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law and may amount to a war crime. The increased level 
</b></p>
<p><b>of fear among Israeli civilians resulting from the use of tunnels was palpable. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission also condemns the extrajudicial executions of alleged </b>&#8220;<b>collaborators</b>&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><b>which amount to a war crime.  
</b></p>
<p>80. <b>The Palestinian authorities have consistently failed to ensure that perpetrators 
</b></p>
<p><b>of violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b>are brought to justice. The commission is concerned that continuing political divisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>contribute significantly to the obstruction of justice for victims of violations by 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian armed groups. The absence of measures to initiate criminal proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b>against alleged perpetrators calls into question the stated determination of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Palestinian Authority to achieve accountability. In accordance with their legal 
</b></p>
<p><b>obligations, the authorities must take urgent measures to rectify this long-standing 
</b></p>
<p><b>impunity. 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Comprehensive and effective accountability mechanisms for violations 
</b></p>
<p><b>allegedly committed by Israel or Palestinian actors will be a key deciding factor of 
</b></p>
<p><b>whether Palestinians and Israelis are to be spared yet another round of hostilities and 
</b></p>
<p><b>spikes in violations of international law in the future.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The persistent lack of implementation of recommendations </b>&#8211;<b> made by previous 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissions of inquiry, fact-finding missions, United Nations treaty bodies, special 
</b></p>
<p><b>procedures and other United Nations bodies, in particular the Secretary-General and 
</b></p>
<p><b>OHCHR </b>&#8211;<b> lies at the heart of the systematic recurrence of violations in Israel and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Occupied Palestinian Territory. Bearing in mind this wealth of guidance, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>commission will not elaborate an exhaustive list of recommendations, which would 
</b></p>
<p><b>repeat concerns registered by other bodies. Rather, it calls upon all duty bearers to 
</b></p>
<p><b>implement fully all recommendations made by the above-mentioned bodies without 
</b></p>
<p><b>delay in order to avert a crisis similar to that of summer 2014 in the future.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>The commission calls upon all parties to fully respect international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law and international human rights law, including the main principles 
</b></p>
<p><b>of distinction, proportionality and precaution, and to establish promptly credible, 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective, transparent and independent accountability mechanisms. The right of all 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims to an effective remedy, including full reparations, must be ensured without 
</b></p>
<p><b>further delay. In this context, the parties should cooperate fully with the preliminary 
</b></p>
<p><b>examination of the International Criminal Court and with any subsequent 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigation that may be opened.  
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The commission also calls upon Israelis and Palestinians to demonstrate 
</b></p>
<p><b>political leadership by both refraining from and taking active steps to prevent </b></p>


<p><b>statements that dehumanize the other side, incite hatred, and only serve to perpetuate 
</b></p>
<p><b>a culture of violence.  
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The commission calls upon the Government of Israel to conduct a thorough, 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent, objective and credible review of policies governing military operations 
</b></p>
<p><b>and of law enforcement activities in the context of the occupation, as defined by 
</b></p>
<p><b>political and military decision-makers, to ensure compliance with international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law and human rights law, specifically with regard to: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) The use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in densely populated 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas, including in the vicinity of specifically protected objects;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) The definition of military objectives; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) The tactics of targeting residential buildings;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) The effectiveness of precautionary measures;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The protection of civilians in the context of the application of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Hannibal directive;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Ensuring that the principle of distinction is respected when active 
</b></p>
<p>neighbourhoods are declared &#8220;sterile combat zones&#8221;; <b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) The use of live ammunition in crowd-control situations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The review should also examine mechanisms for continuous review of respect for 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law and human rights law during military operations and 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the course of law enforcement activities in the context of the occupation. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>The commission further calls upon the Government of Israel: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To ensure that investigations comply with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>standards and that allegations of international crimes, where substantiated, are met 
</b></p>
<p><b>with indictments, prosecutions and convictions, with sentences commensurate to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>crime, and to take all measures necessary to ensure that such investigations will not be 
</b></p>
<p><b>confined to individual soldiers alone, but will also encompass members of the political 
</b></p>
<p><b>and military establishment, including at the senior level, where appropriate;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To implement all the recommendations contained in the second report of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Turkel Commission, in particular recommendation No. 2 calling for the enactment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of provisions that impose direct criminal liability on military commanders and civilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>superiors for offenses committed by their subordinates, in line with the doctrine of 
</b></p>
<p><b>command responsibility;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To grant access to Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory for, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>cooperate with, international human rights bodies and non-governmental 
</b></p>
<p><b>organizations concerned with investigating alleged violations of international law by 
</b></p>
<p><b>all duty bearers and</b> <b>any mechanisms established by the Human Rights Council to 
</b></p>
<p><b>follow up on the present report;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To address structural issues that fuel the conflict and have a negative 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on a wide range of human rights, including the right to self-determination; in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular, to lift, immediately and unconditionally, the blockade on Gaza; to cease all 
</b></p>
<p><b>settlement-</b>related activity, including the transfer of Israel&#8217;s own population to the 
</p>
<p><b>occupied territory; and to implement the advisory opinion rendered on 9 July 2004 by 
</b></p>
<p><b>the International Court of Justice on the legal consequences of the construction of a 
</b></p>
<p><b>wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(e)</b> <b>To accede to the Rome Statute.  </b></p>


<p>87. <b>The commission calls upon the State of Palestine:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To ensure that investigations into violations of international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law and international human rights law, including international crimes, 
</b></p>
<p><b>by the Palestinian Authority, the authorities in Gaza and Palestinian armed groups, 
</b></p>
<p><b>where substantiated, comply with international human rights standards and that full 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability is achieved, including through criminal proceedings; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b)</b> <b>To accelerate efforts to translate the declarations on Palestinian unity 
</b></p>
<p><b>into tangible measures on grounds that would enable the Government of national 
</b></p>
<p><b>consensus to ensure the protection of human rights and to achieve accountability for 
</b></p>
<p><b>victims.  
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The commission calls upon the authorities in Gaza and Palestinian armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>groups: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) To respect the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by ending all attacks on Israeli civilians and civilian objects, and stopping 
</b></p>
<p><b>all rocket attacks and other actions that may spread terror among the civilian 
</b></p>
<p><b>population in Israel; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) To take measures to prevent extrajudicial executions and eradicate 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; to cooperate with national 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigations aimed to bring those responsible for violations of international law to 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice; and to combat the stigma faced by families of alleged collaborators.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The commission calls upon the international community:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a)</b> <b>To promote compliance with human rights obligations, and to respect, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to ensure respect for, international humanitarian law in the Occupied Palestinian 
</b></p>
<p><b>Territory and Israel, in accordance with article 1 common to the Geneva 
</b></p>
<p><b>Conventions;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b)</b> <b>To use its influence to prevent and end violations, and to refrain from 
</b></p>
<p><b>encouraging violations by other parties;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) To accelerate and intensify efforts to develop legal and policy standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>that would limit the use of explosive weapons with wide-area effects in populated 
</b></p>
<p><b>areas with a view to strengthening the protection of civilians during hostilities;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) To support actively the work of the International Criminal Court in 
</b></p>
<p><b>relation to the Occupied Palestinian Territory; to exercise universal jurisdiction to try 
</b></p>
<p><b>international crimes in national courts; and to comply with extradition requests 
</b></p>
<p><b>pertaining to suspects of such crimes to countries where they would face a fair trial.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The commission recommends that the Human Rights Council consider 
</b></p>
<p><b>conducting a comprehensive review of the implementation of the numerous 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations addressed to the parties by its own mechanisms, in particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant commissions of inquiry and fact-finding missions, and explore mechanisms to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure their implementation. </b> </p>
