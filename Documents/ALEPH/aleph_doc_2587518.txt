Offshore, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into a purchase agreement (the 
&#147;Purchase Agreement&#148;) with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Credit 
Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&amp; Co., UBS Securities LLC 
and Capital One
Securities, Inc., as representatives of the initial purchasers listed on 
Schedule I to the Purchase Agreement (collectively, the &#147;Initial 
Purchasers&#148;), relating to the sale by the Company to the Initial Purchasers
of $300.0 million
aggregate principal amount of the Company&#146;s 7.50% Senior Notes due 2021 
(the &#147;Notes&#148;). The Notes were sold at par. The Company&#146;s 
obligations under the Notes will be, jointly and severally, fully and 
unconditionally guaranteed
(the &#147;Guarantees&#148;), on a senior unsecured basis, by each of the 
Company&#146;s current and future domestic restricted subsidiaries 
(collectively, the &#147;Guarantors,&#148; and together with the Company, the 
&#147;Issuers&#148;) that
incur or guarantee indebtedness under a credit facility, including the 
Company&#146;s existing revolving credit facility. The net proceeds from the 
Notes offering will be approximately $294.5 million, after deducting the Initial
Purchasers&#146;
discount and estimated offering expenses. The Company expects to use the net 
proceeds, together with cash on hand, to fund its pending tender offer and 
consent solicitation for all of the Company&#146;s outstanding $300.0 million 
aggregate principal
amount of 10.50% senior secured notes due 2017 (the &#147;10.50% Notes&#148;) 
and to redeem any of the 10.50% Notes not purchased in the tender offer. The 
Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and 
indemnities by the
Issuers in favor of the Initial Purchasers. The sale of the Notes to the Initial
Purchasers pursuant to the Purchase Agreement is expected to close on 
October&nbsp;1, 2013. The closing is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of 
customary
conditions. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%;

offered and sold to the Initial Purchasers pursuant to an exemption from the 
registration
requirements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities 
Act&#148;). The Initial Purchasers intend to resell the Notes and Guarantees in 
private sales exempt from registration under the Securities Act (i)&nbsp;inside 
the
United States to &#147;qualified institutional buyers&#148; as defined in Rule 
144A under the Securities Act (&#147;Rule 144A&#148;), in accordance with Rule 
144A and (ii)&nbsp;to other eligible purchasers pursuant to offers and sales

outside the United States within the meaning of Regulation S under the 
Securities Act (&#147;Regulation S&#148;) in accordance with Regulation S. The

principal amount of Securities which the defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial
