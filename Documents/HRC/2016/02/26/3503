<b>Republic of Korea 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Guided</i> by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human

</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the 
Human Rights Council and the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, including Council resolution 16/8 of 24 March 
</p>
<p>2011 and Assembly resolution 66/174 of 19 December 2011, and urging the 
implementation of those resolutions, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 3 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 
2006,  
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the 
Council, and 5/2, on the code of conduct for special procedures mandate holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his or her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the reports submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea,1 and urging the 
implementation of the recommendations contained therein,  
</p>
<p>  
 * Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
 1 A/66/343 and A/HRC/19/65. 
</p>

<p><i>Deeply concerned</i> at the persisting deterioration in the human rights situation in the 
Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea, at the continuing reports of systematic, widespread 
</p>
<p>and grave violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights in the country 
and at the unresolved questions of international concern relating to the abduction of 
nationals of other States, and urging the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic 
</p>
<p>of Korea to respect all human rights and fundamental freedoms fully, 
</p>
<p><i>Deploring</i> the grave, widespread and systematic human rights abuses in the

</p>
<p>against political prisoners and repatriated citizens of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of

Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to date to implement the recommendations 
</p>
<p>contained in that report, 
</p>
<p><i>Alarmed</i> by the precarious humanitarian situation in the country, exacerbated by its 
national policy priorities, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that it is the responsibility of the Government of the Democratic 
People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms of its entire population, including by ensuring access to adequate 
food, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> the particular vulnerability of women, children, persons with 
disabilities and the elderly, and the need to ensure their protection against neglect, abuse, 
exploitation and violence, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> the importance of States&#8217; engaging fully and constructively with the 
universal periodic review process and with other mechanisms of the Human Rights Council 
for the improvement of their human rights situations, 
</p>

cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur and to permit him unrestricted access to visit 
the country and to provide him with all information necessary to enable him to fulfil his 
mandate; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also urges</i> the Government of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea to 
ensure full, rapid and unimpeded access of humanitarian assistance that is delivered on the 
</p>
<p>  
 2 A/HRC/13/13. </p>


<p>basis of need, in accordance with humanitarian principles, coupled with adequate 
monitoring; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Encourages</i> the United Nations, including its specialized agencies, regional

experts and non-governmental organizations, to develop regular dialogue and cooperation 
with the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his mandate; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with all 
assistance and adequate staffing necessary to carry out his mandate effectively and to 
ensure that this mechanism works with the support of the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights; 
</p>

implementation of his mandate to the Human Rights Council and to the General Assembly.
