<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 21/12, the Human Rights Council requested the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in collaboration with the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression, to prepare, working in consultation with States and other relevant stakeholders, 
a compilation of good practices in the protection of journalists, the prevention of attacks 
and the fight against impunity for attacks committed against journalists, and to present the 
compilation in a report to the Council at its twenty-fourth session. The present report was 
prepared pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Current situation 
</b></p>
<p>2. In keeping the general public informed, journalists and other media professionals 
play an essential role by ensuring transparency and accountability in the conduct of public 
affairs and other matters of public interest. It is precisely as a result of this crucial role, 
however, that journalists are frequently subject to violations of their most fundamental 
human rights, including abduction, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, expulsion, 
harassment, killing, surveillance, search and seizure, torture and threats and acts of other 
forms of violence. Female journalists face additional risks, including being subjected to 
forms of sexual violence while covering public events or when in detention.1  
</p>
<p>3. Such threats and attacks are committed by both State and non-State actors, often to 
silence journalists documenting and disseminating information or opinions perceived by 
these actors as sensitive, such as in relation to human rights violations, environmental 
issues, corruption, organized crime, drug trafficking, public crises, emergencies or public 
demonstrations.2 
</p>
<p>4. Given that acts of violence undermine the free flow of information, they have a 
profound impact on the ability of citizens to contribute to democratic processes by means of 
informed decisions on a wide range of issues. In this regard, therefore, threats and attacks 
against journalists also violate the fundamental right to freedom of opinion and expression. 
</p>
<p>5. Trends in threats and attacks against journalists and other media professionals paint 
a very troubling picture. Reports indicate that, since 1992, approximately 984 journalists 
have been killed and 232 imprisoned in the exercise of their profession.3 According to other 
sources, since the start of 2013, 19 journalists have been killed and 177 have been 
imprisoned.4 In 2012, 90 journalists were killed, the worst figure recorded since 1995.5 In 
2012 alone, 879 journalists were arrested, 1,993 were threatened or physically attacked and 
38 were kidnapped. Some 73 journalists fled their country as a consequence of attacks or 
threats of attack.3

<p>6. Some of the most dangerous countries for journalists are those that are or have been 
in situations of armed conflict.6 Indeed, since 1992, 185 journalists have been killed in such 
situations.7 The very large majority of violence and attacks against journalists occur, 
however, outside armed conflict. Moreover, while the death or injury of foreign journalists 
often captures the attention of the international community, most of those who are victims 
of threats and attacks are local journalists covering local issues. One organization estimated 
that, since 1992, 88 per cent of the journalists who have been killed worldwide were local.3 
Furthermore, approximately 42 per cent of the journalists killed were reporting on political 
issues, 35 per cent on war, 20 per cent on corruption, 16 per cent on human rights and 15 
per cent on crime. 
</p>
<p>7. Impunity for attacks against journalists is a serious and pervasive problem, and it is 
one &#8211; if not the main &#8211; challenge to strengthening the protection of journalists.8 For 
example, there is near total impunity in cases of violations of the right to life of journalists. 
According to one source, perpetrators go unpunished in nine out of 10 cases; at 16 May 
2013, those responsible for the murder of 594 journalists in countries around the world 
since 1992 had not been held accountable.9 
</p>
<p>8. In many countries, the offences of slander, libel and defamation are treated as 
criminal offences. The existence and use of such criminal laws against journalists and other 
media professionals deters reporting on issues of public interest.10 The conviction of 
journalists for such offences often results in imprisonment, heavy fines or the suspension of 
media licenses, which in turn deter criticism of public figures and can significantly 
compound a climate of intimidation.11 The impact of counter-terrorism legislation on 
journalists and other media professionals raises concern, given that the use of broader 
police and intelligence service powers for combating terrorism are also used to unduly 
restrict freedom of expression.15 
</p>
<p>9. The Internet and other digital media sources have become an essential medium for 
disseminating news. There is an increasing number of &#8220;online journalists&#8221;, both 
professionals and &#8220;citizen journalists&#8221;, who are untrained yet still play an important role in 
documenting and disseminating information.12 In its general comment No. 34, the Human 
Rights Committee defined journalism as &#8220;a function shared by a wide range of actors, 
including professional full-time reporters and analysts, as well as bloggers and others who 
engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the Internet or elsewhere.&#8221;13 As the number 
of online journalists has increased, so have attacks against them, such as illegal hacking of 
their accounts, monitoring of their online activities, arbitrary arrest and detention, and the 
blocking of websites that contain information critical of the authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Applicable international law 
</b></p>
<p>10. International human rights law and international humanitarian law establish an array 
of norms and standards that provide effective normative protection to journalists and other 
media professionals, both in their exercise of the right of freedom of expression and from 
</p>

<p>threats and attacks. The enforcement of existing legislation is critical for strengthening the 
protection of journalists.14 
</p>
<p><b> A. International human rights law 
</b></p>
<p>11. Threats and attacks against journalists violate a wide range of human rights norms 
established in both treaty law and customary international law.15 Specifically, journalists 
and other media professionals experience violations of the right to life,16 the right to liberty 
and security of person,17 the right to a fair trial,18 the right to equality before the law,19 the 
right to recognition before the law20 and rights to privacy, family and home.21 Attacks 
against journalists also violate fundamental prohibitions against torture, cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment22 and enforced disappearance.23 In addition to 
constituting human rights violations, certain conduct can amount to international crimes, 
including killing, torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and enforced 
disappearance.  
</p>
<p>12. The right to freedom of expression, an individual right and a collective right held by 
society as a whole, may also be severely undermined.24 Together with the freedom of 
opinion, the right to freedom of expression is a prerequisite for every free and democratic 
</p>
<p>  
 14 See for example A/HRC/20/17, para. 56. 
 15 Rights set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil 
</p>
<p>and Political Rights are recognized as having the status of customary international law. See for

<p>society. Indeed, without respect for this freedom, an informed, active and engaged citizenry 
is impossible. In this respect, while the right to freedom of expression is not absolute, it 
may only be derogated from in the exceptional circumstances provided for in article 4 of 
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or subject to the specific 
restrictions set down in article 19(3) of the same covenant. The Human Rights Committee 
categorically stated in its general comment that article 19(3) could never be invoked as a 
justification for muzzling advocacy of multiparty democracy, democratic tenets or human 
rights, nor, in any circumstance, could an attack on a person, because of the exercise of his 
or her freedom of opinion or expression, including such forms of attack as arbitrary arrest, 
torture, threats to life and killing, be compatible with article 19.25 
</p>
<p>13. The obligation to respect and to ensure respect of the human rights of journalists and 
other media professionals rests on the State as a whole. It encompasses a positive duty of 
States to ensure that persons are protected from any act that would impair the enjoyment of 
their rights, including by taking effective measures or exercising due diligence to prevent 
any harm caused by private persons or entities. This obligation to protect is particularly 
important in the case of threats and attacks made against journalists by non-State actors.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>14. Under international humanitarian law, journalists are entitled to all the protections 
afforded to civilians in times of conflict. An intentional attack against civilians, including 
journalists, constitutes a war crime.26 Journalists will lose this protection if they directly 
participate in hostilities for as long as they take direct part. Participation does not include 
such activities as conducting interviews with civilians or combatants, taking still or moving 
pictures, making audio recordings or any of the other usual tasks involved in journalistic 
practice. The dissemination of propaganda by a journalist does not amount to direct 
participation.27 
</p>
<p>15. In situations of international armed conflict, war correspondents who are accredited 
to and accompany armed forces qualify for prisoner of war status should they be captured.28 
In non-international armed conflicts, international humanitarian law makes no distinction 
between war correspondents and other journalists, and journalists have the same protection 
as other civilians. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability under international human rights law and international 
</b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p>16. When violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law 
have been allegedly committed, States are obliged to investigate the allegations effectively,

<p>promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially and, if appropriate, to prosecute those 
responsible.29 Failure to do so could give rise to independent violations of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.30 Furthermore, violations of international human 
rights law and international humanitarian law give rise to a right of the victim to an 
effective remedy, which includes the right to equal and effective access to justice and 
adequate, effective and prompt reparation for the harm suffered.31 Reparation encompasses 
compensation, restitution, rehabilitation, satisfaction and guarantees of non-recurrence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Initiatives relating to the safety of journalists 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. States 
</b></p>
<p>17. In their responses to the note verbale dated 11 January 2013 addressed to them by 
OHCHR,32 States documented a wide range of legislative measures, as well as a variety of 
policies and practices, that aim to protect the right to freedom of expression or freedom of 
information and, more specifically, to ensure the safety of journalists.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Legislative initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>18. Many States noted that freedom of expression and the right to information were 
protected by their Constitution. States also referred to national legislation that aims to give 
effect to the right to freedom of expression. Other States noted laws that provide that, when 
determining the penalty, offences committed in response to the exercise of freedom of 
expression would be considered an aggravating circumstance. 
</p>
<p>19. According to the responses, several States had either recently conducted or were 
currently conducting a legislative review to strengthen mechanisms for ensuring freedom of 
</p>

Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, art. 3; Basic Principles

Discrimination, art. 6; American Convention on Human Rights, art. 25; Arab Charter on Human 
Rights, art. 23; European Convention on Human Rights, art. 13; Regulations annexed to the 
Convention with respect to the Laws and Customs of War on Land (1907), art. 3; fourth Geneva 
Convention, art. 148; Additional Protocol I, art. 91; Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, 
arts. 68 and 75; Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims 
of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International 
Humanitarian Law, Principle 11; Updated Set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of 
Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity, Principle 34; HRC, General Comment No. 31, 
paras. 8, 15-19. 
</p>
<p> 32 Responses were received from Austria, Bulgaria, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Georgia, 
Grenada, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Mexico, Mongolia, Montenegro, Poland, the Republic of 
Moldova, the Russian Federation, Serbia, Slovenia, Sweden, the Syrian Arab Republic, Trinidad and 
Tobago, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uruguay. </p>


<p>expression and freedom of information in accordance with international standards; for 
example, Grenada, Mexico, Montenegro, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, 
Serbia, and Uruguay reportedly recently decriminalized acts of slander, defamation, 
contempt or libel. 
</p>
<p>20. In addition, some States made reference to plans of action for addressing issues 
relating to freedom of information. The Republic of Moldova, for instance, recently 
amended its national human rights plan of action (2011-2014) to include activities relating 
to the independence of the mass media and freedom of expression following 
recommendations made during the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council. 
In Mongolia, the strategic plan of the national human rights commission for 2012-2014 
reportedly includes monitoring the implementation of, and raising public awareness about, 
laws on information transparency and the right to information. 
</p>
<p>21. More specifically, States referred to constitutional and legislative measures intended 
to address the protection of journalists; for example, Mexico indicated that, following a 
recent constitutional amendment, crimes committed against journalists had become federal 
offences. In Colombia, article 73 of the Constitution specifically provides that &#8220;journalism 
will enjoy such protection as necessary to guarantee its freedom and professional 
independence&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>22. Other examples include the Audiovisual Code in the Republic of Moldova, which 
requires that public authorities ensure the protection of journalists if they are subject to 
pressure or threats that might restrict them in carrying out their professional duties. Serbia 
pointed out that a recent amendment made to the Criminal Code criminalizes threats against 
journalists performing their professional duties by including journalists in a group of 
persons significant in the field of public information. Similarly, the Russian Federation 
stated that amendments made in 2011 to its Criminal Code included establishing criminal 
liability for obstructing the professional activities of journalists by violence or threats of 
violence. The Press Law in Poland reportedly provides for the same sanctions to be 
imposed against those who use violence against journalists as those who use violence 
against public officials.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Combating impunity initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>23. Other States discussed mechanisms to ensure the investigation and prosecution of 
attacks against journalists and other media professionals. For instance, Colombia stated that 
the Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office had a special subunit that conducted investigations into 
crimes committed against journalists. In Mexico, the Special Prosecutor for Crimes against 
Freedom of Expression reportedly has the authority to direct, coordinate and supervise 
investigations and, where appropriate, the prosecution of crimes committed against 
journalists. It is also involved in the systematization of information regarding attacks on 
journalists.  
</p>
<p>24. Serbia reported that, in January 2012, a national commission had been created to 
review the investigations of the killing of Dada Vujasinovi&#263;, Slavko &#262;uruvija and Milan 
Panti&#263;, three prominent journalists, in the 1990s, and to make recommendations to improve 
future investigations. Sweden stated that it monitored and responded to assaults against 
journalists, bloggers and human rights defenders, and that the Swedish Union of Journalists 
provided legal advice and protection for professional journalistic practices. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Protection initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>25. The measures to strengthen the protection of journalists reported included the 
Protection Programme for Journalists and Social Communicators, established in Colombia 
in 2000, together with the Programme for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, </p>


<p>which aims to protect journalists and media professionals facing threats of violence. As part 
of the programme, civil society organizations monitor threats against journalists and present 
cases to the Risk Evaluation and Regulation Committee, an inter-institutional committee 
that determines the protection measures to be implemented. Colombia also established a 
national unit for the protection of journalists to provide equipment and assistance 
constituting material measures of protection to journalists, such as mobile phones, 
bulletproof vehicles and emergency evacuations and transfers to other regions of the 
country or abroad under witness protection programmes. This initiative brings together 
previously separate protection programmes in Colombia for the protection of judges, 
prosecutors, witnesses, human rights defenders, journalists and others. 
</p>
<p>26. Mexico stated that the Law on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders and 
Journalists of 2012 created mechanisms to increase cooperation between federal and State 
agencies and civil society to implement measures to protect human rights defenders and 
journalists. The Law also established a fund for the protection of human rights defenders 
and journalists, which provides funding for the implementation and operation of urgent and 
preventive measures to protect human rights defenders and journalists. An early warning 
system has the purpose of providing journalists with immediate access to the authorities if 
threatened. 
</p>
<p>27. In its response, Montenegro stated that the police performed risk assessments for all 
media employees or their family members who had been subjected to threats, after which 
protective measures, including police protection, may be provided. In addition, checks were 
reportedly conducted of persons registered as having committed assaults against journalists. 
</p>
<p>28. Georgia noted in its response that, in cooperation with United States Agency for 
Development and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it gave 
training to media professionals and the police to enhance the safety of journalists, including 
during public demonstrations. In Denmark, the curriculum for students of journalism 
includes &#8220;risk reporting&#8221;, which provides students with knowledge on operating safely in 
areas of crisis or conflict. In Montenegro, the Centre for Education of Agents of the 
Administration of Justice reportedly has an annual training programme for judges that 
includes sessions on freedom of expression. The Russian Federation reported the holding of 
several training sessions on journalistic practices, with the participation of government 
entities and media organizations. 
</p>
<p>29. Other States, including Denmark, Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago, noted that 
public condemnations of attacks against journalists were an important protection measure. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Advocacy and awareness-raising initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>30. The responses received from States showed that they had adopted a broad spectrum 
of initiatives for drawing attention to the issues of freedom of expression and the safety of 
journalists. The initiatives included prizes for contributions to the freedom of expression, 
and special observance days to highlight the vital role that journalists and a free press 
played in democratic societies. Regarding the latter, examples included the &#8220;Freedom of 
Expression of Thought Day&#8221; (20 September) and &#8220;National Day of Press Freedom&#8221; (23 
</p>
<p>October) in Uruguay, and the &#8220;Imprisoned Writers&#8217; Day&#8221; (15 November) in Sweden. States 
also pointed out that awareness-raising had been conducted by means of conferences and 
meetings held at the national, regional and international levels on the issues of freedom of 
expression and the -protection of journalists. For example, in June 2012, Trinidad and 
Tobago hosted the International Press Institute World Congress on the theme, &#8220;Media in a 
challenging world: a 360 degree perspective&#8221;, which included a focus on protection of 
journalists. Sweden reported that it had created a website that hosted information on a range 
of human rights, including the right to freedom of expression. </p>


<p>31. Moreover, States noted initiatives aimed at strengthening the protection of 
journalists through the sharing of practices. For instance, in November 2012, the Inter-
American Press Association held a meeting in Honduras that brought together officials 
from Honduras and Mexico to share relevant practices. 
</p>
<p><b> B. United Nations bodies 
</b></p>
<p>32. The issue of safety of journalists has been addressed by United Nations organs and 
agencies through a variety of initiatives.33  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Security Council and General Assembly 
</b></p>
<p>33. The General Assembly has emphasized the need for States to ensure the respect for 
and protection of journalists while working in situations of armed conflict.34 In its 
resolution 1738 (2006), the Security Council condemned attacks against journalists, media 
professionals and associated personnel in situations of armed conflict, recalling, inter alia, 
that such persons should be considered civilians and thus respected and protected as such. 
The Council urged States and other parties to armed conflict to do their utmost to prevent 
violations of international humanitarian law against civilians, including journalists, media 
professionals and associated personnel. It also called for an end to attacks, and emphasized 
the responsibility of States to ensure accountability for serious violations of international 
humanitarian law. In its resolution, the Council also decided to address the issue of 
protection of journalists under the agenda item on the protection of civilians in armed 
conflict, and requested the Secretary-General to include, as a subitem in his reports on 
protection of civilians in armed conflict, the issue of safety and security of journalists, 
media professionals and associated personnel.35  
</p>
<p>34. In his latest report on protection of civilians, the Secretary-General highlighted the 
dangers for journalists working in the Syrian Arab Republic and during the conflict in 
Libya, reminding States of their obligation to prevent attacks against journalists and to 
prosecute those responsible for such attacks. The Secretary-General also welcomed the 
initiatives being pursued in the Human Rights Council by the Government of Austria and 
some human rights special procedures mandate holders to ensure better protection of 
journalists.36  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p>35. Since its establishment in 2006, the Human Rights Council has regularly addressed 
the issue of safety of journalists in the context of the right to freedom of expression and 
opinion.37 Resolution 21/12 was the first Council resolution to have a specific focus on 
safety of journalists.38 In that resolution, the Council expressed, inter alia, its concern 
</p>
<p>  
 33 In response to a note verbale sent to United Nations agencies, programmes and funds, and other 
</p>
<p>international and regional organizations, as well as a request for information sent to a large number of 
non-governmental organizations, responses were received from the Centre for Freedom of the Media, 
the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of Journalists and the 
International Labour Organization. 
</p>
<p> 34 See for example General Assembly resolutions 2673 (XXV), 2854 (XXVI) and 3500 (XXX) . 
 35 See also Security Council resolutions 1973 (2011), 2096 (2013) and 2093 (2013). 
 36 S/2012/376, paras 14-15. See also S/2010/579 and S/2009/277. 
 37 See Human Rights Council resolutions 7/36, 12/16, 16/4, 19/35 and 21/12. See also Commission on

 38 See also Human Rights Council resolution13/24 on the protection of journalists in situations of armed 
</p>
<p>conflict. </p>


<p>regarding ongoing violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, condemned 
in the strongest terms all attacks and violence against journalists and stressed the need to 
ensure greater protection for all media professionals and for journalistic sources. It also 
expressed its concern that attacks against journalists often occurred with impunity, and 
called upon States to ensure accountability, as well as to promote a safe and enabling 
environment for journalists to perform their work independently and without undue 
interference.  
</p>
<p>36. The safety of journalists has also been explicitly addressed by international 
commissions of inquiry recently mandated by the Human Rights Council and supported by 
OHCHR. For example, the international commission of inquiry on the situation of human 
rights in the Syrian Arab Republic documented in a recent report the targeting of 
journalists, as well as specific incidents of local and international journalists being 
arbitrarily detained, held hostage, and killed in the context of the continuing hostilities, in 
violation of both parties&#8217; obligations under international humanitarian law.39 Similarly, in 
2011, the International Commission of Inquiry to investigate all alleged violations of 
international human rights law in the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya highlighted incidents of 
serious attacks on journalists and other media professionals, including arbitrary arrest, 
torture, ill-treatment, harassment, intimidation and enforced disappearances, as well as, in 
some cases, targeted attacks.40 
</p>
<p><b> C. Special procedures and treaty bodies 
</b></p>
<p>37. The issue of safety of journalists and other media professionals is also of concern to 
special procedures and the Human Rights Committee. Several mandate holders have paid it 
significant attention in their reports, awareness-raising and advocacy-related activities (such 
as participating in expert consultations and conferences, and issuing press statements), and 
direct interventions with Governments on individual cases through the communications 
procedure.41 The issue has been a particularly important focus of the Special Rapporteur on 
the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression,42 the 
Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions43 and the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders.44 The said mandate holders have 
highlighted the detrimental impact of attacks on journalists on the full realization of the 
human rights on which they are mandated to report and advise, and have made important 
recommendations aimed at ensuring greater protection for journalists and other media 
professionals. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention45 and the Working Group on 
Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances46 have addressed, through individual or joint 
communications, cases concerning journalists that fall within the scope of their mandates.

 40 A/HRC/17/44, paras. 117, 144-154, 248 and 254. 
 41 For example, in the first 11 months of 2012, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
</p>
<p>arbitrary executions sent at least 15 communications related to attacks on the right to life of 
journalists and other media workers.

</p>
<p>549; and A/HRC/22/45 and Corr.1, paras. 140-143 and 414. </p>


<p>rights has also been dealt with by the Human Rights Committee, most particularly in its 
general comment No. 34 on article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights.47 
</p>
<p><b> D. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization  
</b></p>
<p>38. Among its other activities, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) has undertaken a number of significant initiatives to strengthen 
the protection of journalists as part of its mandate to defend freedom of expression and 
press freedom. It convened two United Nations inter-agency meetings on the safety of 
journalists and the issue of impunity in Paris (September 2011) and Vienna (November 
2012), which brought together United Nations bodies and non-governmental and 
intergovernmental organizations, independent experts, media groups and professional 
associations to formulate a strategy to address safety of journalists and impunity at the 
global and national levels.  
</p>
<p>39. The above-mentioned meetings culminated in the United Nations Plan of Action on 
the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity, developed by UNESCO in collaboration 
with OHCHR and other United Nations agencies. The objective of the Plan is to create a 
free and safe environment for journalists and media professionals in both conflict and non-
conflict situations, and to combat impunity for attacks on journalists. Its measures include 
the establishment of an inter-agency mechanism to strengthen the contribution of each 
United Nations actor to the issue of safety of journalists and enhance Organization-wide 
coherence on this issue, as well as cooperation with Member States, to develop legislation 
and other mechanisms for safeguarding journalists, establishing partnerships, awareness-
raising and fostering initiatives. 
</p>
<p>40. It is also noteworthy that, in 1993, the General Assembly followed the 
recommendation of the UNESCO General Conference by proclaiming 3 May as World 
Press Freedom Day. The day is a reminder of the importance of freedom of the press, draws 
attention to threats to that freedom around the world, including through attacks on 
journalists, and encourages initiatives to strengthen press freedom. Furthermore, since 
1997, UNESCO has advocated for and monitored the issue of the safety of journalists and 
impunity for attacks on journalists.48 In a biannual report on the safety of journalists and the 
danger of impunity, the Director-General of UNESCO documented the killing of journalists 
and the responses of State to inquiries thereon. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Other organizations 
</b></p>
<p>41. Many other governmental and non-governmental organizations and civil society 
actors are engaged in the issues of promotion of freedom of expression and the protection 
of journalists. 
</p>
<p>42. Regional mechanisms tasked with promoting and protecting freedom of expression 
include protection of journalists as a main concern.49 In 1997, the Organization of American 
</p>
<p>

Communication No. 1128/2002 (CCPR/C/83/D/1128/2002). 
</p>
<p> 48 See resolution 29 of the UNESCO General Conference, November 1997. 
 49 See the joint declaration of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion and expression and regional special rapporteurs on freedom of expression made 
 </p>


<p>States established an office of the Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression, which, 
inter alia, advises the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the evaluation of individual 
petitions, prepares country and annual reports in which it makes recommendations to 
Member States on addressing violence against journalists,50 conducts on-site visits and 
undertakes awareness-raising activities, such as publicly condemning attacks against 
journalists. Also in 1997, OSCE established the mandate of Representative on Freedom of 
the Media to provide early warnings on violations of freedom of expression and to advocate 
full compliance with OSCE principles and commitments regarding freedom of expression 
and the media. In 2011, it issued the OSCE Safety of Journalists Guidebook, which sets out 
good practices for addressing the safety of journalists. In 2004, the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights established the mandate of Special Rapporteur on Freedom of 
Expression and Access to Information in Africa. 
</p>
<p>43. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Human 
Rights have found that attacks on journalists violate the right to freedom of expression and 
many other rights, and that there are positive obligations on States to protect journalists, 
and to carry out effective investigations into alleged attacks.51 In September 2012, the Inter-
American Court issued its most extensive ruling yet on State obligations regarding violence 
against journalists in the <i>V&#233;lez Restrepo</i> case,52 ordering the State to provide a wide range 
of reparations to the victim and his family, including ongoing protection, the payment of 
medical costs, an effective investigation into events, damages, and training for the armed 
forces on the right to freedom of thought and expression and the role of journalists and 
social commentators.  
</p>
<p>44. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) plays a significant role in the 
protection of journalists and other media professionals in situations of armed conflict. As 
noted in its response, since 1985, ICRC has operated a hotline for journalists deployed in 
dangerous situations by which journalists who are wounded, detained or missing, their 
families and media organizations can request assistance from ICRC. ICRC also conducts, 
often in cooperation with other organizations, training on international humanitarian law 
and first aid for media professionals. In November 2011, the 31st International Conference 
of the Red Cross and Red Crescent adopted the Four-Year Action Plan for the 
Implementation of International Humanitarian Law, in which the importance of journalists 
was reaffirmed and recommendations aimed at the protection of journalists in situations of 
armed conflict were made. 
</p>
<p>45. Non-governmental organizations and civil society actors also play an important role 
in documenting violence against journalists, raising awareness, reporting, assisting in 
legislative and policy development related to protection of journalists, training and taking 
steps to address violence, including by providing direct assistance.

challenge to freedom of expression.

<p>46. As described in its response, the International Federation of Journalists has 
developed a database that acts as an early warning system by providing information about 
potential acts and threats of violence against journalists. Moreover, a network of regional 
and country-specific unions facilitates the exchange of information and coordination of 
action. The Federation also pointed out that it worked with journalists and Governments to 
help to relocate and protect journalists. It could provide immediate financial relief to 
journalists and their families who have been victims of violence or received threats of 
violence, through the International Safety Fund. With regard to awareness-raising, it has 
developed handbooks on international law and humanitarian law for journalists, and has a 
practice of making public statements when journalists are attacked or when a Government 
fails to respond a threat or an attack. The Federation is also involved in bringing cases 
before regional mechanisms where national authorities are unwilling to undertake the 
necessary investigations and prosecutions. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Good practices for the safety of journalists 
</b></p>
<p>47. Ensuring that journalists and other media professionals can effectively carry out 
their work requires the prevention of threats and attacks against them and ensuring 
accountability, as well as creating an environment in which independent, free and 
pluralistic media can operate.  
</p>
<p>48. The good practices for the safety of journalists described below were identified 
through a thorough review of State practices, including those provided in response to the 
note verbale dated 11 January 2013 addressed by OHCHR to States, recommendations 
made by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
opinion and expression and those made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders, as well as the good practices previously highlighted by international, 
regional and non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors. 
</p>
<p>49. The good practices indicate that an effective approach to the protection of journalists 
depends on political commitment supported by clear and effective legislative and practical 
safeguards to prevent threats and attacks against journalists and to ensure accountability. 
The exact nature of each given system for protection may differ, as each system must be 
tailored to address the varying causes of the violence that exist in each context and to meet 
local needs, including the needs of the journalists affected and other media professionals.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Political commitment 
</b></p>
<p>50. Unequivocal political commitment to ensuring that journalists can carry out their 
work safely is a critical prerequisite to any system of protection. In this regard, a clear 
public position should be taken at the highest levels of government regarding the important 
role of journalists in society and the need to ensure their full protection from violations of 
their rights. States should also support and facilitate the work of media organizations and 
civil society groups that are concerned with the protection of journalists and freedom of 
expression. 
</p>
<p>51. Policies for ensuring the safety of journalists and other media professionals, zero 
tolerance of any form of violence against journalists, and full accountability for any such 
violence should be comprehensively integrated into all levels of government at the local, 
national, regional and international levels. States should ensure that a gender-sensitive 
approach is taken when formulating and implementing such policies.  </p>


<p><b> B. Legislative measures 
</b></p>
<p>52. Political commitment must also be translated into the design, promulgation and full 
implementation of laws for the protection of journalists in accordance with States&#8217; 
international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>53. National laws must provide special protection for journalists in due recognition of 
their public function through, for example, amendments to civil and criminal codes. 
Consideration may be given to incorporating, by law, journalists and other media 
professionals into any existing legal framework for the protection of human rights 
defenders. 
</p>
<p>54. Progressive laws protecting the right to freedom of opinion and expression are 
essential. Any restriction on the right must be provided by law, only imposed for one of the 
grounds set out article 19(3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and 
be necessary and proportionate. Any restriction should also be formulated with sufficient 
precision to enable an individual to adjust his or her conduct accordingly, and be easily 
accessible to the public. Measures criminalizing any form of freedom of expression should 
be revoked, except insofar as they constitute permissible and legitimate restrictions. States 
should also ensure that legislative measures, such as counter-terrorism or national security 
laws, cannot be used to threaten or undermine the safety of journalists.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Combating impunity measures 
</b></p>
<p>55. Ensuring accountability for attacks against journalists is a key element in preventing 
future attacks; failure to do so could violate a State&#8217;s human rights obligations and 
contribute to the culture of impunity that perpetuates violence. It may also be interpreted as 
tolerance of or acquiescence to violence on the part of the State. As such, the investigation 
and prosecution of all attacks against journalists through an effective and functioning 
domestic criminal justice system and the provision of remedies to the victims are 
imperative.  
</p>
<p>56.  Investigations into suspected attacks should be carried out by a special investigative 
unit or an independent national mechanism, particularly in countries where there is a high 
incidence of reported attacks against journalists. Such a unit or mechanism should be 
established by law and empowered to monitor and carry out investigations into cases and 
issues related to the protection of journalists and other media professionals. It may also be 
empowered to coordinate policy and action between different government authorities, and 
have the competency to make recommendations to the Government. The unit or mechanism 
must be sufficiently resourced and staff should be appropriately trained to ensure that it 
operates independently and effectively. Journalists and civil society organizations should be 
able to participate in the design, functioning and evaluation of such a body.  
</p>
<p>57. Investigations into suspected attacks against journalists should be conducted 
effectively, promptly, thoroughly, independently and impartially. This can be facilitated 
through the development of protocols and methods by police and prosecutors. During 
investigations, any link between the suspected attack and the journalist&#8217;s professional 
</p>
<p>activities should be considered. Where the evidence requires, the person allegedly 
responsible for the attack must be prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>58. Information-gathering mechanisms, such as databases, should be established to 
permit the gathering of verified information about threats and attacks against journalists. 
The information collected should not only inform policy development and the assessment 
of necessary protective measures, but also contribute to prosecutions. Where civil society 
groups have established such information-gathering mechanisms, cooperation between </p>


<p>them and the State to facilitate the use of information to strengthen accountability processes 
is strongly encouraged.  
</p>
<p>59. States should also cooperate with any regional accountability mechanisms, including 
human rights courts, addressing cases of attacks on journalists. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Protection measures 
</b></p>
<p>60. There is a wide range of initiatives that the State can adopt to protect journalists and 
other media professionals through prevention, as well as reducing the impact of attacks. 
The issuing of immediate and unequivocal public condemnations of any attacks against 
journalists and other media professionals is an important measure.  
</p>
<p>61. Training is a key aspect of prevention. As a matter of standard procedure, training 
should be provided to law enforcement personnel and the military, prosecutors and the 
judiciary regarding their obligations under international human rights law and international 
humanitarian law, and how to ensure effective fulfilment of those obligations. Such training 
may also focus on dealing with particular areas of risk for journalists, such as protests and 
public events, in accordance with international human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>62. Training should also be provided to members of the armed forces and journalist and 
media organizations regarding international human rights and international humanitarian 
law obligations applicable during armed conflict, the legitimacy of the presence of 
journalists during situations of armed conflict, and practices and procedures to minimize 
risks to journalists. Collaboration with international and regional organizations and civil 
society in providing such training could greatly enhance their effectiveness.  
</p>
<p>63. State authorities should investigate promptly and thoroughly all reports of threats 
against journalists, and take any necessary and appropriate steps to ensure that the 
individual is protected from further threats and/or physical attack. In this respect, the 
protection of journalists can be significantly strengthened through the establishment of an 
early warning and rapid response mechanism to give journalists and other media 
professionals, if threatened, immediate access to the authorities and protective measures. 
The mechanism should be an official State entity with high-level recognition and be 
sufficiently funded to function effectively. It should be established in consultation with 
journalists and other media professionals and organizations, and have the confidence of the 
media community. Once established, the mechanism should be composed of representatives 
from relevant State organs concerned with law enforcement and human rights, together 
with representatives from civil society, including journalist and media organizations.  
</p>
<p>64. Access to the mechanism should be available to all journalists and other media 
professionals, and particularly those working on high-risk issues, such as corruption and 
organized crime. Following any determination that an individual needs protection, the 
mechanism should be able to provide material measures of protection, including mobile 
telephones and bulletproof vests, as well as establish safe havens and emergency evacuation 
or relocation to safe parts of the country or other countries through a protection programme. 
Such programmes, including witness protection programmes, must operate efficiently and 
on a rapid-response basis, and should not be used in such a way as to unduly restrict the 
work of journalists and other media professionals. In countries where attacks against 
journalists are of particular concern, States should seriously consider establishing special 
protection programmes in consultation with journalists and civil society. 
</p>
<p>65. Where early warning systems, such as hotlines or 24-hour emergency contact points, 
have been established by media organizations or civil society, States should facilitate 
immediate assistance for individuals identified at risk and their families. </p>


<p>66. Where attacks have been committed, States should take steps to mitigate their 
impact, including by providing such services as free medical care, psychological support 
and legal services, as well as assistance in relocating journalists and their families. States 
may also establish or contribute to funds or other mechanisms that provide support to 
families of journalists who have been killed, including financial support, education grants, 
and medical and psychological treatment. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Awareness-raising measures 
</b></p>
<p>67. Initiatives for raising public awareness about the issue of safety of journalists and a 
zero-tolerance approach to violence against journalists should be implemented at the local 
and national levels, including by incorporating the issue of safety of journalists in formal 
public education programmes. Such activities could also include establishing national 
observance days to highlight the role of, and dangers faced by, journalists, and publicly 
promoting World Press Freedom Day.  
</p>
<p>68. States should also promote the issue of the safety of journalists within 
intergovernmental organizations, including the Human Rights Council, and regional and 
international organizations, as well as through regional and international conferences and 
meetings. States may also consider providing support to awareness-raising and information-
sharing activities carried out by international and regional organizations and civil society 
groups.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>In all societies, journalists and other media professionals play a critical role, 
which is, however, seriously undermined by the violence that many journalists 
</b></p>
<p><b>experience in the course of carrying out their professional duties. The threats and 
</b></p>
<p><b>attacks against them constitute violations, including gross violations, of fundamental 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights; they also function to intimidate and silence journalists and other media 
</b></p>
<p><b>professionals with a significant and highly troubling impact on the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>expression and opinion.  
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>It is incumbent on States to ensure the safety of journalists through the 
implementation and enforcement of existing norms and standards. As such, first and 
</b></p>
<p><b>foremost, States should implement their obligations under international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>law and international humanitarian law to ensure the rights of journalists and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>media professionals, including through the full respect of the right to freedom of 
</b></p>
<p><b>opinion and expression, as well as the other fundamental rights of all journalists and 
</b></p>
<p><b>other media professionals.  
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The good practices described in the present report include key elements of a 
framework for a safe and enabling environment in which journalists and other media 
</b></p>
<p><b>professionals may carry out their work unhindered. The exact nature of each given 
</b></p>
<p><b>system for protection may differ among States. Essential components include a firm 
</b></p>
<p><b>political commitment that translates into clear and effective legislative measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>prevent threats and attacks against journalists and other media professionals, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>accountability in all cases of attack.
