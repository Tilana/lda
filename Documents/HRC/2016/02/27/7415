<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report covers the period from December 2013 to December 2014 and is 
</p>
<p>submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 67/152, in which the Assembly 
</p>
<p>requested the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed 
</p>
<p>Conflict to submit a report to the Human Rights Council on the activities undertaken in 
</p>
<p>fulfilment of her mandate, including information on progress achieved, challenges in the 
</p>
<p>children and armed conflict agenda and her field visits. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Progress and challenges in addressing grave violations 
against children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>2. Unprecedented challenges for the protection of tens of millions of children growing 
</p>
<p>up in countries affected by conflict materialized in 2014. In particular, children in six 
</p>
<p>countries affected by major crises, namely, the Central African Republic, the State of 
</p>
<p>Palestine, Iraq, Nigeria, South Sudan and the Syrian Arab Republic, were exposed to the 
</p>
<p>most egregious violations. In most of those countries, conflict was characterized by 
</p>
<p>extremist ideology, sectarian, ethnic or religious divisions that challenged the response 
</p>
<p>capacity of national authorities and the international community. Those conflicts added to 
</p>
<p>existing challenges from protracted conflicts, such as in Afghanistan, the Democratic 
</p>
<p>Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Yemen, where grave violations against children 
</p>
<p>continued.  
</p>
<p>3. Among the events that shocked the world&#8217;s conscience were the abduction and/or 
</p>
<p>killing by Boko Haram of hundreds of girls and boys from their schools in north-eastern 
</p>
<p>Nigeria. The group&#8217;s brutal tactics, total disregard for basic human rights and targeted 
</p>
<p>attacks against schools have had regional repercussions on the education of children. In Iraq 
</p>
<p>and the Syrian Arab Republic, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and other 
</p>
<p>groups espousing extremist ideologies also used extreme violence that directly or indirectly 
</p>
<p>targeted children. Moreover, some of ISIL propaganda materials broadcast through web and 
</p>
<p>social media featured sexual exploitation of Yazidi girls, religious indoctrination of 
</p>
<p>children and the use of child soldiers. Efforts to counter extremist groups have also posed 
</p>
<p>serious issues for the safety and well-being of children, with State-allied militias engaging 
</p>
<p>in uncontrolled or loosely-controlled mobilization, resulting in many boys, and sometimes 
</p>
<p>girls, being used in support roles and even as combatants.  
</p>
<p>4. The recruitment and use of children became endemic in the conflicts in South Sudan 
</p>
<p>and the Central African Republic. In both cases, ethnic and/or religious divisions, fuelled 
</p>
<p>by power struggles, resulted in killing and maiming, sexual violence and other grave 
</p>
<p>violations against thousands of children. The right to education and health, already weak in 
</p>
<p>both countries, has been seriously compromised.  
</p>
<p>5. There remained no end in sight for the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, and 
</p>
<p>children continued to bear the brunt of the violence. In the State of Palestine, at least 539 
</p>
<p>children were reportedly killed during the Israeli military operations launched in Gaza 
</p>
<p>between 8 July and 26 August 2014. Thousands more were injured and suffered life-long 
</p>
<p>disabilities or lost family members, homes, schools and hospitals in the bombings. The 
</p>
<p>situation in Libya and Yemen is equally alarming.  
</p>
<p>6. In all of those countries, children were killed, maimed, abducted, sexually abused, 
</p>
<p>and recruited and used by armed forces or groups. Their schools and hospitals came under 
</p>
<p>attack and they were too often denied access to vital humanitarian assistance. We have seen 
</p>
<p>the highest number of displaced persons since the Second World War, including millions of </p>


<p>children. Whether displaced within or outside of their home countries, children are 
</p>
<p>particularly vulnerable and face additional challenges in relation to access to health care 
</p>
<p>and education. In some cases, Government response to conflict, through their own armed 
</p>
<p>forces or militias, created additional risks for children. 
</p>
<p>7. The proliferation of crises, coupled with the imperative to provide adequate 
</p>
<p>assistance to children in countries affected by protracted conflict, has put the United 
</p>
<p>Nations response mechanisms to the test. Despite all our efforts, hundreds of thousands of 
</p>
<p>children have dire protection needs. Responding to the long-term psychological impact and 
</p>
<p>reintegrating children formerly associated with armed forces and groups will require more 
</p>
<p>resources than are available today. The needs of children exposed to the violence carried 
</p>
<p>out by extremist groups will pose even greater challenges to which we must prepare a 
</p>
<p>structured and coordinated response. At the end of this difficult year, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative concluded that, more than ever, children &#8212; often the majority of the 
</p>
<p>population in countries affected by conflict &#8212; continue to be the most vulnerable to the 
</p>
<p>impact of war. 
</p>
<p>8. To contribute to the system-wide response, the Special Representative strengthened 
</p>
<p>her collaboration with United Nations partners to foster accountability for perpetrators of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations by improving the monitoring and reporting of grave violations 
</p>
<p>against children. She used every opportunity and fora to bring the plight of children to the 
</p>
<p>forefront and to provide information on human rights violations committed against them. In 
</p>
<p>reaction to the increase in attacks against schools and hospitals, she launched a guidance 
</p>
<p>note on the topic to strengthen United Nations response through effective use of the tools 
</p>
<p>provided by the Security Council. 
</p>
<p>9. Addressing grave violations of children&#8217;s rights is imperative and all parties to 
</p>
<p>conflict who commit crimes must be held to account. In 2014, progress in ensuring that 
</p>
<p>appropriate judicial responses were in place to address grave violations against children 
</p>
<p>during conflicts was observed at national and international levels. However, the wave of 
</p>
<p>violence that has occurred against children, particularly as perpetrated by extremist groups, 
</p>
<p>has compounded the challenge of addressing accountability comprehensively, due to the 
</p>
<p>breakdown of law and order in the areas under their control. 
</p>
<p>10. Despite the daunting challenges that lay ahead, years of constructive engagement 
</p>
<p>with parties to conflict to end the recruitment and use of children are starting to bear fruit. 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative welcomes the emergence of a consensus among the 
</p>
<p>governments of the world that children do not belong in armed forces, especially in 
</p>
<p>conflict. The Special Representative seized the opportunity to turn the page on the 
</p>
<p>recruitment and use of children by government forces and launched, jointly with the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), the campaign &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221;. The campaign 
</p>
<p>aims to end and prevent the recruitment of children by government forces, by the end of 
</p>
<p>2016. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Working with United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>11. The Special Representative considers Human Rights Council mechanisms and tools 
</p>
<p>as a key apparatus for addressing the plethora of challenges that all actors face to protect 
</p>
<p>children in armed conflict. In September 2014, at the invitation of the President of the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council, the Special Representative briefed the Special Session of the 
</p>
<p>Council on the situation in Iraq, which provided an important opportunity to highlight 
</p>
<p>violations of the rights of children. The Special Representative commends the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Council for its decision, affirmed in resolution 7/29, to integrate the rights of the 
</p>
<p>child in its work and in the work of its mechanisms in a regular, systematic and transparent </p>


<p>manner and to dedicate at least one full-day meeting annually to discuss different themes on 
</p>
<p>children&#8217;s rights.  
</p>
<p>12. The Office of the Special Representative continued to work in close collaboration 
</p>
<p>with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 
</p>
<p>with a view to mainstreaming children and armed conflict in the work of the treaty bodies, 
</p>
<p>special procedures and other human rights mechanisms. In the same vein, recommendations 
</p>
<p>relating to children and armed conflict formulated by United Nations human rights 
</p>
<p>mechanisms were important advocacy tools in the work of the Special Representative. On 
</p>
<p>regular occasions in 2014, the Special Representative met with the Chair and members of 
</p>
<p>the Committee on the Rights of the Child to improve the exchange of information and 
</p>
<p>encourage joint advocacy with respect to children affected by armed conflict. The Office of 
</p>
<p>the Special Representative also provided information on the rights of children in specific 
</p>
<p>conflict-affected country situations, ahead of universal period reviews. The Special 
</p>
<p>Representative encourages the Committee to continue to integrate the monitoring of grave 
</p>
<p>violations and to mainstream accountability in its consideration of States parties&#8217; reports. 
</p>
<p>During the reporting period the Special Representative also met with the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Special Envoy for Global Education. Moreover, the Special Representative 
</p>
<p>engaged with the United Nations commissions of inquiry for the Central African Republic 
</p>
<p>and the Syrian Arab Republic to share information pertaining to grave violations against 
</p>
<p>children and to emphasize the importance of strengthening investigations into grave 
</p>
<p>violations of children&#8217;s rights. 
</p>
<p>13. The Special Representative and her Office also strengthened their relationship with a 
</p>
<p>number of United Nations coordination mechanisms on human rights. The Office is a 
</p>
<p>member of the Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group and works to integrate child 
</p>
<p>protection concerns by highlighting the need for accountability. To that end, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative attended the Rule of Law Coordination and Resource Group Principals 
</p>
<p>Retreat in Long Island, New York, in May 2014. The Office of the Special Representative 
</p>
<p>is also a member of the Human Rights Up Front initiative and participated in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the initiative&#8217;s workplan through the subworking groups, on topics such 
</p>
<p>as information management and training. The Office periodically contributed to a number 
</p>
<p>of regional quarterly reviews and the Special Representative participated in meetings of the 
</p>
<p>Senior Advisory Group on situations included in the children and armed conflict agenda. 
</p>
<p>Lastly, as a member of the review group on the United Nations Human Rights Due 
</p>
<p>Diligence Policy, the Special Representative emphasized the links with the children and 
</p>
<p>armed conflict mandate, including where elements of action plans can inform risk 
</p>
<p>assessments. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Ending the recruitment and use of children in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. </b>&#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign<b> 
</b></p>
<p>14. In March 2014, the Special Representative, together with UNICEF, launched the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign to end the recruitment and use of children by 
</p>
<p>government security forces by the end of 2016. The campaign, endorsed by the Security 
</p>
<p>Council in resolution 2143 and welcomed by the General Assembly, aims to mobilize 
</p>
<p>political support, provide technical assistance and assist listed governments who are 
</p>
<p>committed to implementing an action plan and taking the necessary measures to ensure that 
</p>
<p>their security forces do not recruit or use children. </p>


<p>15. At its launch, all eight governments listed in the annexes to the Secretary-General&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>report on children and armed conflict (A/68/878-S/2014/339) endorsed the campaign, 
</p>
<p>namely Afghanistan, Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar, Somalia, 
</p>
<p>South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen. Six of them had already committed to ending and 
</p>
<p>preventing the recruitment of children and signed action plans with the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>Action plans are Security Council-mandated agreements between a party to conflict and the 
</p>
<p>United Nations that identify actions and measures to end and prevent grave violations 
</p>
<p>against children. 
</p>
<p>16. The &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign has gained momentum in the short time 
</p>
<p>since its launch. In May 2014, the Government of Yemen signed an Action Plan with the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, committing to ensure that their national security forces do not recruit or use 
</p>
<p>children. Chad completed all the requirements under its Action Plan and was delisted from 
</p>
<p>the annexes of the Secretary-General&#8217;s annual report on children and armed conflict in 
</p>
<p>2014. South Sudan recommitted to the Action Plan that it had signed in 2012 and, despite 
</p>
<p>the ongoing crisis, a national launch of the campaign was held on 29 October 2014. The 
</p>
<p>Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo made steady progress in the 
</p>
<p>implementation of its Action Plan, particularly with regard to giving the United Nations 
</p>
<p>access to military facilities and universal screening of recruits; it appointed a personal 
</p>
<p>advisor to the President on sexual violence and child recruitment. In August 2014, the 
</p>
<p>Government of Afghanistan confirmed its commitment to the campaign with the 
</p>
<p>endorsement of a &#8220;Road Map Towards Compliance,&#8221; which detailed 15 measures to fully 
</p>
<p>implement the Action Plan signed with the United Nations in 2011. In Myanmar, 376 
</p>
<p>children were released from the ranks of the Tatmadaw since the beginning of 2014. 
</p>
<p>Implementation monitoring is undertaken and dialogue held between the Government of 
</p>
<p>Myanmar and the United Nations every six months. In Somalia, a child protection unit has 
</p>
<p>been established in the Somalia Armed Forces and the Somali authorities put in place 
</p>
<p>mechanisms for the handover to the United Nations of children found in the ranks of its 
</p>
<p>army. Dialogue is ongoing with the Sudanese Government, which has expressed its 
</p>
<p>commitment to ensuring security forces without the presence of children. 
</p>
<p>17. The &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign reached out to United Nations Member 
</p>
<p>States and other actors to mobilize political and practical support. In May 2014, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative chaired a meeting, convened by the Embassy of Luxembourg and the 
</p>
<p>African Union Peace and Security Council, in Addis Ababa, in which the five African 
</p>
<p>States concerned by the &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign participated. The meeting 
</p>
<p>focused on specific challenges, best practices and strategies towards ending the recruitment 
</p>
<p>and use of children by government forces. In June 2014, the United Kingdom of Great 
</p>
<p>Britain and Northern Ireland invited the Special Representative to participate in a closed-
</p>
<p>door ministerial round table on ending the recruitment and use of children by armed forces. 
</p>
<p>In September 2014, also at the invitation of the United Kingdom, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative moderated a round table on the margins of the General Assembly, in New 
</p>
<p>York, to share experiences and discuss the next steps in the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>campaign. The event was attended by Ministers of Foreign Affairs and representatives of 
</p>
<p>Afghanistan, Chad, Liberia, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, 
</p>
<p>Yemen, as well as the African Union Peace and Security Commissioner. Also in September 
</p>
<p>2014, the Office of the Special Representative and UNICEF collaborated with a number of 
</p>
<p>non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to organize a one-day workshop on ways to 
</p>
<p>support the campaign and harness complementarity between different actors to support the 
</p>
<p>implementation of action plans at national level. In Geneva, the Special Representative held 
</p>
<p>a consultative workshop with the NGO Focus Group on Children Affected by Armed 
</p>
<p>Conflict to take stock of the progress of the campaign and discuss best practices and lessons 
</p>
<p>learned in countries concerned. The &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign has also reached </p>


<p>out to regional organizations to mobilize support with regard to expertise, advocacy and 
</p>
<p>capacity-building.  
</p>
<p>18. The momentum generated by the &#8220;Children, Not Soldiers&#8221; campaign is encouraging. 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative continues to reach out to Member States and all relevant 
</p>
<p>partners to mobilize political, technical and financial support to fully implement the action 
</p>
<p>plans and reach the objective of no children in government forces in conflict by 2016. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Progress with non-State armed groups 
</b></p>
<p>19. Despite the ongoing challenges in respect of access to and dialogue with non-State 
</p>
<p>armed groups to end grave violations against children, the number of public statements and 
</p>
<p>command orders issued by armed groups prohibiting the recruitment and use of children 
</p>
<p>has increased. That trend was observed in a number of situations and provided a basis for 
</p>
<p>building momentum to address grave violations against children by armed groups.  
</p>
<p>20. Fifty-one armed groups are included in the lists annexed to the report of the 
</p>
<p>Secretary-General on children and armed conflict (A/68/878-S/2014/339). Those groups are 
</p>
<p>very diverse in nature, which requires different strategies of engagement, and the 
</p>
<p>implementation of child protection commitments may vary considerably. Advocacy 
</p>
<p>strategies require the identification of specific incentives based on the military structure, 
</p>
<p>size, modus operandi and other characteristics of armed groups. Taking those aspects into 
</p>
<p>account, concrete commitments are then identified by the United Nations and translated 
</p>
<p>into activities and measures with the armed group concerned, culminating in an agreed 
</p>
<p>action plan.  
</p>
<p>21. A multi-dimensional approach is also required to engage non-State armed groups to 
</p>
<p>advocate for compliance with international human rights and humanitarian law by all 
</p>
<p>parties to a conflict. In that spirit, the Special Representative continued to engage with 
</p>
<p>mediators, special envoys and regional organizations to integrate the protection of children 
</p>
<p>into peace-making initiatives on a case-by-case basis. During the reporting period, the 
</p>
<p>Special Representative maintained dialogue with the Special Envoy for the Great Lakes 
</p>
<p>Region, the former Joint Special Representative of the United Nations and the League of 
</p>
<p>Arab States for Syria, the Deputy Mediator of the Intergovernmental Authority on 
</p>
<p>Development (IGAD) for South Sudan, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on 
</p>
<p>Yemen and representatives of the Gulf Initiative. She also engaged regularly with mediators 
</p>
<p>involved in peace efforts, including representatives of third-party governments, the African 
</p>
<p>Union, the Economic Community of Central African States, IGAD and the United Nations.  
</p>
<p>22. That approach has assisted in the effort to gain commitments and positive 
</p>
<p>developments from a number of non-State actors on the recruitment and use of children and 
</p>
<p>the prevention of other grave violations throughout the reporting period. In the Philippines, 
</p>
<p>during the course of 2014, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front renewed its commitment to its 
</p>
<p>Action Plan to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children, which was signed in 
</p>
<p>August 2009.  
</p>
<p>23. In the Central African Republic, the United Nations successfully advocated with 
</p>
<p>both the ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka and the anti-Balaka groups. The ex-S&#233;l&#233;ka leadership committed to take 
</p>
<p>measures against the recruitment and use of children and disseminated command orders 
</p>
<p>among its ranks with the support of the United Nations, which resulted in the release and 
</p>
<p>separation of over 70 children. Dialogue continued with field commanders of anti-Balaka 
</p>
<p>units, resulting in the separation of children in several instances. Discussions were also held 
</p>
<p>with United Nations and African Union partners to ensure that commitments to end the 
</p>
<p>recruitment and use of children and other grave violations against children would be </p>


<p>included in a political settlement. Protection concerns were included in the Accord de 
</p>
<p>cessation des hostilit&#233;s en R&#233;publique centrafricaine signed on 23 July 2014. 
</p>
<p>24. In Sudan, following advocacy by the United Nations, several non-State actors issued 
</p>
<p>command orders or launched internal sensitization campaigns on the protection of children 
</p>
<p>and the prohibition of their recruitment and use. In August 2014, Minni Minnawi, leader of 
</p>
<p>a faction of the Sudan Liberation Army, further operationalized its commitment by putting 
</p>
<p>in place a mechanism to end the recruitment and use of child soldiers. A community-based 
</p>
<p>strategic plan was also initiated by Sheikh Musa Hilal and endorsed by the leaders of five 
</p>
<p>tribes. The strategic plan was designed to curb the use of children as fighters in inter- and 
</p>
<p>intra-ethnic clashes. 
</p>
<p>25. The Special Representative met in Addis Ababa, in May 2014, with the former Vice 
</p>
<p>President of South Sudan and leader of the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Movement/Army in 
</p>
<p>Opposition, Riek Machar, to whom she relayed her concerns regarding reports of large 
</p>
<p>numbers of children recruited and used, killed, maimed or raped by his forces. She obtained 
</p>
<p>a signed commitment to end the recruitment and use of children and all grave violations 
</p>
<p>against children, and command orders were issued following the meeting. However, at the 
</p>
<p>time of reporting, the commitment had yet to be implemented and violations against 
</p>
<p>children continued unabated by both sides. 
</p>
<p>26. In Mali, the joint leadership of the Mouvement national pour la lib&#233;ration de 
</p>
<p>l&#8217;Azawad and the Mouvement arabe de l&#8217;Azawad signed command orders prohibiting the 
</p>
<p>six grave violations against children and granted screening access to the United Nations. 
</p>
<p>Dialogue with other armed groups is ongoing. Armed groups also came forward in the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic, pledging to end and prevent the recruitment and use of children as 
</p>
<p>well as other grave violations, including attacks on schools and hospitals, and the military 
</p>
<p>use of schools. In Yemen, the United Nations country task force on monitoring and 
</p>
<p>reporting engaged with the Al-Houthi armed group and maintained dialogue over a draft 
</p>
<p>action plan, despite the challenging security developments. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Detention 
</b></p>
<p>27. The detention of children without criminal charge or on national security charges 
</p>
<p>constitutes a growing challenge and a grave concern for the Special Representative, and is 
</p>
<p>present in nearly all situations that fall within the scope of her mandate. The challenge has 
</p>
<p>been compounded by the response of governments to extremist groups and the changing 
</p>
<p>perceptions of the status of combatants within the counter-terrorism framework. 
</p>
<p>Governments holding children for their alleged or actual association with radical armed 
</p>
<p>groups no longer view them primarily as victims of armed conflict but often consider the 
</p>
<p>children as security threats. Many counter-terrorism strategies typically comprise the long-
</p>
<p>term deprivation of liberty and solitary confinement of individuals involved in perceived or 
</p>
<p>actual terrorist activities, which not only violates their rights to a fair trial but also has a 
</p>
<p>particularly devastating psychological impact on children. The impact of treating children 
</p>
<p>recruited and used by armed groups as security threats compounds the challenge of 
</p>
<p>addressing reintegration. 
</p>
<p>28. The problem of children detained by government authorities is also present in 
</p>
<p>situations in which there is little threat from extremists. Children arrested or captured in the 
</p>
<p>course of more conventional military operations are often held in poor conditions and 
</p>
<p>detained without being brought before a judge or granted access to a lawyer. If children are 
</p>
<p>prosecuted for acts allegedly committed during their involvement with an armed group, the 
</p>
<p>courts do not apply basic standards of fair trial and juvenile justice standards. Military 
</p>
<p>courts are particularly inappropriate forums for hearing cases involving children, given that </p>


<p>they do not fully recognize the special status of juveniles in conflict with the law. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, when deprived of their liberty, children are vulnerable to human rights 
</p>
<p>violations, including sexual abuse, degrading and inhumane treatment and, in some 
</p>
<p>instances, torture. 
</p>
<p>29. Despite the challenges, agreements have been reached with a number of 
</p>
<p>governments to ensure that detained children are handed over to the United Nations. In 
</p>
<p>March 2014, a standard operating procedure for the handover of children formerly 
</p>
<p>associated with armed forces and groups was adopted by the Government of Somalia. An 
</p>
<p>agreement for the handover of children formerly associated with armed forces and groups 
</p>
<p>was also reached with the African Union Mission in Somalia. On 10 September 2014, the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the Government of Chad signed a protocol on the handover of children 
</p>
<p>associated with armed forces and groups, which includes specific provisions regulating 
</p>
<p>detention. Those procedures build on the progress made with protocols for the handover of 
</p>
<p>children formerly associated with armed forces and groups in the Democratic Republic of 
</p>
<p>the Congo and in Mali signed in 2013.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Representative calls upon the Human Rights Council to use all available 
</p>
<p>tools to promote alternatives to the prosecution and detention of children for their alleged 
</p>
<p>association with armed groups, in particular under counter-terrorism responses. In that 
</p>
<p>regard, she commends the work of the Human Rights Council on detention and welcomes 
</p>
<p>the panel discussion at the 27th session of the Council on the protection of the human rights 
</p>
<p>of persons deprived of their liberty. The Special Representative attended the global 
</p>
<p>consultation on the right to challenge the lawfulness of detention before court, organized by 
</p>
<p>the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in Geneva, on 1 and 2 September 2014. The 
</p>
<p>Working Group will submit draft basic principles and guidelines to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council in 2015. The Special Representative anticipates that those documents will address 
</p>
<p>the impact of detention on children in armed conflict. Lastly, the Special Representative 
</p>
<p>welcomes the invitation by the General Assembly, in resolution 69/157 of 18 December 
</p>
<p>2014, to request the Secretary-General to commission an in-depth global study on children 
</p>
<p>deprived of their liberty, conducted in close cooperation with relevant United Nations 
</p>
<p>partners, including the Office of the Special Representative. The study will aim to 
</p>
<p>formulate recommendations for action to effectively realize the rights of the child and will 
</p>
<p>be submitted to the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Attacks on schools and hospitals 
</b></p>
<p>31. Attacks on schools and hospitals are becoming an all-too familiar aspect of conflict, 
</p>
<p>depriving millions of children of their right to education and health. The Special 
</p>
<p>Representative remained deeply concerned by the increasing number of attacks on schools 
</p>
<p>and hospitals, despite their protected status under international law. In almost every 
</p>
<p>situation relating to the children and armed conflict agenda, the right to education and 
</p>
<p>health was gravely affected by attacks on and the widespread military use of schools and 
</p>
<p>hospitals as well as by attacks and threats of attacks against teachers and doctors. In many 
</p>
<p>situations, such as in Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Israel and the State of Palestine and the 
</p>
<p>Syrian Arab Republic, parties to conflict destroyed schools and hospitals by indiscriminate 
</p>
<p>shelling of civilian areas or in targeted attacks against education facilities, teachers, school 
</p>
<p>children, health workers and clinics. In 2014, we witnessed attacks on schools and 
</p>
<p>ideological opposition to standard school curricula in places as varied as Iraq, Nigeria, 
</p>
<p>Pakistan, southern Thailand, Somalia and the Syrian Arab Republic. Attempts by certain 
</p>
<p>groups to radicalize teachings or exclude girls or minorities from education pose an even 
</p>
<p>greater risk to the fundamental right of all children to an education. Health centres and </p>


<p>health workers were also targeted, leading to the resurgence of preventable diseases, such 
</p>
<p>as polio. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>32. In recent years, the international community has become increasingly aware of the 
</p>
<p>impact on children of attacks on schools and hospitals and taken important steps to protect 
</p>
<p>those institutions. The Security Council recognized this important aspect in its resolutions 
</p>
<p>1998, and requested the Secretary-General to list in the annexes of his annual reports on 
</p>
<p>children and armed conflict the armed forces and groups who attack schools and/or 
</p>
<p>hospitals and related protected persons. In resolution 2143, the Security Council called for 
</p>
<p>enhanced monitoring of the military use of schools. To better implement those resolutions, 
</p>
<p>the Special Representative, together with UNICEF, World Health Organization (WHO) and 
</p>
<p>United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), published 
</p>
<p>the guidance note &#8220;Protect Schools and Hospitals&#8221;1 on 21 May 2014. With this guidance 
</p>
<p>note, child protection actors in the field will be better equipped to monitor, report on and 
</p>
<p>engage in advocacy, and work with parties to conflict to end and prevent attacks on schools 
</p>
<p>and hospitals. It also calls for increased collaboration with both traditional and new 
</p>
<p>partners, including a range of civil society partners whose work is crucial to protection from 
</p>
<p>and monitoring of attacks on education and health care.  <b> 
</b></p>
<p>33. Accountability for those who attack schools and hospitals is a key aspect of 
</p>
<p>prevention. The Special Representative reiterates her call upon Member States to promote 
</p>
<p>the guidance note, institute changes in national policies and legislation as well as in military 
</p>
<p>doctrine, manuals and training, and investigate and prosecute those who deliberately target 
</p>
<p>schools and hospitals. The Security Council expressed deep concern about the military use 
</p>
<p>of schools and hospitals as it compromises their civilian status, puts them at risk of attacks 
</p>
<p>as lawful military targets, and has a disruptive effect on educational and medical activities. 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative invites the Human Rights Council and other human rights 
</p>
<p>bodies to use all available means to draw attention to the issue, including the universal 
</p>
<p>periodic review, country situations and thematic reports. Lastly, the Special Representative 
</p>
<p>welcomes the release on 16 December 2014 of the &#8220;Guidelines for Protecting Schools and 
</p>
<p>Universities from Military Use during Armed Conflict&#8221;, by the Global Coalition to Protect 
</p>
<p>Education from Attack, and encourages Member States to adopt them.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>34. The burdensome process of rebuilding and reopening schools and restoring a 
</p>
<p>community&#8217;s trust in their safety often leaves children without education for months or 
</p>
<p>even years. In that regard, the Special Representative underlines the importance of targeted 
</p>
<p>initiatives, such as the Secretary-General&#8217;s Global Education First Initiative, the &#8220;No Lost 
</p>
<p>Generation&#8221; initiative by the United Nations and its partners in the Syrian Arab Republic, 
</p>
<p>the planned data hub project on global attacks on education by Protect Education in 
</p>
<p>Insecurity and Conflict, which will be publicly available for advocacy use, and the 
</p>
<p>European Union Children of Peace initiative. Children growing up in the absence of health 
</p>
<p>care or education will have an impact on a society&#8217;s potential for development and peace 
</p>
<p>for many years after a conflict has ended. Ensuring access to education and health care, in 
</p>
<p>particular during times of war, must be a priority so as to better protect children from the 
</p>
<p>impact of armed conflict.  <b> 
</b></p>

<p><b> VII. Rape and other forms of sexual violence committed against 
children during armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p>35. Sexual violence continues to be a prominent violation of children&#8217;s rights in most 
</p>
<p>situations of conflict, affecting both girls and boys dramatically. Rape and other forms of 
</p>
<p>sexual violence are committed in the context of attacks against the civilian population and 
</p>
<p>children are usually targeted due to their vulnerability and frequently because of their 
</p>
<p>ethnicity. Violations are also committed in the context of recruitment and use of children g 
</p>
<p>and abductions. Girls are particularly vulnerable to abduction or recruitment by armed 
</p>
<p>groups to be used for sexual purposes. Parties to conflict use sexual violence against 
</p>
<p>children as a tactic to instil fear so as to assert control over people and land. It is also an 
</p>
<p>increasing trend used by extremist groups to terrorize populations. For example, Boko 
</p>
<p>Haram has been abducting girls from schools, and reports indicate that those girls have 
</p>
<p>been forcibly married to local commanders. 
</p>
<p>36. Access to justice by survivors of sexual violence remains a challenge in most 
</p>
<p>conflict situations, with social stigma and fear of reprisal being contributing factors. The 
</p>
<p>challenge of accessing justice in areas where instability prevails and State authority is weak 
</p>
<p>or absent is an additional constraint. Inappropriate legislation or administrative obstacles 
</p>
<p>also exist. In some cases, criminal codes do not have a definition of the rape, which may 
</p>
<p>lead to inconsistent application of the law by the police and judicial authorities. In other 
</p>
<p>cases, corruption &#8212; for example, the false requirement to present costly medical 
</p>
<p>certificates &#8212; may prevent victims from filing complaints. Another major impediment to 
</p>
<p>accessing justice is the often inadequate compensation provided to survivors, as well as 
</p>
<p>lengthy and costly procedures before the courts, which may lead a victim&#8217;s family to reach 
</p>
<p>an amicable settlement with the perpetrators, rather than bring the case to justice. 
</p>
<p>37. As part of global efforts to address sexual violence against children, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative participated in the Global Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, held 
</p>
<p>in London, in June 2014, and was the keynote speaker for the session dedicated to the 
</p>
<p>vulnerabilities of children to sexual violence in armed conflict. Her Office also contributed 
</p>
<p>to the Secretary-General&#8217;s guidance note on reparations for victims of conflict-related 
</p>
<p>sexual violence,2 which was jointly coordinated by OHCHR and the United Nations Entity 
</p>
<p>for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women). The inclusion of 
</p>
<p>special guarantees for non-repetition in the design and implementation of State policy, as 
</p>
<p>well as the establishment of legal and institutional frameworks to prevent, investigate, 
</p>
<p>prosecute and punish crimes of sexual violence committed against children in situations of 
</p>
<p>conflict, is a positive development. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Partnerships with regional organizations 
</b></p>
<p>38. Partnerships with regional organizations have been a priority for the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative to further advance the children and armed conflict agenda and promote 
</p>
<p>regional ownership in the protection of children. 
</p>
<p>39. In May 2014, the Special Representative gave a briefing at the African Union Peace 
</p>
<p>and Security Council&#8217;s first-ever open session dedicated to children affected by armed 
</p>
<p>conflict. The briefing came after the signing of the Declaration of Intent on 17 September 
</p>
<p>2013, formalizing the collaboration between the Office of the Special Representative and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2  &#8220;Guidance note of the Secretary-General: Reparations for conflict-related sexual violence&#8221;, launched 
</p>
<p>in August 2014. </p>


<p>the Peace and Security Department of the African Union Commission, in partnership with 
</p>
<p>UNICEF. In October 2014, the Special Representative attended the African Union Fifth 
</p>
<p>High-Level Retreat on Promotion of Peace, Security and Stability in Africa, in Tanzania, 
</p>
<p>which provided the opportunity to exchange on issues relating to the children and armed 
</p>
<p>conflict agenda with senior African Union officials. With regard to the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the Declaration of Intent, a workplan is being developed with the support of a Child 
</p>
<p>Protection Advisor of the Peace and Security Department to mainstream and devise 
</p>
<p>strategies for the protection of children affected by armed conflict, especially as it relates to 
</p>
<p>the African Union&#8217;s activities in the areas of peace and security.  
</p>
<p>40. Tangible progress has also been made in developing a framework of cooperation 
</p>
<p>between the Office of the Special Representative and the League of Arab States to 
</p>
<p>mainstream child protection in the League&#8217;s peace and security agenda. The Cooperation 
</p>
<p>Agreement, signed on 22 September 2014, aims to enhance coordination and information 
</p>
<p>flow between the two entities, and a workplan is being developed with the aim of assisting 
</p>
<p>member States to mainstream child protection concerns into their policies and programmes, 
</p>
<p>identifying a high-level focal point for children and armed conflict within the League and 
</p>
<p>encouraging all its member States to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the 
</p>
<p>Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>41. The Special Representative continues to work with the North Atlantic Treaty 
</p>
<p>Organization (NATO) to integrate the children and armed conflict agenda into their 
</p>
<p>policies, procedures and training. At the NATO Wales Summit in September 2014, NATO 
</p>
<p>Allies reaffirmed their commitment to carrying out their responsibilities to mainstream 
</p>
<p>child protection in the planning and conduct of its operations and missions, as well as in its 
</p>
<p>training, monitoring and reporting. In that regard, the Special Representative welcomes 
</p>
<p>NATO&#8217;s plans to adjust its military guidelines on children and armed conflict to ensure that 
</p>
<p>troops are sufficiently prepared whenever and wherever the issue is likely to be 
</p>
<p>encountered. The inclusion of a Children and Armed Conflict Advisor in the Resolute 
</p>
<p>Support Mission in Afghanistan is also a welcome step that will improve the capacity of 
</p>
<p>NATO troops and national authorities with regard to children and armed conflict issues. 
</p>
<p>42. In December 2014, the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights and  
</p>
<p>Committee on Foreign Affairs held a special hearing on the campaign &#8220;Children, Not 
</p>
<p>Soldiers&#8221;. The Special Representative briefed parliamentarians on progress achieved since 
</p>
<p>the launch of the campaign and highlighted challenges and ways for the European Union to 
</p>
<p>support the objectives of the campaign. While in Brussels, the Special Representative met 
</p>
<p>with the Managing Director for Multilateral Affairs of the European External Action 
</p>
<p>Service and members of the Political and Security Committee to consider opportunities for 
</p>
<p>reinforcing the existing collaboration. In December 2014, the European Parliament created 
</p>
<p>an Intergroup on Children&#8217;s Rights to mainstream the needs and protection of children 
</p>
<p>across all parliamentary committees. 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Field visits by the Special Representative 
</b></p>
<p>43. During the reporting period, the Special Representative continued to use field visits 
</p>
<p>as a key advocacy tool for engaging with governments and non-State armed actors, 
</p>
<p>fostering constructive relations and gaining commitments from parties to conflict to end 
</p>
<p>grave violations against children. She visited the Central African Republic (December 
</p>
<p>2013), Yemen (May 2014), South Sudan (June 2014) and Somalia (August 2014). </p>


<p><b> A. Central African Republic 
</b></p>
<p>44. In the context of the escalating violence and the deteriorating security situation in 
</p>
<p>the Central African Republic, the Special Representative visited the country from 17 to 
</p>
<p>21 December 2013, together with the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on the 
</p>
<p>Prevention of Genocide and a representative of the Office of the Special Representative of 
</p>
<p>the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict. The primary aim of the visit was to 
</p>
<p>assess the impact of the conflict on children and to advocate with the then authorities and 
</p>
<p>other relevant interlocutors for the cessation of violence and protection for civilians. The 
</p>
<p>Special Representative called for the strengthening of United Nations capacity to ensure an 
</p>
<p>adequate response to the child protection crisis. Since that visit, the political landscape in 
</p>
<p>the Central African Republic has evolved and the Special Representative continues to 
</p>
<p>engage with the new transitional authorities.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Yemen 
</b></p>
<p>45. At the invitation of the Government, the Special Representative visited Yemen from 
</p>
<p>13 to 15 May 2014 for the signing of an Action Plan to end the recruitment and use of 
</p>
<p>children by government forces. Pursuant to the Action Plan, the Government of Yemen 
</p>
<p>committed to criminalize and investigate allegations of recruitment and use of children its 
</p>
<p>armed forces. Unfortunately, following the signing of the Action Plan, the security and 
</p>
<p>political situation in Yemen deteriorated and remains volatile, limiting implementation 
</p>
<p>progress. The Special Representative and the United Nations in Yemen continue to work 
</p>
<p>closely with the Yemeni authorities to make progress on the provisions of the Action Plan. 
</p>
<p><b> C. South Sudan 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Special Representative visited South Sudan from 22 to 27 June 2014 to assess 
</p>
<p>the impact on children of the crisis that has unfolded since 15 December 2013, and to 
</p>
<p>follow up on the implementation of the Action Plan signed in 2012. The Special 
</p>
<p>Representative, jointly with the Director General of UNESCO and its Special Envoy for 
</p>
<p>Peace and Reconciliation, met with the President of South Sudan. The Special 
</p>
<p>Representative called upon the President to hold perpetrators of violations against children 
</p>
<p>accountable and emphasized that there can be no peace without justice. A recommitment 
</p>
<p>agreement was signed by the Government of South Sudan and the United Nations to end 
</p>
<p>and prevent the recruitment and use of children by Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army. The 
</p>
<p>agreement also addressed the killing and maiming of children, sexual violence against 
</p>
<p>children and attacks on schools and hospitals.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Somalia 
</b></p>
<p>47. The Special Representative visited Somalia from 16 to 20 August 2014 to assess the 
</p>
<p>impact of conflict on children and to follow up with the Somali authorities on the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the two Action Plans to end and prevent recruitment and use of children 
</p>
<p>by armed forces and the killing and maiming of children, which were signed in 2012. The 
</p>
<p>precarious security situation and the lack of resources are paramount challenges, heavily 
</p>
<p>affecting the capacity to establish and uphold of the rule of law in Somalia, and permitting 
</p>
<p>widespread violations of human and children&#8217;s rights. Despite the difficulties, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative found that there were opportunities to improve the environment and 
</p>
<p>minimize the impact of conflict and military operations on children. </p>


<p><b> X. Progress in the development of international law 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Convention on the Rights of the Child and its optional protocols 
</b></p>
<p>48. In November 2014, the Special Representative participated in the celebration of the 
</p>
<p>25th anniversary of the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child together 
</p>
<p>with, among others, the Chair of the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children and the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography. She addressed 
</p>
<p>the General Assembly and called upon Member States to honour the commitments that they 
</p>
<p>have made to children, recalling that governments bear the primary responsibility for the 
</p>
<p>respect, protection and fulfilment of the rights of children. The Special Representative 
</p>
<p>utilized field missions to South Sudan and Somalia to reiterate that message and strongly 
</p>
<p>advocate for accession to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. She gained 
</p>
<p>commitments from the Presidents of both States to expedite the accession process. The 
</p>
<p>Special Representative welcomes the decision taken on 15 December 2014 by the Federal 
</p>
<p>Parliament of Somalia to ratify the Convention.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Representative continued to encourage Member States to sign and ratify 
</p>
<p>the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of 
</p>
<p>children in armed conflict and to enact legislation to criminalize the recruitment and use of 
</p>
<p>children. During the reporting period, she held bilateral meetings with United Nations 
</p>
<p>Member States that had not ratified and/or signed the treaty, and actively briefed regional 
</p>
<p>organizations, civil society and regional groups on the matters so as to coordinate advocacy. 
</p>
<p>Moreover, in September 2014, the Special Representative sent letters to all States that had 
</p>
<p>not yet ratified the Optional Protocol. In 2014, an additional seven States ratified the 
</p>
<p>Protocol, namely the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, St. 
</p>
<p>Lucia and the State of Palestine. To date, the Optional Protocol has 129 signatories and 159 
</p>
<p>parties.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Representative welcomes the entry into force of the Optional Protocol 
</p>
<p>to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a communications procedure on 14 April 
</p>
<p>2014, as it will strengthen the overall architecture and redress mechanisms of the 
</p>
<p>Convention on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the involvement of 
</p>
<p>children in armed conflict. 
</p>
<p><b> XI. Progress in achieving accountability for violations of 
</b>children&#8217;s rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>51. Despite increasing violations in a number of situations, it is a sad reality that 
</p>
<p>perpetrators of grave violations of child rights are rarely brought to justice. Several factors 
</p>
<p>limit access to justice for children and facilitate impunity, such as breakdown in the rule of 
</p>
<p>law, corruption, ambiguity and gaps in the law, poverty and insecurity. The Special 
</p>
<p>Representative continued to work with United Nations bodies, offices, justice actors, NGOs 
</p>
<p>and other key interlocutors to pursue accountability and overcome those barriers. She also 
</p>
<p>continued to call for accountability for violations of the rights of children in bilateral and 
</p>
<p>multilateral meetings with United Nations Member States.  
</p>
<p>52. The devastating nature of the violence in the Central African Republic demanded a 
</p>
<p>robust response from the international community and the United Nations system 
</p>
<p>demonstrated a deep commitment to address impunity and put in place justice mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>In April 2014, the Security Council adopted resolution 2149 that allows the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic </p>


<p>(MINUSCA) to adopt urgent temporary measures on an exceptional basis to maintain basic 
</p>
<p>law and order and fight impunity. Moreover, on 8 August 2014, the United Nations and the 
</p>
<p>Government of the Central African Republic signed a memorandum of understanding 
</p>
<p>providing for the creation of a Special Criminal Court composed of national and 
</p>
<p>international judges. The Special Criminal Court will be mandated to investigate serious 
</p>
<p>crimes, including grave violations of children&#8217;s rights, such as the recruitment and use of 
</p>
<p>children in armed conflict. The Central African authorities have started the process of 
</p>
<p>drafting and adopting legislation to establish the Special Criminal Court.  
</p>
<p>53. During the reporting period, the Special Representative engaged with sanctions 
</p>
<p>committees and panels to provide information where grave violations against children are 
</p>
<p>criteria for designation. She briefed the Security Council Committee established pursuant to 
</p>
<p>resolution 2127 (2013) concerning the Central African Republic, in May 2014, and the 
</p>
<p>Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1533 (2004) concerning the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, in September 2014, and provided information on grave 
</p>
<p>violations of the rights of children. The Office of the Special Representative also increased 
</p>
<p>collaboration with relevant groups or panels of experts to share information on grave 
</p>
<p>violations against children. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Representative continues to work with the International Criminal Court 
</p>
<p>in the pursuance of accountability. In 2014, the Office of the Prosecutor continued its 
</p>
<p>preliminary examinations of a number of situations, including Afghanistan, Colombia, Iraq 
</p>
<p>and Nigeria, and completed its preliminary investigation into the Central African Republic. 
</p>
<p>The Special Representative&#8217;s reports provided the Court with information on grave 
</p>
<p>violations against children.  
</p>
<p>55. On 1 December 2014, the Appeals Chamber of the Court delivered its verdict on the 
</p>
<p>appeal of Thomas Lubanga, confirming the verdict of the  March 2012 Trial Chamber that 
</p>
<p>Mr. Lubanga was guilty of the enlistment, conscription and use in hostilities of children 
</p>
<p>under the age of 15. The Special Representative echoes the Prosecutor&#8217;s sentiments that 
</p>
<p>that decision stands as a symbol of hope and an important step towards bringing an end to 
</p>
<p>the suffering of tens of thousands of children still forced to fight, kill and die in conflicts 
</p>
<p>around the world. 
</p>
<p>56. In March 2014, the International Criminal Court rendered its judgement in the case 
</p>
<p>against Germain Katanga concerning an attack in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 
</p>
<p>2003. A majority of the bench found him guilty of the crime against humanity of murder 
</p>
<p>and the war crimes of wilful killing, intentional attack against the civilian population, 
</p>
<p>pillaging and destruction of property. However, the defendant was acquitted of the charges 
</p>
<p>of using child soldiers, as well as of sexual slavery and rape. The Chamber acknowledged 
</p>
<p>that killing and maiming of children took place during the attacks and that children were 
</p>
<p>present in the armed forces at the time of the attack. That corresponds with the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative&#8217;s findings in 2003, that the Front de r&#233;sistance patriotique en Ituri/Front 
</p>
<p>populaire pour la justice au Congo (FRPI/FPJC) was recruiting and using children, as were 
</p>
<p>the &#8220;Lendu militias&#8221; in 2002. The FRPI/FPJC is still listed for recruitment and use of 
</p>
<p>children in the 2014 annual report of the Secretary-General on children and armed conflict.3 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Representative commends the International Criminal Court on their 
</p>
<p>findings on the impact of conflict on children in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the 
</p>
<p>Lubanga and Katanga cases, and urges it to continue its efforts to strengthen evidence 
</p>
<p>gathering in instances of grave violations of children. In that regard, the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative welcomes the release in June 2014 of the Policy Paper on Sexual and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3  A/68/878-S/2014/339. </p>


<p>Gender-Based Crimes by the Office of the Prosecutor. The Office of the Special 
</p>
<p>Representative will assist the Office of the Prosecutor in developing a policy paper on 
</p>
<p>children and armed conflict to help ensure that there is full accountability for crimes against 
</p>
<p>children in times of conflict.  
</p>
<p><b>  National initiatives to address issues of accountability 
</b></p>
<p>58. In addition to the Special Representative&#8217;s advocacy work and developments in the 
</p>
<p>legal architecture at the international level, there have been a number of positive legal 
</p>
<p>developments at national level, which are crucial to the protection of children. Indeed,  
</p>
<p>international instruments have limited reach and national legislation must be the first port of 
</p>
<p>call for addressing the multitude of violations of children&#8217;s rights that have been prevalent 
</p>
<p>in the past year.  
</p>
<p>59. In March 2014, the United Nations country task force on monitoring and reporting 
</p>
<p>in Chad re-launched advocacy efforts with the President of the National Assembly, the 
</p>
<p>Minister of Justice and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, calling on Chadian parliamentarians 
</p>
<p>to vote into law the Code of Child Protection and the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>60. In April 2014, the Central African authorities created a special investigation and 
</p>
<p>instruction unit (Cellule sp&#233;ciale d&#8217;enqu&#234;te et d&#8217;instruction) with the mandate to investigate 
</p>
<p>and prosecute serious human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>61. In Columbia, a bill was approved in June 2014 on the protection of victims of sexual 
</p>
<p>and gender-based violence in armed conflict. This new law is a major step forward and 
</p>
<p>harmonizes the national legislation with international standards. It clarifies the scope of 
</p>
<p>crimes considered as sexual violence, with emphasis on victims under 14 years, introduces 
</p>
<p>the right to comprehensive response and assistance, in terms of health and psychosocial 
</p>
<p>support, and allows for the participation of victims in legal proceedings.  
</p>
<p>62. During the reporting period, some progress in accountability was seen in the 
</p>
<p>Democratic Republic of the Congo, with a life sentence for Forces Arm&#233;es de la 
</p>
<p>R&#233;publique D&#233;mocratique du Congo (FARDC) Lt-Colonel Bedi Mobuli Engangela (alias 
</p>
<p>&#8220;106&#8221;) for the war crimes of murder, rape and sexual slavery, on 15 December 2014. A 10-
</p>
<p>year sentence was also handed down to FARDC General Jerome Kakwavu by a military 
</p>
<p>court, for the war crime of rape, in November 2014. Four members of FARDC and one 
</p>
<p>member of the Police Nationale Congolaise were tried and convicted with prison sentences 
</p>
<p>ranging from three to 20 years for rape and attempted rape of girls in Katanga and North 
</p>
<p>Kivu, in July and August 2014. Additional investigations of members of the security forces 
</p>
<p>are ongoing with regard to the suspected rape of children. In addition, four former leaders 
</p>
<p>of the Nyatura and Mayi Mayi Shetani armed groups were arrested on charges of 
</p>
<p>recruitment and use of children and are awaiting trial in Kinshasa. Lastly, on 11 February 
</p>
<p>2014, the President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo promulgated an amnesty law 
</p>
<p>that excluded rape, sexual violence, recruitment and use of children from any amnesty. 
</p>
<p>63. In the Philippines, the United Nations country task force on monitoring and 
</p>
<p>reporting explored ways to integrate the provisions of the Action Plan into the broader 
</p>
<p>peace process, including ensuring the Moro Islamic Liberation Front&#8217;s accountability  
</p>
<p>towards children within the context of the Bangsamoro Basic Law, which was passed in 
</p>
<p>September 2014 and includes specific provisions on the protection of children. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>an act providing for the special protection of children in situations of armed conflict, 
</p>
<p>amending the Philippines Republic Act, is currently at the bicameral committee level.  
</p>
<p>64. In Afghanistan, a Presidential decree issued on 27 August 2014 strengthened the 
</p>
<p>existing legal framework by endorsing a law criminalizing the recruitment and use of 
</p>
<p>children. On 1 November 2014, following modifications, the law was approved by the </p>


<p>Lower House of the Afghan Parliament and is expected to be approved by the Senate and 
</p>
<p>endorsed by the President.  
</p>
<p>65. In November 2014, a Malian NGO filed a total of 104 criminal complaints on behalf 
</p>
<p>of women and girls who were victims of conflict-related sexual violence committed by 
</p>
<p>armed groups in 2012 and 2013. That was the first time that conflict-related sexual violence 
</p>
<p>cases have been submitted for legal proceedings in Malian courts.  
</p>
<p>66. In South Sudan, the Lower House of Parliament endorsed a draft law criminalizing 
</p>
<p>under-age recruitment by national forces. The law is expected to be passed by the Upper 
</p>
<p>House and ratified by the President. Moreover, the Legal Advisor to the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Defence and Veteran Affairs proposed amendments to the Sudan People&#8217;s Liberation Army 
</p>
<p>Act (2009) to include punitive measures for perpetrators of grave violations against 
</p>
<p>children. The proposals have since been delivered to the Ministry of Justice for further 
</p>
<p>amendment and drafting of a bill to be presented before the Legislative Assembly. 
</p>
<p>67. In Yemen, an amended draft child rights laws has been proposed, which includes 
</p>
<p>stricter penalties for those who recruit and use children and sets the minimum age for 
</p>
<p>voluntary recruitment at 18. The amended draft child rights law is pending before the 
</p>
<p>interministerial committee of the Cabinet. The interministerial committee will be 
</p>
<p>reactivated following the formation of the new Cabinet in November 2014.  
</p>
<p><b> XII. Observations and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The Special Representative commends the Human Rights Council for its work 
in relation to persons deprived of their liberty as well as on juvenile justice, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>encourages the Council to continue to give due consideration to the rights of children 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected by armed conflict in that regard, including in its resolutions on country-
</b></p>
<p><b>specific situations and thematic issues and in the mandates of special procedures and 
</b></p>
<p><b>commissions of inquiry. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>The Special Representative commends the inclusion of accountability for grave 
violations against children in armed conflict in the Committee on the Rights of the 
</b></p>
<p>Child&#8217;s <b>consideration of States </b>parties&#8217; reports<b>, and encourages the Committee to 
continue to integrate the monitoring of the six grave violations against children 
</b></p>
<p><b>affected by armed conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The Special Representative notes with appreciation the attention paid by the 
special procedures mandate holders and commissions of inquiry to including child-
</b></p>
<p><b>protection concerns in their work. She encourages them to continue to include the 
</b></p>
<p><b>plight of children affected by armed conflict in their monitoring, reports and 
</b></p>
<p><b>recommendations, and to bring those concerns to her attention. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>The Special Representative welcomes national and international progress in 
achieving accountability on the part of perpetrators for grave violations against 
</b></p>
<p><b>children. Governments are encouraged to strengthen their support to justice systems 
</b></p>
<p><b>by allocating sufficient resources and capacity for investigating and prosecuting those 
</b></p>
<p><b>who perpetrate crimes against children in conflict. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The Special Representative calls upon States to consider alternatives to 
prosecution and detention of children for their alleged or actual association with 
</b></p>
<p><b>armed groups or as part of counter-terrorism measures, and to ensure, at a minimum, 
</b></p>
<p><b>that trials and procedures are consistent with international juvenile justice standards 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the principle of prioritizing the best interests of the child. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The indoctrination of children by extremist groups poses new challenges with 
regard to their protection and psychosocial rehabilitation and reintegration. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Representative encourages the Human Rights Council to make use of its </b></p>


<p><b>mechanisms to highlight and address the need for appropriate measures to 
</b></p>
<p><b>rehabilitate those children, in compliance with the principle of the best interest of the 
</b></p>
<p>child and respecting the child&#8217;s primary status as a victim.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>The Special Representative welcomes the recent ratifications of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child and its Optional Protocol on the involvement of children in 
</b></p>
<p><b>armed conflict and reiterates her urgent call upon States who have not yet done so to
