Tariff;

In State v Baleinabodua [2012] FJHC 981; HAC145.2010 (21 March 2012) Justice Salesi Temo stated as follows referring to tariff for Criminal Intimidation

"Criminal Intimidation" is a serious offence&., if the threat was intended to cause grievous hurt. &. in my view, an acceptable tariff would be a sentence between 12 months and 4 years imprisonment. Serious cases should be given the sentence in the upper range, while less serious cases should be given sentences at the lower end of the scale.
