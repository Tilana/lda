<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its seventeenth session 
from 21 October to 1 November 2013. The review of Israel was held at the 14th meeting on 
29 October 2013. The delegation of Israel was headed by Ambassador Eviatar Manor, 
Permanent Representative, Permanent Mission of Israel to the United Nations Office at 
Geneva. At its 19th meeting, held on 1 November 2013, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Israel. 
</p>
<p>2. On 14 January 2013, the Human Rights Council mandated the President to select the 
following group of rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Israel: Maldives, Sierra 
Leone and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. 
</p>
<p>3. The Human Rights Council, in its decision OM/7/101, had decided to reschedule the 
review from 29 January 2013 to the seventeenth session of the Working Group on the 
Universal Periodic Review at the latest. 
</p>
<p>4. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of Israel: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/17/ISR/1);  
 (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/ISR/2, A/HRC/WG.6/17/ISR/2 and Corr. 1); 
 (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/15/ISR/3 and Corr.1 and A/HRC/WG.6/17/ISR/3).  
</p><p>5. A list of questions prepared in advance by Germany, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland 
was transmitted to Israel through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of 
the universal periodic review (UPR). Summaries of additional questions made during the 
interactive dialogue are to be found in section I, subsection B, of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. Eviatar Manor, the head of the delegation, noted that Israel came to its second 
review with strong reservations regarding the Human Rights Council. The discrimination 
against, and the unfair treatment of, Israel continued. The infamous item 7 still featured on 
the agenda of every Council session and Israel was not a member of any geographical 
group. 
</p>
<p>7. In March 2012, Israel had said: &#8220;Enough.&#8221; Israel suspended its relations with the 
Human Rights Council and with OHCHR. In June 2013, the Ambassador wrote to the 
President of the Council to reaffirm his intention to pursue a diplomatic engagement. The 
results of that dialogue and ongoing engagement had allowed Israel to undergo the UPR. 
Israel had made its decision because it respected United Nations resolutions, human rights 
in general, and human rights mechanisms in particular. But the unfair treatment of Israel 
must come to an end. The delegation hoped that the appearance by Israel under the </p>


<p>universal periodic review would go a long way to restore equality and fairness regarding 
Israel in Geneva. 
</p>
<p>8. Israel came to the review with respect for the process, belief in the importance of its 
universality and cooperative nature, and with great pride in its achievements. 
</p>
<p>9. The delegation referred to information contained in the national report, including the 
final chapter, which looked at challenges, constraints and opportunities. The main challenge 
Israel was facing was its relations with the Palestinians. Recent resumption of direct 
negotiations for peace was a welcome step. In that context, the delegation pointed out that 
Israel had agreed to release Palestinian prisoners as a confidence-building measure. A 
second group of prisoners was being released that night. Their release illustrated the 
determination of Israel to reach an agreement with its Palestinian neighbours that would, 
once and for all, end the conflict. 
</p>
<p>10. The engagement by Israel with human rights bodies and mechanisms reflected those 
principles. Israel was a party to the core human rights treaty bodies, and had, between 2009 
and 2013, completed its examination by six treaty bodies. Moreover, during 2011, Israel 
had hosted the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special 
Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression. Israel also had hosted the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
discrimination in this context, in February 2012, and the Special Representative of the 
Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, in 2009. 
</p>
<p>11. Since its establishment, Israel had had to balance a difficult and complex security 
situation with democratic traditions and the respect for human rights. Such challenges 
strained the delicate balance between the effective steps necessary to overcome the various 
threats to a State&#8217;s security and the protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>12. The delegation noted that they had come to listen to comments and 
recommendations, which they would study closely, and that they would report on the 
implementation of recommendations received during the first cycle of the UPR. 
</p>
<p>13. Shai Nitzan, Deputy Attorney General (Special Affairs), Ministry of Justice, noted 
that the national report, the presence of the members of the delegation, the periodic reports 
submitted by Israel to human rights treaty bodies and the State&#8217;s interactive dialogue with 
such bodies were opportunities for in-depth self-examination and identification of 
challenges. 
</p>
<p>14. Israel had been subjected regularly to significant, and often politically motivated, 
scrutiny over the years, disproportionate to the worldwide human rights situation. Israel 
worked regularly with various international and domestic bodies and non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) involved with human rights issues, including with the Minerva 
Center and civil society on the reporting process and follow-up with the human rights treaty 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>15. Israel was aware of the complexity of its multicultural society and of the vital need 
to protect human rights, and to strike an appropriate balance between protection of human 
rights and the public interest. 
</p>
<p>16. Mr. Nitzan noted that the extremely limited scope of his statement did not permit 
him to cover all improvements pertaining to the implementation of human rights in Israel. 
</p>
<p>17. Israeli courts played a crucial role in anchoring and promoting human rights in 
Israeli society. The courts were empowered to conduct a judicial review of any act of 
legislation, in the light of the Basic Laws. Mr. Nitzan provided examples in that regard. </p>


<p>18. The delegate noted the establishment, in 2011, of a joint interministerial team for 
reviewing and implementing the concluding observations of human rights treaty bodies. 
</p>
<p>19. Reference was also made to the public commission of inquiry that was mandated, 
among other responsibilities, to assess whether the mechanisms for examining and 
investigating claims raised in relation to violations of the laws of armed conflict conformed 
with the obligations of Israel under international law. The commission, which was headed 
by a Supreme Court Judge and included two distinguished international observers, 
concluded in its comprehensive report that the State&#8217;s mechanisms generally complied with 
those obligations. The Prime Minister decided to establish a professional team that would 
study the recommendations of the report, examine the need for modifications and 
improvements, and suggest specific modes of action. 
</p>
<p>20. Israel had given consideration to the recommendations from the previous review, 
including on the legal regime in the West Bank, especially regarding minors. A Juvenile 
Military Court had been established in the West Bank to guarantee adequate and 
professional care for juveniles. The age of majority had been raised from 16 to 18 years. 
</p><p>21. The delegate referred to steps taken to facilitate everyday life and the observance of 
religion for the Palestinian population in the West Bank, especially during the holiday of 
Ramadan, and to increases in the number of work permits for Palestinian workers. 
</p>
<p>22. Israel was open to constructive criticism and looked forward to working within the 
framework of the UPR mechanism, in a process conducted on the basis of universality, 
impartiality and professionalism, so that the shared goal of promoting and enhancing 
human rights could be fully achieved. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>23. During the interactive dialogue, 73 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. All written 
statements of the delegations, to be checked against delivery on the United Nations 
Webcast archives,1 are posted on the extranet of the Human Rights Council when 
available.2 
</p>
<p>24. Nicaragua expressed its regret that many of the recommendations from the first 
review still had not been implemented. 
</p>
<p>25. Nigeria noted that the national report had been made available rather late, making it 
difficult to consider it before the review.  
</p>
<p>26. Norway recognized the continued interaction of Israel with the treaty bodies and 
welcomed the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 
(CRPD). 
</p><p>27. Oman noted that many recommendations had not been implemented, and called 
upon the international community to take necessary actions to stop Israel&#8217;s aggression. 
</p>
<p>28. Pakistan condemned the human rights violations in the occupied Arab territories.

<p>29. On a point of clarification, the State of Palestine stated that the presence of Israel 
that day was partial and had no value; there could be no selectivity for any country or any 
member and therefore Israel was obliged to comply with the resolution establishing the 
Human Rights Council. It stated that the report submitted by Israel had no value, since it 
failed to address at all human rights in the land of the State of Palestine which was under 
occupation by Israel. Turning to the review, it asked about the legal basis for the 
confiscation of the identity cards of Palestinians residing in Jerusalem and where the border 
of Israel was located. 
</p>
<p>30. In response, Israel indicated that the statement made by the Palestinian 
representative was neither a point of clarification nor a procedural motion, but rather the 
use of extra time to make his statement. Israel had come to the meeting in the spirit of 
dialogue and the delegation was prepared to answer all questions regarding the territories 
under the State&#8217;s control. 
</p>
<p>31. Poland welcomed the national report and the return of Israel to the Human Rights 
Council. 
</p>
<p>32. Portugal expressed concern about discrimination and inequality, inter alia, the 
distinction between Jewish and Arab citizens, and discrimination against women. 
</p>
<p>33. Qatar referred to the failure by Israel to cooperate with the Human Rights Council 
and the United Nations mechanisms responsible for monitoring the human rights situation 
in the occupied Palestinian territories. 
</p>
<p>34. The Republic of Korea noted that the promotion and protection of human rights was 
ensured in institutional and practical terms. 
</p>
<p>35. The Russian Federation drew attention to the human rights concerns in the occupied 
Palestinian territory. 
</p>
<p>36. Morocco referred to issues such as the lack of measures to protect Palestinian 
civilians and attempts to change the nature of Jerusalem. 
</p>
<p>37. Saudi Arabia made only recommendations.  
</p>
<p>38. Slovakia encouraged Israel to ensure a balance between the rights of migrants and 
national interests and legislative measures related to freedom of religion. 
</p>
<p>39. Slovenia welcomed progress made regarding children in Israeli military detention. 
</p>
<p>40. While acknowledging the Government&#8217;s efforts to strengthen the promotion and 
protection of human rights, South Sudan also called for strengthened efforts to protect the 
rights of all citizens. 
</p>
<p>41. South Africa expressed support for the mediation efforts and welcomed the re-
establishment by Israel of normal relations with the Human Rights Council.  
</p>
<p>42. Spain welcomed the participation by Israel in the review. 
</p>
<p>43. The Sudan noted the negative consequences that the State&#8217;s nine-month period of 
non-cooperation had on the work of the Human Rights Council and the UPR.  
</p>
<p>44. Sweden asked about measures to limit the use of administrative detention, and 
requested more information about efforts to protect women and girls from gender-based 
violence. 
</p>
<p>45. Switzerland referred to the situation of minorities, asylum-seeking procedures, the 
settlements and the blockade affecting the civilian population in Gaza.  </p>


<p>46. The Syrian Arab Republic hoped that the Human Rights Council would be able to 
contribute to implementing United Nations resolutions aimed at ending the Israeli 
occupation of Arab territories. 
</p>
<p>47. Thailand called on Israel to, inter alia, end the blockade of the Gaza Strip, lift 
restrictions on movements and ensure non-discriminatory treatment of Jewish and non-
Jewish peoples. 
</p>
<p>48. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia asked to be informed about progress 
in the implementation of recommendations under the first UPR as well as those of the treaty 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>49. Tunisia deplored the non-submission of a national report and the considerable delay 
in the review, which, added to the boycott of the human rights mechanisms, constituted a 
case of persistent non-cooperation that the Human Rights Council and the General 
Assembly should take seriously in order to preserve the universality and credibility of the 
UPR. 
</p>
<p>50. Turkey considered that the improvement of the human rights record primarily 
required the ending of the occupation in the territories of the State of Palestine. 
</p>
<p>51. The United Arab Emirates asked what steps would be taken to implement Human 
Rights Council resolutions and, in particular, the conclusions of various reports of human 
rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>52. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland expressed concern over 
Israeli practices in the occupied Palestinian territories, including the extensive use of 
administrative detention. 
</p>
<p>53. The United States of America noted its strong belief that every State Member of the 
United Nations should fully participate in the UPR, and commended Israel for its 
commitment to upholding human rights. 
</p>
<p>54. Uruguay encouraged progress in the peace negotiations between Israelis and 
Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>55. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela regretted the disregard by Israel for the 
recommendations of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>56. Algeria was gravely concerned by the serious non-compliance with UPR procedures 
and rules and by such a dangerous precedent.  
</p>
<p>57. Argentina highlighted the ratification of CRPD and encouraged Israel to continue to 
advance in the adoption of the remaining human rights instruments.  
</p>
<p>58. Australia welcomed several measures, remained concerned at restrictions on 
freedom of movement, and noted the concern expressed by Israel about being singled out in 
item 7 of the Human Rights Council agenda. 
</p>
<p>59. Austria asked whether the position of Israel had evolved on the issues of 
discrimination against Arab Israeli citizens and the protection of human rights defenders.  
</p>
<p>60. Bahrain expressed its concern about the delay in the review of Israel and about the 
situation of Palestinian children. 
</p>
<p>61. Referring to comments made by the Syrian Arab Republic, the head of the 
delegation noted that he had not seen masses of Golan Heights inhabitants rushing to visit 
their families in the Syrian Arab Republic. 
</p>
<p>62. In response to an advance question by Norway, the delegation noted that, despite 
increasing challenges, and in line with the State&#8217;s responsibility under international law, </p>


<p>Israel took significant steps to promote the standards of living of Palestinians and 
cooperated with the Palestinian Authority, which had the responsibility for the vast majority 
of the Palestinian population. The United Nations Development Programme development 
index showed that the Palestinian Authority was above the regional average. 
</p>
<p>63. Israel was also working to improve the movement of people and goods in the West 
Bank. Currently there were only a few checkpoints in place, which were normally open. 
</p>
<p>64. Responding to an advance question by Mexico and Slovenia, the delegation stated 
that, as enshrined in the declaration of independence and in many basic laws and court 
rulings, equality and non-discrimination was the cornerstone of Israel&#8217;s democratic society. 
</p>
<p>65. In response to another question by Norway, the delegate noted that, as of August 
2013, 126 of 133 localities with a predominantly Arab population had approved outline 
plans. 
</p>
<p>66. Referring to a question on the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the Israel Security 
Agency (ISA), the delegate said that both had supervising mechanisms. Regarding a 
question from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the 
Netherlands, he noted that the IDF had established a system to investigate and pursue 
allegations of misconduct. The Attorney General provided civilian oversight for any 
decision of the Military Advocate General on whether or not to investigate or indict a 
person suspected of war crimes and other crimes. 
</p>
<p>67. Responding to questions from Sweden, the Russian Federation, Spain and other 
countries, Mr. Nitzan noted that administrative detention was a lawful security measure 
under international law. It was used as a preventive measure against persons who posed 
grave threats to the security of the West Bank and Israel and its population. 
</p>
<p>68. Another issue that had been raised by several countries, including the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Russian Federation, Spain and 
Portugal, was connected to claims of torture by the ISA. The ISA was responsible by law 
for the protection of Israel&#8217;s security against terrorist threats, espionage and other threats. 
The ISA operated in accordance with the ruling of the High Court of Justice, and especially 
the ruling from 1999 concerning ISA interrogations, forbidding any use of physical 
pressure. 
</p>
<p>69. The prohibition of torture, as an offence, had not been legislated yet in Israel, 
however, acts and behaviours defined as torture under article 1 of the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment constituted 
offences under the Penal Code. 
</p>
<p>70. Hila Tene-Gilad, Director, Human Rights and Relations with International 
Organizations, Ministry of Justice, addressed questions raised by Germany, the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Netherlands, as well as additional 
questions by Switzerland and the United States of America. 
</p>
<p>71. The issue of the Bedouin population in the Negev presented a great challenge to 
Israel in many aspects. With regard to planning, 18 Bedouin localities had approved outline 
plans, and the planning procedures of six additional localities were ongoing. The 
Government of Israel was encouraging movement to regulated localities by providing 
financial benefits. Following the report of the Goldberg Committee, the governmental plan 
for regulation of Bedouin housing in the Negev had been submitted. The Government had 
resolved to anchor the implementation framework in legislation, a process carried out in 
consultation and cooperation with the Bedouin population. 
</p>
<p>72. Nir Keidar, International Law Department, Israel Defense Forces, addressed the 
issue of law enforcement regarding Palestinian minors in the West Bank, which had been </p>


<p>raised by several States, including Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Thailand and the 
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. 
</p>
<p>73. Israel has taken the utmost precautions in handling cases of crime perpetrated by 
minors, which presented a specific set of challenges. Israeli authorities had to balance the 
need to deal with serious, life-threatening crimes, often instigated or encouraged by terrorist 
organizations, and the lack of cooperation from Palestinian authorities, which led to a lack 
of alternatives to arrest and an environment of hostility towards the Israeli authorities, with 
a fundamental need to act compassionately in accordance with the relevant international 
standards. 
</p>
<p>74. All aspects of the criminal process were conducted according to clear and published 
procedures and were frequently subject to judicial review. Throughout the process minors 
were informed of their rights and had a right to legal representation. 
</p>
<p>75. In the past years an extensive and ongoing review of the criminal law framework 
applicable in the West Bank had been carried out and had led to substantial amendments, 
including the raising of the age of majority and the substantial shortening of detention 
periods, the granting of status to parents during the proceedings, limitation periods for the 
prosecution of minors and the possibility to order a probation officer&#8217;s report following the 
criminal conviction of a minor. 
</p>
<p>76. Belgium commended the ratification of the majority of the human rights instruments 
and asked whether Israel had considered ratifying the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death 
penalty (ICCPR-OP 2) and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women. 
</p>
<p>77. Cuba regretted Israel&#8217;s lack of cooperation with the Human Rights Council. It 
referred to Israel as an occupying power violating international law. 
</p>
<p>78. Brazil acknowledged some important progress in realizing human rights, but 
expressed concern about settler violence against Palestinian civilians. 
</p>
<p>79. Canada welcomed the participation of Israel and, referring to the section on minority 
rights in the national report, asked about further developments towards equality, 
participation in public life, and fair provision of public services and infrastructure since the 
first UPR of Israel. 
</p>
<p>80. Chile reiterated the need to put an end to acts of violence and economic deprivation 
affecting the Palestinian population. Chile called on Israel to end all expansion of 
settlements. 
</p>
<p>81. China called for the release all Palestinian prisoners and the improvement of their 
living conditions. It also expressed hope that Israel would lift the blockade on the Gaza 
Strip as soon as possible. 
</p>
<p>82. Costa Rica noted the ratification of CRPD. In relation to the Palestinians and the 
occupied Palestinian territories it called on Israel to respect international humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>83. The Plurinational State of Bolivia noted that Israel had re-established its 
commitment to the UPR, albeit with a delay. 
</p>
<p>84. Cyprus commended several aspects of human rights protection in Israel. It urged all 
interested parties to refrain from actions that could undermine the negotiation process 
between Israel and the Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>85. The Czech Republic expressed concern over the continued discrimination against 
minorities, referring particularly to the situation of the Bedouins. </p>


<p>86. Denmark recognized an overall decline in the use of administrative detention, but 
remained concerned about the practice and continued allegations of torture and ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p>87. Ecuador noted the commitment of Israel to ensure gender equality. It expressed its 
belief that Israel should make efforts to eliminate discrimination against the Palestinian 
population.  
</p>
<p>88. Egypt condemned, inter alia, the disrespect shown by Israel for United Nations 
resolutions. 
</p>
<p>89. Estonia called on Israel to investigate all allegations of ill-treatment and bring to 
justice those responsible. It expressed concern over military court proceedings involving 
minors. 
</p>
<p>90. Finland noted the cooperation by Israel with the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF), and asked to hear about the steps taken to implement recommendations put 
forward by UNICEF. 
</p>
<p>91. France welcomed the return of Israel to the UPR. 
</p>
<p>92. Germany asked what steps were being taken to implement the recommendations of 
the Turkel Commission and about measures to reduce the use of administrative detention. 
</p>
<p>93. Greece expressed concern about settlement activities, and commended progress in 
achieving equal treatment in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity 
</p>
<p>94. Guatemala welcomed Israeli-Palestinian discussions, which constituted a significant 
advance towards peace in the Middle East. It noted concerns about the increase in 
demolitions in the occupied Palestinian territory. 
</p>
<p>95. Hungary noted the continuing cooperation with treaty bodies, and asked about steps 
envisaged to improve the rights of minorities. 
</p>
<p>96. Iceland urged the halting of all settlement activities and the withdrawal of settlers 
from the occupied Palestinian territory. It encouraged the effective implementation of 
legislation and dialogue with the Palestinian authorities on violence against women, as well 
as the withdrawal of the reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). 
</p><p>97. Indonesia noted the ratification by Israel of CPRD, but expressed concern about 
policies such as the wall in the occupied Palestinian territories. 
</p>
<p>98. Ireland raised several human rights concerns, and urged Israel to implement the 
recommendations of a March 2013 UNICEF report.  
</p>
<p>99. The Islamic Republic of Iran stated that persistent non-cooperation of the Israeli 
regime with the UPR mechanism seriously jeopardized the periodicity, sanctity, reliability, 
credibility and integrity of the whole UPR process. Despite systematic and flagrant 
violations of international obligations by the Israeli regime, no concrete actions had yet 
been taken. It further reiterated that the time was right for collective action to protect the 
rights of Palestinians and alleviate the suffering of innocent people. 
</p>
<p>100. Israel made a point of order objecting to the use of the term &#8220;Israeli regime&#8221; by the 
Islamic Republic of Iran in its statement. 
</p>
<p>101. The President of the Human Rights Council reminded delegates that it was of the 
utmost importance that, when discussing human rights issues, everybody respected each 
other&#8217;s views and upheld United Nations terminology and standards when referring to 
countries. </p>


<p>102. Iraq asked what measures ensured that the births of Palestinian children were 
registered so that they could obtain identity documents. 
</p>
<p>103. Italy asked about measures to implement the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(CRC) and the law on youth in the West Bank, and to improve the socioeconomic 
conditions of minorities. 
</p>
<p>104. Japan appreciated efforts by Israel to advance the rights of women and ethnic 
minorities, but expressed concern over the reports of forced eviction of Palestinians. 
</p>
<p>105. Jordan expressed alarm that the right of self-determination of the Palestinian people 
was still being violated by Israel. 
</p>
<p>106. Kuwait recommended that the international community take measures to protect the 
rights of the Palestinian people and shoulder its responsibilities to hold accountable those 
responsible for grave human rights violations which were committed daily against the 
Palestinian people under occupation. 
</p>
<p>107. Latvia asked about measures envisaged to implement the recommendation of the 
Committee on the Rights of the Child to ensure that children accused of having committed 
security offences were detained only as a measure of last resort, in adequate conditions and 
for the shortest possible period of time. 
</p>
<p>108. Libya referred to the indifference shown by Israel to the UPR. It commended the 
release of Palestinian prisoners, and called for the withdrawal of Israel from the occupied 
Palestinian territories. 
</p>
<p>109. Malaysia expressed its view that the situation in the occupied Palestinian territories 
was worsening. 
</p>
<p>110. Maldives was deeply concerned by Israeli practices in Palestine, the lack of 
commitment to the United Nations bodies, and violations of international human rights and 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>111. Mexico expressed its hope that the review would contribute to efforts to improve the 
human rights situation in Israel, and congratulated the State for its ratification of CRPD. 
</p>
<p>112. Rwanda commended Israel for resuming its cooperation with the universal periodic 
review mechanism. 
</p>
<p>113. The Netherlands commended the efforts made by Israel, but remained concerned 
about the rights of Palestinian children in military custody and of the Bedouin community. 
</p>
<p>114. New Zealand welcomed the ratification of CPRD and Israel&#8217;s vibrant democracy, 
independent judiciary and active civil society. 
</p><p>115. Lebanon made a point of order. Lebanon was among the countries which had not 
registered on the list of speakers, because, among other principled reasons, the report had 
not been made available for comment. It referred to paragraph 105 of the national report of 
Israel, in which the Amal organization, which was a Lebanese nationalist resistance 
movement that had a history in combating Israeli occupation, was labelled as a &#8220;terrorist 
organization&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>116. In responding to the issues raised by Lebanon during a point of order, Israel recalled 
that in July, the European Union had designated the Hezbollah military wing as a terrorist 
organization. It noted that the report had mentioned the fact that a senior member of that 
organization had been able to address courts in Israel and had received remedy. 
</p>
<p>117. Lebanon made a point of order. It noted that its previous comment was specific to 
the reference to the Amal organization in the national report and not to any other political 
faction referred to by the previous speaker. </p>


<p>118. The President of the Human Rights Council recalled that it was the responsibility of 
the State under review to draw up a national report as a basis for discussion in the session 
of the Working Group. The publication of a national report as an official document of the 
United Nations did not imply any official position on the content of that report. 
</p>
<p>119. The State of Palestine made a point of order. It noted that the current meeting was 
the UPR of Israel and, as such, Israel should not be mentioning members of parties that had 
nothing to do with the questions on the table. It asked for a legal opinion on whether it was 
possible to engage with the United Nations mechanisms but cease to engage with the 
Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>120. The President said he had already addressed that question. 
</p>
<p>121. In response to Canada, the head of the delegation referred to affirmative action 
regarding the Arab minority, in particular an increase of directors in public companies, and 
the intention to increase annually the number of minority individuals employed in the civil 
service and as judges. 
</p><p>122. Addressing additional comments, the delegation indicated that the Gaza Strip had 
not been under Israeli control since 2005, following the implementation by Israel of the 
disengagement initiative. Since then, Israel could clearly be said to have no effective 
control in the Gaza Strip. Any claim to the contrary had clearly distorted and misapplied the 
established rules of international law. As a consequence, as had also been affirmed in 2007 
by the Israeli High Court of Justice, Israel did not have a general duty to ensure the welfare 
of the population of the Gaza Strip. The obligations of Israel towards the Gaza Strip 
stemmed from the continuing state of armed conflict with the Hamas terrorist organization. 
</p>
<p>123. He stressed that the Hamas terrorist organization had violently seized control of the 
Gaza Strip, and had established a terrorist entity. Israel had hoped that the disengagement 
from Gaza would lead to a reduction in terrorist attacks and ultimately to a comprehensive 
peace agreement with the Palestinians. However, attacks on Israeli civilians were still 
frequent. 
</p>
<p>124. The State of Palestine made a point of order. It refused to accept that Hamas or any 
other Palestinian faction be defined as terrorists. It suggested remaining focused on the 
UPR of the State under review. 
</p>
<p>125. Israel further noted that, due to the volatile security situation, and in the light of the 
obligations under international law, Israel had imposed a legal naval blockade to prevent 
weapons transfer to Hamas. 
</p>
<p>126. Cuba fully supported the point of order that had been made by the State of Palestine. 
</p>
<p>127. Israel asked for the practice of using points of order for issues that were not 
technical to be stopped. 
</p>
<p>128. The President of the Human Rights Council asked, in line with UPR modalities, that 
delegations refrain from interpreting the State under review. 
</p>
<p>129. The policy of Israel was that all goods could enter the Gaza Strip freely through the 
land passages that were open, with the sole exception of those goods that could pose a 
security risk to Israel. Israel had also allowed entry into its territory in humanitarian cases, 
such as for persons needing urgent medical care, and was very active in facilitating projects 
funded and implemented by the international community. 
</p>
<p>130. Mr. Nitzan responded to comments made by Denmark, France, Italy and others, 
noting that law enforcement against settlers&#8217; violence was given special attention through a 
combined interministerial team for addressing incitement, uprisings and ideological crimes. 
In September 2012, the Minister of Public Security had announced the establishment of a </p>


<p>new police unit which was intended to combat nationalist crimes and &#8220;price tag&#8221; offences, 
which were aimed against Palestinians. Great effort was also being made in the prevention 
of criminal activity. 
</p>
<p>131. Referring to incitement, and the criminal prosecution of racism in Israel, on which 
Nigeria and other countries had commented, the delegate said that the law provided for a 
penalty of up to five years&#8217; imprisonment for publishing anything with the intent to incite to 
racism, regardless of the outcome or the truthfulness of it, and many indictments had been 
filed in recent years. 
</p>
<p>132. Ohad Zemet, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Legal Department, responded to questions 
from Germany, Italy, Norway, Rwanda, Slovakia and the United States of America relating 
to immigrants. The history of the Jewish people made Israel highly sensitive to that 
humanitarian issue. However, the situation of Israel was more complicated than other 
developed countries and it was impossible to develop regional strategies for cooperation 
with neighbours or countries of origin, as other States with similar challenges did. Israel 
was currently granting protection to 60,000 people, who amounted to 95 per cent of all 
individuals who crossed the border from Egypt; Israel provided them with access to work, 
basic health care and education. 
</p>
<p>133. Ms. Tene-Gilad said that Israel had hundreds of NGOs active in a large number of 
issues, including human rights. Israel placed no legal restrictions on the right of 
organizations to engage in activities for the promotion and observance of human rights. 
Organizations or individuals that presented themselves as a human rights 
organization/activist/defender were not exempt from obeying the law. 
</p>
<p>134. In concluding, the delegation noted that, unfortunately, they were not able to address 
all issues raised, but would study the recommendations and return with a response at a later 
stage in the review process. 
</p>
<p>135. The delegation restated the respect Israel had for the UPR process, and noted that the 
high-level delegation, national report, presentations and answers to the many questions 
testified to that. 
</p>
