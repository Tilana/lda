<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special Rapporteur on 
the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, pursuant to 
Human Rights Council resolution 6/12. On 28 March 2008, the Human Rights Council appointed 
James Anaya, from the United States of America, as the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people. James Anaya assumed his 
mandate on 1 May 2008. This document is the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s second annual report to the 
Human Rights Council. In his first annual report of 11 August 2008 (A/HRC/9/9), the Special 
Rapporteur provided a number of reflections concerning the normative framework for addressing 
indigenous peoples&#8217; concerns, and on the operationalization of the human rights norms affirmed 
in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other relevant 
international instruments. 
</p>
<p>2. In the first part of his second annual report, the Special Rapporteur will discuss the 
implementation of his mandate. In this regard, he will first provide a reflection on his mandate in 
relation to those of other United Nations mechanisms and institutions that deal with indigenous 
issues, especially the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of the Human Rights Council, and note areas 
for cooperation. There follows a discussion on the practical framework of his work, in light of 
those other mechanisms, including a summary of the activities carried out over the past year as 
they relate to four principal areas of work: promoting good practices; thematic studies; country 
reports; and cases of alleged human rights violations. The Special Rapporteur devotes the second 
half of the report to an analysis of the duty of States to consult with indigenous peoples on 
matters affecting them, one of the core issues he has faced in his work in relation to indigenous 
peoples in various countries, with the hope of offering insight into how this issue may be 
addressed in the future by Governments, indigenous peoples, the United Nations system, and 
other stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>3. The present report also contains a series of addenda of reports and other public documents 
issued by the Special Rapporteur over the past year. Addendum 1 contains a summary of 
communications sent to Governments and replies received concerning cases of alleged human 
rights violations, as well as observations by the Special Rapporteur on these cases. Addenda 2, 3, 
and 4 are the reports on the situation of indigenous peoples in Brazil, Nepal, and Botswana, 
following missions from 14 to 25 August, and 24 November to 2 December 2008, and from 19 
to 27 March 2009, respectively. Addendum 5 is the report of the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of the indigenous communities that are affected by the construction of a hydroelectric 
project on the Changuinola River, Panama, and observations of the Government of Panama in 
response. Addendum 6 contains the report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights 
situation in Chile following his visit to that country from 6 to 9 April 2009 to assess the status of 
the implementation of the recommendations of his predecessor, Rodolfo Stavenhagen, with an 
annex containing a report outlining the international norms that are relevant to a consultation 
process in connection with constitutional reforms related to indigenous peoples in that country. 
Addendum 7 is the outcome report of a meeting in Madrid in February 2009 to enhance 
coordination between the three United Nations mechanisms with a mandate specific to 
indigenous issues: the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental 
freedoms of indigenous people, the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of the Human Rights Council. 
Finally, Addendum 8 is the report of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s examination of the human rights 
issues surrounding the confrontations between indigenous peoples and the police in Bagua, Peru. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the support provided by the staff at the 
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. He would also like to thank 
staff and affiliated researchers of the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program at the 
University of Arizona for their continued assistance with all aspects of his work. Further, the 
Special Rapporteur wishes to gratefully acknowledge and express his gratitude to the 
International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs, the Alm&#225;ciga Intercultural Work Group, and 
the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development of the Government of Spain 
for their support of the international expert seminar entitled &#8220;Implementation of the rights of 
indigenous peoples: the role of the United Nations machinery on the rights of indigenous 
peoples&#8221; in February 2009 and other support. Finally, the Special Rapporteur would like to thank 
the many indigenous peoples, Governments, United Nations bodies and agencies, 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and others that have cooperated with him over the past 
year to implement his mandate. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur is pleased to provide the Human Rights Council with the present 
report as he moves into the second year of fulfilling his mandate with optimism for a better 
future for indigenous peoples, encouraged by positive developments in many places, yet 
concerned by the reality of ongoing struggles and violations of indigenous peoples throughout 
the world. The Special Rapporteur reaffirms his strong commitment to his role as Special 
Rapporteur, acknowledges with humility the responsibility it represents, and thanks all those 
who have supported and continue to support him. 
</p>
<p><b>I.  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MANDATE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Coordination with other mechanisms and bodies 
</b></p>
<p>6. Before detailing his own areas of work and work methods, the Special Rapporteur would 
like to provide the Human Rights Council with some reflections on his mandate in relation to 
those of other United Nations mechanisms and institutions that deal with indigenous issues, 
especially the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples of the Human Rights Council. Coordination with these and 
other institutions is a fundamental aspect of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, as the 
Human Rights Council calls on him, in its resolution 6/12, article 1, paragraph (d), &#8220;To work in 
close cooperation, while avoiding unnecessary duplication, with other special procedures and 
subsidiary organs of the Human Rights Council, relevant United Nations bodies, the treaty 
bodies, and human rights regional organizations.&#8221;  
</p>
<p><b>1. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and  
the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur is specifically required &#8220;To work in close cooperation with the 
Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and to participate in its annual session&#8221; (Human Rights 
Council resolution 6/12, art. 1, para. (e)). This cooperation also extends to the Expert </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Mechanism, which is mandated by the Human Rights Council to invite the Special Rapporteur to 
its annual session in order to &#8220;enhance cooperation and avoid duplicating the work&#8221; of the 
respective mechanisms (Human Rights Council resolution 6/36, art. 5). 
</p>
<p>8. During the course of his work, the Special Rapporteur has noted a significant level of 
confusion among indigenous groups, NGOs, and other stakeholders about the respective roles 
and functions of the three mechanisms, as well as their place within the institutional structure of 
the United Nations. Continued education about the individual mandates and functions of these 
mechanisms is essential. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues was 
established in 2000 as an advisory body to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, 
focusing mainly on indigenous issues in the field of economic and social development, culture, 
the environment, education, health and human rights.<b>1</b> The United Nations Permanent Forum is 
made up of 16 individual experts and meets annually for two weeks in New York. The Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which held its first annual session in 
October 2008, is composed of five individual experts with a mandate to provide the Human 
Rights Council with thematic expertise on the rights of indigenous peoples, mainly in the form of 
studies and research-based advice (Human Rights Council resolution 6/36, art. 1, para. (a)). This 
year, the Human Rights Council has requested the Expert Mechanism to prepare a study on 
lessons learned and challenges to achieve the implementation of the right of indigenous peoples 
to education, which was concluded this year (Human Rights Council resolution 9/7). 
</p>
<p>9. The three United Nations mechanisms with a mandate on indigenous issues were not 
necessarily designed with a complementary purpose, but were developed separately in 
response to different historical and political contexts and the demands of the indigenous 
peoples&#8217; movement. Consequently, on paper, the mandates of these three mechanisms overlap to 
a certain extent and, in practical terms, many of the activities carried out by the respective 
mandate-holders could be structured more effectively in relation to those of the other 
mechanisms.  
</p>
<p>10. From 4 to 6 February 2009, the Special Rapporteur participated in a seminar in Madrid 
with the members of the Expert Mechanism and four members of the Permanent Forum, along 
with a group of experts from various regions, including the former Special Rapporteur, 
Rodolfo Stavenhagen. The main objective of the meeting was to promote an informal dialogue 
among the members of the three mechanisms to better coordinate their work, as well as their 
activities with other United Nations agencies and bodies. During the meeting, the experts 
discussed methods for streamlining the work of the three mechanisms by examining the priority 
work area or areas of the respective mandates and identifying ways in which the aspects of each 
mandate might be maximized. 
</p>
<p>11. For example, in contrast to the Expert Mechanism and the Permanent Forum, the Special 
Rapporteur has a clear mandate to investigate and make recommendations on specific human 
rights situations of indigenous peoples. Nevertheless, as was noted during the expert meeting, 
following a pattern similar to that of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations, which is no 
longer active, numerous indigenous groups attend the annual sessions of the Permanent Forum 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  United Nations Economic and Social Council resolution 2000/22. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and the Expert Mechanism with the intention of presenting allegations of specific situations of 
human rights violations, despite the fact that there is no specific mandate and no procedural 
mechanism currently in place for the Permanent Forum and Expert Mechanism to take action on 
these allegations.  
</p>
<p>12. Given the recognized expectations on the part of indigenous peoples to have these specific 
concerns heard, the Special Rapporteur and members of the Permanent Forum and Expert 
Mechanism recommended in the report following the Madrid meeting that the Special 
Rapporteur develop methodologies for receiving allegations of human rights violations and, as 
required, of direct dialogue between the Governments and indigenous peoples, during his 
participation at the annual sessions of the Permanent Forum and the Expert Mechanism. In this 
connection, during the past year, the Special Rapporteur has attended the annual meetings of the 
Permanent Forum and the Expert Mechanism, and has started to develop methods for receiving 
communications in coordination with these mechanisms in order to maximize the participation of 
indigenous groups, their organizations, and NGOs at these sessions. The Special Rapporteur 
continues to refine and realize these procedures. 
</p>
<p>13. Further, it is worth pointing out that, because the mandate of the Expert Mechanism is 
primarily research-based and study oriented, the Special Rapporteur considers his role in this 
regard as focusing mainly on providing observations on the core issues that have arisen during 
his work evaluating specific countries and examining specific situations of allegations of human 
rights violations. These will, for the most part, be practically oriented and identify best practices, 
where they exist. The Special Rapporteur will also provide input to the Permanent Forum and the 
Expert Mechanism on the basis of this work. <b> 
</b></p>
<p>14. While the Permanent Forum, the Expert Mechanism and the Special Rapporteur have 
different roles, a common purpose that joins them is the advancement of the human rights of 
indigenous peoples worldwide. Clearly, an important point of reference for pursuing this 
common purpose is the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. In 
article 42 of the Declaration, the General Assembly calls upon all United Nations bodies and 
agencies to &#8220;promote respect for and full application of the provisions of this Declaration&#8221;. The 
Special Rapporteur is committed to continued collaboration with these two mechanisms as he 
enters the second year of his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Coordination with United Nations agencies,  
and with regional and other bodies 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur has also been active in engaging with agencies of the 
United Nations Secretariat on indigenous issues. He participated in two regional seminars in 
Latin America on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, one in 
Lima, Peru between 6 and 8 October 2008, and one in Montelimar, Nicaragua between 10 and 
13 June 2009, organized by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, which, at 
the regional level, promotes implementation of the rights and corresponding State obligations 
expressed in the Declaration through education, information-gathering, and advisory 
services. During the seminars, he gave presentations on the content and means of implementing 
the Declaration, especially as it pertains to the Latin America region. The Declaration was  
also the subject of a presentation he gave to representatives of various United Nations  
agencies in a seminar organized by the United Nations Development Programme in New York, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>on 20 May 2009, in which the Special Rapporteur emphasized the role of United Nations 
agencies and programmes in implementing the Declaration. The following day, the Special 
Rapporteur met in New York with members of the United Nations Department of Political 
Affairs to exchange views on indigenous issues in relation to major political and economic 
trends. 
</p>
<p>16. At the regional level, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights have played groundbreaking roles in developing a 
distinct body of jurisprudence concerning the rights of indigenous peoples in the Americas, with 
an important normative effect in other regions. On 25 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur 
participated in an expert seminar on indigenous land rights and the principle of free, prior, and 
informed consent in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the Inter-American Commission on 
Human Rights; he has exchanged information with the Commission on various cases. The 
Special Rapporteur has also confirmed his willingness to cooperate with the Working Group on 
Indigenous Populations/Communities of the African Commission on Human and Peoples&#8217; 
Rights, and looks forward to exploring concrete ways in which he may enhance collaboration 
with the Commission in the future. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur has also cooperated with the World Bank, and on 3 June 2008 
was the featured speaker in a seminar on &#8220;Advancing indigenous rights and development in 
Latin America and the Caribbean&#8221; in Washington, D.C., in which he focused on the role of the 
World Bank in relation to various challenges and initiatives concerning indigenous peoples. He 
continues to maintain contact with representatives of the World Bank to explore ways of further 
coordination. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Areas of work 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur has engaged in a range of activities within the terms of his 
mandate to monitor the human rights conditions of indigenous peoples worldwide and promote 
steps to improve those conditions. He has sought to incorporate a gender perspective, and be 
attentive to the particular vulnerabilities of indigenous children. Overall, the Special Rapporteur 
has tried to develop work methods oriented towards constructive dialogue with Governments, 
indigenous peoples, NGOs, relevant United Nations agencies and other actors, in order to 
address challenging issues and situations and build on advances already made. The various 
activities that he has carried out in this spirit can be described as falling within four, interrelated 
spheres of activity: promoting good practices; thematic studies; country reports; and cases of 
alleged human rights violations. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Promoting good practices 
</b></p>
<p>19. A first area of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work follows from the directive given by the 
Human Rights Council &#8220;to identify &#8230; and promote best practices&#8221; (Human Rights Council 
resolution 6/12, art. 1, para. (a)). The Special Rapporteur has been focused on working to 
advance legal, administrative, and programmatic reforms at the domestic level to implement the 
standards of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and other 
relevant international instruments. Reform of this kind is a major undertaking, as it is full of all 
kinds of complexities and requires a strong commitment, both financial and political, on the part 
of Governments.  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>20. During the course of his work, the Special Rapporteur has been asked to provide assistance 
with constitutional and legislative reform initiatives by providing orientation on how to 
harmonize those initiatives with relevant international standards. As reported to the Human 
Rights Council last year, shortly after assuming his mandate in May 2008, the Special 
Rapporteur was asked by indigenous organizations and the President of the Constituent 
Assembly of Ecuador to provide technical assistance with the constitutional revision process. 
Ecuador&#8217;s new Constitution was approved by referendum in September 2008 with significant 
provisions affirming indigenous collective rights. The Special Rapporteur continues to monitor 
Ecuador&#8217;s implementation of those reforms and subsequent legislation. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur has also promoted good practices by encouraging positive steps 
that States have made. In December 2008, the Special Rapporteur was invited to attend a 
ceremony in Awas Tingni, Nicaragua, during which the Government handed over to that 
indigenous community the much-awaited title to its ancestral lands, as required by a 
2001 judgement of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. In a press release following the 
titling, the Special Rapporteur commended the Government of Nicaragua for taking affirmative 
steps to implement the judgement. The Special Rapporteur will continue to monitor progress 
towards ensuring that the rights of Awas Tingni to the titled lands are fully respected in practice 
by third parties and towards addressing the land and related claims of other indigenous 
communities.  
</p>
<p>22. Also, in April 2009, the Special Rapporteur visited Chile to assess the situation of the 
indigenous peoples, as a follow-up to the 2003 visit to the country by his predecessor. While 
many problems persist for indigenous peoples in Chile, the Government has taken important 
steps within the last year to advance the protection of their rights, including by ratifying in 
September 2008 International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 concerning 
Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989), and by committing to enact 
constitutional reforms to recognize and promote indigenous rights. In light of the constitutional 
reform process, the Special Rapporteur developed and submitted to the Government a report, 
which was subsequently made public, outlining and analysing the various applicable elements of 
the right to consultation, and providing examples of consultation mechanisms in other countries. 
The Government has initiated consultations with the indigenous groups of Chile on the 
constitutional reform process, and the Special Rapporteur continues to monitor their progress. 
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur participated in a seminar on indigenous rights in Jakarta, from 16 
to 17 March 2009, sponsored by the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission 
(KOMNAS HAM) and the Indigenous Peoples&#8217; Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN - Aliansi 
Masyarakat Adat Nusantara). At the seminar, KOMNAS HAN and AMAN announced an 
agreement for a joint programme for addressing indigenous issues - a good example of 
coordination between a State&#8217;s independent human rights commission and a major indigenous 
organization.  
</p>
<p>24. From 27 to 31 October 2008, the Special Rapporteur joined Saami representatives from 
throughout the Saami territory in the Nordic countries and Russia, Government representatives, 
and others in attendance at the 19th Saami Conference, in Rovaniemi, Finland. At the 
conference, the Special Rapporteur was able to meet with the Saami Council and the Saami </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>Parliaments in the Nordic countries to discuss ways of strengthening institutional arrangements 
for protecting Saami rights. The Saami Parliaments have become an increasingly effective means 
for Saami people to enhance control over matters affecting their lives and communities.  
</p>
<p>25. An important component of efforts to build good practices at the domestic level is a policy 
of commitment to advance the rights of indigenous peoples in accordance with the Declaration. 
This year, Australia, one of only four States to have voted against it, officially endorsed the 
Declaration and, in a widely circulated statement, committed to fully implement the standards 
contained therein. This is a welcome development in Australia&#8217;s policies towards indigenous 
peoples, which the Special Rapporteur noted in a press release issued jointly with the 
Chairpersons of the Expert Mechanism and the Permanent Forum in April 2009. Likewise, 
Colombia, which had abstained in the vote on the Declaration, sent a letter to the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights on 20 April 2009 expressing its support for the 
Declaration and the principles contained therein and &#8220;subscribed to the concepts of equality, 
respect for diversity, and non-discrimination that constitute the foundation of the Declaration&#8221;.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>26. In his future work, the Special Rapporteur will continue to promote positive developments, 
and reiterates his willingness to offer constructive technical and advisory assistance to 
Governments, companies, indigenous peoples and other stakeholders, where needed, in their 
efforts to establish legal, administrative, and programmatic initiatives and reforms in indigenous 
matters. The work of the Special Rapporteur in this regard will be oriented in practical terms and 
aimed at identifying and promoting models that can be applied in various contexts. The Special 
Rapporteur foresees detailing these models, where they exist and have been successful, in his 
subsequent annual reports to the Human Right Council and in other public reports. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Thematic studies 
</b></p>
<p>27. A second area of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work, which is intended to contribute to good 
practices in specific country situations, involves conducting or participating in studies on issues 
or themes that are of interest to indigenous peoples across borders and regions of the world. The 
former Special Rapporteur carried out a number of thematic studies to identify major issues and 
to provide a foundation for subsequent positive practical action and reform, including on the 
impacts of development projects on indigenous communities, the implementation of domestic 
laws and international standards to protect indigenous rights, indigenous peoples and the 
education system, the relationship between formal State law and customary indigenous law, and 
international norms concerning indigenous peoples. However, as previously noted, taking into 
consideration the establishment of the Expert Mechanism with a mandate to provide thematic 
expertise and recommendations to the Human Rights Council on issues affecting indigenous 
peoples, the Special Rapporteur now sees his own work carrying out thematic studies as 
secondary to the other areas of his work. His role will, for the most part, be complementary and 
supportive of the work of the Expert Mechanism. In this regard, early this year he provided 
information, based on his experiences as Special Rapporteur, for the Expert Mechanism&#8217;s current 
study on the right of indigenous peoples to education.  
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  Letter from the Deputy Minister of Multilateral Affairs to the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>28. Apart from this input, in the interest of further understanding specific challenges facing 
indigenous women, the Special Rapporteur participated in the Regional Consultation on 
&#8220;Violence against Indigenous Women in Asia Pacific&#8221; with the Special Rapporteur on violence 
against women, its causes and consequences, Yakin Ert&#252;rk. The Regional Consultation was 
organized by the Asia Pacific Forum on Women, Law and Development, and Mahila Sarvangeen 
Utkarsha Mandal, and was followed by a National Consultation on Indigenous Women in India, 
with activities from 14 to 18 October 2008 in New Delhi. Participants in the consultations, many 
of them indigenous women from the region, identified key recurring issues contributing to 
violence, including discriminatory acts against indigenous women around the following themes: 
economic globalization, militarization and armed conflict, and culture, tradition and religion and 
their intersectional impacts on the lives of indigenous women. The discussions with the two 
Special Rapporteurs were directed towards identifying effective strategies and mechanisms for 
addressing multiple forms of violence against indigenous women at the national, regional and 
international levels and to learn from good practices.  
</p>
<p>29. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur is collaborating with NGOs and indigenous experts 
on two initiatives related to two thematic areas of recurrent concern to indigenous peoples. One 
is a seminar, organized by the NGOs Khredda and the UNESCO Centre of Catalonia 
(UNESCOCAT) to take place in October of this year, on dispute resolution mechanisms with 
regard to extractive industries operating or seeking to operate within indigenous territories. This 
seminar and the report it will generate correspond to a recommendation made last year by the 
Permanent Forum that the Special Rapporteur carry out a study on transnational corporations, 
and it is intended to complement the Permanent Forum&#8217;s own work on this subject. A second 
initiative is a multifaceted study on legal pluralism and indigenous customary law, to be carried 
out in collaboration with the International Council on Human Rights Policy and the 
United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. This study is likely to begin 
with a workshop at the University of Arizona, United States of America, early next year.  
</p>
<p><b>3.  Country reports 
</b></p>
<p>30. A third area of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work involves investigating and reporting on the 
overall human rights situations of indigenous peoples in selected countries. The reports of the 
country situations include conclusions and recommendations aimed at strengthening good 
practices, identifying areas of concern, and improving the human rights conditions of indigenous 
peoples. The reporting process typically involves a visit to the countries under review, including 
to the capital and selected places of concern within the country, during which the Special 
Rapporteur interacts with Government representatives, indigenous communities from different 
regions, and a cross section of civil society actors that work on issues relevant to indigenous 
peoples. In accordance with the Code of Conduct for special procedures mandate-holders, these 
visits can only take place with Government consent and cooperation.  
</p>
<p>31. Over the past year, the Special Rapporteur has visited Brazil, Nepal, Botswana, and 
Australia to report on those countries, and he has conducted follow-up visits to Chile and 
Colombia to evaluate their progress in implementing the recommendations in the reports of his 
predecessor. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur has received positive indications from the 
Governments of the Republic of the Congo and the Russian Federation for forthcoming visits, 
and has outstanding requests for visits to India and Indonesia, which he hopes will be considered 
favourably in the near future. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Cases of alleged human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>32. Finally, the fourth, and perhaps principal, area of work involves responding, on an ongoing 
basis, to specific cases of alleged human rights violations. A fundamental aspect of the mandate 
of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of 
indigenous people, as reaffirmed by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 6/12 is &#8220;to 
gather, request, receive and exchange information and communications from all relevant sources, 
including Governments, indigenous people and their communities and organizations, on alleged 
violations of their human rights and fundamental freedoms&#8221; (art. 1, para. (b)). The Special 
Rapporteur has placed special emphasis on his mandate &#8220;to develop a regular cooperative 
dialogue with all relevant actors&#8221; (art. 1, para. (f)) by developing ongoing long-term strategies 
for all the work he undertakes. 
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s ability to address specific situations of alleged violations relies, 
to a large extent, on the information provided to him by indigenous peoples and their 
organizations, NGOs and other sources. Over the past year, the Special Rapporteur has received 
information about cases of alleged human rights violations in countries on every continent and, 
in response, has sent numerous communications to Governments about these situations. These 
cases involve, inter alia, infringements of the right to free, prior and informed consent, especially 
in relation to natural resource extraction and displacement or removal of indigenous 
communities; denial of the rights of indigenous peoples to lands and resources; the situation of 
indigenous peoples in voluntary isolation; incidents of threats or violence against indigenous 
peoples and individuals, including defenders of indigenous rights; and concerns about 
constitutional or legislative reforms in indigenous subject matter. A complete summary of 
communications sent, responses received from Governments, and observations of the Special 
Rapporteur can be found in the communications report attached to the present report as 
Addendum 1. 
</p>
<p>34. Given the limited resources available, it is impossible for the Special Rapporteur to 
respond to every case that comes to his attention. However, in general, he does his best to act on 
detailed and credible information that presents a serious situation falling within his mandate in 
which intervention has a reasonable chance of having a positive impact, either by drawing 
needed attention to the situation or by prompting Government authorities or other actors into 
corrective action. Alternatively, the Special Rapporteur may take action where the situation is 
representative of, or connected to, a broader pattern of human rights violations against 
indigenous peoples. The Special Rapporteur has been careful to respond to allegations of human 
rights violations from a wide range of regions and countries.  
</p>
<p>35. The usual first step in taking action on such information is to write a letter to the 
Government concerned, along with a request that the Government respond. In some cases, the 
Special Rapporteur has issued public statements calling attention to, or expressing concern over, 
the human rights violations alleged. If circumstances warrant it and the Government concerned 
consents, the Special Rapporteur may conduct a country visit to examine a specific situation, as 
he did in visits to Panama and Peru. In addition, as he has done with regard to the situations 
examined in those two countries and expects to do in future cases, he may issue detailed 
observations with analyses and recommendations, in the hope that they will be of use to the 
Governments and indigenous peoples concerned in their efforts to address the problems raised. 
The Special Rapporteur is aiming to avoid the &#8220;revolving door&#8221; approach of simply sending a </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>communication and receiving a response from the Government concerned, but rather aims to 
engage actively with States, indigenous peoples and other actors to closely monitor and evaluate 
situations, identify underlying causes of immediate problems, promote specific action that builds 
on advances already made, and develop recommendations that are practical, well founded in 
available knowledge, and in accordance with relevant human rights standards.  
</p>
<p><b>II.  A CORE ISSUE:  THE DUTY TO CONSULT 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur has sought to identify common patterns of problems facing 
indigenous peoples throughout the world and to develop measures to target those issues directly. 
He has noticed, frequently and in a wide variety of situations, a lack of adequate implementation 
of the duty of States to consult with indigenous peoples in decisions affecting them, and a need 
on the part of Governments and other stakeholders for orientation about the measures necessary 
for compliance with this duty. The Special Rapporteur has observed that, without the buy-in of 
indigenous peoples, through consultation, at the earliest stages of the development of 
Government initiatives, the effectiveness of Government programmes, even those that are 
intended to specifically benefit indigenous peoples, can be crippled at the outset. Invariably, it 
appears that a lack of adequate consultation leads to conflictive situations, with indigenous 
expressions of anger and mistrust, which, in some cases, have spiralled into violence. 
</p>
<p>37. There is not one specific formula for carrying out consultations with indigenous peoples 
that applies to all countries and in all circumstances. In this respect, article 34 of ILO Convention 
No. 169 affirms: &#8220;The nature and scope of the measures to be taken to give effect to this 
Convention shall be determined in a flexible manner, having regard to the conditions 
characteristic of each country.&#8221; While the implications of the duty to consult are many and 
varied, during the past year, the Special Rapporteur has touched upon issues related to 
consultation mainly in two areas: in the context of constitutional and legislative reforms touching 
upon indigenous subject matters; and in the context of development and natural resource 
extraction initiatives and, in some cases, related relocation efforts affecting indigenous peoples. 
The Special Rapporteur will devote the rest of the report to reflecting on certain aspects of the 
duty to consult and its implementation that are relevant to issues he has confronted, in the hope 
of providing useful points of clarification and orientation. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  The normative grounding and general character of the duty to consult 
</b></p>
<p>38. It should be emphasized that the duty of States to consult with indigenous peoples on 
decisions affecting them finds prominent expression in the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and is firmly rooted in international human rights law. This duty is 
referenced throughout the Declaration in relation to particular concerns (arts. 10, 11, 15, 17, 19, 
28, 29, 30, 32, 36, and 38), and it is affirmed as an overarching principle in article 19, which 
provides: &#8220;States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples 
concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and 
informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that 
may affect them.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>39. Like the Declaration, ILO Convention No. 169 requires States to consult with 
indigenous peoples in good faith, with the objective of achieving their agreement or consent 
on the aspects of management schemes or projects that affect them, and calls upon States to </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>carry out consultations with indigenous communities in connection with a variety of contexts 
(arts. 6, paras. 1 and 2, 15, para. 2, 17, para. 2, 22, para. 3, 27, para. 3, and 28). A tripartite 
committee of the ILO Governing Body has in fact said that &#8220;the spirit of consultation and 
participation constitutes the cornerstone of Convention No. 169 on which all its provisions are 
based&#8221;.<b>3</b> The jurisprudence of the ILO draws out some of the contours of the duty to consult, 
which are referenced below. 
</p>
<p>40. The duty of States to effectively consult with indigenous peoples is also grounded in the 
core human rights treaties of the United Nations, including the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination<b>4</b> and the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Most recently, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, 
which oversees compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Racial Discrimination, has called upon numerous Governments to carry out consultations with 
indigenous peoples on matters affecting their rights and interests, specifically in its concluding 
observations on Canada,<b>5</b> Indonesia,<b>6</b> New Zealand,<b>7</b> the Democratic Republic of the Congo,<b>8</b> 
the United States of America,<b>9</b> Ecuador,<b>10</b> Sweden,<b>11</b> and Namibia;<b>12</b> and also in its review of 
specific situations under its early-warning measures and urgent procedures, including in Belize,<b>13</b>

</p>
<p>Brazil,<b>14</b> Chile,<b>15</b> Panama,<b>16</b> and Peru.<b>17</b> Similarly, the Human Rights Committee has made 
reference to the duty to consult in a number of its reports to Governments on their compliance 
with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, most recently in its concluding 
observations on Chile,<b>18</b> Costa Rica,<b>19</b> Panama,<b>20</b> Botswana,<b>21</b> and Nicaragua.<b>22</b> Additionally, the 
duty to consult arises from the obligations assumed by States under the American Convention on 
Human Rights, as affirmed by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.<b>23</b> 
</p>
<p>41. This duty is a corollary of a myriad of universally accepted human rights, including the 
right to cultural integrity, the right to equality and the right to property, as indicated in the 
referenced statements and decisions, respectively, of the Human Rights Committee, the 
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Inter-American Court of 
Human Rights. More fundamentally, it derives from the overarching right of indigenous peoples 
to self-determination and from related principles of democracy and popular sovereignty. The 
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms in its article 3 
that: &#8220;Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right they freely 
determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural 
development.&#8221; This affirmation responds to the aspirations of indigenous peoples worldwide to 
be in control of their own destinies under conditions of equality, and to participate effectively in 
decision-making that affects them. The right of self-determination is a foundational right, 
without which indigenous peoples&#8217; human rights, both collective and individual, cannot be fully 
enjoyed. Related principles of popular sovereignty and democracy join in opposition to 
government by imposition and uphold the imperative of government by consent. Consistent with 
these principles, the duty of States to consult with indigenous peoples in decisions affecting them

 <p> 
</p>
<p>is aimed at reversing the historical pattern of exclusion from decision-making, in order to avoid 
the future imposition of important decisions on indigenous peoples, and to allow them to flourish 
as distinct communities on lands to which their cultures remain attached. 
</p>
<p>42. As a general matter, decisions of the State should be made through democratic processes in 
which the public&#8217;s interests are adequately represented. Procedures for notice to and comment by 
the general public often appropriately reinforce representative democratic processes for State 
decisions. However, special, differentiated consultation procedures are called for when State 
decisions affect indigenous peoples&#8217; particular interests. Such special procedures are justified 
because of the nature of those particular interests, arising as they do from indigenous peoples&#8217; 
distinctive cultural patterns and histories, and because the normal democratic and representative 
processes usually do not work adequately to address the concerns that are particular to 
indigenous peoples, who are typically marginalized in the political sphere. The duty of States to 
consult with indigenous peoples and its various normative components are premised on 
widespread acknowledgment, as manifested in the Declaration, of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
distinctive characteristics and the need for special measures to address their disadvantaged 
conditions. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Situations in which the duty to consult applies 
</b></p>
<p>43. It would be unrealistic to say that the duty of States to consult directly with indigenous 
peoples through special, differentiated procedures applies literally, in the broadest sense, 
whenever a State decision may affect them, since almost all legislative and administrative 
decisions that a State adopts may affect the indigenous peoples of the State along with the rest of 
the population in one way or another. Rather, a purposive interpretation of the various relevant 
articles of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, in light of other 
international instruments and related jurisprudence, leads to the following assessment of the 
scope of application of the duty to consult: it applies whenever a State decision may affect 
indigenous peoples in ways not felt by others in society. Such a differentiated effect occurs when 
the interests or conditions of indigenous peoples that are particular to them are implicated in the 
decision, even when the decision may have a broader impact, as in the case of certain legislation. 
For example, land or resource use legislation may have broad application but, at the same time, 
may affect indigenous peoples&#8217; interests in particular ways because of their traditional land 
tenure or related cultural patterns, thus giving rise to the duty to consult. 
</p>
<p>44. The duty to consult is not limited to circumstances in which a proposed measure will or 
may affect an already recognized right or legal entitlement. The Special Rapporteur notes with 
concern that some States have effectively or purposefully taken the position that direct 
consultation with indigenous peoples regarding natural resource extraction activity or other 
projects with significant environmental impacts, such as dams, is required only when the lands 
within which the activities at issue take place have been recognized under domestic law as 
indigenous lands. Such a position is misplaced since, commensurate with the right to 
self-determination and democratic principles, and because of the typically vulnerable conditions 
of indigenous peoples, the duty to consult with them arises whenever their particular interests are 
at stake, even when those interests do not correspond to a recognized right to land or other legal 
entitlement. In this regard, a tripartite committee of the ILO Governing Body has expressly 
affirmed: &#8220;The consultations referred to in article 15, paragraph 2, are required in respect of 
resources owned by the State pertaining to the lands that the peoples concerned occupy or </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>otherwise use, whether or not they hold ownership title to those lands.&#8221;<b>24</b> One can easily 
imagine innumerable ways in which indigenous peoples and their interests may be affected by 
development projects or legislative initiatives in the absence of a corresponding legal 
entitlement. 
</p>
<p>45. The specific characteristics of the consultation procedure that is required by the duty to 
consult will necessarily vary depending upon the nature of the proposed measure and the scope 
of its impact on indigenous peoples. Constitutional or legislative reform measures that concern 
or affect all the indigenous peoples of a country will require appropriate consultation and 
representative mechanisms that will in some way be open to, and reach, all of them. By contrast, 
measures that affect particular indigenous peoples or communities, such as initiatives for natural 
resource extraction activity in their territories, will require consultation procedures focused on 
the interests of, and engagement with, those particularly affected groups. 
</p>
<p><b>C. The requirement that consultations be in good faith, 
with the objective of achieving agreement or consent 
</b></p>
<p>46. The character of the consultation procedure and its object are also shaped by the nature of 
the right or interest at stake for the indigenous peoples concerned and the anticipated impact of 
the proposed measure. The Declaration establishes that, in general, consultations with indigenous 
peoples are to be carried out in &#8220;good faith &#8230; in order to obtain their free, prior and informed 
consent&#8221; (art. 19). This provision of the Declaration should not be regarded as according 
indigenous peoples a general &#8220;veto power&#8221; over decisions that may affect them, but rather as 
establishing consent as the objective of consultations with indigenous peoples. In this regard, 
ILO Convention No. 169 provides that consultations are to take place &#8220;with the objective of 
achieving agreement or consent on the proposed measure&#8221; (art. 6, para. 2). The somewhat 
different language of the Declaration suggests a heightened emphasis on the need for 
consultations that are in the nature of negotiations towards mutually acceptable arrangements, 
prior to the decisions on proposed measures, rather than consultations that are more in the nature 
of mechanisms for providing indigenous peoples with information about decisions already made 
or in the making, without allowing them genuinely to influence the decision-making process. 
</p>
<p>47. Necessarily, the strength or importance of the objective of achieving consent varies 
according to the circumstances and the indigenous interests involved. A significant, direct 
impact on indigenous peoples&#8217; lives or territories establishes a strong presumption that the 
proposed measure should not go forward without indigenous peoples&#8217; consent. In certain 
contexts, that presumption may harden into a prohibition of the measure or project in the 
absence of indigenous consent. The Declaration recognizes two situations in which the State is 
under an obligation to obtain the consent of the indigenous peoples concerned, beyond the 
general obligation to have consent as the objective of consultations. These situations include 
when the project will result in the relocation of a group from its traditional lands, and in cases

 <p> 
</p>
<p>involving the storage or disposal of toxic waste within indigenous lands (arts. 10 and 29, 
para. 2, respectively). In the same vein, in a case involving the Saramaka people of Suriname, the 
Inter-American Court of Human Rights held that &#8220;regarding large-scale development or 
investment projects that would have a major impact within Saramaka territory, the State has a 
duty, not only to consult with the Saramaka, but also to obtain their free, prior, and informed 
consent, according to their customs and traditions&#8221;.<b>25</b> 
</p>
<p>48. In all cases in which indigenous peoples&#8217; particular interests are affected by a proposed 
measure, obtaining their consent should, in some degree, be an objective of the consultations. As 
stated, this requirement does not provide indigenous peoples with a &#8220;veto power&#8221;, but rather 
establishes the need to frame consultation procedures in order to make every effort to build 
consensus on the part of all concerned. The Special Rapporteur regrets that in many situations 
the discussion over the duty to consult and the related principle of free, prior and informed 
consent have been framed in terms of whether or not indigenous peoples hold a veto power that 
they could wield to halt development projects. The Special Rapporteur considers that focusing 
the debate in this way is not in line with the spirit or character of the principles of consultation 
and consent as they have developed in international human rights law and have been 
incorporated into the Declaration. 
</p>
<p>49. These principles are designed to build dialogue in which both States and indigenous 
peoples are to work in good faith towards consensus and try in earnest to arrive at a mutually 
satisfactory agreement. As emphasized earlier, the duty of States to consult with indigenous 
peoples and related principles have emerged to reverse historical patterns of imposed decisions 
and conditions of life that have threatened the survival of indigenous peoples. At the same time, 
principles of consultation and consent do not bestow on indigenous peoples a right to unilaterally 
impose their will on States when the latter act legitimately and faithfully in the public interest. 
Rather, the principles of consultation and consent are aimed at avoiding the imposition of the 
will of one party over the other, and at instead striving for mutual understanding and consensual 
decision-making. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Elements of confidence-building conducive to consensus 
</b></p>
<p>50. A good faith effort towards consensual decision-making of this kind requires that States 
&#8220;endeavour to achieve consensus on the procedures to be followed; facilitate access to such 
procedures through broad information; and create a climate of confidence with indigenous 
peoples which favours productive dialogue&#8221;.<b>26</b> The creation of a climate of confidence is 
particularly important in relation to indigenous peoples, &#8220;given their lack of trust in State 
institutions and their feeling of marginalization, both of which have their origins in extremely old

 <p> 
</p>
<p>and complex historic events, and both of which have yet to be overcome&#8221;.<b>27</b> As a tripartite 
committee of the Governing Body of ILO noted in a case involving a constitutional reform 
process in Mexico, &#8220;the climate of confrontation, violence and lack of mutual trust stopped the 
consultations from being conducted more productively&#8221;.<b>28</b> Further, indigenous peoples are 
typically disadvantaged in terms of political influence, financial resources, access to information, 
and relevant education in comparison to the State institutions or private parties, such as 
companies, that are their counterparts in the consultations. 
</p>
<p>51. In order to achieve a climate of confidence and mutual respect for the consultations, the 
consultation procedure itself should be the product of consensus. The Special Rapporteur has 
observed that, in many instances, consultation procedures are not effective and do not enjoy the 
confidence of indigenous peoples, because the affected indigenous peoples were not adequately 
included in the discussions leading to the design and implementation of the consultation 
procedures. Additionally, States must duly address the imbalance of power by ensuring 
arrangements by which indigenous peoples have the financial, technical and other assistance they 
need, and they must do so without using such assistance to leverage or influence indigenous 
positions in the consultations. 
</p>
<p>52. The building of confidence and the possibility of genuine consensus also depends on a 
consultation procedure in which indigenous peoples&#8217; own institutions of representation and 
decision-making are fully respected, as explicitly required by the Declaration (art. 19) and 
ILO Convention No. 169 (art. 6, para. 1 (a)). The Special Rapporteur notes that indigenous 
peoples may also need to develop or revise their own institutions, through their own 
decision-making procedures, in order to set up representative structures to facilitate the 
consultation processes. The Special Rapporteur has noted that the failure of indigenous groups to 
clarify their representative organization structures can confuse and slow down the consultation 
process. In this respect, it may be helpful to bear in mind that the Declaration recalls that the 
functioning of indigenous institutions should be &#8220;in accordance with international human rights 
standards&#8221; (art. 34) and calls for particular attention &#8220;to the rights and special needs of 
indigenous elders, women, youth, children and persons with disabilities&#8221;, including in the 
elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against indigenous children and women 
(art. 22). 
</p>
<p>53. In cases involving natural resource exploitation or development projects affecting 
indigenous lands, in order for the indigenous peoples concerned to make free and informed 
decisions about the project under consideration, it is necessary that they are provided with full 
and objective information about all aspects of the project that will affect them, including the 
impact of the project on their lives and environment. In this connection, it is essential for the 
State to carry out environmental and social impact studies so that the full expected consequences 
of the project can be known. These studies must be presented to the indigenous groups

</p>
<p>concerned at the early stages of the consultation, allowing them time to understand the results of 
the impact studies and to present their observations and receive information addressing any 
concerns. Further, a consensus-driven consultation process in such contexts should not only 
address measures to mitigate or compensate for adverse impacts of the project, but also explore 
and arrive at means of equitable benefit-sharing in a spirit of true partnership. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  The duty to consult and private company responsibility 
</b></p>
<p>54. Frequently, issues of consultation arise when Governments grant concessions to private 
companies to extract natural resources, build dams, or pursue other development projects 
within or in close proximity to indigenous lands. In this connection, the State itself has the 
responsibility to carry out or ensure adequate consultation, even when a private company, as a 
practical matter, is the one promoting or carrying out the activities that may affect indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights and lands. In accordance with well-grounded principles of international law, the 
duty of the State to protect the human rights of indigenous peoples, including its duty to consult 
with the indigenous peoples concerned before carrying out activities that affect them, is not one 
that can be avoided through delegation to a private company or other entity. Further, as is the 
case in other contexts, consultations on extractive or other development activities affecting 
indigenous peoples should take place at the earliest opportunity and in all phases of 
decision-making, such that consultations should occur before concessions to private companies 
are granted. 
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur has observed several instances in which the State hands over 
consultation obligations to the private company involved in a project. In addition to not 
absolving the State of ultimate responsibility, such delegation of a State&#8217;s human rights 
obligations to a private company may not be desirable, and can even be problematic, given that 
the interests of the private company, generally speaking, are principally lucrative and thus cannot 
be in complete alignment with the public interest or the best interests of the indigenous peoples 
concerned. That is not, however, to discount the possibility of substantial convergence of these 
interests in a way that allows for consensus through negotiations in which imbalances of power 
are overcome. 
</p>
<p>56. For their part, private companies that promote or engage in extractive or other development 
activities affecting indigenous peoples should themselves, as a matter of company policy, 
endeavour to conform their behaviour at all times to relevant international norms concerning the 
rights of indigenous peoples, including those norms related to consultation. While in strict legal 
terms, with the exception of some circumstances, international law does not impose direct 
responsibility on companies to respect human rights, private companies are in fact increasingly 
evaluated for their compliance with international human rights norms. More and more, there is 
widespread expectation that companies will follow these norms within their respective spheres of 
influence, an expectation that has been expressed by international civil society, international 
human rights institutions, States, and companies themselves.<b>29</b> Additionally, in situations in

 <p> 
</p>
<p>which company activities will have a significant impact on indigenous communities, it is usually 
ill-advised for companies to ignore relevant international norms for practical reasons. As the 
Special Rapporteur has observed in his work, a failure to act in conformity with these norms 
makes companies vulnerable to difficulties such as lost time and economic resources, and 
impedes them from attaining or maintaining an image of social responsibility. 
</p>
<p>57. The Special Rapporteur has observed that many companies lack an adequate understanding 
of the international human rights norms concerning indigenous peoples that are applicable in the 
countries in which they conduct business, and that many companies lack a code of conduct that 
adequately incorporates human rights principles. In order for private companies to meaningfully 
comply with relevant human rights norms within their respective spheres of influence, it is 
necessary for them to identify, fully incorporate and make operative the norms concerning the 
rights of indigenous peoples within every aspect of their work related to the projects they 
undertake. In addition, as part of its required due diligence, each private company operating in 
proximity to indigenous peoples should ensure that, through its behaviour, it does not ratify or 
contribute to any act or omission on the part of the State that could infringe the human rights of 
the affected communities, such as a failure on the part of the State to adequately consult with the 
affected indigenous community before proceeding with a project. For its part, the State should, at 
all times, closely monitor company behaviour to ensure that indigenous peoples&#8217; rights are fully 
respected, and that required consultations are fully and adequately employed.

<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b>Implementation of the mandate 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Cooperation with other mechanisms and bodies 
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>Coordination with the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Peoples and the Expert 
Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples is an important aspect of the 
implementation of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. The respective mandates of 
those three mechanisms, which were created at different times and in response to different 
moments in the international movement to protect the rights of indigenous peoples, are 
complementary but also overlapping in certain ways. Ongoing efforts at coordination 
among the three mechanisms should be strengthened and consolidated into a permanent 
feature of their work both jointly and separately. 
</b>59. <b>Likewise, the Special Rapporteur welcomes opportunities for his cooperation  
with agencies and programmes throughout the United Nations system, as well as with 
regional and specialized institutions. This cooperation should continue in order to 
promote awareness of indigenous issues and programmatic action that is conducive to 
mainstreaming those issues and to effectively implementing standards of indigenous rights 
as affirmed in relevant international instruments. 
</b></p>
<p><b>2.  Areas of work 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>The Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work pursuant to his mandate falls within four interrelated 
and mutually reinforcing areas: promoting good practices; thematic studies; country 
reports; and cases of alleged human rights violations, with the latter category being the one </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>that has required the greatest amount of attention on an ongoing basis. The Special 
Rapporteur is grateful for the cooperation he has received from several States, indigenous 
peoples and others in all aspects of his work. He urges States that have not responded to his 
communications of alleged human rights violations to do so, and also urges States to 
respond positively to requests for country visits. 
</b></p>
<p><b>3.  The duty to consult 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>A core issue that the Special Rapporteur has repeatedly confronted is a lack of 
adequate consultation with indigenous peoples on matters that affect their lives and 
territories. A lack of adequate consultation is related to conflictive situations and profound 
expressions of discontent, mistrust and even anger on the part of indigenous peoples in 
various scenarios across the world. The Special Rapporteur perceives a need on the part of 
States and other stakeholders for orientation about the relevant normative parameters and 
measures necessary for compliance with the duty to consult with indigenous peoples, in 
accordance with international standards. In the following paragraphs, the Special 
Rapporteur summarizes his conclusions on certain aspects of the duty to consult, and adds 
recommendations. 
</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Normative framework and national laws, policies and practice 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>In accordance with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples and ILO Convention No. 169, States have a duty to consult with indigenous peoples 
through special, differentiated procedures in matters affecting them, with the objective of 
obtaining their free, prior and informed consent. Premised on an understanding of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; relative marginalization and disadvantaged conditions in regard to 
normal democratic processes, this duty derives from the overarching right of indigenous 
peoples to self-determination and from principles of popular sovereignty and government 
by consent; and it is a corollary of related human rights principles. 
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>The duty to consult applies whenever a legislative or administrative decision may 
affect indigenous peoples in ways not felt by the State&#8217;s general population, and in such 
cases the duty applies in regard to those indigenous groups that are particularly affected 
and in regard to their particular interests. The duty to consult does not only apply when 
substantive rights that are already recognized under domestic law, such as legal 
entitlements to land, are implicated in the proposed measure. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>States should develop mechanisms for determining and analysing if, and the extent to 
which, proposed legislative or administrative measures, including those for natural 
resource extraction or other development activities, affect indigenous peoples&#8217; particular 
interests, in order to determine the need for special consultation procedures well before the 
measures are taken. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The specific characteristics of the required consultation procedures will vary 
depending on the nature of the proposed measure, the scope of its impact on indigenous 
peoples, and the nature of the indigenous interests or rights at stake. Yet, in all cases in 
which the duty to consult applies, the objective of the consultation should be to obtain the </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>consent or agreement of the indigenous peoples concerned. Hence, consultations should 
occur early in the stages of the development or planning of the proposed measure, so that 
indigenous peoples may genuinely participate in and influence the decision-making. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The principle that indigenous consent should be the objective of consultation does not 
mean that obtaining consent is an absolute requirement for all situations. In all cases, what 
fundamentally matters is that a good faith effort by the State is made to achieve agreement. 
Indigenous peoples, as well, should seek in good faith to reach consensus on proposed 
measures and avoid inflexible positions when the proposed measures are based on 
legitimate public interests. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>Notwithstanding the necessarily variable character of consultation procedures in 
various contexts, States should define into law consultation procedures for particular 
categories of activities, such as natural resource extraction activities in, or affecting, 
indigenous territories. Such mechanisms that are included into laws or regulations, as well 
as ad hoc mechanisms of consultation, should themselves be developed in consultation with 
indigenous peoples. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Consulting with indigenous peoples on the very elements of the consultation 
procedure to be employed not only helps to ensure that the procedure is effective, it is 
also an important, necessary confidence-building measure. Other measures for 
confidence-building are also needed. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>In this regard, States should make every effort to allow indigenous peoples to 
organize themselves and freely determine their representatives for consultation 
proceedings, and should provide a climate of respect and support for the authority of those 
representatives. For their part, indigenous peoples should work, when needed, to clarify 
and consolidate their representative organizations and structures in order that they may 
function effectively in relation to consultation procedures. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>States should also develop adequate analyses and impact assessments of proposed 
legislative or administrative measures, and make them available to the indigenous peoples 
concerned along with all relevant information well in advance of negotiations. States should 
also endeavour to ensure that indigenous peoples have adequate technical capacity and 
financial resources in order to effectively participate in consultations, without using such 
assistance to leverage or influence indigenous positions in the consultations. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>Relevant agencies and programmes within the United Nations system, as well as 
concerned NGOs, should develop ways to provide indigenous peoples with access to the 
technical capacity and financial resources they need to effectively participate in 
consultations and related negotiations. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>Even when private companies, as a practical matter, are the ones promoting or 
carrying out activities, such as natural resource extraction, that affect indigenous peoples, 
States maintain the responsibility to carry out or ensure adequate consultations. For their 
part, as a matter of policy if not legal obligation, private companies should conform their 
behaviour at all times to relevant international norms concerning the rights of indigenous 
peoples, including those norms related to consultation. </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. <b>Private companies that operate or seek to operate on or in proximity to indigenous 
lands should adopt codes of conduct that bind them to respect indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in 
accordance with relevant international instruments, in particular the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. States should develop specific 
mechanisms to closely monitor company behaviour to ensure full respect for indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights, and to ensure that required consultations are fully and adequately 
employed. 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>States should take measures to improve the mediation capacity of Government 
agencies, in partnership with companies if applicable, to deal with potentially conflicting 
interests in relation to indigenous land and resources, and to work with all stakeholders to 
implement such mechanisms and ensure protection from discrimination and equal 
opportunities to indigenous peoples in this regard.
