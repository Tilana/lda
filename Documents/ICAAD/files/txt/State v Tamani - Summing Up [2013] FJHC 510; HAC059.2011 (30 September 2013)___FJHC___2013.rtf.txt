SUMMING UP

Ladies and Gentleman of Assessors,

1.      
        
It is now my duty to sum up this case to you. I will direct on matters of law which you must accept and act upon. On matters of facts however, which witnesses to accept as reliable, which version of the evidence to accept, these are matters for you to decide for yourselves. So if I express my opinion to you about facts of the case or if I appear to do so it is a matter for you whether you accept what I say, or form your own opinion. In other words you are the judges of facts. All matters of facts are for you to decide. It is for you to decide the credibility of the witnesses and what parts of their evidence you accept as true and what parts you reject.

2.      
 You have to decide what facts are proved and what inferences drawn from those facts. You then apply law as I explain it to you and form your individual opinion as to whether the accused is guilty or not guilty.

3.      
 Prosecution and defence made their submissions to you about the facts of this case. That is their duty. But it is a matter for you to decide which version of the facts to accept or reject.

4.      
 You will not be asked to give reasons for your opinions but merely your opinions of yourself and your opinion need not be unanimous but it would be desirable if you agree on them. Your opinions are not binding on me but I can tell you that they carry great weight with me when I deliver my judgment.

5.      
 On the question of proof, I must direct you as a matter of law that the onus of burden of proof lies on the prosecution throughout the trial and never shift. There is no obligation on the accused person to prove his innocence. Under our criminal justice system the accused person is presumed to be innocent until he is proved guilty. This is the golden rule.

6.      
 The standard of proof in a criminal trial is one of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This means you must be satisfied so that you are sure of the accused's guilt before you can express an opinion that he is guilty. If you have any reasonable doubt about his guilt then you must express an opinion that he is not guilty.

7.      
 Proof can be established only through evidence. Evidence can be from direct evidence that is the evidence that who saw the incident or felt the offence being committed. The other kind of evidence is circumstantial evidence that you put one or more circumstances together and draw certain irresistible inferences. Evidence presented in the form of a document is called Documentary evidence.

8.      
 The facts which agreed between the prosecution and the defence are called agreed facts. You may accept those facts as if they had been led from witnesses from witness box.

9.      
 The following facts are agreed between prosecution and 1st accused:

1.      
It is agreed that Isikeli Tamani is referred to as the first accused in this case.

2.      
It is agreed that Isikeli Tamani, 48 years, is unemployed and resides at Lot 20, Wainibuku, Nakasi.

8.      
It was agreed that Amena Araibulu was caution interviewed on the 7th January 2010 at Criminal Investigations Department Headquarters, Suva. 

11.     
The caution interview statements of the accused persons are in evidence. What an accused says in his caution interview is evidence only against him. I will direct you shortly on how you should consider that evidence.

12. Your decisions must be solely and exclusively upon the evidence, which you have heard in this court and upon nothing else. You must disregard anything you have heard about this case outside of this court room. 

13. Your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence and apply the law to those facts. Approach the evidence with detachment and objectivity. Do not get carried away by emotions.

14. Now let's look at the charges.

On 06/01/2010 he had gone to Carpenters Shipping in order to help a friend who told him over the phone to collect a parcel to be delivered to one Jack Wilson. As his friend helps him financially for his business and to buy his medicine he decided to collect the parcel from Carpenters Shipping.

One Tevita Halalilo had given the name of Jack Wilson but he does not know Jack Wilson personally. Witness said that the money recovered from him came before the parcel.

55. According to 2nd accused he received a call from Tamani on 06/01/2010 and both met at Kasabia, Toorak at 10.00am. While in the taxi Tamani had given a card with a serial number and told him to check from Carpenters Shipping. He had called Jonetani who works at Carpenters Shipping. Jonetani confirmed the arrival of the parcel addressed to Jack Wilson. Tamani had said that he is Jack Wilson and has all the documents for clearance. At 3.00pm when he went to Carpenters Shipping Tamani had come in a Taxi and gave original documents to clear a bicycle. Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) had been given to him by Tamani to pay custom duty and to pay Jonetani and custom officers. Jonetani took the documents and went into the office. Witness told Jonetani that Jack Wilson is a paralysed person who was seated in the taxi. This was observed by Jonetani and the customs officer. While it was being checked by custom officer inside the room a police team came and arrested him. They were taken to CID Head Quarters and opened the parcel and shown the drugs concealed inside the bicycle. Witness said that he knew Tamani for about 5 years. During this period he had cleared goods about three times and this is the fourth time. All the times he received tips. He says that he agreed to clear the consignment in good faith and without any intention. He worked for Pacific Agency as an Operational Supervisor for about 12 years.

56.     
In the cross examination witness said that he knew clearance procedure very well. ID is required to clear a parcel. His company also practice this. He only assisted Tamani to clear the parcel. He admitted that he knew Tamani is not Jack Wilson. He admits that he did not inform this to either police or custom officer as Tamani had original documents. He showed Tamani as Jack Wilson to Jonetani and the custom officer. Witness admitted that he knew Tamani's brother and advised him that is unsafe to send drugs to Fiji. Further he admitted that he advised Tamani's brother that importing drugs through shipping is safe. His mother also works for Carpenters Shipping. But he used Jonetani to sign on behalf of Jack Wilson.

56. In the re-examination witness admitted that he advised Tamani's brother about the procedure of sending drugs to Fiji.

57. That was the case for the defence.

Summary

58. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, in this case a parcel detected with illicit drugs at Carpenters FEDEX bond at Nadi Airport. It was properly delivered to Carpenter Shipping Suva under the supervision of custom and the police. The parcel was addressed to Jack Wilson of 77 Malau Place, Vatuwaqa. On 06/01/2010 1st accused and 2nd accused tried to clear the parcel from Carpenters Shipping Bond Yard at Edinburgh Drive Suva. They were arrested by CID Officers and recorded their interview under caution. The Drugs which were detected at that time were properly weighed and sealed before it is produced in this court. All the exhibits are properly marked and produced before this court. I have already explained to you each witness's evidence in detail. Consider their evidence very carefully. 

59. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, in this case prosecution tendered both accused person's caution interview statement as evidence. I have told you earlier that what one accused person says in his caution interview statement it is only evidence against him. It is not evidence against the other. 1st accused says that the police ill-treated him and fabricated his statement. But 2nd accused is not challenging his caution interview statement. You have heard the police officer who recorded the caution interview of 1st accused denied ill-treating 1st accused. According to police officer interview took place two days because of the time taken to search and to give the accused sufficient rest during the interview. What weight you choose to give the interviews made by these two accused is a matter entirely for you. If you consider them to be unrealisable either because the police ill-treated the accused, or because the accused themselves told lies to police, then you may think that you cannot put much weight on them at all. If however you consider them to be reliable records of what the accused said to the police, then you may think that they contain important statements of what allegedly occurred on 06/01/2010. 

60. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, in this case accused persons opted to give evidence from witness box. That is their right. But they have nothing to prove to you. But you must give their evidence careful consideration. 

61. In this case 1st accused is charged for Importation of Controlled Chemical contrary to Section 6(b) of the Illicit Drugs Control Act, 2004. 2nd accused is charged for Aiding and Abetting contrary to Section 21(c) of the Penal Code, Cap.17 and Section 6(b) of the Illicit Drugs Control Act, 2004. I have already explained to you about the charges and its ingredients.

62.     
Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, you have heard all the prosecution witnesses. You have observed them giving evidence in the court. You have observed their demeanour in the court. Considering my direction on the law, your life experiences and common sense, you should be able to decide which witness's evidence, or part of their evidence you consider reliable, and therefore to accept, and which witness's evidence, you consider unreliable and therefore to reject. 

63.     
Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, If I do not mention a particular witness or a particular piece of evidence that does not mean it is unimportant. You should consider and evaluate all the evidence in coming to your decision.

64.     
You must also carefully consider both accused person's position as stated above. Please remember, even if you reject the version of both accused that does not mean that the prosecution had established the case against them. You must be satisfied that the prosecution has established the case beyond reasonable doubt against both accused persons.

65. Ladies and Gentleman of assessors, remember, it is for the prosecution to prove both accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. It is not for both accused to prove their innocence. The burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove both accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and that burden stays with them throughout the trial.

66. Once again, I remind, that your duty is to find the facts based on the evidence, apply the law to those facts and come to a correct finding. Do not get carried away by emotions.

67. This is all I have to say to you. You may now retire to deliberate. The clerks will advise me when you have reached your individual decisions, and we will reconvene the court.

68. Any re-directions.

 I thank you for your patient hearing to my summing- up.
