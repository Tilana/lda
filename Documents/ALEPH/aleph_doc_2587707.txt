<P style="line-height:13pt; margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:-13pt; padding-

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>The Company is subject to delisting pursuant to Section 120 of the
Company Guide in that the Company or its management has failed to adequately 
control related party transactions. &nbsp;Specifically, Section 120 of the 
Company Guide requires listed companies to &#147;subject related party 
transactions to appropriate review and oversight by the Company&#146;s Audit 
Committee or a comparable body of the Board of Directors.&#148; &nbsp;In that 
regard, the Company failed to provide proof of board and audit committee 
approvals in connection with various related party transactions including 
transactions totaling approximately $39 million in 2009 that were previously 
identified by John Lees &amp; Associates Limited (&#147;JLA&#148;).</P>

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt"

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt"

delisting pursuant to Section 127 of the Company Guide, which grants the 
Exchange the discretion to delist a company when &#147;the issuer and/or an 
individual associated with the issuer has a history of regulatory 
misconduct.&#148; &nbsp;Staff believes that, especially in light of its 
continuing nature, the regulatory misconduct described above raises public 
interest concerns warranting delisting under Section 127 of the Company 
Guide.</P>

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>The Company is subject to delisting pursuant to Section 132(e) of 
the Company Guide in that it has failed to provide requested information to the 
Exchange within a reasonable time frame and/or has provided information to the 
Exchange that omitted material information. &nbsp;Notwithstanding reasonable 
extensions of time, the Company has only responded to two of seventeen requests 
in Staff&#146;s February 9, 2012 letter (the &#147;February 9 Request&#148;), 
has refused to provide any information with respect certain categories of 
requests in the February 9 Request, and has stated with respect to the remaining
categories of information that it &#147;is unable to specify exactly when&#148; 
it would be able to respond. &nbsp;The Company&#146;s refusal to provide the 
requested information has impaired Staff&#146;s ongoing assessment of the 
Company&#146;s continued listing eligibility. &nbsp;The Company has had more 
than a reasonable period of time to respond to the February 9 Request, and its 
failure to do so is an independent ground for delisting under Section 
132(e).</P>

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>Staff has determined that the Company is not in compliance with 
Sections 134 and 1101 of the Company Guide based on its failure to file its Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011. &nbsp;Due to the unavailability of 
reliable financial information and the uncertainty of when the Company will make
its required filing, Staff has determined that continued listing of the Company 
would be inconsistent with applicable Exchange listing standards.</P>

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>The Company is also subject to delisting pursuant to Section 
1003(d) which authorizes Staff to initiate delisting proceedings when a listed 
Company fails &#147;to comply with its listing or other agreements with the 
Exchange and/or SEC Requirements in any material respect.&#148; 
&nbsp;Specifically, the Company or its management has failed to accurately and 
adequately disclose certain related party transactions in its public filings 
including the business reasons for or the risks associated with corporate funds 
flowing through personal bank accounts of company executives to pay for expenses

<P style="margin:0pt" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>The Company also failed to comply with Staff information requests 
as described above. &nbsp;Therefore, Staff believes that the Company has failed 
to comply with its listing agreement and/or other agreements with the Exchange, 
as well as with relevant SEC requirements.</P>

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>The Company is also subject to delisting pursuant to Section 
1003(f)(iii) of the Company Guide in that the Company or its management has 
engaged in operations, which, in the opinion of the Exchange, are contrary to 
the public interest. &nbsp;In this regard, Staff believes that the actions 
(including, but not limited to, inaction) of the Company and/or its management 
and/or its agents raise significant public interest concerns. &nbsp;As outlined 
above, the JLA Report found transactions totaling approximately $39 million in 
2009, without appropriate board approval, including transfers into and through 
the personal bank accounts of Mr. Hongjun Wang, the Company&#146;s then chief 
executive officer, and Ms. Guizhi Ju, mother of Mr. Wang and a then director of 
the Company. &nbsp;Further, even after the Company&#146;s announcement of 
certain remedial actions taken in response to the JLA report, there appeared to 
have been a continued lack of internal controls, allowing activities that raise 
public interest concerns to occur.</P>
<P style="margin:0pt" align=justify><BR></P>
<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>These actions by the Company and/or its management and/or its 
agents cast material doubt on the integrity of the Company&#146;s financial 
statements. &nbsp;Further, the decision by the SEC to temporarily suspend 
trading in the Company&#146;s securities
in March 2012
casts additional doubt on whether the Company&#146;s financial performance is 
accurately portrayed by its financial statements. &nbsp;Thus, continued listing 
of the Company&#146;s securities on the Exchange would not be in the public 
interest.</P>

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; text-indent:36pt; font-size:11pt"

<P style="line-height:13pt; margin:0pt; padding-left:54pt; font-size:11pt" 
align=justify>On December 5, 2011, the Exchange notified the Company that, as a 
result of the retirement of Mr. Edward Rule as a member of the audit committee, 
it was not in compliance with Section 803(B)(2)(a) in that it only had two out 
of the requisite three members on its audit committee. &nbsp;</P>

align=justify>On April 4, 2012, the Exchange notified the Company that it is 
subject to delisting pursuant to Sections 132(e) and 1003(d) of the Company 
Guide, as the Company failed to comply with its listing agreement and/or other 
agreements with the Exchange by not providing the requested information to the 
Exchange within a reasonable time frame.&nbsp; Furthermore, in light of the 
nature and severity of the Company&#146;s continued listing deficiencies, Staff 
has determined in accordance with Section 1009(a)(ii) that it was necessary and 
appropriate for the protection of investors to truncate the continued listing 
evaluation and follow-up procedures and move to immediate delisting proceedings 
(the &#147;Staff Determination&#148;). &nbsp;The Exchange&#146;s letter dated 
April 4, 2012 also notified the Company of additional deficiencies with respect
