23 ​ Appendix ​ ​ ​
24 ​ (i) The mineral reserve estimates for Mount Milligan Mine are as of December 31, 2015 and were prepared by Robert Clifford, Thompson Creek’s Director of Mine ​ Engineering, who is a Qualified
Person under NI 43-101. The mineral reserve estimates were prepared using an ultimate open pit design optimized at spot metal prices ​ of $2.95/lb copper, $1,250/oz gold, an exchange rate of
US$1.00/C$1.10, a cut-off grade of 0.176% copper equivalent and takes into consideration metallurgical ​ recoveries, concentrate grades, transportation costs, smelter treatment charges and royalty and
streaming arrangements in determining economic viability. The mineral ​ reserve estimates are based on the cost assumptions included in the NI 43-101 technical report entitled "NI 43-101 Technical
Report-Mount Milligan Mine-Northern ​ Central British Columbia" dated January 21, 2015 and filed on SEDAR on January 21, 2015. Mill recoveries vary by rock type and region but average 85.0% copper
and ​ 71.5% gold. Anticipated losses resulting from beneficiation average approximately 4.5% copper and 2.5% gold. ​ (ii) Adjusted operating costs, all-in costs and all-in costs - including taxes as well as
sustaining capital, growth capital, average realized gold price per ounce and cost of ​ sales per ounce sold are non-GAAP measures and are discussed under “Non-GAAP Measures” in the Company’s
annual MD&A filed on SEDAR. ​ (iii) The mineral reserves at Kumtor have been estimated based on a gold price of US$1,200 per ounce, as at December 31, 2015. The open pit reserves and resources ​
at Kumtor are estimated based on a cut-off grade of 0.85 grams of gold per tonne for the Central Pit and 1.0 grams of gold per tonne for the Southwest and Sarytor ​ deposits. Open Pit resources at
Kumtor are constrained by a pit shell developed using a gold price of US$1,450 per ounce. Mineral resources are in addition to reserves. ​ Mineral resources do not have demonstrated economic viability.
Further information including key assumptions, parameters and methods used to estimate mineral ​ resources and reserves, as well as legal, political, environmental and other risks are described in
Centerra’s 2015 Annual Information Form dated March 31, 2016 filed ​ on SEDAR. ​ ​ Notes to mineral properties slides ​ Notes Regarding Mineral Properties ​ ​
