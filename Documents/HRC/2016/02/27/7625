<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 24/23, 
in which the Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR) to prepare a report, in consultation with States, United Nations agencies, funds 
and programmes, civil society and other relevant stakeholders, on preventing and 
eliminating child, early and forced marriage, with a particular focus on challenges, 
achievements, best practices and implementation gaps.  
</p>
<p>2. For the preparation of the report, OHCHR solicited inputs from Member States, 
United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, special procedures mandate-holders, 
treaty bodies, civil society organizations and other relevant stakeholders. As at 17 March 
2014, 110 replies had been received, including 31 from Member States. All the submissions 
are available on the OHCHR website.1 OHCHR also reviewed recent studies and research 
on the issue. 
</p>
<p>3. Information received for the present report reveals a wide variation in the prevalence 
of child, early and forced marriage between and within countries.2 It is a practice which 
adversely impacts on the rights of girls, boys, men and women. However, child, early and 
forced marriage has a disproportionately negative impact on women and girls. According to 
United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) estimates, in 2012, approximately 400 million 
women aged 20&#8211;49 around the world (or 41 per cent of the total population of women in 
that age group) had been married or entered into a union before they reached 18 years of 
age.3 The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) reported that the rate of marriage for 
girls before the age of 18 in developing countries (not including China) is one in three, the 
majority of whom have limited education and live in rural areas and in extreme poverty.4 
</p>
<p><b> II. Definitions  
</b></p>
<p>4. For the purpose of this report, &#8220;child marriage&#8221; is a marriage in which at least one of 
the parties is a child. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, a child is 
&#8220;every human being below the age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the 
child, majority is attained earlier&#8221;.5 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has called on 
States parties to review the age of majority if it is set below 18.  
</p><p>5. &#8220;Early marriage&#8221; is often used interchangeably with &#8220;child marriage&#8221; and refers to 
marriages involving a person aged below 18 in countries where the age of majority is 
attained earlier or upon marriage. Early marriage can also refer to marriages where both 
spouses are 18 or older but other factors make them unready to consent to marriage, such as 
their level of physical, emotional, sexual and psychosocial development, or a lack of 
information regarding the person&#8217;s life options.6

<p>6. A forced marriage is any marriage which occurs without the full and free consent of 
one or both of the parties and/or where one or both of the parties is/are unable to end or 
leave the marriage, including as a result of duress or intense social or family pressure. 
</p>
<p><b> III. International legal framework  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Right to enter into marriage with free and full consent  
</b></p>
<p>7. International human rights treaties guarantee the right of all individuals to enter into 
marriage with the free and full consent of both parties. The International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights in its article 23, paragraph 3, provides for this right, as does the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its article 10, 
paragraph 1. The Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and 
Registration for Marriages in its article 1 provides that this consent must be expressed by 
both parties in person and in the presence of a competent authority.7 Article 16 of the 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women obligates 
States to ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, inter alia, the same right freely 
to choose a spouse and to enter into marriage only with their free and full consent. The 
Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee on the 
Rights of the Child have both stressed the importance of additional legal safeguards to 
protect the right of all individuals to freely enter into marriage, even in plural legal systems 
which include both customary and statutory laws. A number of regional instruments also 
stipulate that marriage may only be entered into with the free and full consent of both 
parties.8 
</p>
<p>8. The Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and 
Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery (Supplementary Convention) obligates States 
to undertake all &#8220;practicable and necessary legislative and other measures&#8221; to bring about 
the abolition or abandonment of various institutions and practices which amount to forced 
marriage, such as promising or giving a woman in marriage, where she does not have the 
right to refuse, following payment to her parents, guardians, family or another person or 
group; the right of a husband, his family or clan to transfer his wife to another person for 
value received or for any other reason; and the inheriting by another person of a woman on 
the death of her husband.9 As discussed under Section V, forced marriage can under certain 
circumstances amount to slavery and slavery-like practices.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Child marriage  
</b></p>
<p>9. Article 16, paragraph 2, of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women provides that &#8220;the betrothal and the marriage of a child shall 
have no legal effect.&#8221; The African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child also 
prohibits both child marriage and the betrothal of girls and boys and requires that legislative 
and other measures be taken to protect their rights.10 The Committee on the Rights of the

<p>Child and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women have both 
raised concerns over the continued existence of child marriage and have recommended that 
States parties enforce the prohibition of child marriage. 
</p>
<p>10. The Committee on the Rights of the Child has also noted that a number of the 
provisions of the Convention on the Rights of the Child should be considered applicable to 
the issue of child marriage, including article 24, paragraph 3, which provides that States 
parties should &#8220;take all effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing 
traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children.&#8221;11 The Committee on the 
Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Committee against Torture have also 
identified child marriage as a harmful practice which leads to the infliction of physical, 
mental or sexual harm or suffering, with both short- and long-term consequences, and 
negatively impacts on the capacity of victims to realize the full range of their rights.12 The 
Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography has 
indicated that child marriage may be considered as sale of children for the purposes of 
sexual exploitation, in violation of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of 
the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and of article 35 
of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.13 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery has drawn links between 
child marriage and slavery, pointing out that States are obliged to prohibit and eliminate 
slavery as a non-derogable and fundamental principle of international law.14 According to 
ECPAT International, marriage of children and adolescents under the age of 18 can under 
certain circumstances be considered a form of commercial sexual exploitation when the 
child is used for sexual purposes in exchange for goods or payment in cash or in kind.15 
</p>
<p>12. Article 16 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
against Women, articles 2 and 3 of the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age 
for Marriage and Registration of Marriages and article 2 of the Supplementary Convention 
on the Abolition of Slavery obligate States parties to undertake legislative measures to 
specify a minimum age for marriage.16 The Committees on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women and on the Rights of the Child have recommended that

essential measures to be taken to protect the child from all forms of violence, article 34 on protecting 
children from all forms of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, article 35 on measures to prevent the 
abduction of, sale of or traffic in children and article 36 on protecting the child against all other forms 
of exploitation which may cause harm to the child.

<p>States parties remove exceptions related to the minimum age of marriage<b> </b>and establish a 
minimum age of marriage for girls and boys, with or without parental consent, of 18 
years.17 Similarly, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has 
recommended that States raise and equalize the minimum age for marriage for boys and 
girls.18  
</p>
<p>13. In 2012, the Committees on the Rights of the Child and on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women, together with the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Violence against Children, the Working Group on the issue of discrimination 
against women in law and practice, together with four other special procedures mandate 
holders, issued a joint statement calling on States to increase the age of marriage to 18 years 
for both girls and boys without exception, and stated that child marriage could not be 
justified on traditional, religious, cultural or economic grounds.19 
</p><p>14. The Human Rights Committee has indicated that the age for marriage should be such 
as to enable each spouse to give her/his free and full personal consent under conditions 
prescribed by law20 and that States should ensure that the minimum age complies with 
international standards and adopt active measures to prevent early marriage of girls.21 The 
Committee against Torture has recognized that child marriage may constitute cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment, particularly where governments have failed to establish a 
minimum age of marriage that complies with international standards.22 Several regional 
human rights instruments have similarly placed the obligation on States to undertake 
legislative and other measures to establish a minimum age of marriage of 18 years.23  
</p>
<p>15. The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and other 
treaty bodies require States to register births and marriages as a means to facilitate 
monitoring of the age of marriage and to support the effective implementation and 
enforcement of laws on the minimum age of marriage.24 To meet this obligation, States are

<p>urged to establish national civil registration that is free, universal and accessible for the 
birth registration of all children and to ensure that all marriages are registered by a 
competent authority.25  
</p>
<p><b> C. Right to equality and non-discrimination  
</b></p>
<p>16. As discussed below, child, early and forced marriage is now widely recognized as a 
form of gender-based discrimination which disproportionately affects women and girls. The 
rights to equality and non-discrimination are set forth in a number of international human 
rights instruments.26 The Committees on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women 
and on the Rights of the Child have both described forced and child marriage as a 
manifestation of discrimination against women and girls, a violation of their rights and an 
obstacle to the girl child&#8217;s full enjoyment of her rights. They have further highlighted that 
the practice is perpetuated by entrenched adverse customs and traditional attitudes that 
discriminate against women or place women in subordinate roles to men, or by women&#8217;s 
stereotyped roles in society.27  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Factors contributing to child, early and forced marriage  
</b></p>
<p>17. Empirical evidence shows poverty and insecurity as one of the root causes of child, 
early and forced marriage. Although the proportion of child brides has generally decreased 
over the last 30 years, child marriage remains common in rural areas and among the poorest 
communities.28 In many communities, marriage is often perceived as a way to ensure the 
economic subsistence of girls and women with no autonomous access to productive 
resources and living in situations of extreme poverty. Marrying children can also have 
economic advantages, such as lower dowries for younger brides. Families may agree to the 
temporary marriage of their daughter in exchange for financial gain, also referred to as a 
&#8220;contractual marriage&#8221;. Poverty may also encourage women to marry foreign nationals for 
financial security, a practice which increases opportunities for trafficking in women.29 
Research indicates that, in a limited number of countries, child, early and forced marriage 
also takes place in wealthy families, where it is perceived as a means of preserving wealth 
amongst families from the same socioeconomic class. 
</p>
<p>18. Child and early marriage is strongly associated with girls who have received little or 
no formal education. Plan International in Egypt notes for instance that poor-quality

eliminate discrimination against women in all matters relating to marriage and family relations. See

<p>schooling, overcrowding, unqualified teachers and gender-based violence often increase the 
viability of early marriage as an alternative option for many girls.30  
</p>
<p>19. Responses received for the present report indicate that in many contexts families are 
encouraged to marry their children young because it is the accepted cultural practice. In 
Nepal, for example, a 2013 study conducted by UNICEF found that three of the five main 
reasons given by respondents for marriage under 18 years of age were social pressure, 
culture and because &#8220;it is normal &#8211; everyone does it&#8221;.31 Plan International also notes that 
parents&#8217; decisions to marry their daughters at an early age are often motivated by 
stereotypical views of sexuality and women&#8217;s role in society.32 In these circumstances, 
marriage is viewed as a way to protect girls from the risk of sexual violence, prevent pre-
marital relations and potential dishonour to the family, avoid criticism of older unmarried 
girls as impure,33 restore family honour in cases of sexual violence or hide real or perceived 
sexual orientation.34  
</p>
<p>20. The risk of child, early and forced marriage is also exacerbated for girls in conflict 
and humanitarian crisis situations, where the increased risks of poverty from financial 
instability and sexual violence leave girls even more vulnerable to this practice.35 For 
instance, reports of the independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab 
Republic noted an increase in child, early and forced marriage, as families felt their 
daughters would be safer if married.36 
</p>
<p><b> V. Human rights impact of child, early and forced marriage 
</b></p>
<p>21. The impact of child, early and forced marriage on the realization and enjoyment of 
girls&#8217; and women&#8217;s rights can be wide ranging.37 It can imply significant age and power 
differentials between a bride and her spouse, which undermine the agency and autonomy of 
girls and young women. In this context, girls and young women often face physical, 
psychological, economic and sexual violence, and restrictions on their movement. Women 
and girls in situations of child and forced marriage may experience conditions inside a 
marriage which meet &#8220;international legal definitions of slavery and slavery-like practices&#8221; 
including servile marriage, sexual slavery, child servitude, child trafficking and forced

<p>labour, and &#8220;a potentially high proportion of child marriage cases appear to constitute the 
worst forms of child labour under the 1999 ILO Convention No. 182.&#8221;38  
</p>
<p>22. Girls and young women who challenge, or are perceived as challenging, the power 
dynamics within the family are often subjected to severe consequences, including crimes 
committed in the name of &#8220;honour&#8221; and other forms of violence. The Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children has drawn attention 
to how child marriage makes girls especially vulnerable to violence and abuse.39  
</p>
<p>23. Child, early and forced marriage is associated with a range of poor health and social 
outcomes and other negative consequences. Specifically, early and frequent pregnancies 
and forced continuation of pregnancy are all common in child marriages. They are closely 
linked to high maternal and infant morbidity and mortality rates and can have an adverse 
effect on girls&#8217; sexual and reproductive health.40 In fact, &#8220;pregnancy-related complications 
are the main cause of death for young women, with girls being twice as likely to die from 
childbirth as women in their twenties&#8221;.41 Girls and women who are subjected to child, early 
and forced marriage are often not empowered to make decisions about, or lack accurate 
information about, their sexual and reproductive health, which compromises their ability to, 
inter alia, decide on the number and spacing of their children and negotiate contraceptive 
use, and places them at heightened risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections and 
HIV.  
</p>
<p>24. Child marriage and early childbearing are also recognized as significant obstacles to 
ensuring educational, employment and other economic opportunities for girls and young 
women.42 Often, girls are discouraged from attending school when they get married or may 
be expelled from school when they become pregnant and are treated as adult women 
regardless of their age. Research by Plan International in Kenya found, for example, that 
84.2 per cent of girls who were married reported that they no longer had time to enjoy an 
education because of their new responsibilities as married girls.43 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Measures and strategies to prevent and eliminate child, early 
and forced marriage 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Legislative measures 
</b></p>
<p>25. States are increasingly taking legislative measures to address child, early and forced 
marriage. These include amendments to laws to raise the minimum age of marriage to 18

<p>for both girls and boys, prohibition of child and forced marriage, sanctions against the 
perpetrators of child, early and forced marriage and implementation of compulsory 
registration of all marriages.44 The Syrian Arab Republic, for instance, reported that a 
ministerial committee, established to study articles in all Syrian laws which discriminate 
against women and children, had proposed amendments to the legal age and prevention of 
child, early and forced marriage.45 Sweden also reported that it was in the process of 
strengthening legal protection against forced marriage and child marriage. The Committees 
on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and on the Rights of the Child have 
welcomed instances of such progress in their recent reviews of States parties&#8217; reports, 
including those of Albania (CEDAW/C/ALB/CO/3), Azerbaijan (CRC/C/AZE/CO/3-4), 
Benin CRC/C/BEN/CO/2), Egypt (CRC/C/EGY/CO/3-4), France (CRC/C/FRA/CO/4), 
Guinea-Bissau (CRC/C/GNB/CO/2-4), Kenya (CEDAW/C/KEN/CO/7), Madagascar 
(CRC/C/15/Add.218) and the Republic of Korea  (CEDAW/C/KOR/CO/7).46 
</p><p>26. Various States indicated in their responses that they have regulations on civil and 
criminal remedies and other administrative regulations for victims of child and forced 
marriage. For instance, in the United Kingdom Forced Marriage (Civil Protection) Act 2007 
provides a specific civil remedy to prevent forced marriage and to assist victims where a 
marriage has already taken place through a Forced Marriage Protection Order (FMPO). 
Such Orders can include forbidding a person to be taken overseas, or ordering that they be 
returned to the United Kingdom. An application for a protection order can be made by the 
person at risk or a third party acting on their behalf.47 Other countries are considering 
reforming their laws to provide specific remedies in cases of child, early and forced 
marriage.48  
</p>
<p>27. Many countries have also enacted laws which impose a criminal penalty for forcing 
someone to marry or for performing marriages of persons below the age of 18. For example, 
in February 2013, the Australian Parliament adopted the Slavery Act, which recognizes 
&#8220;forced marriage as a serious form of exploitation and a crime, akin to a slavery-like 
practice&#8221;.49 Under this Act, forced marriage offences carry a maximum penalty of four 
years&#8217; imprisonment, or seven years&#8217; imprisonment for an aggravated offence. An offence 
may be aggravated in several circumstances, including where the victim is under the age of 
</p><p>18. The offence of forced marriage applies to any person with a role in bringing about the 
forced marriage, including families, friends, wedding planners or marriage celebrants. 
Azerbaijan has also amended its criminal code to include forced marriage as a criminal 
offence. In the United Kingdom, a parliamentary process is under way to introduce a 
specific criminal offence of forcing someone to marry.50

 Submission from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The protection orders 
</p>
<p>have proved useful in cases where the child is in imminent danger of being removed from the 
jurisdiction for the purpose of marriage. An emergency protection order normally lasts eight days 
with a possible extension of seven days, which buys the authorities time to apply for more long-term 
protection, e.g., a care order. See also submission from Ruth Gaffney-Rhys, University of South 
Wales.

<p><b> B. Policies, action plans and coordination mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>28. Several submissions reported on efforts to strengthen national coordination among 
government bodies, civil society organizations and United Nations agencies and 
development partners and on the development of multidisciplinary action plans. Examples 
include the recently launched Alliance to End Child Marriage in Ethiopia steered by the 
Ministry of Women. The Alliance is to implement a joint strategy drafted by the 
Government in partnership with donors, civil society organizations and other development 
actors to combat female genital mutilation/cutting, child marriage and abduction.51 In Sierra 
Leone, the National Strategy for the Prevention of Teenage Pregnancy (2013-2018) 
addresses child marriage and engages multiple ministries as well as a large number of 
stakeholders to accelerate change.52 Norway has implemented four action plans on forced 
marriage, covering legislative changes, awareness-raising and crisis<b> </b> housing as well as a<b> </b> national information helpline on forced marriage.53 Various States reported that they had 
increased coordination structures at the local level, in the form of committees which include 
representatives from local government and civil society organizations.54 
</p>
<p><b> C. Engagement of religious and traditional leaders and service providers 
</b></p>
<p>29. Responses received provided examples of how effective implementation of policies 
and plans had been strengthened through partnerships with traditional and religious leaders. 
For example, Girls Empowerment Network Malawi reported a decrease in child marriages 
after it ran a campaign encouraging traditional leaders and parents to devise strategies to 
prevent child marriage. The campaign led to tribal and traditional leaders&#8217; edicts banning 
the practice, which are being replicated in other areas.55 In Indonesia, the involvement of 
religious and village leaders in media campaigns has led to a marked reduction in a practice 
called <i>merarik</i>, whereby girls are kidnapped if their parents do not agree to a marriage or 
when the bride price or the dowry is too high and which is increasingly used to kidnap girls 
for sexual slavery and trafficking.56 
</p>
<p>30. State programmes which provide support to women and girls who are already 
married highlighted the direct involvement of teachers, health workers, law enforcement 
and judicial officials and social workers, and the active participation of girls who are at risk 
of being married.57 
</p>
<p><b> D. Education and empowerment of girls and women 
</b></p>
<p>31. A common theme in the submissions received was the critical need to ensure the 
empowerment of women and girls through, inter alia, education and access to resources as 
the best preventive measures against child marriage and for the full realization of the human 
rights of women and girls.

<p>32. Initiatives mentioned include direct financial support to families and guardians to 
encourage girls to continue their education;58 efforts to increase the enrolment and retention 
rate of girls in school, such as lower cut-off re-entry points and scholarships for girls; and 
programmes that provide non-formal education and vocational training, development of 
livelihood skills and life skills education.59 Several countries also indicated that they were 
supporting girls&#8217; empowerment through programmes that target girls at risk of child 
marriage and those that are married. 
</p>
<p>33. Examples of the above-mentioned initiatives include the following: in Egypt, the 
Ishraq programme, which prepares out-of-school girls, including those forced to drop out of 
school upon marriage or motherhood, for re-entry into the formal school system;60 in 
Cameroon, the Government, working in partnership with civil society organizations, has 
signed a declaration with the Council of Imams on the importance of education for girls;61 
in Turkey, the Government has adopted legislation that extends the length of compulsory 
education from 8 to 12 years;62 in Germany, victims or potential victims of child, early and 
forced marriage are empowered through educational and vocational opportunities to enable 
them to better defend themselves against being forcibly married and to seek out help;63 and 
in Nigeria, the Government&#8217;s early marriage programmes include scholarships, conditional 
cash transfers, economic empowerment and community mobilization.64 
</p>
<p>34. Several submissions highlighted how women&#8217;s organizations have mobilized to 
strengthen awareness of child, early and forced marriage. For instance, in Canada, there is a 
coalition called Network of Agencies Against Forced Marriage with approximately 80 
members.65 UNICEF is increasingly deploying technology as a way of engaging adolescent 
girls and boys to become agents of change in their communities and nations. In Uganda, 
UNICEF U-report used text messages and mobile telephones to stimulate national debate on 
child marriage, teenage pregnancies and, especially, the issue of pregnant girls being asked 
to drop out of school.66 
</p>
<p><b> E. Awareness-raising 
</b></p>
<p>35. Several responses indicated that awareness-raising on the harms of child, early and 
forced marriage, including among men and boys, often contributes to promoting social 
norms that support efforts by girls and their families to delay the age of marriage. To 
address some of the underlying social norms and individual attitudes, some countries are 
showing signs of decreasing support for the practice amongst the wider society. For 
example, in the Indian state of Rajasthan, following televised community weddings and 
other community-level measures to raise awareness of the law criminalizing child marriage, 
a number of villages declared their collective commitment to ending the practice of child 
marriage through the signing of petitions.67

<p>36. Several States are working to raise awareness in collaboration with religious and 
civil marriage celebrants, migrant and legal resource centres, domestic violence services, 
child support agencies, families and community leaders, and women, girls and boys from 
vulnerable groups.68 Examples include the Government of Zambia, which, in partnership 
with traditional leaders and civil society organizations, has launched a national campaign to 
end child marriages. The campaign has stimulated public discussion at village gatherings 
and several chiefdoms have subsequently banned the practice. In Malaysia, the Minister of 
Women, Family and Community Development publicly spoke out about the increased trend 
towards child marriage despite the existence of legislation and pointed out the danger it 
poses to the health of young girls.69 Canada reported that civil society organizations, 
particularly immigrant women&#8217;s organizations, are providing information about forced 
marriage alongside other topics, such as girls&#8217; leadership. A number of organizations 
reported on awareness-raising and sensitization campaigns on the illegality and harmful 
effects of child, early and forced marriage in conflict situations and humanitarian crisis 
settings.70 
</p>
<p><b> F. Protection measures  
</b></p>
<p>37. Various responses highlighted the importance of ensuring appropriate safety and 
protection measures for victims of child, early and forced marriage, such as specifically 
designed temporary shelters and making special services available at shelters for victims of 
violence. Australia, through its Support for Trafficked People Program, is providing support 
services for suspected victims of forced marriage, including shelters.71  
</p>
<p>38. As mentioned above, the United Kingdom Civil Protection Act enables victims and 
third parties to obtain forced marriage protection orders and discussions are under way to 
criminalize breaches of such orders.72 Switzerland is looking into the possibility of 
introducing similar protection orders73 and Quebec, Canada, has initiated a study on whether 
to introduce civil protection orders.74 In 2006, India enacted the Prohibition of Child 
Marriage Act, which enables courts to intervene through stay orders to stop imminent child 
marriages and impose punitive sanctions. Under this Act, victims have the right to seek 
annulment of the marriage and may seek redress by claiming financial support from the 
husband/in-laws until they are remarried.75

promoting the prosecution of cases of child, early and forced marriage. Australia, for

starting a family. During the conflicts in Liberia, Uganda and Sudan, girls were abducted and given as

<p>example, highlighted the fact that, in June 2013, its Parliament passed the Vulnerable 
Witness Act, which allows vulnerable witnesses to give evidence in criminal proceedings by 
closed-circuit television, video link or video recording, limit their contact with the 
defendant or members of the public and have a support person with them while giving 
evidence.76  
</p>
<p>40. Several States are implementing training programmes for relevant public officials, 
including law enforcement and local administration officers. For instance, the Government 
of Switzerland has allocated funding for its newly established &#8220;Control Networks on forced 
marriages&#8221;. The networks offer coaching and counselling for victims of child, early and 
forced marriage and training for professionals providing access to support services.77 In 
Canada, there are plans for online training on forced marriage and &#8220;honour&#8221;-based violence 
developed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to be made available to municipal police 
and other agencies.78 In Australia, a module about forced marriage issues is now part of the 
compulsory ongoing professional development training provided to civil celebrants.79 The 
Government of Oman, in partnership with UNICEF, is preparing a training programme for 
teachers, law enforcement workers and those working in other relevant fields on protection 
of the family which will include child marriages.80 The Government of the United Kingdom 
has issued guidelines on forced marriage with the intention of improving practices among 
frontline workers, including the police and social services.81 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Challenges and implementation gaps  
</b>41. A number of challenges and implementation gaps have been highlighted in the 
submissions for the report. 
</p>
<p>42. With regard to challenges relating to the legal framework and the implementation of 
laws, 147 countries currently permit children below the age of 18 to be married, either with 
parental, spousal or caregiver consent, with court permission or in accordance with cultural 
practices or religious laws.82 Of the 147 countries, 54 allow for girls to marry at a younger 
age than boys. In the majority of cases, marriage provisions in plural legal systems are 
inconsistent with international obligations.83 For instance, in some cases, the Civil Law 
establishes the minimum age of marriage at 18 years, while customary and religious law 
enables a parent, often the father, to decide the appropriate age of marriage for a daughter.84

<p>Several countries with plural legal systems also have laws that apply different marital ages 
to different religious communities.85 In other countries, the minimum age of marriage is 
based on the age of criminal responsibility, the age of sexual consent, the onset of puberty 
or pregnancy.86  
</p>
<p>43. Another challenge is related to laws that exempt a rapist from punishment if he 
marries his victim.87 In some circumstances, it may be possible to use laws relating to rape 
or statutory rape to assist girls subjected to child marriage; however in many countries the 
law provides an exception when the perpetrator is the husband.88 
</p>
<p>44. Provisions relating to child, early and forced marriage are often contained in various, 
sometimes conflicting laws. For instance, in Egypt, such provisions concerning child, early 
and forced marriage can be found in the Children Law, the Penal Code, the Civil Status 
Law, the Law on the Combating of Human Trafficking and Decree No. 11 of 2011 on the 
criminalization of harassment.89 In Nigeria, the Child Rights Act stipulates 18 years of age 
for marriage with some much lower state exceptions, and conflicts with the relevant 
constitutional provision.90 
</p>
<p>45. Even when the legislation is in line with international standards, effective 
implementation of the law is often constrained by the continued presence of underlying 
conditions which, as noted by UNFPA, include &#8220;Gender inequality, lack of protection of 
girls&#8217; human rights, persistent traditions in favour of early marriage, poverty, humanitarian 
crises and tough economic realities.&#8221;91 Furthermore, deeply embedded cultural beliefs and 
lack of awareness amongst officials, parents and families about the reasons for legislating 
against child, early and forced marriage and the harmful consequences of the practice often 
hinder the application of the legislation.92 
</p>
<p>46. Several civil society organizations noted that criminalization of early marriage may 
deter victims, especially those from immigrant or minority communities, from coming 
forward, particularly if it may result in the criminal prosecution and imprisonment of family 
members.93 They highlighted the need to accompany legal reforms with awareness-raising 
efforts for families and communities.

<p>47. The absence of systematic free and compulsory marriage and birth registration in an 
official registry and the absence of compulsory registration of customary and religious 
marriages,94 have been identified as major stumbling blocks for the implementation of 
existing child protection legislation.95 
</p>
<p>48. Several States reported that marriages concluded under force might be voidable, 
annulled or dissolved.96 However, civil society organization submissions indicate that in 
many countries, victims of child, early and forced marriage face legal and practical barriers 
to accessing remedial action. These barriers include time limitations on petitions for 
annulment, economic constraints and the requirement that &#8220;a girl has the support of an adult 
if she is still a minor&#8221; in order for her to submit a petition.97 Furthermore, laws that provide 
only for civil remedies commonly place the onus on the girl herself to apply for annulment 
of the marriage. In the United Kingdom for instance, calls have been made to abolish or 
extend the time limit for lodging nullity petitions in order to protect the victims of forced 
marriage, as many victims are married young and &#8220;lack the confidence to challenge their 
situation&#8221; in the first years of marriage, which means that they will often be statute barred 
from petitioning for an annulment.98  
</p>
<p>49. Ensuring proper funding for organizations providing refuge for victims of child, 
early and forced marriage is also a challenge. Women&#8217;s Aid, a United Kingdom-based CSO 
which provides refuge to victims of domestic violence, including forced marriage, reported 
turning away significant numbers of women on a daily basis owing to lack of space.99  
</p>
<p>50. Concerning prevention, access to quality education for girls continues to be a major 
challenge in many countries. Although various governments have made important progress 
in improving access to education within the framework of their Millennium Development 
Goals programmes, structural and systemic barriers, such as entrenched social norms 
whereby parents frequently opt to invest in their sons&#8217; education over their daughters&#8217; and 
considerable resource constraints mean that a large number of young people, particularly 
girls, remain out of school.100 The Government of Ethiopia estimates that the number of 
schools needs to be more than doubled to cope with the demand generated by the major 
increase in primary enrolments over the past 15 years.101 Laws that prevent pregnant girls 
from attending school, such as those in Papua New Guinea and Swaziland, mean that 
married children&#8217;s access can be severely curtailed.102 The quality of education also 
continues to remain a concern.

 In the United Kingdom, for example, victims of forced marriage have the option of petitioning for an 
</p>
<p>annulment rather than a divorce in view of the lesser stigma that is attached to annulment (submission 
from Ruth Gaffney-Rhys, p. 1). In Switzerland, the Federal Council has launched a federal 
programme against forced marriage which contains preventive measures for women and girls and 
protective measures for those who have already been forcefully married. The programme will run 
from 2013 to 2017.

<p>51. The continued presence of social pressure that views child, early and forced marriage 
as a means to avoid pregnancy outside of wedlock and to maintain honour in cases of rape, 
also remains a challenge.103 A small number of submissions received reported on efforts to 
address stigma associated with sexual violence and women&#8217;s sexuality. 
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>52. <b>Despite progress made, significant challenges remain in the adoption and 
implementation of laws, polices and strategies to address the systemic and underlying 
factors which allow the marriage of children to persist and prevent women from 
marrying a spouse of their choice. Currently, legislation in 147 countries contains 
exceptions permitting the marriage of children below the age of 18 and, even where 
legislation is in line with international standards, the prohibition of child and forced 
marriage is difficult to implement owing to a number of the challenges discussed 
above, including cultural attitudes supporting the practice.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>Comprehensive and coordinated approaches are needed in order to effectively 
address child, early and forced marriage. It is recommended that national policies and 
strategies be developed and implemented with the involvement of relevant government 
departments at the national and local levels, civil society organizations, including 
women&#8217;s groups, religious and community leaders, national human rights institutions 
and other relevant stakeholders, including legislators and the judiciary.  
</b>54. <b>Policy and protection measures, action and strategies should be guided by the 
best interests of the child, be context-appropriate and in accordance with international 
human rights standards. They should be part of broader efforts to promote equality 
and eliminate discrimination against women and girls not only in access to education, 
but also, inter alia, in the areas of employment, political participation, health, access to 
inheritance, land and productive resources. Such policies and plans, as appropriate, 
should encompass the following broad areas of focus:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensuring a national legal framework in line with international human 
rights standards, including with regard to the age of majority and the legal age for 
marriage for girls and boys, the prohibition of forced marriage and birth and 
marriage registration;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Harmonizing national laws on marriage, including by amending existing 
laws to remove legal obstacles faced by girls who seek the enforcement of national 
laws on child marriage prevention or prohibition and legal remedies; removing 
unreasonable legal requirements for formally ending a child marriage; and providing 
access to remedies for those who leave a marriage; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Promoting girls&#8217; access to high-quality education, in accordance with 
relevant international standards, including tailored reintegration programmes for 
girls who are forced to drop out of school owing to marriage and/or childbirth; the 
provision of economic support and incentives to girls attending schools and to their 
families has proven to be effective in allowing girls to pursue higher education and 
delay marriage;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Promoting women&#8217;s economic empowerment and access to productive 
resources, including by addressing discriminatory norms and practices in this regard.

 Save the Children reported that, in Nepal, there were cases of suicide by girls who were separated 
</p>
<p>from their intended husbands (Save the Children submission, p. 5). </p>


<p><b>(e) Addressing the widespread cultural and social acceptance of child, early 
and forced marriage, including by raising awareness of its harm to the victims and the 
cost to society at large and by providing platforms and opportunities for discussion 
within communities and families on the benefits of delaying marriage and ensuring 
that girls receive education. The involvement of older women and of religious and 
community leaders, and the engagement of men and boys as key participants in these 
efforts is essential;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Providing age-appropriate, culturally relevant and empirically based 
comprehensive education on sexuality, sexual and reproductive health, gender 
equality and life-skills training for women and girls, and ensuring that women and 
girls are made aware of and have the capacity to claim and exercise their rights in 
relation to marriage;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Supporting the establishment of networks to facilitate the exchange of 
information between girls and young women on child, early and forced marriage 
through the innovative use of technology;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(h)  Implementing training programmes for government officials, the 
judiciary, law enforcement and other State officials, teachers, health and other service 
workers, those working with immigrants and asylum seekers, and relevant 
professionals and sectors on how to identify girls at risk or actual victims and on 
applicable legislation and prevention and care measures;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Providing adequate financial resources and support to comprehensive 
programmes to address child, early and forced marriage, including those aimed at 
married girls and those within indigenous and rural communities, in cooperation with 
United Nations agencies, regional organizations, civil society organizations and other 
relevant stakeholders;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) Improving data collection, research and dissemination of existing good 
practices and ensuring a clear analysis and assessment of the impact of existing 
policies and programmes as a means of strengthening them, ensuring their 
effectiveness and monitoring their implementation.
