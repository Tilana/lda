<p><b>Part One:  Resolutions and Decisions 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  Resolutions adopted by the Council at its sixth session 
</b></p>
<p><b>6/1.  Protection of cultural rights and property in situations of armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, </p>
<p> <i>Guided</i> by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations, 
</p>
<p> <i>Guided also</i> by the principles relating to economic, social and cultural rights enshrined in 
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social 
and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (A/CONF.157/23), 
the 2005 World Summit Outcome (General Assembly resolution 60/1 of 16 September 2005) 
and Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 that established the Human Rights Council 
all affirm that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and mutually 
reinforcing and must be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the 
same emphasis, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>that the General Assembly acknowledged in its resolution 60/251 that peace 
and security, development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system and the 
foundations for the collective security and well-being, and recognized that development, peace 
and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging</i> that human rights law and international humanitarian law are 
complementary and mutually reinforcing, 
</p>
<p> <i>Gravely concerned</i> about serious violations of international humanitarian law and human 
rights law during armed conflicts, in all parts of the world, and their detrimental impact on 
cultural rights and property, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed 
Conflict and its Protocols, and stressing the importance of their implementation to protect 
cultural property, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming </i>that the destruction of or any other form of damage to cultural property may 
impair the enjoyment of cultural rights, in particular of article 15 of the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Calls upon</i> all States to respect human rights law and strongly urges all parties to an 
armed conflict to strictly observe and respect, as applicable, the rules of international 
humanitarian law during armed conflicts, and to respect the rules on the protection of cultural 
property; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Emphasizes</i> that each party to an armed conflict is committed under international law 
to take all necessary steps to protect cultural property through safeguarding of and respect for 
such property, including cultural property situated in occupied territories; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Strongly condemns</i> any destruction of cultural property in violation of international 
humanitarian law, as applicable, during armed conflicts; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Emphasizes </i>that protection of cultural property during armed conflicts can contribute 
to the full enjoyment of the right of everyone to take part in cultural life; 
 5. <i>Urges </i>States and encourages intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations 
to take all necessary measures at the national, regional and international levels to address the 
issue of protection of cultural rights and property during armed conflicts, paying particular 
attention to the situation in occupied territories, and to provide appropriate assistance as 
requested by the concerned States; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Requests </i>the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all 
Governments, the competent United Nations bodies, the specialized agencies, regional 
intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Decides</i> to remain seized of this issue and to consider further actions to implement 
the present resolution.

</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote. See chap. III.] 
</p>
<p><b>6/2.  Mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food 
</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the 
Commission on Human Rights on the issue of the right to food, including General Assembly 
resolution 61/163 of 19 December 2006 and Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/18 
of 14 April 2005, 
</p>
<p> <i>Bearing in mind</i> paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling</i> the resolutions 5/1 &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human Rights 
Council&#8221; and 5/2 &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the 
Human Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge 
his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and their annexes, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling also </i>commitments taken by the international community to fully implement the 
Millennium Development Goals, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the problems of hunger and food insecurity have global dimensions and 
that they are likely to persist and even increase dramatically in some regions of the world unless 
urgent, determined and concerted action is taken, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the valuable work and commitment of Mr. Jean Ziegler during his tenure 
as the first mandate-holder to achieving the realization of the right to food; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the right to food for a 
period of three years: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote the full realization of the right to food and the adoption of measures at 
the national, regional and international levels for the realization of the right of everyone to 
adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger so as to be able fully 
to develop and maintain their physical and mental capacities; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To examine ways and means of overcoming existing and emerging obstacles to the 
realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To continue mainstreaming a gender perspective and taking into account an age 
dimension in the fulfilment of the mandate, considering that women and children are 
disproportionately affected by hunger, food insecurity and poverty; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To submit proposals that could help the realization of Millennium Development Goal 
No. 1 to halve by the year 2015 the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, as well as to 
realize the right to food, in particular, taking into account the role of international assistance and 
cooperation in reinforcing national actions to implement sustainable food security policies; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To present recommendations on possible steps with a view to achieving 
progressively the full realization of the right to food, including steps to promote the conditions 
for everyone to be free from hunger and as soon as possible enjoy fully the right to food, taking 
into account lessons learnt in the implementation of national plans to combat hunger; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) To work in close cooperation with all States, intergovernmental and 
non-governmental organizations, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, as 
well as with other relevant actors representing the broadest possible range of interests and 
experiences, within their respective mandates, to take fully into account the need to promote the 
effective realization of the right to food for all, including in the ongoing negotiations in different 
fields; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) To continue participating in and contributing to relevant international conferences 
and events with the aim of promoting the realization of the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Calls upon</i> all Governments to cooperate with and assist the Special Rapporteur in 
his/her task, to supply all necessary information requested by him/her and to give serious 
consideration to responding favourably to the requests of the Special Rapporteur to visit their 
countries, to enable him/her to fulfil his/her mandate effectively; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Requests</i> the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all 
necessary human and financial resources for the effective fulfilment of the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Invites</i> the Special Rapporteur ending the fulfilment of his mandate to submit to the 
Council in 2008 a comprehensive final report on his findings, conclusions and recommendations, 
after more than six years as mandate-holder on the right to food; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Reaffirms</i> that the Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the 
Right to Adequate Food in the Context of National Food Security, adopted by the General 
Council of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2004 
represent a practical tool to promote the realization of the right to food for all, contribute to the 
achievement of food security and thus provide an additional instrument in the attainment of 
internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium 
Declaration; 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to submit a report on the implementation of the 
present resolution to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session and to the Council in 2008, 
in accordance with its annual programme of work; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Invites</i> Governments, relevant United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, 
treaty bodies and civil society actors, including non-governmental organizations, as well as the 
private sector, to cooperate fully with the Special Rapporteur in the fulfilment of his/her 
mandate, inter alia through the submission of comments and suggestions on ways and means of 
realizing the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda item. 
</p>
<p><i>20th meeting 
27 September 2007 
</i></p>
<p>[Adopted without a vote. See chap. III.] 
</p>
<p><b>6/3.  Human rights and international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p><i> The</i> <i>Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/55 of 20 April 2005, and taking 
note of the report presented to the Council by the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity (A/HRC/4/8), 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> <i>also</i> the resolutions 5/1 &#8220;Institution-building of the United Nations Human 
Rights Council&#8221; and 5/2 &#8220;Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders of the 
Human Rights Council&#8221; of 18 June 2007 and stressing that the mandate-holder shall discharge 
his/her duties in accordance with these resolutions and their annexes, 
</p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> that the processes of promoting and protecting human rights should be 
conducted in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations 
and international law, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the importance, in the view to the promotion and protection of international 
solidarity, of the declarations and programmes of action of international conferences such as the 
World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in 1993, the International Conference on 
Financing for Development held in Monterrey in 2002, the United Nations Conference on 
Environment and Development held in Rio in 1992, the World Summit on Sustainable 
Development held in Johannesburg in 2002, and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction 
held in Kobe in 2005, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> <i>Taking note with appreciation </i>of the initiatives of the International Action against Hunger 
and Poverty, particularly in the field of innovative financial mechanisms, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> that at the World Conference on Human Rights States pledged to cooperate with 
each other in ensuring development and eliminating obstacles to development, and stressed that 
the international community should promote effective international cooperation for the 
realization of the right to development and the elimination of obstacles to development, 
</p>
<p> <i>Reaffirming</i> that article 4 of the Declaration on the Right to Development states that 
sustained action is required to promote more rapid development of developing countries and, as a 
complement to the efforts of developing countries, effective international cooperation is essential 
in providing these countries with appropriate means and facilities to foster their comprehensive 
development, 
</p>
<p><i> Taking into account</i> that article 2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights states that each State party to the Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually 
and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the 
maximum of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of 
the rights recognized in the Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the 
adoption of legislative measures, 
</p>
<p><i> Persuaded</i> that sustainable development can be promoted by peaceful coexistence, friendly 
relations and cooperation among States with different social, economic or political systems, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> that the widening gap between the economically developed and developing 
countries is unsustainable and that it impedes the realization of human rights in the international 
community, and makes it all the more imperative for every nation, according to its capacities, 
to make the maximum possible effort to close this gap, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing concern</i> at the fact that the immense benefits resulting from the process of 
globalization and economic interdependence have not reached all countries, communities and 
individuals, and at the increasing marginalization from their benefits of several countries, 
particularly the least developed and the African countries, 
</p>
<p> <i>Expressing its deep concern</i> at the number and scale of natural disasters, diseases and 
agricultural pests and their increasing impact in recent years, which have resulted in a massive 
loss of life and long-term negative social, economic and environmental consequences for 
vulnerable societies throughout the world, in particular in developing countries, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the crucial importance of increasing the resources allocated for official 
development assistance, and recalling the pledge of the industrialized countries to allocate 
0.7 per cent of their gross national product for official development assistance, and recognizing 
the need for new and additional resources to finance the development programmes of developing 
countries, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Determined</i> to take new steps forward in the commitment of the international community 
with a view to achieving substantial progress in human rights endeavours by an increased and 
sustained effort of international cooperation and solidarity, 
</p>
<p><i> Asserting</i> the necessity for establishing new, equitable and global links of partnership and 
intra-generational solidarity, and for promoting intergenerational solidarity for the perpetuation 
of humankind, 
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> that the attention paid to the importance of international solidarity as a vital 
component of the efforts of developing countries towards the realization of the right to 
development of their peoples and the promotion of the full enjoyment of economic, social and 
cultural rights by everyone has been insufficient, 
</p>
<p><i> Resolved</i> to strive to ensure that the present generations are fully aware of their 
responsibilities towards future generations, and that a better world is possible for the present and 
future generations, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Reaffirms</i> the recognition set forth in the declaration adopted by the Heads of State 
and Government at the Millennium Summit of the United Nations of the fundamental value of 
solidarity to international relations in the twenty-first century, in stating that global challenges 
must be managed in a way that distributes costs and burdens fairly, in accordance with basic 
principles of equity and social justice, and that those who suffer, or who benefit least, deserve 
help from those who benefit most; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses its determination</i> to contribute towards the solution of current world 
problems through increased international cooperation, to create such conditions as will ensure 
that the needs and interests of future generations are not jeopardized by the burden of the past, 
and to hand on a better world to future generations; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Urges</i> the international community to consider urgently concrete measures to 
promote and consolidate international assistance to developing countries in their endeavours for 
development and for the promotion of conditions that make possible the full realization of all 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Recognizes</i> that the so-called &#8220;third-generation rights&#8221; closely interrelated to the 
fundamental value of solidarity need further progressive development within the United Nations 
human rights machinery in order to be able to respond to the increasing challenges of 
international cooperation in this field; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests </i>all States, United Nations agencies, other relevant international 
organizations and non-governmental organizations to mainstream the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity in their activities; 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Decides</i>, taking into account the urgent need to further develop guidelines, standards, 
norms and principles with a view to promoting and protecting the right of peoples and 
individuals to international solidarity, to request the independent expert on human rights and 
international solidarity to continue discharging his mandate, subject to the review of this 
mandate that will be accomplished by the Council in the near future; </p>

resolution 61/170 of 19 December 2006, as well as of the report of the Secretary-General on this 
issue (A/HRC/6/2),

<p><i> Stressing </i>that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to international law, 
international humanitarian law, the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles 
governing peaceful relations among States, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of all 
human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights,

<p><i> Expressing its concern</i> about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures 
in the field of human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and 
cooperation, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the Final Document of the Fourteenth Conference of Heads of State or 
Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in September 2006 in Havana, in which they 
agreed to oppose and condemn these measures or laws and their continued application, persevere 
with efforts to effectively reverse them and urge other States to do likewise as called for by the 
General Assembly and other United Nations organs, and to request States applying these 
measures or laws to revoke them fully and immediately, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 to 
25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with 
international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations 
among States and impedes the full realization of all human rights, and also severely threatens the 
freedom of trade, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned</i> that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
General Assembly, the former Commission on Human Rights and United Nations conferences 
held in the 1990s and their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of international law and the 
Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated, 
implemented and enforced, inter alia through resorting to war and militarism, with all their 
negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social 
development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating 
additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under 
the jurisdiction of other States, 
<i> Reaffirming</i> that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the implementation of 
the Declaration on the Right to Development, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which 
provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Urges</i> all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive measures not 
in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the 
United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, in 
particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade 
relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments, in particular the 
right of individuals and peoples to development; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Strongly objects</i> to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in addition, 
threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member States neither to 
recognize these measures nor apply them, as well as to take effective administrative or legislative 
measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral 
coercive measures; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns</i> the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain Powers of 
such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, particularly against 
developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from exercising their right to 
decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and social systems; 
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates its call</i> upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 
the principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the declarations of the 
United Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves to 
their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures; 
</p>

which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and 
cultural development; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recalls</i> that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 
the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 
24 October 1970, and according to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States proclaimed by the Assembly in its 
resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32, no State may use or 
encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in 
order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from 
it advantages of any kind; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms</i> that essential goods such as food and medicines should not be used as tools 
for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their own 
means of subsistence and development; 
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Underlines</i> that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles to the 
implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this regard, calls upon all 
States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the extraterritorial 
application of domestic laws which run counter to the principles of free trade and hamper the 
development of developing countries, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group of Experts 
on the Right to Development in its report on its second session (E/CN.4/1998/29); 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Rejects</i> all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with extraterritorial 
application which are not in conformity with international law;

Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly urged States to

</p>
<p> 5. <i>Emphasizes</i> that such procedures as described in paragraph 4 above, at the national

within religions or beliefs, at all levels and with a broader participation including of women, to 
promote greater tolerance, respect and mutual understanding;

adverse consequences on the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief of all 
members of the religious communities concerned; 
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Further emphasizes</i> that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, restrictions 
on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if limitations are prescribed by 
law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and 
freedoms of others, and are applied in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion; 
</p>
<p> 15. <i>Recommends</i> that the United Nations and other actors, including non-governmental 
organizations and bodies and groups based on religion or belief, in their efforts to promote 
freedom of religion or belief, ensure the widest possible dissemination of the text of the 
Declaration, in as many different languages as possible, and promote its implementation; 
</p>
<p> 16. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 17. <i>Concludes</i> that there is a need for the continued contribution of the Special 
Rapporteur to the protection, promotion and universal implementation of the right to freedom of 
religion or belief; 
</p>
<p> 18. <i>Decides</i> therefore to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of 
religion or belief for a further period of three years and, in this context, invites the Special 
Rapporteur: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To promote the adoption of measures at the national, regional and international levels 
to ensure the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief; 
</p>

<p><b>PRST/6/1.  Situation of human rights in Haiti 
</b></p>
<p> At the 21st meeting, on 28 September 2007, the President of the Council made a statement 
reading as follows: 
</p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council welcomes the return to the rule of constitutional law in 
the Republic of Haiti, as evidenced by the election of the President of the Republic, the 
restoration of an elected Parliament, the appointment, endorsed by Parliament, of a 
Prime Minister, and the holding of municipal elections. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council commends the Haitian authorities on their commitment and efforts to 
improve living conditions for Haitians through measures such as greater regard for human 
rights and cooperation between the Haitian National Police and the United Nations 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) in curbing violence. 
</p>
<p>3. The Council is nonetheless aware of the many challenges that Haiti is facing. It 
encourages the international community to continue supporting the efforts of the elected 
authorities, and encourages those authorities to make use of the resources and expertise 
placed at their disposal. 
</p>
<p>4. The Council takes note of the difficulties encountered and the efforts made by the 
Haitian authorities. 
</p>
<p>5. While still concerned at the persistent criminal activity in some parts of the country, 
the Council notes with satisfaction the steps taken to counter corruption and 
drug-trafficking. It welcomes current efforts to correct irregularities in the police and 
justice systems, and encourages the Haitian authorities to continue them, bringing to 
fruition their plans for stronger inspection units within the police and justice systems, 
regulations to govern the judiciary, the establishment of a High Council of the Judiciary 
and the reopening of the Judicial Training College, an end to prolonged detention and 
improved conditions in detention, the introduction of a legal aid scheme and better staffed 
forensic science and forensic medical services. It notes with satisfaction the proposal for a 
steady improvement in relations between the Office of Citizen Protection and the 
MINUSTAH Human Rights Section. 
</p>
<p>6. The Council also welcomes the Haitian authorities&#8217; plans to pass a series of laws on 
the status of women and reforms of the civil registry and land registry systems. 
</p>
<p>7. The Council encourages the international community to step up its activities in all 
these areas and in human rights training and education for the security forces. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>8. The Council thanks the independent expert appointed by the Secretary-General to 
consider the human rights situation in Haiti for his report (A/HRC/4/3). It encourages the 
expert to continue his mission and report thereon to the Council at its eighth session. It 
encourages the Haitian authorities to continue to cooperate with the independent expert and 
put his recommendations into effect.

of $56,600 for the biennium 2008-2009 will be required for travel and daily subsistence 
allowance of four Council thematic procedures mandate holders to participate in the Social 
Forum called for in paragraphs 5 (c) and 9 under section 23, Human Rights. The total estimated 
requirements for the biennium 2008-2009 are as follows: </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic 
</p>

</p>
<p>Total  252 400 
</p>
<p> 3. Resource requirements for the two-day annual meetings of the Social Forum as 
established by the former Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights 
for the biennium included in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, 
consisting of conference-servicing requirements and daily subsistence allowance payments for 
the 10 experts of the Social Forum, are as follows: 
</p>
<p><b>Proposed programme budget for biennium 2008-2009

Section 28E, Administration, Geneva  2 800 
</p>
<p>Total   184 000 
</p>
<p> 4. The provision of $184,000 outlined in paragraph 3 above which  was included in the 
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 is proposed to offset the estimated 
requirements of $252,400 for the Social Forum, outlined in paragraph 2 above. It is estimated 
therefore that an additional amount of $68,400 will be required for the biennium 2008-2009 to 
provide for conference servicing and the travel and daily subsistence allowance of four thematic 
procedures mandate-holders, as follows: under section 2, $52,400; under section 23, $15,000; 
and under section 28E, $1,000. 
</p>
<p> 5. Although it is anticipated that an additional amount of $68,400 will be required for 
the biennium 2008-2009 under sections 2, 23 and 28E, no additional resources will be requested 
at this juncture, in light of the continuing review by the Council of its subsidiary machinery in 
response to General Assembly resolution 60/251. The consolidated statement of requirements 
arising from the continuing review by the Council and potential absorptive capacity from 
reduced requirements arising from the amended programme of work under the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be reported to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>6/14.  Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of paragraphs 1, 7, and 8 of resolution 6/14, the Human Rights 
Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to appoint, for a three-year period, a Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery, including its causes and its consequences, to replace the Working Group on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the Special Rapporteur to submit annual reports on the activities of the 
mandate to the Council together with recommendations on measures that should be taken to 
combat and eradicate contemporary forms of slavery and protect the human rights of victims of 
such practices; 
</p>
<p> (c) Requested the Secretary-General to give the Special Rapporteur all necessary human 
and financial assistance for the effective fulfilment of his/her mandate. 
</p>
<p> 2. It is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Council, a total amount 
of $85,500 per year beginning in 2008 will be required under section 23, Human rights, to 
implement the activities called for in paragraphs 1 and 7, as follows:  
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the Special Rapporteur for consultations and to attend the annual meeting 
of special procedures and to present a report to the Council, for two field missions per year and 
one trip to New York each year to present a report to the General Assembly ($48,900/per year); 
</p>
<p> (b) Travel of one staff and two interpreters to accompany the Special Rapporteur during 
field missions ($29,400 per year);  
</p>
<p> (c)  Local transportation, security, communication and other miscellaneous expenses 
during field missions ($7,200 per year). 
</p>
<p> 3. It is also estimated that adoption of the resolution gives rise to reduced requirements 
in the biennia 2006-2007 and 2008-2009 related to the discontinuation of the Working Group on 
Contemporary Forms of Slavery as reflected in (a) and (b) below:  
</p>
<p> (a) For the biennium 2006-2007, a total amount of $137,700 under the following 
sections: 
</p>
<p> United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic 
</p>
<p>and Social Council affairs and conference 
management 
</p>
<p> 107 900 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human rights  26 500 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva  3 300 
</p>
<p>Total  137 700 
</p>
<p> (b) For the biennium 2008-2009, a total amount of $301,400 which were included 
under the following budgetary sections of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 
2008-2009: 
</p>
<p> United States dollars 
Section 2, General Assembly and Economic 
</p>
<p>and Social Council affairs and conference 
management 
</p>
<p> 217 600 
</p>
<p>Section 23, Human rights  77 200 
Section 28E, Administration, Geneva  6 600 
</p>
<p>Total  301 400 </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> 4. It is anticipated that the unexpended balance arising from the discontinuation of the 
Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, in the biennium 2006-2007, will be utilized 
for the implementation of previously approved decisions of the Council for which it was 
intended to be implemented within the existing appropriation.  
</p>
<p> 5. The provision foreseen under section 23, Human rights, of the proposed programme 
budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be reprogrammed to cover the resource requirements of 
this resolution, estimated at $85,500 per year under section 23, Human rights. No additional 
appropriations will be required as a result of the adoption of this resolution. 
</p>
<p> 6. Regarding the remaining provision of $217,600 under section 2 and $6,600 under 
section 28 E in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, originally foreseen 
for the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery, it is anticipated that it will be 
reprogrammed in the light of the continuing review by the Council of its subsidiary machinery in 
response to General Assembly resolution 60/251. The consolidated statement of requirements 
arising from the continuing review by the Council and potential absorptive capacity from 
reduced requirements arising from the revised programme of work under the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be reported to the General Assembly.  
</p>
<p> 7. Since the period of the appointment of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary 
forms of slavery extends into the biennium 2010-2011, the requirements for that period will be 
considered in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011. 
</p>
<p> 8. With regard to paragraph 8, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, in which the Assembly reaffirmed 
that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with 
responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>6/15.  Forum on Minority Issues 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of paragraphs 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of resolution 6/15, the Human Rights 
Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to establish a Forum on Minority Issues to provide a platform for promoting 
dialogue and cooperation on issues pertaining to persons belonging to national or ethnic, 
religious and linguistic minorities, which shall provide thematic contributions and expertise to 
the work of the independent expert on minority issues; 
</p>
<p> (b) Decided that the Forum shall meet annually for two working days allocated to 
thematic discussions; 
</p>
<p> (c) Decided that the independent expert on minority issues shall convene the Forum and 
guide its work, including by identifying annual thematic subjects for discussion in consultation 
with the Forum, and invite her to include in her report a summary of its annual discussions and 
recommendations for future thematic subjects, for consideration by the Council; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (d) Requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to provide all the necessary 
support to facilitate the convening of the Forum and the participation of relevant stakeholders 
from every region in its meetings giving particular attention to ensuring broadest possible 
participation, including in particular representation of women; 
</p>
<p> (e) Requested the Secretary-General to provide the Forum, within existing resources of 
the United Nations, with all the services and facilities necessary to fulfil its mandate. 
</p>
<p> 2. It is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Council, total full costs 
of $134,800 per year are estimated for the biennium 2008-2009 for: 
</p>
<p> (a) Conference services to be provided to the Forum on Minority Issues for an annual 
session of two working days of meetings in the biennium 2008-2009;  
</p>
<p> (b) Travel and daily subsistence allowance of the independent expert on minority issues 
and additional participants called for in paragraphs 3, 4 and 6;  
</p>
<p> (c) Consultants&#8217; requirements.

</p>
<p>Total  134 800 
</p>
<p> 3. Adoption of the resolution will lead to discontinuation of the annual three working 
days of meeting of the Working Group on Minorities. The current provisions associated with the 
Working Group per year are as follows:  
</p>
<p> (a) $149,500 under section 2; 
</p>
<p> (b) $34,900 under section 23;  
</p>
<p> (c) $1,900 under section 28 E.  
</p>
<p> 4. The provisions referred to in paragraph 3 above, which have been included in the 
proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, are proposed to offset the estimated 
requirements for the Forum on Minority Issues, outlined in paragraph 2 above. It is estimated 
therefore that only an additional amount of $27,900 will be required for the biennium 2008-2009 
under section 23, Human rights, to provide for the travel and daily subsistence allowance of the 
Forum on Minority Issues and consultancy requirements for preparation of forum meetings. 
</p>
<p> 5. Although it is anticipated that an additional amount of $27,900 per year will be 
required for the biennium 2008-2009 under section 23, no additional resources will be requested, 
at this juncture, in light of the continuing review by the Council of its subsidiary machinery in  </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>response to General Assembly resolution 60/251. The consolidated statement of requirements 
arising from the continuing review by the Council and potential absorptive capacity from 
reduced requirements arising from the revised programme of work under the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be reported to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p> 6. With regard to paragraph 7, attention is drawn to the provisions of section VI of 
General Assembly resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990, in which the Assembly reaffirmed 
that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with 
responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters, and reaffirmed the role of the Advisory 
Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions. 
</p>
<p><b>6/16. Informal meeting to discuss the most appropriate mechanisms to continue 
the work of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of resolution 6/16, the Human Rights Council decided to request the 
Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights to convene an informal meeting in Geneva 
open to the participation of States, indigenous peoples and other stakeholders preceding the 
resumed sixth session in December 2007 of the Council to further discuss the most appropriate 
mechanisms to continue the work of the Working Group on Indigenous Populations. 
</p>
<p> 2. It is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Council, the total full 
costs of conference services to be provided to convene an informal meeting of 1.5 days in 2007 
are estimated at $38,900 in the biennium 2006-2007 as follows:

Total 38 900 
</p>
<p> 3. Provisions have not been made under sections 2 and 28E of the programme budget 
for the biennium 2006-2007 to convene the envisaged meeting. Pursuant to the resolution 
adopted, additional resources of $38,900 will be required as detailed in paragraph 2 above. It is 
anticipated that the additional requirements can be accommodated to the extent possible within 
the resources already appropriated under the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007. 
</p>
<p><b>6/18. Human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory: follow-up  
to Human Rights Council resolutions S-1/1 and S-3/1 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 of resolution 6/18, the Human Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Called for the implementation of its resolutions S-1/1 and S-3/1, including the 
dispatching of the urgent fact-finding missions; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (b) Requested the President of the Council and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to report to the Council at its fifth session on their efforts for the 
implementation of Council resolutions S-1/1 and S-3/1 and on the compliance of Israel, the 
occupying Power, with these two resolutions. 
</p>
<p> 2. It may be recalled that, at the first special session of the Council, an oral statement of 
programme budget implications was presented to it on its resolution S-1/1, which informed the 
Council that, while no provisions had been made in the 2006-2007 programme budget to 
dispatch an urgent fact-finding mission to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the related travel 
costs, estimated at $27,300 for the mission, will be absorbed within overall resources included in 
the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, under section 23, Human rights. With regard 
to Council resolution S-3/1, although, owing to time constraints, an estimate of the programme 
budget implications of the resolution was not presented to it, the Council was informed at the 
time it adopted the resolution that to the extent possible resources required to implement the 
decision to dispatch a high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun and to provide all 
administrative, technical and logistical assistance to the mission will be met from resources 
approved for the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007, under section 23, Human 
rights. Subsequent to the third special session of the Council, it was estimated that $130,500 will 
be required to implement Council resolution S-3/1. The Secretary-General in his report on the 
revised estimates resulting from resolutions and decisions adopted by the Council (A/61/530 
and Add.1) informed the General Assembly at the main part of its sixty-first session of the 
aforementioned budgetary requirements. 
</p>
<p> 3. This statement is submitted to inform the Council that the resources required to 
implement its resolutions S-1/1 and S-3/1, estimated at $27,300 and $130,500, respectively, 
remain unchanged. At this time, the Secretary-General maintains his prior position, as reported 
to the General Assembly at the main part of its sixty-first session, that to the extent possible, the 
requirements will be met from resources approved by the General Assembly under section 23, 
Human rights, of the programme budget for the biennium 2006-2007. 
</p>
<p><b>6/20.  Regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights</b> 
</p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of paragraph 2 of resolution 6/20, the Human Rights Council 
requested the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene, in 2008, a 
workshop for an exchange of views on good practices, added value and challenges for such 
regional arrangements, with the participation of representatives of the relevant regional and 
subregional arrangements from different regions, experts as well as all interested United Nations 
Member States, observers, national human rights institutions and representatives of 
non-governmental organizations. 
</p>
<p> 2. It is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution  adopted by the Council, the total full 
costs for: (a) conference services to convene a workshop in 2008; (b) travel to the workshop and 
daily subsistence allowances of 10 representatives of regional arrangements, two experts 
representing treaty bodies and special procedures and one representative of the Council; and (c) a 
consultant to assist with organization and conduct of the workshop and preparation of the report 
to the Council, will be in the amount of $135,200 for the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009 as follows: </p>

<p> 3. Provisions have not been made under sections 2, 23 and 28 E of the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 for the activities envisaged under the 
paragraph 2 of the resolution. Although it is anticipated that additional resources of $135,200 
will be required as detailed in paragraph 2 above, no additional resources will be requested, at 
this juncture, in the light of the continuing review by the Council of its subsidiary machinery 
pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251. The consolidated statement of requirements 
arising from the continuing review by the Council and potential absorptive capacity from 
reduced requirements arising from the amended programme of work under the proposed 
programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be reported to the General Assembly. 
</p>
<p><b>6/21. Elaboration of international complementary standards to the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of subparagraph (a) of resolution 6/21, the Human Rights Council 
decided to convene the inaugural session of the Ad Hoc Committee on Complementary 
Standards during the first semester of 2008, to commence its mandate. 
</p>
<p> 2. It is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Council, conference-
servicing requirements will arise. It may be recalled that, at its third session in December 2006, 
upon adoption of its decision 3/103, the Council was informed in an oral statement of the 
programme budget implications of its decision to establish an Ad Hoc Committee of the Council 
on the elaboration of complementary standards. At that time, it was estimated that requirements 
of $607,100 will arise for the biennium 2006-2007, of which $227,700 related to the Ad Hoc 
Committee and $379,400 related to an additional session of the Intergovernmental Working 
Group. Requirements of $451,800 were also expected to arise for conference services in the 
biennium 2008-2009, for the Ad Hoc Committee. No request for additional appropriations is 
anticipated in the biennium 2006-2007 since the inaugural session of the Ad Hoc Committee is 
expected to be held during the first quarter of 2008. 
</p>
<p> 3. With regard to the requirements for the biennium 2008-2009, conference-servicing 
provisions have been made in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009, 
under section 2, General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference 
management, and section 28 E, Administration, Geneva. </p>

</p>
<p><b>6/22. From rhetoric to reality:  a global call for concrete action against  
racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of paragraph 1 of resolution 6/22, the Human Rights Council 
decided to realign the work and name of the Anti-Discrimination Unit in the Office of the High 
Commissioner for Human Rights consistent with its mandate and that, henceforth, this unit shall 
be known as the Anti-Racial Discrimination Unit, and that its operational activities shall focus 
exclusively on racism, racial discrimination xenophobia and related intolerance, as defined in 
paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Durban Declaration. 
</p>
<p> 2. With regard to the terms of paragraph 1 of the resolution, the Secretariat wishes to 
draw the attention of the Council to the fact that in accordance with paragraph 1(c) of 
regulation 3.1 of article III of the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the 
Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of 
Evaluation, the planning, programming and budgeting process of the United Nations shall be 
governed, inter alia, by full respect for the authority and the prerogatives of the 
Secretary-General as the Chief Administrative Officer of the Organization;  hence the 
renaming of a unit/division within the Secretariat lies with the Secretary-General. In addition, 
it is considered that the terms of reference of the Committee for Programme and Coordination 
as defined in Economic and Social Council resolution 2008 (LX) (1976) places with that body, 
inter alia, review of the biennial programme plan of the United Nations, and its associated 
recommendations regarding work programmes proposed by the Secretariat to give effect to the 
legislative intent of the relevant policy-making organs, taking into account the need to avoid 
overlapping and duplication. Hence, it is the responsibility of the Committee for Programme and 
Coordination to review the operational activities of a programme. 
</p>
<p><b>6/23. Preparations for the Durban Review Conference 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of paragraph 1 of resolution 6/23, the Human Rights Council will 
request the Chairperson of the Preparatory Committee for the Durban Review Conference to 
present her report to the General Assembly during its sixty-second session, covering the 
activities of the Preparatory Committee and progress made in preparation for the 2009 Durban 
Review Conference. 
</p>
<p> 2. It is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Council, a total amount 
of $8,400 will be required for travel of the Chairperson of the Preparatory Committee to 
New York to present her report to the General Assembly during its sixty-second session. 
</p>
<p> 3. No provisions have been made under the programme budget for the 
biennium 2006-2007 for the above-mentioned activity. It is anticipated, however, that the 
amount of $8,400 required will be absorbed within overall resources approved in the programme 
budget for this biennium 2006-2007 under section 23, Human rights. </p>

Rights Council: 
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to initiate an open-ended intergovernmental process in order to elaborate on 
a consensual basis a set of human rights voluntary goals and to promote the realization and 
implementation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in accordance with States&#8217; 
international human rights obligations and commitments, to be launched on 10 December 2008 
during the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights;

<p> (b) Invited the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to present to the 
Council by its session in June 2008 information on the programmes and activities to 
commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</p>
<p> (c) Decided to hold thereafter open-ended intergovernmental informal consultations to 
elaborate a set of human rights voluntary goals to be presented to the Council, on a consensual 
basis, through a draft resolution to be adopted by the end of its session in September 2008. 
</p>
<p> 2. It is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution  adopted by the Council, the total full 
costs, estimated in the amount of $211,600 for the proposed programme budget for the 
biennium 2008-2009, relating to (a) conference services to be provided to the open-ended 
intergovernmental process during informal consultations; and (b) staff costs at the P4 level to 
prepare information on the programs and activities to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of

<p><b>6/36.  Expert mechanism on the rights of indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p> 1. Under the terms of paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8 of resolution 6/36, as orally amended, 
the Human Rights Council:  
</p>
<p> (a) Decided to establish a subsidiary expert mechanism to provide the Council with 
thematic expertise on the human rights of indigenous peoples in the manner and form requested 
by the Council; 
</p>
<p> (b) Decided also that this mechanism shall report annually to the Council on its work; 
</p>
<p> (c) Decided further that the expert mechanism shall consist of five independent experts, 
the selection of which shall be carried out in accordance with the procedure established in 
paragraphs 39 to 53 of the annex to Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007; 
</p>
<p> (d) Decided to invite the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples, and a member of the Permanent Forum on 
Indigenous Issues to attend and contribute to its annual meeting; 
</p>
<p> (e) Decided also that the expert mechanism shall meet once annually, three days in its 
first year and thereafter for up to five days. 
</p>
<p> 2. Provision of $15,100 per annum was made under section 23, Human rights for the 
daily subsistence allowance, of a week, for the Working Group on Indigenous Populations. The 
full cost of travel and daily subsistence allowance for five experts for three days in the first year 
and six days for each subsequent year of the expert mechanism is estimated at $33,000 in the </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>first year and $37,000 thereafter. Therefore, net additional requirements of $17,900 will arise in 
the first year and $21,900 for the next year, or $39,800 for the biennium to provide for travel and 
daily subsistence allowance of the five experts. 
</p>
<p> 3. Additional requirements are anticipated to arise in response to paragraph 5 of the 
resolution to provide for the participation of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous peoples, and a member of the Permanent Forum 
on Indigenous Issues on the above basis, in the amount of $28,000 for the biennium. 
</p>
<p> 4. With respect to conference servicing, provision was made under section 2, 
General Assembly and Economic and Social Council affairs and conference management, to 
provide conference services to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations, which has been 
maintained in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009. Since the new 
expert mechanism will replace the Working Group on Indigenous Populations, its conference 
servicing will be met by the former Working Group&#8217;s entitlements. 
</p>
<p> 5. Therefore, it is estimated that, pursuant to the resolution adopted by the Council, 
total additional cost for travel and daily subsistence allowance for five experts and two 
representatives in the amount of $67,800 per biennium will arise. 
</p>
<p> 6. Although it is anticipated that an additional amount of $67,800 will be required for 
the biennium 2008-2009 under Section 23, to meet the requirements outlined in paragraph 5 
above, no additional resources will be requested at this juncture in light of the continuing review 
by the Council of its subsidiary machinery in response to General Assembly resolution 60/251. 
The consolidated statement of requirements arising from the continuing review by the Council 
and potential absorptive capacity from reduced requirements arising from the amended 
programme of work under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2008-2009 will be 
reported to the General Assembly. The General Assembly will also be informed at that time of 
the continuing requirements beyond the biennium 2008-2009 relating to decisions taken by the 
Council.

of $61,300 per year will be required to implement the activities called for in paragraphs 18, 21 
and 22, as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Travel of the Special Rapporteur for consultations and/or to attend the annual

that the Fifth Committee was the appropriate Main Committee of the Assembly entrusted with

<p>ANNEX V 
</p>
<p><b>Note by the Secretariat entitled &#8220;Main steps to be taken regarding 
the establishment of the universal periodic review (UPR) work 
                             programme (for the first cycle)&#8221; 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  First step (before the selection process) 
</b> (a) In accordance with paragraph 12 of the institution-building text annexed to Council 
resolution 5/1, Member and Observer States may volunteer to be reviewed as a matter of priority. 
Expressions of interest should reach the Secretariat <i>before 21 September 2007</i>; 
 (b) The Secretariat will prepare five lists of countries in alphabetical order, each list 
corresponding to a regional group. The lists of regional groups will be based on groupings drawn 
up in New York in similar circumstances; 
</p>
<p> (c) In accordance with paragraph 9 of the institution-building text, Council members 
whose terms of membership ended in June 2007 or will end in June 2008 will be clearly 
identified* in each list. Those countries volunteering for review will also be identified in each list 
(see appendix I); 
</p>
<p> (d) In order to maintain a good balance between members and non-members, Council 
members whose terms of membership will end in June 2009 or later, will also be identified as 
appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Second step (selection process) 
</b> (a) On 21 September 2007, the President will draw by lot the first Member or Observer 
State, the name of which will serve to reorganize the above lists accordingly. Each list will be 
recomposed taking into account the priorities mentioned in paragraph 1 (c). Those countries 
whose terms of membership ended in June 2007 will be moved up in the list, followed by those 
whose terms of membership will end in June 2008, as well as the volunteers. Members whose 
terms of membership will end in June 2009 and those non-initial members of the Council whose 
terms of membership will end in 2010 will be placed in the list at the first possible opportunity in 
the year during which their terms of membership will end; 
</p>
<p> (b) In accordance with paragraph 14 of the institution-building text, 48 countries will be 
reviewed per year, thus corresponding to 16 countries to be reviewed per session of the Working 
Group on UPR. In this regard, and so as to ensure full respect for equitable geographic 
distribution (paragraph 11 of the institution-building text), the calendar for 2008 and following 
years will be drawn up based on the tables contained in appendix 2; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p>*
  In appendix 1 below, members of the Human Rights Council are indicated in bold, and the 
</p>
<p>date indicates the end of its term of membership. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (c) The President will then draw by lot the order in which countries selected for the first 
UPR session will be considered. Similar drawings will take place at each plenary session for the 
subsequent UPR Working Group sessions; 
</p>
<p> (d) Lastly, all States to be reviewed in 2008 will be invited to indicate before 
15 November 2007 whether they intend to request that one of the three rapporteurs be from its 
own regional group (an option provided for in paragraph 19 of the institution-building text 
annexed to resolution 5/1). </p>
