</b></p>
<p><i>Summary 
</i> The independent expert on the issue of human rights obligations related to access to 
safe drinking water and sanitation, Catarina de Albuquerque, submits the present report to 
the Human Rights Council in accordance with Council resolution 7/22. In the report, the 
independent expert focuses on the human rights obligations and responsibilities which 
apply in cases of non-State service provision of water and sanitation. She begins with an 
overview of the role that non-State service providers play in delivering water and sanitation 
throughout the world. She continues by outlining the human rights obligations of States and 
the responsibilities of non-State service providers and highlights three main areas where 
challenges can be faced in this regard: decision-making, operation of services, and 
accountability and enforcement.  
</p>
<p> In the present report, the independent expert emphasizes that the human rights 
framework does not express a preference over models of service provision, but insists that 
in all instances, the human rights to water and sanitation be guaranteed. The final section of 
the report contains conclusions and recommendations.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted by the independent expert on the issue of human 
rights obligations related to access to safe drinking water and sanitation in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolution 7/22, which tasks her with further clarifying &#8220;the content 
of human rights obligations, including non-discrimination obligations, in relation to access 
to safe drinking water and sanitation&#8221;. She focused the second year of her mandate on 
clarifying the human rights obligations and responsibilities in the context of the 
participation of non-State service providers in water and sanitation service delivery. This 
includes both formal and informal private sector participation, but also extends to a 
multitude of other non-State actors. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert decided to do so for two main reasons. First, in the 2007 
report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the scope and 
content of the relevant human rights obligations related to equitable access to safe drinking 
water and sanitation under international human rights instruments, the High Commissioner 
noted that, inter alia, &#8220;further elaboration is needed regarding the human rights response 
and requirements concerning the private provision of water and sanitation services&#8221; 
(A/HRC/6/3, para. 53). Moreover, since she took up her mandate, the independent expert 
has noted that there is, on the part of various stakeholders, a constant interest and curiosity 
in a human rights analysis of private sector participation. While the debate surrounding 
private sector participation has often been polarizing, the independent expert observes that 
concrete situations are rarely &#8220;black or white&#8221;, but instead are characterized by varying 
shades of grey. In carrying out this research, she noted that serious misconceptions exist 
about both the factual situation and the role and implications of human rights. These 
misconceptions relate, for instance, to the actual extent of private sector participation and 
the multitude of non-State actors who are involved in water and sanitation service 
provision. Therefore, she broadened the subject matter of her analysis, acknowledging that 
the formal private sector represents only a small fraction of actors involved in service 
provision. In the present report the independent expert aims to clarify these issues and to 
apply and specify the human rights obligations of States and the responsibilities of non-
State actors in the context of non-State actor involvement in service provision.  
</p>
<p>3. To approach this task, the independent expert engaged in wide consultative 
processes. At one expert consultation, jointly organized with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation 
and held in Geneva in January 2010, participants discussed the human rights obligations of 
States in the context of the involvement of non-State service providers. A second 
consultation, held in Lisbon in April 2010, focused on the responsibilities of service 
providers in terms of human rights. Both consultations brought together experts from 
different backgrounds, such as civil society, State-owned and private companies, water and 
sanitation regulators, academia and international organizations, and presented an 
opportunity to benefit from the diverse experience of people who work in the sector. The 
independent expert also convened a public consultation in Geneva on 27 January 2010, in 
which several representatives of States Members of the United Nations, civil society, the 
private sector and academia participated. Lastly, she received 65 written contributions: 24 
submissions from States, 4 from regulators, 2 from municipalities, 13 from civil society, 1 
from a national human rights institution, 12 representing private sector interests and 9 from 
individuals. The in-depth discussions and various perspectives have provided valuable 
assistance and guidance to the independent expert in preparing the present report and she is 
very grateful to all those who contributed. </p>


<p><b> II. Background on provision by non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>4. It is possible to identify three different forms of service provision:  
</p>
<p>(a) <b>Direct management. </b>The State can provide services itself, often through its 
municipalities. In that case, no actor other than the State is involved and the State is directly 
responsible and accountable for the provision of services; 
</p>
<p>(b) <b>Delegated service provision.</b> Instead of providing services itself, the State 
may choose to formally delegate service provision to non-State actors. While more 
attention is often paid to the involvement of large, transnational companies, service 
provision may also be delegated to smaller companies, non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) or community-based organizations. Services are also often operated through State-
owned companies, that is, companies that are totally or in the majority owned by the State, 
but that are legally distinct entities from the State itself. From the perspective of human 
rights, the crucial aspect is that the State has delegated the task of providing water and 
sanitation services to a third actor;  
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Informal provision.</b> Finally, in many cases, the State neither provides 
services itself, nor does it formally delegate service provision. Under these circumstances, 
informal provision often takes place, involving a variety of actors and structures that have 
evolved over time, responding to a need in areas not covered by formal provision, ranging 
from small-scale entrepreneurs to NGOs and community-based organizations. In this case, 
the State has not made an intentional decision to involve third actors. Rather, informal 
provision is de facto participation of non-State actors.  
</p>
<p>5. While the independent expert is aware of the significant differences in size, capacity 
and structure of these actors, she considers it necessary to cover the entire spectrum of non-
State service providers. In the present report, she will not address direct State provision, 
because the legal analysis is different when non-State actors are involved, as will be 
explained below. Hence, the present report addresses both formal and informal service 
provision and covers private companies and entrepreneurs, NGOs and community-based 
organizations involved in service provision, as well as State-owned companies. She will use 
the terms &#8220;non-State service providers&#8221; or &#8220;actors&#8221; to refer to these. Where her 
considerations are limited to the private sector or parts of it, she will use the terms &#8220;(formal/ 
informal) private sector&#8221;, &#8220;private sector participation&#8221; or &#8220;private actors&#8221;, while avoiding 
the term privatization for the reasons outlined below.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Delegated service provision 
</b></p>
<p>6. While the private sector has a long history of involvement in water and sanitation 
service provision, the starting point for the most recent wave of private sector participation 
can be situated in the 1980s in several developed countries, followed by many developing 
and transition countries during the 1990s.1 Private sector participation in developing 
countries should be understood in the context of donor approaches and international 
policies.2 International financial institutions, in particular, have promoted neo-liberal 
</p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Policies and Private Sector Participation in Water Supply</i>, Naren Prasad, ed. (Houndsmill, Palgrave 
Macmillan, 2008), pp. 3 and 12. 
</p>
<p> 2 Private sector participation also has to be seen in the context of international trade and investment law 
that may potentially conflict with human rights law by limiting the regulatory space of a State. It 
would, however, be beyond the scope of the present report to address these complex issues. See 
generally the report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights on human rights, trade and 
</p>
<p> </p>


<p><b> 5 
</b></p>
<p>reforms advocating for States to reduce public spending and avoid significant investments.3 
Some of the reforms leading to greater involvement of the private sector have been imposed 
through loan or aid conditionalities, debt reprogramming or loan forgiveness.4  
</p>
<p>7. Some highly visible instances of private sector participation have triggered a 
vigorous debate, criticism and high scrutiny over the formal private sector, focusing more 
on water than sanitation. On the one side, some argue that water is a public good and a 
unique resource essential for life and health and thus should remain in the public domain. 
Critics often point to instances where private sector participation is perceived to have 
failed, arguing that performance has been poor, agreed coverage targets have not been met, 
the quality of services has decreased, prices have increased substantially and that processes 
have not been transparent. Conversely, others argue that the private sector can contribute to 
the necessary investments in the sector, and thus extend coverage to currently unserved or 
underserved areas, as well as increase service quality and efficiency, contribute with 
technologies and skills and provide services at lower prices. 
</p>
<p>8. The intensity of the debate between advocates and critics, which is sometimes 
ideological and emotional, may have partially obscured the actual extent of private sector 
participation. While such participation is very common in some countries,5 on a global 
scale, other forms of service provision predominate. It has been estimated that, as of 2003, 
only 5 per cent of world&#8217;s population was being served by the formal private sector.6 
Moreover, the debate sometimes conveys the impression that the private sector is largely 
dominated by transnational corporations. This does not reflect present reality. Some 
transnational corporations have started to withdraw from developing countries,7 they are 
increasingly developing local partnerships,8 and, in a number of countries, local private 
actors are also very active.9 Moreover, delegated service provision is not limited to the 
operation of networks; service provision can also be delegated to suppliers of non-
networked services including standpipe operators, water kiosks, and operators of shared 
sanitation facilities. 
</p>
<p>9. Private sector participation is commonly used to refer to a broad spectrum of 
contractual arrangements between governments and the private sector that involve private 
companies in varying degrees in the provision of water and sanitation services. They differ 
according to the ownership of assets, the responsibility for capital investments, the 
allocation of risks, the responsibility for operations and maintenance, and the typical

investment (E/CN.4/Sub.2/2003/9); and more generally on the fragmentation of international law the

<p>contract duration.10 For instance, while the model of concessions confers the management, 
risk and responsibility for investment on the private sector, private sector participation can 
also be limited to contracting out some aspects of management or service provision. In 
many cases, the system cannot be designated as exclusively public or private but instead 
takes on a hybrid nature, also in the form of joint ventures. The oft-used term 
&#8220;privatization&#8221; obscures the fact that full-scale privatization, that is, divestiture including 
the transfer of assets, is a rare exception rather than the norm.11 To avoid imprecision and 
confusion, the independent expert will not use the term, but will rather mention private 
sector participation when referring specifically to the private sector. 
</p>
<p>10. State-owned companies also play an increasingly significant role in service 
provision, both in their home States as well as abroad.12 Such companies are fully or 
predominantly owned by the State, are often incorporated under private law and often 
operate on a commercial basis. While they are owned by the State, they are distinct legal 
entities from the State as such. Therefore, they are considered here as non-State actors to 
which service provision is delegated (often through a legislative act or a contract), and 
many of the same issues as in the context of private sector participation arise.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Informal provision 
</b></p>
<p>11. Compared to the formal private sector, many more people are served by informal 
small-scale providers. It has been estimated that up to 25 per cent of the urban population in 
Latin America and almost 50 per cent of the urban population in Africa rely on small-scale 
providers to some extent.13 Apart from unprotected sources, such as rivers, poor households 
rely on a variety of private water vendors such as water truck, standpipe and kiosk 
operators and small-scale water delivery services, which often &#8211; although not always &#8211; 
operate on an informal basis. When other sources are unsafe, people also often depend on 
bottled water in particular for drinking purposes. Even more so than in the water sector, 
small-scale local entrepreneurs are of enormous significance in the provision of sanitation 
services. Sanitation for low-income households is often provided on site and multiple actors 
are involved, with activities ranging from constructing, maintaining and emptying latrines 
and septic tanks to managing public facilities and selling related products such as cleaners 
and soap.  
</p>
<p>12. Finally, NGOs and community-based organizations are also taking on an 
increasingly important role in service provision, stepping in where the State is not involved 
in such activities. While their motivation may be different, as they often operate on a not-
for-profit basis, many of the same issues arise in that context, for instance how to apply 
consistent standards for the quality of services and how to ensure that organizations are 
accountable to the people they serve. 
</p>
<p>13. To a large extent, the debate has focused on the relative advantages and 
disadvantages of formal public or private provision, too often losing sight of this de facto

</b></p>
<p>commercialized service provision. While such services differ greatly depending on the 
circumstances, it is not uncommon for people to have no choice but to rely on services 
(often low quality) which are exorbitantly priced.14 Due to the high number of 
intermediaries involved in providing the service, high transport costs and a lack of 
regulation, water bought from informal private vendors is frequently 10 to 20 times as 
expensive as water provided by a utility.15 When looking beyond networked water supply 
and sewerage, adding in informal small-scale providers, a completely different picture of 
the characteristics of the private sector emerges. Overall, there is a need for a more nuanced 
debate, which recognizes the various forms of private sector participation, the wide range of 
non-State actors involved, the role of State-owned companies, as well as differences 
between networked provision of water and sanitation vs. on-site solutions.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Standards of assessment: the human rights to water and 
sanitation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Links between the provision of water and sanitation by non-State actors 
and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>14. In the political debate over the best mode of service delivery, human rights are often 
invoked in arguments against private sector participation. The right to water (less so the 
right to sanitation) and opposition to private sector participation are frequently linked to 
each other. Decisions taken at the national level to recognize the right to water, while 
simultaneously ruling out private sector participation of water services, contributed to this 
perception.16  
</p>
<p>15. Yet, the two issues are separate. Human rights are neutral as to economic models in 
general,17 and models of service provision more specifically. The report of the High 
Commissioner points out that &#8220;the approach of United Nations treaty bodies and special 
procedures has been to stress that the human rights framework does not dictate a particular 
form of service delivery and leaves it to States to determine the best ways to implement 
their human rights obligations&#8221; (A/HRC/6/3, para. 52). The various forms of delegating 
service provision are viable options that each State can consider.  
</p>
<p>16. Certainly, however, this does not imply that human rights are irrelevant. The 
delegation of water and sanitation service delivery does not exempt the State from its 
human rights obligations. Traditionally, human rights are concerned with the relationship 
between the State and the individual. They impose obligations on States and endow 
individuals with rights. When a third party comes in, it has to be accommodated within that 
bilateral relationship, as the State retains its obligations to realize human rights, while the 
type of actions necessary to meet these obligations changes. While the State is directly 
accountable for the provision of services in the case of direct management, the lines of 
accountability become more complex when a third actor becomes involved. When opting 
for this form of service delivery, the State must adopt specific measures which take account 
of the involvement of non-State actors to ensure that the rights to sanitation and water are 
not compromised. In its general comment No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, the

 15 Ibid., pp. 83-84. 
 16 See for instance art. 47 of the Constitution of Uruguay. 
 17 Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 3 (1990) on the nature of 
</p>
<p>States parties obligations, para. 8. </p>


<p>Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights points out that &#8220;States parties must 
prevent [third parties] from compromising equal, affordable, and physical access to 
sufficient, safe and acceptable water&#8221; (para. 24), which equally applies to sanitation.18 As 
outlined below, involving non-State actors requires, inter alia<i>,</i> clearly defining the scope of 
functions delegated to them, overseeing their activities through setting regulatory standards 
and monitoring compliance. 
</p>
<p>17. The work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises is especially 
relevant to the subject of this report as it is concerned with States&#8217; obligations and business 
responsibilities. In his 2008 report to the Human Rights Council, the Special Representative 
set out a three-part policy framework entitled &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; (A/HRC/8/5). 
It consists of the States&#8217; obligation to protect against human rights abuses by third parties, 
the responsibility of companies to respect human rights, and the need for access to effective 
remedies and grievance mechanisms to address alleged human rights violations. The 
Human Rights Council welcomed the framework by consensus in its resolution 8/7. The 
Special Representative is now in the process of further operationalizing the framework. To 
some extent, the work of the independent expert builds on the framework and is aimed at 
contributing to its operationalization by applying it specifically to the provision of water 
and sanitation services. 
</p>
<p><b> B. State obligations 
</b></p>
<p>18. The State cannot exempt itself from its human rights obligations by involving non-
State actors in service provision. Irrespective of responsibilities of the latter, the State 
remains the primary duty-bearer for the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>19. Generally speaking, the human rights obligations of States can be classified as 
obligations to respect, to protect and to fulfil. Obligations to respect require States to refrain 
from interfering with existing access. Obligations to protect take into account the role of 
third parties, requiring States to prevent such third parties from interfering with the 
enjoyment of human rights by others. Finally, obligations to fulfil call on States to adopt 
the necessary measures to enable and assist individuals to enjoy their human rights and to 
ensure direct provision as a last resort, when individuals are, for reasons beyond their 
control, unable to provide for themselves. States have to achieve the full realization of the 
rights to water and sanitation progressively. They are required to devote the maximum 
available resources and move towards it as expeditiously and effectively as possible, but do 
not have to achieve the full realization immediately. 
</p>
<p>20. States must realize their human rights obligations in a non-discriminatory manner. 
They are obliged to eliminate both de jure and de facto discrimination on grounds of race, 
colour, sex, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, 
property, birth, physical or mental disability, health status, or any other civil, political, 
social or other status including the social and economic situation.19 They are obliged to pay 
priority attention to groups and individuals particularly vulnerable to exclusion and 
discrimination. Depending on the circumstances, they may need to adopt positive measures 
to redress existing discrimination.  
</p>

</p>
<p>drinking water and sanitation (A/HRC/12/24), para. 64. 
 19 See Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, general comment No. 20 (2009) on non-
</p>
<p>discrimination in economic, social and cultural rights. </p>


<p><b> 9 
</b></p>
<p>21. When non-State actors are involved in service provision, there is a shift to a stronger 
focus on the obligation of the State to protect. At the same time, the obligation to fulfil 
retains its significance with the aim of creating an enabling environment. States have a duty 
to regulate and monitor providers that they involve in service delivery. Moreover, they may 
need to adopt supplementary measures depending on the circumstances, for instance to 
ensure the affordability of services. A comprehensive approach is needed: non-State service 
providers can be involved, but the State has the obligation to develop an overall (short, 
medium and long-term) strategy on how to fully realize the rights to water and sanitation. 
When the State does not directly provide services, its role nevertheless remains obligatory 
and critical.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Responsibilities of non-State service providers: rationale, basis and 
scope 
</b></p>
<p>22. Parallel to the obligation of the State to protect, it is undisputed that service 
providers must comply with the laws and regulations of the State in terms of a general legal 
obligation. Yet, while the activities of non-State actors can have an enormous impact on the 
realization of human rights, they are not addressed directly within the traditional human 
rights legal framework concerned with the relationship between States and individuals. This 
issue of direct human rights responsibilities of non-State providers will now be considered. 
</p>
<p>23. The basic expectation that Society has of business enterprises is that they will 
respect human rights (A/HRC/8/5, para. 9), and businesses themselves acknowledge this 
responsibility.20 This is affirmed through global voluntary commitments such as the United 
Nations Global Compact21 and various multi-stakeholder initiatives in different sectors. 
These commitments are reinforced through soft law instruments22 such as the Guidelines 
for Multinational Enterprises of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development23 and the Tripartite Declaration of Principles Concerning Multinational 
Enterprises of the International Labour Organization (para. 8).These do not create legally 
binding obligations, but &#8220;[derive their] normative force through recognition of social 
expectations by States and other key actors&#8221; (A/HRC/4/35, para. 45). The &#8220;Protect, Respect 
and Remedy&#8221; framework has confirmed these commitments, and the Human Rights 
Council, in its resolution 8/7, has specifically emphasized that business enterprises have a 
responsibility to respect human rights. While such an endorsement does not establish direct 
human rights obligations in a strictly legal sense, it shows a strong political commitment 
and highlights that this is what States expect from business enterprises in relation to human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>24. To some extent, the debate has focused on highly visible transnational corporations 
against the background of globalization and gaps in accountability. Yet, it seems just as 
relevant in the context of medium-sized national companies and small-scale service 
providers that often operate unregulated. Their activities can have a significant impact on

</p>

to human rights, although discussions about human rights have been included in its meetings.

<p>the realization or non-realization of human rights. And while their activities may not have 
the same repercussions at the global level and they do not get as much attention, they serve 
more people than the formal private sector. Furthermore, their impact is of a more direct 
nature as they are not anonymous companies, but often neighbours, friends or family 
members.  
</p>
<p>25. The activities of State-owned companies can influence the enjoyment of human 
rights to an even larger extent.24 At a very minimum, State-owned companies have the same 
responsibilities as other businesses. Depending on the degree of control the State exercises 
over such companies, the State may be held responsible for their actions. When State-
owned companies act as arms of Government or implementing agents of Government 
policy, the State must ensure policy coherence and guarantee that the activities of those 
companies contribute to the realization of human rights.  
</p>
<p>26. To be able to respect human rights, non-State actors need to know the actual and 
potential impact of their activities on the realization of human rights. According to the 
framework of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, such actors are 
required to exercise due diligence &#8220;to become aware of, prevent and address adverse human 
rights impacts&#8221;.25 Due diligence is understood as &#8220;a comprehensive, proactive attempt to 
uncover human rights risks, actual and potential, over the entire life cycle of a [&#8230;] business 
activity, with the aim of avoiding and mitigating those risks&#8221;.26 That responsibility is not a 
mere passive one, but requires active steps to put into place the necessary policies, 
mechanisms to identify actual and potential harm to human rights, and grievance 
mechanisms.27 
</p>
<p>27. In exercising due diligence, non-State service providers have to take into account a 
variety of factors. They must consider the country and local context where their activities 
are carried out &#8211; such as the institutional capacities of the Government &#8211; aiming to identify 
the specific human rights challenges. A second set of factors turns to the actual and 
potential impact of their activities. Finally, a third set relates to whether they might 
contribute to human rights abuses through their relationships with other actors (A/HRC/8/5, 
para. 57). Thus, the responsibility to respect not only requires service providers to ensure 
that their own action does not result in human rights abuses, but also includes the avoidance 
of complicity, which means that they must avoid being indirectly involved in human rights 
abuses committed by other actors, including the State (para. 73). The concept of due 
diligence requires contextualization and is sufficiently flexible to determine what is 
required from non-State providers operating in different contexts. The necessary actions 
required in the exercise of due diligence will depend on the scale, nature and sectoral and 
operational specificities of the actor in question.  
</p>
<p>28. Compared to other business activities, the provision of water and sanitation services 
is characterized by special features: the services relate directly to the fulfilment of human 
rights. While non-State actors are well positioned to positively contribute to the realization 
of the rights to sanitation and water through service provision, the activities of service 
providers, whether through their direct actions or through failure to live up to the mandate 
delegated to them, can also potentially result in abuses of the rights to water and sanitation.

<p>In this regard, their activities are intrinsically linked to the realization of human rights, and 
therefore they need to observe particular requirements in exercising due diligence. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Main challenges from a human rights perspective 
</b></p>
<p>29. From a human rights perspective, it is imperative to determine whether service 
delivery contributes to or undermines the realization of human rights. Therefore, the 
provision of services must be assessed against the standard of the human rights to sanitation 
and water. While all aspects of these rights, that is, availability, safety, acceptability, 
accessibility, affordability, participation, non-discrimination and accountability,28 have to 
be met, some will become more relevant than others in the following discussion.  
</p>
<p>30. The challenges in the water and sanitation sector are huge. Many of these challenges 
are faced by all service providers, State and non-State, and thus this analysis may be 
relevant in a broader context. However, the present section retains a specific focus on 
situations where non-State service providers are involved, clarifying the obligations of 
States and the responsibilities of non-State actors in this context, since the human rights 
analysis changes when non-State actors become involved. By identifying the challenges in 
the context of water and sanitation service provision, it is hoped that concrete and practical 
guidance may be offered to States and service providers alike. Against the standard of the 
human rights to water and sanitation, a number of such challenges can be identified, 
including: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Guaranteeing transparent and democratic decision-making 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Addressing power asymmetries in the bidding and negotiation process 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Reaching the poorest and most marginalized 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring affordable services 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Avoiding disconnections in cases of inability to pay 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring the quality of services 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring regulatory capacity and enforcement 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Ensuring monitoring and follow-up capacity  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Establishing effective complaint mechanisms 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Addressing corruption 
</p>
<p>31. These challenges can be encountered at various stages of engagement with non-State 
service providers. Human rights have to be protected before and throughout the process, 
requiring a constant assessment, both by States and service providers, of whether the 
measures taken contribute to the realization of human rights. In the present section, both 
State obligations and the responsibilities of non-State actors will be addressed in relation to 
the challenges encountered. Starting with the decision to delegate service provision, the 
independent expert highlights questions regarding participatory and transparent processes, 
instruments for delegation and human rights impact assessments. She specifically addresses 
provision of services to previously unserved and underserved areas. In the operation of 
services, it is observed that regulation is essential, but often not sufficient to meet the 
standards of the human rights to water and sanitation and must be complemented by social 
</p>

<p>policies. That section also raises issues regarding institutional capacity and the regulation of 
informal small-scale providers. Finally, the last section turns to questions of accountability 
and enforcement. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Decision-making  
</b></p>
<p>32. The human rights framework sets certain standards with regard to, inter alia, 
transparency and participation. These requirements apply starting with the process of 
decision-making on the nature and modalities of service provision, the bidding process and 
entering into contracts in the case of private sector participation, and a continuous 
assessment of the actual and potential impact on human rights.  
</p>
<p>33. In the case of informal service provision, there has not been an intentional decision 
to involve non-State service providers, but rather these structures have evolved over time 
responding to a need in areas not connected to the utility network. In this regard, the issues 
for States to consider is whether and how to integrate this type of provision into the formal 
system and how to exercise oversight over a sector largely operating on its own terms, 
questions that will mainly be addressed in section B below. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Democratic, participatory and transparent processes 
</b></p>
<p>34. The decision whether to delegate service provision must take place in the context of 
a sound overall strategy that lays out how the State aims to achieve universal access to 
sanitation and water. Both the strategy and the decision on delegation have to be adopted in 
a democratic, participatory and transparent process. In the view of the independent expert, 
the participation of all concerned must be active, free and meaningful.29 To enable genuine 
participation, this requires disclosure of adequate and sufficient information and actual 
access to information, referring in particular to the instruments that delegate service 
provision. In the case of State-owned companies, management will usually be delegated via 
legislation, decrees or contracts, while the authorities will often enter into contracts with 
private providers. The creation of a wider enabling environment<b> </b>for meaningful 
participation must be ensured, as well as specific opportunities<b> </b>for participation and 
reinforcement of the capacities of individuals and civil society to enable them to participate, 
monitor, evaluate and report on possible human rights abuses. 
</p>
<p>35. Democratic decision-making implies that Governments must not be pushed into the 
decision to delegate service provision by donor conditionalities. Such conditionalities may 
limit independent decision-making in developing countries and thus undermine democracy 
and the capacity of local authorities to address and solve local problems. States must not 
limit their regulatory and policy space and must safeguard the ability to protect human 
rights (A/HRC/14/27, paras. 20-25). The decision for, or against, delegating service 
provision to non-State actors should always be taken in the light of the local circumstances. 
In that regard, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights considers that the 
&#8220;international financial institutions [...] should take into account the right to water in their 
lending policies, credit agreements, structural adjustment programmes and other 
development projects [&#8230;], so that the enjoyment of the right to water is promoted&#8221;,30 
which, in the opinion of the independent expert, also applies to the right to sanitation.

</p>
<p>para. 3). 
 30 General comment No. 15, para. 60. </p>


<p><b> 13 
</b></p>
<p>36. When deciding to delegate service provision, and once that fundamental decision 
has been taken, the subsequent process of tendering, bidding and contract negotiation also 
must be transparent. The terms of reference and the final contract should be made available 
for public scrutiny and commenting. Commercial confidentiality must not jeopardize the 
transparency requirements provided for under the human rights framework. Both the tender 
and the bids must be based on accurate information, taking into account all existing relevant 
facts. This precludes strategic underbidding. Some have asserted that companies have 
purposely quoted bids less than the actual amount required to implement the contract, with 
the intention of renegotiating the contract for a higher price once the bid has been won.31 
Renegotiations are not generally a problem from a human rights perspective: changes in 
circumstances and data availability may require that the contract be adapted or amended 
and renegotiations may also be necessary to adapt contracts to human rights requirements. 
However, when renegotiations are the result of strategic underbidding and companies 
secure more favourable terms in the ensuing bilateral negotiations, such as increases in 
tariffs as well as delays and decreases in investment obligations,32 this is contrary to the 
exercise of due diligence. 
</p>
<p>37. The negotiation of contracts is extremely complex, including the need to clearly 
define responsibilities, allocate risks, set delivery and coverage targets and establish 
penalties for non-compliance. Negotiation skills are therefore essential. In particular, local 
governments are usually far less experienced than transnational corporations in negotiating 
contracts and addressing the issues at stake.33 Any imbalance aggravates the task of 
ensuring that the contract includes the necessary human rights safeguards. Therefore, 
strengthening the negotiation capacity of (local) governments and reducing power 
asymmetries is essential. 
</p>
<p>38. Any instrument delegating service provision, including contracts, must meet human 
rights standards. While ensuring this is the primary obligation of the State, non-State 
service providers are expected to exercise due diligence in this regard. To become aware of, 
and address, any potential impact on the realization of human rights, service providers have 
a responsibility to analyse the proposed instrument from a human rights perspective, in 
order to detect any human rights-related risks and aim to avoid them. As outlined above, 
exercising due diligence explicitly extends to the relationship with others, including when 
service providers enter into a contract with the State. While they cannot unilaterally change 
the terms, they are expected to avoid complicity in human rights abuses, namely by not 
entering into a contract which seems likely to result in human rights violations. Non-State 
service providers should proactively engage with the State to identify and address human 
rights concerns, and in this manner support the efforts of the State to realize human rights. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Providing services to previously unserved and underserved areas  
</b></p>
<p>39. Particular challenges occur with regard to the provision of services to previously 
unserved and underserved areas. In these cases, the operator is faced with not only the 
recurrent costs of operation and maintenance, but also the need for substantial investments. 
The private sector has often been criticized for selectively serving attractive areas within 
regions, countries, cities and neighbourhoods, where a high rate of return can be expected. 
However, the geographic coverage of services provided by non-State actors is the result of 
a political decision and a contract proposed by the public authorities &#8211; non-State service 
</p>

</p>
<p>D.C., World Bank, 2004), p. 37. 
 32 Ibid., p. 18. 
 33 Marin, <i>Public-Private Partnerships</i> (see footnote 7 above), p. 131. </p>


<p>providers will not extend services to unserved or underserved areas unless explicitly 
mandated to do so in their contracts. 
</p>
<p>40. It is therefore the Government that has the power and obligation to resist the 
temptation of investing in and prioritizing only neighbourhoods where interventions are less 
expensive and complex. The State has the ultimate obligation to realize the rights to 
sanitation and water for all, including the poorest in society. It must not discriminate 
against people living in certain areas, but rather must pay specific attention to the most 
marginalized. To that end, it must develop a comprehensive and coherent approach that 
may or may not involve non-State actors in the provision of services to currently unserved 
and underserved areas. When involving private actors, the Government must carefully 
consider where it contracts for private sector participation, what coverage is to be achieved 
in the designated areas and what service levels have to be met, and negotiate the contract 
accordingly. Like any other instrument delegating service provision, the contract should 
include clear goals, such the targets to be reached, investment levels and pricing 
arrangements. The State also has to consider what additional measures are necessary in 
terms of subsidies and other instruments, which will be further discussed below.  
</p>
<p>41. The lack of security of tenure, in particular in informal settlements, is one of the 
critical underlying issues in this context. Utility networks often do not extend to informal 
settlements, while currently more than one billion people live in unauthorized urban and 
peri-urban areas.34 Service providers often do not extend services to these areas due to the 
lack of legal tenure. At the same time, people themselves do not have a strong incentive for 
investing in ensuring access to water and sanitation in their homes when they face the 
constant threat of forced eviction. Appropriate measures by the State to facilitate provision 
will depend on the local context and might include steps to formalize the legal status of 
settlements, guarantees that people will not be forcibly evicted, the provision of financial 
assurances, and, in some circumstances, resettlement to an alternative area as long as 
human rights standards are respected.35 Where the issue of the lack of security of tenure has 
not yet been resolved, States should at least take measures to ensure that the informal 
service provision that often prevails in such areas meets minimum human rights standards, 
as further outlined below, or that innovative solutions to providing formal services are 
implemented. 
</p>
<p>42. In cases where services are provided to previously unserved or underserved areas, 
the role of the water and sanitation service providers in contributing to the progressive 
realization of human rights becomes particularly obvious. Given that intrinsic link to the 
fulfilment of human rights, exercising due diligence to become aware of and address 
potential negative impacts is particularly important. That responsibility extends to detecting 
(de facto) discrimination, for instance where the scope of delegation excludes certain areas 
such as slums. What can reasonably be expected from non-State service providers depends 
on the context and the scale of operation. For instance, when becoming aware that certain 
targeted areas within or next to its area of operation are excluded from its contract, service 
providers should inquire about the broader Government strategy to determine whether these 
areas are provided with services by other operators. They should raise concerns about 
limited coverage with the State and engage proactively in order to avoid and address 
policies that would amount to discrimination.

</b></p>
<p><b> 3. Human rights impact assessment 
</b></p>
<p>43. A human rights impact assessment can serve as a tool for ensuring compliance with 
human rights. It can be described as a &#8220;systematic process to investigate and measure the 
impact of policies, programmes, projects, and interventions on human rights&#8221;.36 The 
decision to delegate service provision should be preceded by an ex ante assessment that 
carefully considers the potential impact on the realization of human rights, including the 
rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>44. States are encouraged to build human rights impact assessments into the process of 
deciding on the means of service provision and monitoring such provision, as well as to 
adopt legislation that imposes on service providers the obligation to carry out a human 
rights impact assessment. Service providers have a responsibility to undertake these 
assessments as part of exercising due diligence to become aware of the actual and potential 
impact of their action on the human rights to water and sanitation. On that basis, the State 
and service providers can work together to integrate human rights into water and sanitation 
policies, thereby ensuring compliance with human rights law, preventing human rights 
violations and maximizing positive effects.  
</p>
<p>45. Depending on the scale and expected impact of the decision and the size and 
capacity of the actor carrying out the assessment, the human rights impact assessment does 
not necessarily have to be very formal in nature. To facilitate the process, it could also be 
integrated with social or environmental impact assessments. While there is no agreed 
template for conducting a human rights impact assessment,37 some principal elements can 
be identified that should be taken into account:38 
</p>
<p>(a) Any assessment should be explicitly based on human rights, including the 
rights to water and sanitation; 
</p>
<p>(b) The human rights impact on the most excluded and marginalized should 
specifically be addressed; 
</p>
<p>(c) The process of carrying out the assessment itself should be in line with 
human rights principles, including active, free and meaningful participation, non-
discrimination, gender equality, transparency and accountability; 
</p>
<p>(d) The process should strive to contribute to strengthening the capacities of relevant 
stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>(e) The assessment should seek to involve national, regional and international 
human rights mechanisms as their respective mandates and capacities allow.

<p><b> B. Operation of services  
</b></p>
<p>46. When non-State actors are involved in service provision, the obligation remains with 
the State to ensure that the involvement does not result in violations of the rights to 
sanitation and water; adequate regulation is thus required. Regulation is often understood to 
refer &#8220;to the promulgation of an authoritative set of rules, accompanied by some 
mechanism, typically a public agency, for monitoring and promoting compliance with these 
rules&#8221;39 that are aimed at the protection of consumers, investors and the environment. 
Accordingly, regulatory activities pertain to environmental regulation, consumer protection 
(including in case of disconnections), the regulation of water quality, economic regulation, 
and general monitoring of the sector.40 In order to be effective, regulation requires, inter 
alia, &#8220;independent monitoring, genuine public participation and imposition of penalties for 
non-compliance.&#8221;41 In this section, the independent expert will introduce the relevant 
human rights standards, consider the responsibilities of non-State actors in the operation of 
services, highlight the need for institutional and regulatory capacity, pay particular attention 
to the regulation of informal small-scale providers, and stress the significance of 
complementary social policies. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Setting standards 
</b></p>
<p>47. One of the key roles of regulation is to set and monitor performance standards. The 
regulatory framework has to set specific standards for providers to comply with in line with 
the human rights to water and sanitation and the obligation to progressively realize these 
rights in particular with regard to: 
</p>
<p>(a)<b> Sufficient quantity.</b> Water must be available in a quantity sufficient to 
satisfy all personal and domestic needs; 
</p>
<p>(b) <b>Water quality.</b> It must not pose a threat to human health. The World Health 
Organization Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality serve as an important reference in this 
regard; 
</p>
<p>(c) <b>Regularity of supply.</b> Water supply must be sufficiently reliable to allow for 
the collection of amounts sufficient to realize all personal and domestic needs over the day; 
</p>
<p>(d)<b> Safety of sanitation facilities.</b> Human, animal and insect contact with human 
excreta must be effectively prevented. Regular maintenance, cleaning and &#8211; depending on 
the technology &#8211; emptying is necessary to that extent. Sludge and sewerage must be 
properly disposed of to avoid negative impacts on water quality and human health; 
</p>
<p>(e) <b>Acceptability.</b> Sanitation facilities, in particular, must be culturally 
acceptable. This will, for instance, often require privacy as well as separate male and 
female facilities when these are shared; 
</p>
<p>(f) <b>Accessibility of services.</b> Services must be available within or in the 
immediate vicinity of each household as well as schools, workplaces, health-care settings 
and public places. Access must be ensured in a sustainable manner; 
</p>
<p>(g) <b>Affordability of services.</b> Regulation also has to set standards regarding 
pricing. Water and sanitation services do not have to be provided for free and tariffs are 
necessary to ensure the sustainability of service provision. To meet human rights standards, 
the essential criterion is that tariffs and connection costs are designed in a way, including

<p><b> 17 
</b></p>
<p>through social policies, that makes them affordable to all people, including those living in 
extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>48. Linked to the question of affordability of services is the issue of disconnections. 
When water disconnections take place despite people&#8217;s inability to pay, individuals must 
still have at least access to minimum essential levels of water.42  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Complying with human rights standards in the operation of services  
</b></p>
<p>49. While it is the obligation of the State to put into place the necessary regulations, 
providers also have responsibilities in the operation of services. As outlined above, they 
must exercise due diligence to become aware of, prevent and address adverse impacts on 
human rights. To meet this responsibility, service providers should take certain measures, 
such as ensuring that the water they provide is of safe quality, ensuring the regularity of 
supply, not discriminating in their operations, adopting fair procedures in cases of 
disconnections due to non-payment and refraining from disconnections when people are 
unable to pay and the disconnection would leave them without access to minimum essential 
levels of water.  
</p>
<p>50. However, the overall policy framework governing these issues is within the purview 
of the State. Often, these decisions apply to a broader context than the area of operation of 
the provider in question. And most importantly, service providers lack the legitimacy to 
take such decisions. Yet, service providers should consider the human rights implications of 
different policy decisions, in particular, they should be aware of adverse implications of 
their activities. They can be expected to engage with the State authorities to ensure they are 
not indirectly contributing to human rights abuses. For instance, while non-State service 
providers do not determine tariff structures unilaterally, they can be involved and make 
suggestions on how to ensure that services are affordable, also to the poorest. Moreover, 
they can and should offer flexible payment schemes adapted to the needs of people living in 
poverty, such as phased connection charges, payment in instalments and grace periods. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Institutional and regulatory capacity 
</b></p>
<p>51. Effective regulation depends on the capacity to carry out regulatory functions. 
Regulation must be independent and shielded from political interference and capture by 
specific groups or politicians. A transparent and comprehensive regulatory framework helps 
to reduce the potential for abuse. Regulatory and institutional models may differ: some 
countries have independent regulatory agencies at the national level, while others largely 
regulate private sector participation by contract. There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but 
regulation has to be approached in a flexible manner and be adapted to local circumstances, 
needs and challenges such as the degree of decentralization. The essential point is that 
institutions must be in a position to carry out regulatory functions independently. 
</p>
<p>52. Even the best contracts and regulatory frameworks will not serve any purpose if they 
are not monitored and enforced. Monitoring compliance with the established standards is 
therefore essential. Benchmarking &#8211; against the best performing company, a model 
company, across different regions, or comparable cities &#8211; might be a suitable instrument to 
assess whether standards are met.43 It is critical that Governments have the commitment and 
the capacity for enforcement. The regulator must be endowed with the power to enforce 
existing regulations and the contractual agreements. Mechanisms for contract enforcement 
</p>
<p>  
 42 See for example section 61(1A) of the Water Industry Act of the United Kingdom of Great Britain 
</p>
<p>and Northern Ireland, which prohibits disconnections of water supply due to non-payment of charges. 
 43 OECD<i>,</i> <i>Private Sector Participation</i> (see footnote 8 above), p. 51. </p>


<p>must include adequate incentives, serious penalties for non-compliance, such as fines, and 
the possibility of revocation of the contract.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Particular challenges of informal small-scale providers 
</b></p>
<p>53. Compared to the regulation of utilities, far less attention has been paid to the 
regulation of informal small-scale providers. Operating unregulated, they often provide 
poor quality services at exorbitant prices. Yet, many people would be far worse off without 
their services. Any attempt to regulate the activities of such providers first requires an 
overview of the sector and the political will to acknowledge their activities. Human rights 
law does not prescribe the choice of policy and approach to small-scale providers, which is 
rather left to the State. It can decide to aim for regulation, or to use incentives for the 
provision of quality services at affordable prices, or to phase out small-scale providers in 
the long term and replace them by formal provision. The best policy option will depend on 
the circumstances and cannot be determined in the abstract. Any measures taken must 
comply with human rights obligations. There has to be a clear strategy with the end goal of 
providing universal access to services in line with human rights standards. At the same 
time, States must ensure that the measures taken - for instance strict licensing requirements 
- do not worsen the situation and leave people without access to services. In particular when 
granting exclusivity to formal providers extending into areas that have previously been 
served by small-scale providers, States have to ensure that the network actually constitutes 
an affordable alternative for poor people and that they are not lacking service provision 
until the formal provider is ready to fill the gap. 
</p>
<p>54. Given the decentralized and often on-site nature of small-scale services provision, 
distinct regulatory instruments are needed. For instance, many on-site sanitation solutions 
require the emptying of septic tanks. To ensure that sludge is actually brought to treatment 
plants and not dumped into the environment, payment for the service could be made only 
upon arrival at the plants. It is unlikely that a central agency can adequately oversee the 
activities by small-scale providers, but rather a different institutional set-up may be 
required, for instance involving local governments.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Significance of social policies 
</b></p>
<p>55. There is an inherent tension between commercial viability and direct full cost 
recovery on the one hand and providing affordable services to the poor on the other hand. 
When utilities are not adequately and sustainably resourced, they cannot ensure operation 
and maintenance, let alone invest in the network. Yet, direct full cost recovery would render 
services unaffordable for many people. Regulatory oversight alone may not be sufficient to 
achieve the rights to sanitation and water for all, and special safeguards and supplementary 
social policies to ensure inclusiveness, such as safety nets and subsidies, may be 
necessary.44 These may take various forms, whether providing support to people&#8217;s income 
or adjusting tariffs to render services affordable. Moreover, while people will often be able 
to pay recurring charges for services, a high one-off payment for the initial connection is 
often beyond their capacity. Connection subsidies and public spending will often be 
necessary to expand the network to low-income areas. Whatever measures are taken, they 
must not disproportionately benefit the upper and middle classes already connected to the 
network, but, crucially, have to be targeted to reach the unserved and underserved most in 
need. Affordability studies carried out by the regulatory body or other States authorities can 
be an important tool for taking decisions on how to target measures.

<p><b> C. Accountability and enforcement  
</b></p>
<p>56. The capacity to regulate effectively does not only depend on the institution itself, but 
is embedded in the broader context. Regulation will be undermined in a situation where 
corruption is rampant or when there is no functioning independent judiciary to enforce the 
regulatory framework and decisions taken by the regulator. Accountability and access to 
effective remedies are essential for closing the circle, as service providers and the State can 
be held accountable for deteriorating services, unmet performance standards, unjustified 
tariff increases, inadequate social policies or other breaches.  
</p>
<p>57. To ensure accountability, roles and responsibilities have to be clearly designated and 
made transparent. Also, the coordination between different entities involved &#8211; public and 
private &#8211; has to be ensured. Water and sanitation users must be able to identify who is 
responsible in order to hold the relevant actor to account. Corruption presents an additional 
challenge to building responsive and accountable institutions. Fighting it requires, above 
all, strong political will. Transparency, in particular, will help to reduce the risk of 
corruption, for instance, by ensuring that bidding is competitive and contracts are made 
public. Where a State-owned company is formed to deliver water and sanitation services, 
the legislative process for the establishment of the company should be the product of a 
participatory and transparent process. In all cases, clearly defined performance targets and 
disclosure of information help to reduce the risk of corruption. 
</p>
<p>58. Accountability can be achieved through judicial, quasi-judicial, administrative, 
political and social mechanisms at the national and international levels. Mechanisms can be 
based at the level of the service provider or of the State. As stated by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and transnational 
corporations and other business enterprises, irrespective of the obligation of the State to 
establish accountability mechanisms and ensure access to these, service providers have a 
responsibility to put into place means that allow individuals to bring alleged human rights 
abuses to their attention (A/HRC/8/5, para. 82). Such mechanisms should be easily 
accessible to consumers, but also to people within the area of operation who are not 
considered clients, for instance due to the non-payment of bills. This is part of exercising 
human rights due diligence, since accountability mechanisms enable the service provider to 
become aware of its (alleged) human rights impacts. Establishing grievance mechanisms 
can be seen as a necessary feedback loop complementing the general monitoring of human 
rights compliance. When abuses have been identified, non-State actors bear a responsibility 
to remedy those. Evidently, the set-up of these mechanisms will vary depending on the size 
of the business and other factors. For instance, while a large company might have an entire 
department dealing with complaints, small providers might be in touch directly with those 
who rely on their services. According to the Special Representative of the Secretary-
General, to be effective and credible, a non-judicial grievance mechanism should be 
legitimate, accessible, predictable, equitable, compatible with rights and transparent 
(para. 92). 
</p>
<p>59. In any case, non-State service providers must not obstruct access to State-based 
accountability mechanisms, including court proceedings. Such mechanisms are essential, 
since an appropriate solution might not be found between the individual who has allegedly 
been harmed and the service provider. Grievance mechanisms provided by service 
providers are an important first step, but they may not settle the issue conclusively. In 
contentious cases, settlement via an independent institution such as the judiciary is 
required. 
</p>
<p>60. Therefore, it must be possible to address complaints to State institutions. Such 
mechanisms must be available to all people, not only for &#8220;clients&#8221; who pay for services 
provision. For instance, concerned individuals must have the opportunity to bring up </p>


<p>potential discrimination in the targeting of subsidies. States have to provide &#8220;accessible, 
affordable, timely and effective&#8221;45 remedies. Victims of violations are entitled to adequate 
reparation, including restitution, compensation, satisfaction and/or guarantees of non-
repetition. While administrative remedies will be adequate in many cases, a right of judicial 
appeal as a last resort is often appropriate and sometimes indispensable.46

<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>61.<b> The independent expert considers that a more nuanced approach is needed in 
the debate on the participation of non-State actors in water and services provision, 
namely, one that overcomes the simplistic public vs. private debate and acknowledges 
the existence of a wide variety of actors and arrangements for the delivery of water 
and sanitation services. These are rarely exclusively public or private, and they also 
involve both the formal and informal sectors. 
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> In the present report, the independent expert has focused on the role of non-
State service providers. Recognizing that service provision is an essential component 
of the realization of the rights to water and sanitation, she intends to continue working 
on this issue. For instance, she considers that instruments for the delegation of service 
provision such as contracts and mandates of State-owned companies would benefit 
from a human rights analysis. In that context, she notes with interest the work the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the issue of human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises is undertaking in the area 
of responsible contracting. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The human rights framework does not call for any particular form of service 
provision. It is well established that, from a human rights perspective, States can opt 
to involve non-State actors in sanitation and water services provision. But the State 
cannot exempt itself from its human rights obligations and hence remains the primary 
duty-bearer. Therefore, also when involving other actors in services provision, the role 
of the State is crucial. The obligations of States and the responsibilities of non-State 
actors are complementary. The latter can and should support the State in the 
realization of human rights. In line with these conclusions, the independent expert 
offers the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) States must develop a national plan, including legislation and other 
appropriate measures, to progressively achieve the full realization of the rights to 
water and sanitation, including in currently unserved and underserved areas, 
independent of the modalities of the service provision chosen. These measures should 
be based on the explicit recognition of the rights to water and sanitation; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) States must not discriminate (de jure or de facto) against any groups or 
individuals in the provision of services, but rather adopt targeted measures to reach 
the most marginalized; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Regardless of its modalities, the decision of the State to delegate or not 
delegate service provision must be taken in a democratic and participatory process. 
All those concerned must be enabled to participate throughout the process and to 
monitor, evaluate and report on possible human rights abuses. Participation has to be

making; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) International financial institutions and donors should support national 
and local decision-making processes aimed at finding contextualized solutions in 
compliance with human rights law; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) The process of decision-making and implementation, any instruments 
that delegate service provision including contracts, and instruments that outline roles 
and responsibilities must be transparent, which requires the disclosure of adequate 
and sufficient information and actual access to information;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) All instruments for delegation, including contracts, must be in line with 
human rights standards, contribute to the realization of the rights to water and 
sanitation and guide the activities of non-State service providers; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Non-State service providers should exercise due diligence to ensure they 
comply with human rights standards throughout the process, from the bidding over 
entering into agreements with the State to the operation of services. They are 
encouraged to proactively engage with the State to detect potential human rights 
abuses and find solutions to address these; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) States should carry out human rights impact assessments before and 
throughout the process, building these into the process of deciding on the means of 
service provision as well as a monitoring provision to determine the actual and 
potential impact on the realization of human rights, including the rights to water and 
sanitation. They are encouraged to adopt legislation that imposes obligations on 
service providers to also carry out human rights impact assessments. Service 
providers should undertake such assessments as part of exercising due diligence to 
become aware of the actual and potential impact of their activities on the realization 
of the human rights to water and sanitation;

<p><b>(i) States must adopt strong regulatory frameworks for all service providers

regulations. International development cooperation and assistance should aim to 
enhance the regulatory capacity of States as needed;
