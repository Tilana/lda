<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p> <i>Noting</i> with deep concern continued evidence of intolerance and discrimination 
against individuals on the basis of race, religion and belief, including Government-endorsed 
discrimination, violence, exclusion and bias,  
</p>
<p> <i>Recognizing</i> the importance of demonstrating to members of racial and religious 
minority populations affected by discrimination and acts of intolerance a shared 
commitment to addressing this problem through concrete and immediate actions, 
</p>
<p> <i>Calling upon</i> all States to consider, as a matter of priority, ratifying the International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p> <i>Calling also upon</i> all States to commit to strengthening and enhancing their efforts 
to address discrimination and hate crimes,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the role the Ad Hoc Committee on the elaboration of 
complementary standards has played in helping to identify specific proposals for concrete 
steps to combat racial and religious discrimination, intolerance and hatred;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Decides</i> to request the Ad Hoc Committee, as an immediate positive step 
forward and without prejudice to its mandate, to focus on determining which of those 
proposals enjoy the consensus necessary for their successful implementation, with a view to 
their adoption by the Council at its sixteenth session.
