Mr. P Rigamoto [LAC] for the Accused 

JUDGMENT

1. Following trial on this matter lasting 2 days, the Assessors returned with an unanimous verdict of not guilty on both counts, charged in the Information, against the accused. 

2. I have reviewed the evidence called in the trial, and I have directed myself in accordance with the summing up, I gave to the assessors. 

I find that the verdict of the assessors was not perverse. It was open to them to reach such a conclusion on the evidence. I accept their verdict. 

3. I therefore find the accused not guilty as charged on both counts. I acquit him accordingly.
