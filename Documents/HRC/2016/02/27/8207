<p><i>Summary  
</i></p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions analyses steps taken by the United States of America in implementing the 
recommendations made by the previous mandate holder, following his visit to the country 
from 16 to 30 June 2008. Despite there being much to commend about the United States of 
America&#8223;s record on extrajudicial killings, three areas where significant improvement 
remains necessary were identified in the mission report (A/HRC/11/2/Add.5). These areas 
concern due process in the imposition of the death penalty; transparency in law 
enforcement, military and intelligence operations; and accountability for potentially 
unlawful deaths in the Government&#8223;s international operations. 
</p>
<p> The Government deserves credit for having taken concrete measures to better track 
and respond to deaths in immigration detention. However, no major progress has been 
made on the three priority areas identified in the mission report. The Special Rapporteur 
urges the Government to implement the recommendations concerning these areas as a 
matter of priority.

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>1. In its resolution 17/5, the Human Rights Council urged States to cooperate with and 
assist the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, in the 
performance of his task, to supply all necessary information requested by him and to ensure 
appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions formulated by him, 
including providing information on the actions taken on those recommendations. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the previous mandate holder on the importance 
of follow-up reports as critical components of country visits to investigate allegations of 
violations of the right to life.  
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with established practice,1 the present follow-up report concerns the 
recommendations made by the previous mandate holder, following his visit to the United 
States of America (AHRC/11/2/Add.5) in 2008. The Special Rapporteur requested 
information from the Government and other actors about the steps taken to implement the  
recommendations in the mission report and about the non-implementation of 
recommendations. In addition, information was sought on the current situation concerning 
extrajudicial executions in the country, particularly on whether and how the situation has 
improved, deteriorated or remained the same.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the United States of America for 
having provided information on measures taken to implement the recommendations 
contained in the mission report. He deems cooperation with governments important to the 
understanding and assessment of progress. The Special Rapporteur also wishes to thank to 
all stakeholders who contributed to the preparation of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>5. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur analyses the steps taken by the United 
States of America in implementing the recommendations made by the previous mandate 
holder, following his visit to the country from 16 to 30 June 2008. The mission report 
(A/HRC/11/2/Add.5) was presented to the Human Rights Council at its 11th session in June 
</p><p>2009. Despite there being much to commend about the United States&#8223; record in relation to 
extrajudicial killings, several areas requiring significant improvement were identified in the 
mission report. Since the country visit, improvements have been made in certain areas. On 
the domestic level, while significant progress has been made in better tracking and 
responding to deaths in immigration detention, some problem areas have either been 
addressed insufficiently or not at all. These relate mainly to due process in the imposition of 
the death penalty, the situation of Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees, accountability failures for 
unlawful deaths due to the Government&#8223;s international operations and lack of transparency 
</p>
<p>regarding the legal framework and targeting choices for targeted killings.<b>

<p>                                                          
 1 In 2006, the previous mandate holder initiated follow-up reports on country visits to assess the extent 
</p>
<p>to which States implement recommendations.  </p>

</p>
<p><b> III. Domestic issues 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Due process in death penalty cases 
</b></p>
<p>6. The mission report highlighted several deficiencies that increase the risk of innocent 
individuals being executed erroneously in the United States, and which raise concerns about 
the fairness of judicial proceedings and racial discrimination.2 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Imposition of the death penalty 
</b></p>
<p>7. According to available figures, some 3,251 people are currently on death row in the 
United States.3 It is widely acknowledged that innocent individuals have very likely been 
sentenced to death and executed in the United States. 4  The 2008 country visit focused 
largely on the death penalty in Alabama and Texas, both of which have extremely high rates 
of executions.5 The Special Rapporteur concluded that, in both states, there was a &#8220;shocking 
lack of urgency with regard to the need to reform glaring criminal justice flaws.&#8221; 6 
Information received for the present report does not indicate that reform proposals are under 
way.  
</p>
<p>8. Nevertheless, some positive steps should be underscored with respect to other states. 
People continue to be exonerated,7 and figures available suggest a continuous decline in 
death sentences over the past decade. 8  Evidence of growing frustration with the death 
penalty can be gleaned from opinion polls, the fact that fewer death sentences are being 
handed down by juries, and legislative activity has increased with a higher number of bills 
calling for an end to the death penalty in several states.9 Senate Bill 3539, adopted on 9 
March 2011, abolished the death penalty in Illinois, bringing the number of states which 
have abolished the death penalty to 16 out of 5010, thus taking a step in the direction of a

<p>worldwide effort to abolish the death penalty. Furthermore, the sentences of 16 individuals 
on death row were commuted to life imprisonment without parole.11 
</p>
<p>9. Notwithstanding these developments, the problems identified in the mission report 
persist. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judicial independence 
</b></p>
<p>10. Judicial independence requires justice to be rendered fairly and without improper 
influence or pressure. However, it is reported that in many instances the death penalty 
continues to be imposed arbitrarily.12 Despite a public appeal to the Government and the 
state of Georgia to stop the execution of Troy Davis, the Special Rapporteur deplores that 
his execution was carried out, although serious concerns had been raised about procedural 
irregularities in his case.13 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur had recommended that the system of partisan elections for 
judges be reformed, as it politicized the death penalty and unfairly increased the likelihood 
of a capital sentence.14 No information has been received to indicate that the authorities have 
taken steps to undertake relevant reforms. 
</p>
<p>12. Given the heightened politicization of the death penalty in Alabama, due to the 
ability of judges to &#8220;override&#8221; the jury&#8223;s opinion in sentencing, the Special Rapporteur 
recommended that Alabama repeal the law permitting judicial override, which enables 
judges to impose the death penalty, even if a jury has unanimously decided to sentence a 
defendant to life imprisonment. No information has been received on the intention to 
abrogate it. A recent study indicates that since 1976, Alabama judges have overridden 107 
jury verdicts, 92 per cent of which commuted life imprisonment to the death sentence.15 In 
Alabama, 21 per cent of prisoners currently on death row have been sentenced to death 
through judicial override. The study highlights that a significant increase in death sentences 
is noted in election years, when trial and appellate court judges up for election often base 
their campaign on their support for the death penalty. The Special Rapporteur contends that 
the power to decide on the life and death of an individual should not be conferred to a single 
judge who may be sensitive to political pressure, as it could result in arbitrariness in 
decisions. Therefore, he reiterates the recommendation that Alabama abrogate the law on 
judicial override. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Right to counsel 
</b></p>
<p>13. Given the irreversibility of sentences, cases involving criminal offences punishable 
by the death penalty require stringent respect of the accused&#8223;s right to a fair trial, including 
the right to appropriate legal representation. During the country visit in 2008, a broad range 
of stakeholders, including Government officials in Texas and Alabama, acknowledged that 
existing programmes providing criminal defence counsel to indigent defendants were 
inadequate.16

</p>
<p>14. The Government has acknowledged the need to improve its system of providing 
legal representation to indigent criminal defendants. Civil society groups consulted during 
the preparation of the report also pointed to these deficiencies.17 The Supreme Court ruling 
in <i>Harbison v. Bell </i>that held that federal law allows indigent death row inmates the right to 
federally appointed counsel to represent them in post-conviction state clemency procedures 
is to be commended.18 However, this right to representation is even more critical at the end 
of the process where there is minimal chance of success. In many states, inmates sentenced 
to death are still not entitled to lawyers for the critical stage of the state habeas procedure, 
when all claims must be raised or they will be defaulted in the Federal habeas procedure 
under the Antiterrorism and Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA). 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur further notes the establishment in March 2010 of the Access 
to Justice Initiative,19 an office within the Justice Department charged with finding ways to 
improve the provision of legal services in the justice system. Like the previous mandate 
holder, the Special Rapporteur strongly recommends the establishment of adequately 
funded, state-wide public defender services, in both Alabama and Texas, which would 
significantly reduce the risk of poor legal representation for defendants in capital cases. It is 
important that oversight of such services be independent of the executive and judicial 
branches.  
</p>
<p>16. It was further recommended that regulations enabling the Department of Justice 
(DoJ) to certify the adequacy of state indigent defence systems based on factors at the 
state&#8223;s discretion be amended or repealed. The Government indicated that all retentionist 
states had adopted their own procedures on providing counsel to represent indigent capital 
defendants in state court. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Racial disparities 
</b></p>
<p>17. The mission report outlined studies from across the country showing racial 
disparities in the imposition of the death penalty.20 Reports released since then corroborate 
the persistence of this problem.21 The Government has expressly acknowledged that racial 
and ethnic disparities exist in the criminal justice system. This new approach by the 
Government constitutes a significant departure from federal officials&#8223; vehement denial of 
such problems during the 2008 country visit,22 and is to be commended. The Government 
also supported  the recommendation of the universal periodic review to undertake studies to 
determine the factors of racial disparity in the application of the death penalty and to prepare 
effective strategies aimed at ending possible discriminatory practices.23 The materialization 
of the DoJ&#8223;s stated intentions to conduct further statistical analysis and studies on sentencing 
disparities is highly anticipated.

</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur notes the Government&#8223;s intention to revise the 2003 
Guidance Regarding the Use of Race by Federal Law Enforcement Agencies, which 
prohibits racial profiling in federal law enforcement activities. Bearing in mind that its 
review was initiated in 2009, 24  he encourages the Government to finalize the revised 
document in consultation with the civil society. For such an instrument to have practical 
relevance, it should be enforceable and law enforcement officials should be held 
accountable for any violations.25 Likewise, it should be binding on all law enforcement 
officers, including intelligence agencies.  
</p>
<p>19. Federal and state governments should systematically review and respond to concerns 
about persistent racial disparities in the criminal justice system, in general, and more 
specifically, in the imposition of the death penalty. The Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to effectively address these issues by supporting the recommendation made by 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to adopt all necessary measures, 
including a moratorium, to ensure that the death penalty is not imposed as a result of racial 
bias.26 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Systematic evaluation of the criminal justice system 
</b></p>
<p>20. The mission report placed the onus on states to systematically review their criminal 
justice system to ensure that the death penalty is not imposed unjustly. The previous 
mandate holder welcomed the establishment of the Criminal Justice Integrity Unit within the 
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals,27 but highlighted the need for an Innocence Commission 
in Texas. Recently, this proposal failed on the final reading. 28  Information concerning 
Alabama does not mention any measures taken to evaluate and respond to the findings and 
recommendations of the American Bar Association&#8223;s report on the implementation of the 
death penalty,29 as recommended in the mission report.30  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Federal habeas corpus review 
</b></p>
<p>21.  No steps have been taken concerning the implementation of the recommendation 
that Congress enact legislation permitting federal courts to review the merits on all issues in 
post-conviction death penalty cases. Thus, the Special Rapporteur is still concerned about 
the AEDPA as it prevents federal habeas review of many issues, imposes a six-month 
statute of limitation for inmates seeking to file federal habeas claims, and restricts access to 
evidentiary hearings at the federal level.31 
</p>
<p>22. Sufficient information was not provided to enable assessment of the usefulness of a 
comprehensive methodology enacted by Congress to ensure that capital defendants have a 
post-conviction right to DNA testing.

<p><b> 7. Most serious crimes  
</b></p>
<p>23. The mission report recommended that states ensure that capital punishment is 
imposed only for the most serious crimes, requiring an intent to kill with a resultant loss of 
life. However, in certain jurisdictions, lesser criminal offences are punishable by the death 
sentence. 32 
</p>
<p>24. The Government also indicated that certain serious non-homicide crimes, such as 
espionage, treason and those relating to terrorism, may result in capital punishment. The 
Special Rapporteur reiterates the above-mentioned recommendation. Moreover, concern has 
been raised that individuals with severe mental illness have been sentenced to death.33 The 
Special Rapporteur calls on federal and state governments to ensure that the death penalty is 
not imposed on the mentally ill.  
</p>
<p><b> 8. Consular notification 
</b></p>
<p>25. Although the Government expressed its commitment to comply with article 36 of 
the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR),34 failure to notify foreign citizens of 
their right to consular assistance at the appropriate time persists.35 The execution in Texas of 
Humberto Leal Garc&#237;a, a Mexican national, has again brought to the fore the Government&#8223;s 
failure to comply with its obligations under the VCCR. In the <i>Avena and Other Mexican 
Nationals</i> judgment, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) concluded that the United States 
had breached its obligations under such provisions.36 The United States was requested to 
review and reconsider the conviction and sentence of the Mexican nationals, including Mr. 
Leal Garc&#237;a. In 2009, the ICJ specified that the Government&#8223;s obligation not to execute Mr. 
Garcia pending a review of his case, and the reconsideration afforded to him was fully intact 
and accepted by the Government.37 However, despite the request made by the Solicitor 
General, the Supreme Court denied a stay of execution. Furthermore, the Governor of Texas 
did not satisfy the appeals for clemency. The Special Rapporteur denounced the execution 
of Mr. Garcia, which was carried out on 7 July 2011, in breach of international law.38  
</p>
<p>26. Nevertheless, the Government has taken some steps to comply with its obligations 
under the VCCR. A Memorandum was issued by the President directing state courts to give 
effect to the decisions in the cases of 51 Mexican nationals, identified in the ICJ judgment.39 
The Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs also issued a Consular Notification and

<p>Access Manual to guide federal, state and local law enforcement and other officials.40 Most 
importantly, a bill has been introduced to facilitate compliance with article 36 of the 
VCCR.41 
</p>
<p>27. The Supreme Court, however, held that the President was not empowered to enforce 
the judgment in domestic courts by means of a Memorandum.42 During the country visit, 
Texas officials contended that their refusal to provide review of the cases of Mexican 
nationals on death row was supported by this decision.43 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the situation of 133 foreign 
nationals currently on death row across the country,44 and strongly recommends the adoption 
of the 2011 Consular Notification Compliance Act to ensure respect for their rights in 
accordance with the VCCR. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Deaths in immigration detention  
</b></p>
<p>29. At the time of the country visit in 2008, the Department of Homeland Security 
(DHS) had no complete record of the number and names of people who had died in 
immigration detention. The number of deaths and lack of transparency regarding the 
circumstances of these deaths were subjects of concern. 45  It was recommended that all 
deaths in immigration detention be promptly and publicly reported and fully investigated. 
To remedy the causes of such deaths, reported denial of necessary medical care, inadequate 
or delayed care, and provision of inappropriate medication, it was recommended that the 
DHS promulgate regulations for the provision of medical care, consistent with international 
standards. 
</p>
<p>30. Deaths in immigration detention remain worrying. The recurrence of and lack of 
transparency surrounding such deaths have continually been denounced. Some reported 
deaths occurred in prison-like conditions where detention was neither necessary nor 
appropriate, and where no proper medical care was provided. The lack and/or denial of 
adequate health care violates the right of immigration detainees to medical care and 
endangers their lives.   
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur notes that significant progress has been made to address 
transparency failures highlighted in the mission report and to track deaths of immigration 
detainees. In accordance with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
Directive No. 7-9.0 on Notification and Reporting of Detainee Deaths, deaths in custody 
must now be regularly reported and published. This directive requires ICE Enforcement and 
Removal Operations (ERO) to notify various components of the DHS, the appropriate 
consulate and the detainee&#8223;s next-of-kin within 24 hours of a detainee&#8223;s death. 46 
Furthermore, the ICE Office of Congressional Relations (OCR) must notify Congress of 
media statements prepared by the ICE Office of Public Affairs, and the ICE Office of State, 
Local and Tribal Coordination is required to notify non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs). Currently, ICE compiles all detainee deaths occurring in ICE custody. Between

 46 United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Directive No. 7-9.0, section 7. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>October 2003 and October 2011, 124 detainees reportedly died in ICE custody.47 Detainees&#8223; 
deaths are investigated by the Director of the Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) 
and a mortality review is conducted by the Office of Health Affairs (OHA). 
</p>
<p>32. On 20 September 2011, the House of Representatives approved the Death in 
Custody Reporting Act. Should this Act be passed, federal and state law enforcement 
agencies would be legally obliged to report deaths in custody to the Attorney General, who 
must produce within two years a study analyzing the individual reports. The Special 
Rapporteur strongly supports enactment of this law. While the Government is commended 
for its efforts to address transparency failures over the deaths of detained immigrants, it 
should also ensure the accountability of the individual(s) responsible for such deaths. 
</p>
<p>33. In 2008, the Detainee Basic Medical Care Act was introduced in Congress, but has 
regrettably not been enacted. Nevertheless, on 16 December 2010, ICE officials took 
concrete steps to recognize the constitutional entitlement of immigration detainees to 
adequate levels of medical and mental health care by settling a lawsuit filed by the 
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alleging that the deficient care at the San Diego 
Correctional Facility caused unnecessary suffering and death.48 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the appointment of regional clinical directors and 
field medical coordinators to provide medical case management and review denials of 
requests for medical services. Furthermore, the Government indicated that as part of the 
drafting process of the 2010 Performance-Based National Detention Standards, all medical 
care standards for medical assistance to care facilities for ICE detainees were under review. 
However, even if implemented, such an instrument would not apply to county jails, where a 
large number of immigration detainees are held.49  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur recommends that legislation on detainee medical care be 
enacted, including the 2011 Refugee Protection Act, which contains important provisions on 
improving detention conditions, including medical care. The 2010 Performance-Based 
National Detention Standards should be finalized and adopted, consistent with international 
standards, and applied to all detention facilities. An independent oversight system should be 
established to monitor all facilities where immigration detainees are held. 50  The DIHS 
should also establish an independent review panel, which would permit detainees to appeal 
denials of care.51 To prevent further abuse and denials of care which may endanger their 
lives, detainees should have access to legal representation.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Killings by law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p>36. The previous mandate holder made two recommendations aimed at better tracking 
and responding to killings by law enforcement officials. He recommended increased use of 
video and audio recordings of interactions between law enforcement officers and members 
of the public, as they serve as evidence and are believed to have a deterrent effect on law 
enforcement officers. In addition, measures should be taken to safeguard tapes, including

also recommended that existing data collection efforts be more comprehensive so as to 
increase their usefulness as &#8220;early warning&#8221; and &#8220;hot spot identification&#8221; mechanisms for 
unlawful killings by law enforcement officers. 
</p>
<p>37. The Government indicated that data on deaths are included in monitoring reports 
which assess compliance with settlement agreements. The Government further mentioned 
that the DoJ regularly requires local and state law enforcement agencies to develop and 
implement early warning systems in its settlement agreements to prevent police-involved 
deaths and to enable the detection of systemic failures or at-risk behaviour.  
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur was not provided with sufficient information to assess 
progress. He encourages federal, state and local authorities to pursue their efforts to 
implement the recommendations in the mission report.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. International operations  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Death penalty under the Military Commissions Act 
</b></p>
<p>39. Following the issue of Executive Order 13492 53  expressing the Government&#8223;s 
intention to close the Guant&#225;namo Bay detention facility, an interagency task force was 
created to review each detainee&#8223;s situation and to recommend the appropriate disposition of 
each case. Its findings were made public in January 2010.54 The task force concluded that 36 
detainees could be tried in civil or military courts, while 48 of the remaining detainees were 
considered too dangerous to be released, but could not be brought to trial. Despite the 
Government&#8223;s commitment to close the detention centre,55 172 people remain in custody, of 
whom six are to be tried by a military commission for capital offences.  
</p>
<p>40. Due process concerns surrounding trials conducted under the Military Commissions 
Act (MCA) prompted the previous mandate holder to recommend that the MCA not be 
applied to death penalty cases, as prosecutions thereunder would not meet due process 
requirements under international human rights and humanitarian law.56 On 21 January 2009, 
the President ordered the immediate suspension of military trials at Guant&#225;namo Bay. 
However, in a reversal of its earlier position that detainees should be tried before civilian 
courts, on 7 March 2011, the Government announced its intention to resume military trials, 
thereby lifting a two-year freeze on military trials.  
</p>
<p>41. On 31 May 2011, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced that the office of 
military commission prosecutors had sworn charges against five Guant&#225;namo Bay 
detainees57 alleged to have been leading conspirators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.58 Capital

<p>punishment was recommended in all five cases, subject to the approval of the Convening 
Authority.  
</p>
<p>42. On 20 April 2011, the DoD announced that military commission charges had been 
sworn against Saudi Arabian national Abd al Rahim Hussein al-Nashiri, inter alia, for his 
involvement in the bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen in 2000. The Convening Authority 
referred capital charges against him and arraignment was set before a military judge in 
Guant&#225;namo on 26 October 2011.59  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government introduced changes to its military 
commission to address some shortcomings highlighted in the mission report,60 including 
prohibition to admit statements obtained through cruel, inhuman and degrading 
interrogation methods as evidence at trial, limitation on the use of hearsay, and the burden 
of proof is no longer  on the objecting party.61 However, the prohibition on statements 
obtained under torture does not go far enough, as hearsay statements obtained under torture 
can be admitted as evidence. A further improvement is that the 2009 MCA requires the 
appointment of &#8220;learned counsel&#8221; in death penalty cases, and provides payment for civilian 
lawyers in that role. Nonetheless, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his predecessor&#8223;s 
concerns. No matter what improvements have been made, the tribunals still remain military 
courts and raise due process concerns.62 The Special Rapporteur strongly supports the view 
that Guant&#225;namo detainees should be tried before ordinary Federal courts and recommends 
that the Government seek to repeal the restrictions and ensure that defendants are tried 
before civilian courts, in full compliance with fair trial safeguards, especially in light of the 
fact that the death penalty may be sought against them. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Detainee deaths at Guant&#225;namo 
</b></p>
<p>44. The previous mandate holder expressed concern about the reported deaths at the 
Guant&#225;namo Bay detention facility, four out of five having been classified as suicides.63 In 
the case of custodial deaths there is the rebuttable presumption of State responsibility, given 
the State&#8223;s heightened duty to protect the right to life.64 In February 2011, the death of Awal 
Gul, followed by the death of a detainee known as Inayatullah, brought the number of 
deaths in custody at Guant&#225;namo to eight; it is alleged that none of these deaths has been 
adequately investigated.65 On 22 February 2010, the Special Rapporteur sent an allegation 
letter to the Government, requesting clarification on the deaths of three prisoners at the 
Guant&#225;namo Bay detention facility.66 The Government&#8223;s response indicated that the deaths 
were suicides.67 A death reported on 19 May 2011, again prompted investigation into the 
circumstances surrounding these incidents. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the 
recommendation that complete and unedited investigations and autopsy results into the 
deaths of Guant&#225;namo detainees be released to family members, if this has not yet been 
done.

<p><b> B. Strategies to protect civilians and enhance transparency regarding 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian casualties 
</b></p>
<p>45. The United States is involved in international military operations in Afghanistan and 
Iraq, and more recently in Libya. Despite efforts made to spare non-combatants, United 
States international operations have caused a large number of civilian casualties. 
Transparency is a requirement under both international humanitarian and human rights 
law,68 as was reaffirmed by the Security Council on 13 October 2010, when it renewed the 
mandate of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), and called on all parties to 
comply with their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law and 
for all appropriate measures to be taken to ensure the protection of civilians. The Security 
Council also recognized the importance of ongoing monitoring and reporting to it, including 
by ISAF, of the situation of civilians, and in particular civilian casualties.69 In its resolution 
extending the mandate of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), the 
Security Council again made a similar recommendation.70 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Military 
</b></p>
<p>46. While acknowledging the challenges of compiling statistics on civilian casualties 
during military operations owing to the lack of secure access to incident sites, the Special 
Rapporteur underscored in the mission report that systematic tracking was critical for 
minimizing casualties. The DoD noted that information on civilian casualties is included in 
significant activity (SIGACT) reports; however, the data is not necessarily accurate and has 
not been consolidated in a comprehensive and searchable database.71  
</p>
<p>47. In Afghanistan, United States troops take part in ISAF and still operate under 
Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). ISAF established the Civilian Casualty Tracking Cell 
in 2008, but has reportedly not accurately recorded civilian casualties. Although most of the 
United States Special Forces (USSF) in Afghanistan were reportedly brought under COM-
ISAF (Commander of ISAF) in March 2010, their procedures for investigating civilian 
casualties remain unclear. 72  In December 2010, members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization (NATO) agreed to review the tracking cell to address shortfalls in 
effectiveness and inadequacies in resourcing. Despite these efforts, the tracking cell appears 
to have insufficient investigatory capacity and empowerment from the military leadership. A 
further shortcoming is that the tracking cell relies heavily on forces on the ground to report 
incidents on their own initiative.73  
</p>
<p>48. While some progress has been made, inappropriate data collection technology, the 
lack of consistency and of full-time investigators need to be addressed.  In the event that an 
incident causes civilian harm, the unit involved conducts an assessment and reports to the 
tracking cell within 24 hours. After 10 days, the unit submits an assessment report to the 
tracking cell, containing all results, including lessons learned and whether compensation has 
been paid. In high-profile cases involving multiple deaths and significant media coverage, 
an incident assessment team of experts (IAT) is deployed by COM-ISAF. The Special 
</p>

</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned however that the IAT operates on an ad hoc basis, in particular in 
high-profile cases, in the absence of clearly established criteria. Furthermore, in each case, 
the team is composed of different experts, making it difficult to ensure continuity in analysis 
and identification of lessons learned. Additionally, the tracking cell may not always capture 
all information relating to civilian casualties, since some incidents take place in areas where 
thorough battle damage assessments are not systematically conducted.74  
</p>
<p>49. Regarding civilian casualty estimates, figures are provided by the United Nations 
Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) and the Afghanistan Independent Human 
Rights Commission (AIHRC). Between 2010 and mid-2011, most civilian casualties in 
Afghanistan were attributed to Anti-Government Elements (AGE),75 accounting for 75 per 
cent of 2,777 civilian casualties in 2010 and 80 per cent of 1,462 civilian casualties in the 
first half of 2011.76 While a rising death toll caused by AGE is noted, fewer civilians were 
killed and injured by Pro-Government Forces (PGF) in 2010 than in previous years, due to 
efforts by international and Afghan military forces to reduce civilian casualties. Air strikes 
claimed the largest number of civilian deaths resulting from PGF operations.77 According to 
UNAMA, night raids and other tactics resulted in less civilian casualties in 2010, primarily 
through the effect of regulations. The Counterinsurgency Guidelines and the Tactical 
Directive on the disciplined use of force were revised and updated by General David 
Petraeus, who took over command of ISAF in July 2010. The Standard Operating 
Procedures on the escalation of force were also published, and two Tactical Directives on 
night raids were issued in January and December 2010, respectively.78 
</p>
<p>50. UNAMA and AIHRC mentioned difficulties in monitoring USSF operations due to 
both tactical reasons and deliberate lack of information. The number of raids conducted by 
USSF increased as they are believed to be more successful in gathering intelligence and 
reducing civilian losses. However, night raids reportedly generate anger and resentment 
among the Afghan population towards the international military presence. 79  In some 
instances, excessive use of force, death and injury to civilians have been reported. AIHRC 
and UNAMA documented 13 such incidents which occurred in 2010.80 No information has 
been received regarding OEF operations to indicate that measures have been taken to 
enhance transparency regarding civilian casualties. 
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur welcomes efforts made in Afghanistan to spare civilians 
from military operations, notably through the adoption of regulations emphasizing civilian 
protection and restricting the use of force. He notes that positive measures have been taken 
to enhance transparency regarding civilian casualties, namely through the ISAF tracking 
cell. However, in light of its shortfalls, the Special Rapporteur calls on the international 
security forces in Afghanistan, including the United States, to allocate sufficient financial 
and human resources to the tracking cell, including full-time experienced investigators to 
carry out its functions and to ensure continuity, analysis and integration of lessons learned.81 
</p>
<p>Additionally, given the allegations that investigations by the tracking cell depend on forces 
on the ground to report incidents on their own initiative, the Special Rapporteur contends

<p>that in order for the tracking cell to record losses systematically, relevant binding 
instruments should be adopted to impose on officers the obligation to systematically report 
incidents. Such an obligation is also strongly advisable in respect of incidents in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>52. In Iraq, United States troops were involved in Operation Iraqi Freedom until 31 
August 2010, when it was redesignated as Operation New Dawn (OND). Despite the 
withdrawal of United States Forces (USF-I) from Iraqi cities on 30 June 2009, civilian 
deaths have continued to be reported as a result of joint Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and 
USF-I operations. In 2010, 113 deaths reportedly resulted from ISF and/or USF-I 
operations, while 64 deaths were reported in 2009. Civilian casualties caused by USF-I 
stood at 17, significantly lower than the 64 deaths reported in 2009.82 It is reported that 
USF-I opened fire on a vehicle, killing an Iraqi journalist and her husband. No further 
clarification was provided by USF-I. Likewise, on 12 February 2010, it is alleged that up to 
10 people were killed and five wounded in a joint ISF/USF-I raid some 75 km north of 
Amarah in Missan Governorate. 83  As mentioned above, information on casualties is 
contained in SIGACTS reports.84 In a report to Congress, the DoD explained that as a 
consequence of USF-I withdrawal from Iraqi cities, the Government&#8223;s visibility and ability 
to verify Iraqi reports have been reduced. While United States and Iraqi forces data are 
close, some values differ.85 The Special Rapporteur notes the challenges encountered by the 
United States forces in this regard, but recalls that it is the Government&#8223;s duty to gather 
information on civilian casualties resulting from USF-I operations, be they joint operations 
or not. The Special Rapporteur reiterates the recommendation that the Government 
systematically and consistently track and publicly disclose information on all civilian losses 
resulting from its international operations. This is important in terms of transparency and 
accountability, and the collected data may be analysed to draw lessons with a view to 
preventing further deaths and collateral damage to civilians.  
</p>
<p>53. Unlike in the battlefield, operational difficulties cannot be invoked to justify a 
failure to compile statistics on deaths in military custody. When a State detains an 
individual, it is held to a heightened level of diligence to protect the individual&#8223;s rights,86 
</p>
<p>meaning that it should prevent deaths, conduct investigations and prosecute unlawful 
conduct.87  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Private contractors  
</b></p>
<p>54. The Government relies heavily on private military and security companies 
(PMSCs)88 within the framework of its international operations. As of March 2011, there 
were reportedly 28,000 private contractors employed by DoD in Afghanistan and Iraq,89

<p>amounting to 18 per cent of DoD&#8223;s workforce. In total, over 200,000 PMSCs have worked 
for the Government. Since the release of the mission report in 2009, there have been 
instances of killings by PMSCs.90  
</p>
<p>55. It is worth noting, however, that deaths caused by PMSCs in Iraq have greatly 
decreased due to legal and other restrictions on the activities of PMSCs.91 On 10 February 
2010, the Ministry of Interior reportedly ordered the PMSC Blackwater (now known as Xe 
Services) to leave the country within one week. In over a year, only one incident involving 
private security officers and resulting in the death of a civilian had been reported. 92 
Likewise, only one incident was reported in 2009.93 The decrease is reportedly attributed to 
several factors, including the decrease in military activities in Iraq, stricter regulation by 
Iraqi authorities, and efforts by the United States to tighten oversight of contractors. 94 
Following the Nissour Square shooting in 2007, the Government has reviewed and 
improved reporting procedures and oversight mechanisms for PMSCs working for the 
United States in Iraq. For instance, video-recording systems must be installed in all vehicles 
used by PMSCs, who must also submit information on their movements to USF-I. 95 
Irrespective of the number of deaths caused by PMSCs in the context of international 
operations, the Government should track and publicly disclose all civilian casualties caused 
by private contractors.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Civilian intelligence agencies 
</b></p>
<p>56. The mission report highlighted five cases of custodial deaths involving the CIA. 
Since then further information on those and other cases has been disclosed in the media and 
by civil society organizations.96 There are also accounts of the involvement of CIA agents 
who allegedly carried out targeted attacks.97 The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government also track and disclose civilian casualties caused by intelligence agents. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Transparency and accountability for unlawful killings and custodial

<p>Government&#8223;s international military and intelligence operations. Transparency in the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice is a pre-requisite for all States governed by the rule of law. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Investigations and accountability through the military justice system 
</b></p>
<p>58. The mission report highlighted the lack of transparency and effective investigation 
and prosecution in the military justice system. During his mission to Afghanistan, the 
previous mandate holder observed that the opacity of the military justice system reduced 
confidence in the United States Government&#8223;s commitment to accountability for illegal 
conduct. Information received indicates that NATO International Security Assistance Force 
(ISAF) does not routinely disclose information about its investigations into cases of civilian 
casualties caused by international security forces. 98  In his mission report, the Special 
Rapporteur recommended that the DoD establish a central office or &#8220;registry&#8221; to maintain a 
</p>
<p>docket and track cases from investigation through final disposition, which should be 
publicly accessible. However, the Government specified that each Military Service 
maintains its own court docketing system to which access is available by an Internet 
website, which suggests that no central registry exists. The Government indicated that trials 
under the Uniform Code of Military Justice are open to the public and often draw in 
extensive media coverage. However, the military trial judge may exclude the public from 
part of the proceedings in order to protect classified information if the prosecution 
demonstrates an overriding need for such exclusion, which cannot be broader than 
necessary.99 
</p>
<p>59. As recommended in the mission report, consideration should be given to 
establishing a Director of Military Prosecutions to ensure separation between the chain of 
command and the prosecution function. No information has been provided in this regard. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur further recommended that the doctrine of &#8220;command 
responsibility&#8221; be codified as a basis for criminal liability in the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice and the War Crimes Act. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that, in March 
2010, the former Commander of the United States forces and ISAF brought most of the 
United States Special Operations Forces under the same chain of command as regular 
United States and NATO forces.100 This is a first step towards greater accountability.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur notes that in 2010 and 2011, court proceedings were 
conducted in five cases involving soldiers who had served in Iraq and/or Afghanistan for 
alleged violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice implementing rules of 
international humanitarian law. However, many deaths remain unpunished and it is reported 
that there are no prosecutions or even investigations of high-level officials potentially 
responsible for abuses, including deaths.   
</p>
<p>62. Information received suggests that the current lack of accountability fuels 
resentment and the belief among Afghans that international forces are above the law and 
unaccountable for their actions. 101  The Special Rapporteur calls on the United States 
Government and Afghan authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure that unlawful 
killings do not remain unpunished, to bring perpetrators to justice and to provide remedies 
for the victims.

<p><b> 2. Investigations and accountability through the civilian justice system 
</b></p>
<p>63. The previous mandate holder found that there was a lack of political and 
prosecutorial will and that a zone of impunity seems to have been created for private 
contractors and civilian intelligence agents. According to information received, the 
inadequate oversight and inability to hold Blackwater and other PMSCs accountable for 
serious crimes have alienated local populations and undermined United States military 
efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.  
</p>
<p>64. While United States law provides several avenues for DoD contractors who commit 
serious crimes overseas,102 criminal jurisdiction for non-DoD contractors remains unclear.103 
In this regard, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the information that the Government is 
currently considering legislation in the form of the Civilian Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act 
(CEJA) that would expand criminal jurisdiction over Federal contractors and employees 
working outside the United States, which would cover non-DoD contractors, 104 as 
recommended in the mission report.105 This Act would further establish units to investigate 
allegations of criminal offences committed by private contractors, thereby increasing 
oversight. Additionally, the Attorney General would be requested to report annually to 
Congress on the number of offences received, investigated and prosecuted.  
</p>
<p>65. While this is a commendable initiative, it should be noted that it would only apply to 
felony offences and not to nationals of the host country working for the United States; as 
such, its scope of application would be somewhat limited. Furthermore, concern is 
expressed about the wording of section 5(b) which explicitly exempts &#8220;lawful&#8221; intelligence 
</p>
<p>activities.106 The Special Rapporteur contends that this provision is unclear, as no lawful 
conduct may ever be prosecuted. It is feared that this provision could be interpreted too 
broadly. Consequently, the said bill should be revised so as to include those working for 
intelligence agencies and to delete the above-mentioned provision.  
</p>
<p>66. On 24 August 2009, the Attorney General announced that he had ordered a 
preliminary review into whether Federal laws were violated in connection with the 
interrogation of specific detainees at overseas locations.107 However, it was made clear from 
the outset that those who acted within the scope of the legal guidance regarding 
interrogation methods would not be prosecuted. Moreover, it is now clear that the DoJ does 
not intend to criminally investigate the high-level officials nor the lawyers who respectively 
</p>
<p>                                                          
 102 For example, section 2340A of title 18 of the United States Code authorizes prosecutions of United 
</p>
<p>States nationals who commit torture outside the United States. Also, section 2441 criminalizes a 
&#8220;grave breach&#8221; of common art. 3 of the Geneva Conventions, when committed overseas and within an 
armed conflict. Under the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA), persons employed by or 
accompanying the Armed Forces outside the United States may be prosecuted domestically if they 
commit a serious criminal offence overseas. The MEJA specifically covers all civilian employees and 
contractors directly employed by the DoD or supporting its mission overseas.

<p>commissioned and authored the legal memoranda authorizing the use of so-called 
&#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques&#8221;. This is so despite revelations by the former President 
</p>
<p>and Vice President that they had authorized at least one of the techniques that the 
International Committee for the Red Cross had deemed as amounting to torture and/or cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment.108  
</p>
<p>67. Attorney John Durham examined the possible involvement of the CIA in the 
interrogation of 101 detainees placed into United States custody following the 9/11 terrorist 
attacks. Mr. Durham advised that full investigations be conducted into the deaths in custody 
of two individuals. In this context, Steve Stormoen, former supervisor of an unofficial CIA 
programme in which individuals were detained and interrogated without their names being 
entered in the Army&#8223;s books, came under scrutiny by the prosecution.109 
</p>
<p>68. While the Special Rapporteur notes that a number of private contractors have 
recently been convicted for unlawful killings, 110  he also notes that a federal judge in 
Washington D.C. dismissed charges against five of the six guards accused of the killings in 
the Nissoor Square incident. Consequently, new legislation was sought in Iraq to enable 
prosecution of foreign contractors in Iraqi courts. The United States Government has 
consistently rejected requests by the Iraqi Government that former Blackwater employees be 
prosecuted in Iraqi Courts. In related developments, a United States prosecutor ruled on 18 
October 2010 that there was insufficient evidence to support a criminal conviction of a 
former Blackwater employee who had killed an Iraqi guard.111 In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur endorses the concern expressed by the Working Group on the use of 
mercenaries, following its visit to Iraq in June 2009, about the lack of accountability of 
contractors for violations committed between 2003 and 2009, and recalls that victims of 
violations and their families are still waiting for justice.112

<p>inquiry&#8221;<b> 
</b></p>
<p>69. Despite the recommendation made by the previous mandate holder in the 2009 
mission report, no commission of inquiry has been established to conduct independent, 
systematic and sustained investigations of policies and practices that have led to deaths and 
other abuses in United States operations. However, an independent prosecutor was 
appointed in August 2009 to investigate alleged CIA interrogation abuses, including cases 
which resulted in the death of prisoners.113 However, it should be noted that the prosecutor 
will examine the deaths of only two CIA prisoners. The potential responsibility of DoD

</p>
<p>officials for the wide-scale abuses documented during DoD interrogations in Iraq, 
Afghanistan and Guant&#225;namo Bay will not be reviewed. 
</p>
<p>70. No information has been received on the establishment, within the DoJ, of an office 
dedicated to investigating and prosecuting crimes by private contractors, civilian 
Government employees, and former military personnel, which should receive the resources 
and investigative support necessary to handle these cases. The Special Rapporteur reiterates 
this recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Reparation for civilian casualties 
</b></p>
<p>71. The United States has played a leading role in granting compensation and restitution 
to civilian victims of United States military operations and implemented a number of 
programmes in this respect. These include payment of legal claims under the Foreign 
Claims Act for non-conflict related losses, condolence payments drawn from the 
Commander&#8223;s Emergency Response Program (CERP) in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as 
</p>
<p><i>solatia</i> payments in the latter, together with various programmes providing assistance for 
damages caused.114  In Afghanistan and in Iraq, the United States Congress created and 
allocated money for assistance programmes for civilian victims of United States military 
actions. 
</p>
<p>72. These programmes have been developed on an ad hoc basis and although some 
progress has been made, there are discrepancies in practice. In the absence of guidelines or 
training, each commander handles claims at his discretion. 115  The Special Rapporteur 
commends the adoption by the North Atlantic Council in June 2010 of guidelines on civilian 
compensation for all troop-contributing nations in Afghanistan. The guidelines focus on 
prompt acknowledgement by ISAF of combat-related civilian harm, proper investigations 
and the pro-active offering of assistance to survivors. However, the guidelines are non-
binding and the ISAF commander has merely forwarded them to the regional commanders 
with no detailed instructions, leaving a gap between political will and practice. 116 Some 
troop-contributing forces, including the United States,117 consider the guidelines insufficient. 
</p>
<p>73. Reportedly, the United States runs its own <i>solatia </i>programme, 118  while several 
NATO countries do not offer any assistance to civilians injured by their actions. It appears 
that public records are insufficient for an estimate of the number of victims who receive 
payments and the proportion of compensations to be made.  
</p>
<p>74. While noting that there is no unified system of compensation among the 
NATO/ISAF contributing states for civilian casualties and injuries, the Special Rapporteur 
reiterates that existing reparation programmes should be combined or replaced by a 
comprehensive and adequately-funded compensation programme for the families of those 
killed in United States operations. In missions involving a range of international forces, such 
as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Government should urge allies to implement similar 
programmes and should promote coordination to ensure that all casualties are compensated.

families in Kapisa province, who were mostly victims of night raids and air strikes. In a separate 
incident, on 21 March 2010, international military forces reportedly left 50,000 Afs (approximately 
$1,000) in a house following a night raid. See A/HRC/17/28/Add.6, para. 41. </p>

<p>75. Concern has been expressed that the tracking cell is currently compiling 
information, albeit without much analysis, and &#8220;storing&#8221; it, instead of creating a 
comprehensive database on civilian harm.119 The Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government adopt uniform procedures and guidelines or a compensation system for civilian 
casualties. Such system should not only be limited to financial compensation, but should 
also take into account the harm caused to families of the deceased and provide adequate 
compensation. Adequate human and financial resources should be allocated to the system 
and all stakeholders, including commanders, troops and judges should receive proper and 
mandatory training on the guidelines. The system should integrate and analyse lessons 
learned with a view to minimizing civilian harm. Finally, consideration should be given to 
creating a high-level Pentagon position to track and assess the impact of United States-led 
international operations. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Targeted killings: lack of transparency regarding legal framework and 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeting choices 
</b></p>
<p>76. As mentioned in the 2009 report120 and evidenced by a number of studies,121 the 
Government has continuously engaged in targeted killings on the territory of other States. 
Such attacks have been reported particularly in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia and 
Yemen where the United States has conducted raids and airstrikes as well as deployed 
unmanned aerial vehicles to target particular individuals. The previous mandate holder was 
disturbed by the lack of transparency regarding the legal framework and targeting choices. 
He called on the Government to clarify the rules of international law it considers to cover 
targeted killings. To date, the Government has not provided an official and satisfactory 
response, but has referred to a statement made by the Department of State Legal Adviser.122 
</p>
<p>77. The legal framework governing targeted killings had already been addressed by the 
mandate,123 and a report presented to the General Assembly in 2011124 considered the extent 
to which an advance decision, ruling out the possibility of offering or accepting an 
opportunity to surrender, renders such operations unlawful; it makes reference also to the 
killing of Osama bin Laden.125 Human rights law dictates that every effort must be made to 
arrest a suspect, in accordance with the principles of necessity and proportionality on the use 
of force. In cases where international humanitarian law may apply, the situation in each 
country should be assessed on a case-by-case basis in order to determine the existence or not 
of armed conflict.

<p> 122 See United States Department of State, Speech by Harold, Hongju Koh, Legal Adviser, to the Annual 
Meeting of the American Society of International Law, 25 March 2010, in which he evokes a number 
of legal bases to justify targeted killing, including the assertion that the Government is engaged in an 
&#8220;armed conflict&#8221; against al-Qaeda, the Taliban and associated forces, who the Government considers 
as legitimate targets under international humanitarian law. He also evokes the right to self-defence.

<p>78. With regard to targeted killings in the context of an armed conflict, the Special 
Rapporteur notes with appreciation that an updated directive on &#8220;population-centric 
counterinsurgency principles&#8221; was adopted in August 2010. However, no information has 
been made available on substantial changes to procedures applied on the ground to ensure 
that strikes targeting Taliban fighters were based on reliable information, and did not cause 
unnecessary suffering and damage to the civilian population. The Special Rapporteur is 
unable to comment on the content and criteria established in the July 2009 Tactical 
Directive on the disciplined use of force, the Standard Operating Procedures on the 
escalation of force and the two Tactical Directives on night raids that were issued in January 
and December 2010, respectively.126 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur again requests the Government to clarify the rules that it 
considers to cover targeted killings, as mere reference to a statement made by a senior State 
official is insufficient. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his predecessor&#8223;s recommendation 
that the Government specify the bases for decisions to kill rather than capture &#8220;human 
targets&#8221; and whether the State in which the killing takes place has given consent. It should 
also specify procedural safeguards in place to ensure in advance that targeted killings 
comply with international law, as well as the measures taken after such killing to ensure that 
its legal and factual analysis is accurate. 
</p>
<p>80. In the absence of Government transparency, civil society has conducted considerable 
research on drone strikes. Although figures vary widely with regard to drone attack 
estimates, all studies concur on one important point: there has been a dramatic increase in 
their use over the past three years.127 While these attacks are directed at individuals believed 
to be leaders or active members of al-Qaeda or the Taliban, in the context of armed conflict 
(e.g. in Afghanistan), in other instances, civilians have allegedly also perished in the 
attacks128 in regions where it is unclear whether there was an armed conflict or not (e.g. in 
Pakistan.  
</p>
<p>81. Since June 2004, some 300 drone strikes have been carried out in Pakistan129 and the 
number of resulting deaths has allegedly reached quadruple figures according to 
unconfirmed reports,130 of which about 20 per cent are believed to be civilians.131 According 
to the non-governmental Pakistan Human Rights Commission, United States drones strikes 
were responsible for at least 957 deaths in Pakistan in 2010.132 Information also indicates 
that the attacks increasingly fuel protests among the population.133 In the mission report, the 
Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government publish the number of civilians 
collaterally killed as a result of drone attacks, and the measures in place to prevent such 
casualties. The DoD formally confirmed that such estimates of civilian casualties are not 
compiled separately from estimates related to other weapons systems. 134  The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates the recommendation that the Government track civilian casualties in

<p>disaggregated data so as to identify the number of casualties resulting from the use of drone 
attacks. 
</p>
<p>82. Disclosure of these killings is critical to ensure accountability, justice and reparation 
for victims or their families. No system of compensation and reparation such as those put in 
place in Iraq and Afghanistan exist in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia or other States where such 
strikes have allegedly taken place. The Government should clarify the procedures in place to 
ensure that any targeted killing complies with international humanitarian law and human 
rights, and indicate the measures or strategies applied to prevent casualties, as well as the 
measures in place to provide prompt, thorough, effective and independent public 
investigation of alleged violations.135  
</p>
<p>83. In addition to the targeted killing of individuals alleged to be involved in terrorist 
activities, or those who pose a risk to national security, the collateral damages resulting from 
the operations carried out is also a matter of concern. In the mission report on his visit to 
Afghanistan, the previous mandate holder mentioned the use of night raids on housing 
compounds as a strategy to capture individuals suspected of links to the Taliban, which too 
often resulted in killings for which no one was held accountable.136 In February 2011, it was 
reported that night raids had resulted in approximately 600 deaths within the space of three 
months, and allegedly shots were fired in 80 per cent of recent raids. 137  Nevertheless, 
casualties are much higher in the case of air and drone strikes. For instance, concern was 
raised about a missile strike in Abyan, South Yemen, in December 2009. According to a 
parliamentary inquiry, 41 residents, including 14 women and 21 children perished in the 
attack. Evidence of the use of United States weaponry was made public. The DoD has not 
commented or explained the precautions that had been taken to avoid casualties and 
deaths.138 
</p>
<p>84. Like his predecessor, the Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned that the practice 
of targeted killing could set a dangerous precedent,139 in that any Government could, under 
the cover of counter-terrorism imperatives, decide to target and kill an individual on the 
territory of any State if it considers that said individual constitutes a threat.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusion 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Government of the United States of America deserves credit for taking 
measures to implement some of the recommendations formulated by the previous 
</b></p>
<p><b>mandate holder in the report of his visit to the country in 2008. At the domestic level, 
</b></p>
<p><b>progress has been made in tracking and better responding to deaths in immigration 
</b></p>
<p><b>detention. The commitment to analyse and address racial disparities in the imposition 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the death penalty is also a welcome step.  
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Regarding international operations, some efforts have been made to provide 
greater transparency with regard to tracking civilian losses in Afghanistan, through 
</b></p>
<p><b>the ISAF tracking cell. Several regulations have been issued to limit the use of force 
</b></p>
<p><b>and enhance civilian protection, and compensation programmes for families of victims 
</b></p>
<p><b>have been strengthened. The decrease in the number of incidents reported in Iraq, and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the measures taken to improve oversight of private contractors are to be commended.  
</b></p>

<p>87. <b>However, no significant improvement has been made on the three priority 
areas identified in the mission report. No progress has been noted to address due 
</b></p>
<p><b>process concerns in the imposition of the death penalty, nor has the Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>implemented the recommendations relating to the situation of Guant&#225;namo Bay

<p><b>detainees. Insufficient measures have been taken to enhance transparency regarding 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian casualties resulting from United States international military and intelligence 
</b></p>
<p><b>operations and to minimize casualties. Indeed, much remains to be done to bring about 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice and to overcome the failure of political will to bring perpetrators to account. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>Efforts should be strengthened to bring perpetrators of unlawful killings, be 
they military contractors, intelligence agents, high-- or low-ranking Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>officials, to justice. The lack of transparency regarding the legal framework and 
</b></p>
<p><b>targeting choices for killings and the dangerous precedent that such practice 
</b></p>
<p><b>represents remain of grave concern. Efforts should be redoubled to implement the

<p><b>recommendations in the 2009 mission report. The Special Rapporteur remains ready

</b></p>
<p><b>  Summary of follow-up to each recommendation</b>140<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Domestic issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Due process in death penalty cases 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The system of partisan elections for judges should be reformed to ensure that capital 
</b></p>
<p><b>defendants receive a fair trial and appeals process. 
</b></p>
<p>No information was provided on relevant reforms. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Alabama and Texas should establish well-funded, state-wide public defender services. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Oversight of these should be independent of the executive and judicial branches. 
</b></p>
<p>No information was provided on relevant reforms. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Texas should establish a commission to review cases in which convicted people have 
</b></p>
<p><b>been subsequently exonerated, analyze the reasons, and make recommendations to 
</b></p>
<p><b>enable the criminal justice system to prevent future mistakes. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Alabama should evaluate and respond in detail to the findings and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the American Bar Association report on the implementation of its death penalty. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Federal and state governments should systematically review and respond to concerns 
</b></p>
<p><b>about continuing racial disparities in the criminal justice system generally, and in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>imposition of the death penalty specifically. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. However, it enjoys the support of the 
Government. 
</p>
<p><b> 6. In light of uncorrected flaws in state criminal justice systems, and given the finality of 
</b></p>
<p><b>executions, Congress should enact legislation permitting federal courts to review on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the merits all issues in death penalty post-conviction cases. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 7. Regulations permitting the Department of Justice to certify the adequacy of state 
</b></p>
<p><b>indigent defence systems based on factors left to s</b>tates&#8217; discretion should be amended 
</p>
<p><b>or repealed. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>
<p><b> 8. Federal and state governments should ensure that capital punishment is imposed only 
</b></p>
<p><b>for the most serious crimes, requiring an intent to kill resulting in a loss of life.  
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented. 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/22/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>26</b> 
</p>
<p><b> 9. Foreign nationals who were denied the right to consular notification should have their 
</b></p>
<p><b>executions stayed and their cases fully reviewed and reconsidered. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.  
</p>
<p><b>  Deaths in immigration detention 
</b></p>
<p><b> 10. All deaths in immigration detention should be promptly and publicly reported and 
</b></p>
<p><b>investigated. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been implemented.  
</p>
<p><b> 11. The Department of Homeland Security should promulgate regulations, through the 
</b></p>
<p><b>normal administrative rule-making process, for provision of medical care that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>consistent with international standards. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented.  
</p>
<p><b>  Tracking and responding to killings by law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p><b> 12. Video and audio recording of interactions between law enforcement officers and 
</b></p>
<p><b>members of the public should be increased. The destruction of tapes should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>minimized through technical means and through the imposition of penalties. 
</b></p>
<p>Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 13. Existing data collection efforts regarding killings by law enforcement officers should 
</b></p>
<p>be improved to increase their usefulness in an &#8220;early warning&#8221; and &#8220;hot spot 
</p>
<p>identification&#8221; role.<b>

<p>Sufficient information has not been provided to enable assessment of progress.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. International operations  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Guant&#225;namo Bay detainees 
</b></p>
<p><b> 14. The Military Commissions Act should not be used for capital prosecutions of any 
</b></p>
<p><b>detainees, including those in Guant&#225;namo. Any such prosecutions should meet due 
</b></p>
<p><b>process requirements under international human rights and humanitarian law. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 15. Complete and non-redacted investigations and autopsy results into the deaths of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Guant&#225;namo detainees should be released to family members. 
</b></p>
<p>No information was made available to the Special Rapporteur to assess the implementation 
of this recommendation. 
</p>
<p><b>  Transparency into civilian casualties 
</b></p>
<p><b> 16. The Government should track and publicly disclose all civilian casualties caused by 
</b></p>
<p><b>military or other operations or that occur in the custody of the Government or its 
</b></p>
<p><b>agents. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has been partially implemented through ISAF in Afghanistan.<b> </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>a docket and track cases from investigation through final disposition. The system 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be capable of providing up-to-date statistical information. The registry should 
</b></p>
<p><b>include information on upcoming hearings and copies of the findings of formal and 
</b></p>
<p><b>informal investigations, rulings, pleadings, transcripts of testimony, and exhibits. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Public internet access to the registry should be available, subject only to legal non-
</b></p>
<p><b>disclosure requirements related to national security and individual privacy.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Ensuring comprehensive criminal jurisdiction over offences in armed conflict 
</b></p>
<p><b> 18. </b>The doctrine of &#8220;command responsibility&#8221; as a basis fo<b>r criminal liability should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>codified in the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the War Crimes Act. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 19. Congress should adopt legislation that comprehensively provides criminal jurisdiction 
</b></p>
<p><b>over all private contractors and civilian employees, including those working for 
</b></p>
<p><b>intelligence agencies. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented, although it enjoys the support of the 
Government. In this regard, the Congress is currently considering passing the Civilian 
Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act. 
</p>
<p><b>  Ensuring accountability 
</b></p>
<p><b> 20. A commission of inquiry should be established to conduct an independent, systematic 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sustained investigation of policies and practices that led to deaths and other 
</b></p>
<p><b>abuses in United States operations. The commission should have the mandate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources to conduct a full investigation. Its results and recommendations should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>publicly and widely disseminated, and the Government should publicly respond 
</b></p>
<p><b>thereto. Given the importance of prosecutions, an independent special prosecutor 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be considered and the commission should not undermine the possibility of 
</b></p>
<p><b>eventual prosecution. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 21. Consideration should be given to establishing a Director of Military Prosecutions to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure separation between the chain of command and the prosecution function. 
</b></p>
<p>This recommendation has not been implemented.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 22. An office dedicated to investigation and prosecution of crimes by private contractors, 
</b></p>
<p><b>civilian Government employees, and former military personnel should be established 
</b></p>
<p><b>within the DoJ. The office should receive the resources and investigative support 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessary to handle these cases. The DoJ should make public statistical information 
</b></p>
<p><b>on the status of these cases, disaggregated by the kind, year, and country of alleged

<p><b> 23. Existing reparation programmes should be combined or replaced by a comprehensive 
</b></p>
<p><b>and adequately funded compensation programme for the families of those killed in 
</b></p>
<p><b>United States operations, including by military and intelligence personnel and private 
</b></p>
<p><b>contractors. In missions involving a range of international forces, such as those in 
</b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan and Iraq, the Government should urge allies to implement similar
