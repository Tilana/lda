FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The forward-looking statements are only predictions and provide our current expectations
or  forecasts  of  future  events  and  financial  performance  and  may  be  identified  by  the  use  of
forward-looking terminology, including the terms “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “expects,”
“plans,” “intends,” “may,” “will” or “should” or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or
comparable terminology, though the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a
statement  is  not  forward-looking.  Forward-looking  statements  include  all  matters  that  are  not
historical  facts  and  include,  without  limitation  statements  concerning:  our  business  strategy,
outlook,  objectives,  future  milestones,  plans,  intentions,  goals,  and  future  financial  condition,
including the period of time for which our existing resources will enable us to fund our operations.
We  intend  that  all  forward-looking  statements  be  subject  to  the  safe-harbor  provisions  of  the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to many
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from any future results
expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We caution you therefore against relying
on  any  of  these  forward-looking  statements.  They  are  neither  statements  of  historical  fact  nor
guarantees or assurances of future performance.
The  forward-looking  statements  contained  in  this  Report  or  the  documents  incorporated  by
reference  herein  speak  only  of  their  respective  dates.  Factors  or  events  that  could  cause  our
actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict them
all. Except to the extent required by applicable laws, rules or regulations, we do not undertake
any  obligation  to  publicly  update  any  forward-looking  statements  or  to  publicly  announce
revisions to any of the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.
ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Company Overview
Indie Growers Association ("Indie Growers" or the "Company") was organized under the laws of
the State of Nevada on March 24, 2006 to explore mineral properties in North America. On April
14, 2014 the Company completed its name change from Viking Minerals Inc. to Indie Growers
Association.
The  company  was  originally  organized  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  and  developing  mineral
claims  (SIC  Code:  1000).    On  June  30,  2014,  the  company  acquired  River  Ridge  Sunshine
Farms LLC, a Washington State corporation, and in so doing, changed its business to that of  real
estate  development  for  the  purpose  of  leasing  land  and  agricultural  buildings  to  licensed
cannabis producers (SIC Code: 5319).
Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, raising substantial doubt about our financial
prospects and the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company is attempting
to generate sufficient revenues from rental income as well as raise additional funds by way of a
public or private offering. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase
revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect.
Competition
Currently we are engaged in the business of leasing land and buildings to licensed cannabis
producers in the state of Washington who don’t have the financial resources to purchase land
and build their own greenhouses. There are other public and private companies which compete
with us in this area.  However, we believe that our principal competitive advantage is our location
in Benton County, one of the most fertile regions in the state.
The  recent  growth  in  the  industry,  particularly  in  Washington,  has  attracted  many  businesses
trying to enter the market.  Some of our competitors have greater capital resources and facilities
which may enable them to compete more effectively in this market.  Due to this competition, there
is no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in generating revenues.  If we are unable to
successfully compete with existing companies and new entrants to the market, this will have a
negative impact on our business and financial condition.
4
Employees
On March 31, 2015, the company had three employees: our director, Robert Coleridge, our Chief
Operating Officer, Ricardo Esparza, and Mr. Esparza’s daughter, Natasha Esparza.
Regulatory Considerations
Under  federal  law,  it  is  illegal  to  possess,  use,  buy,  sell,  or  cultivate  marijuana,  since
the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug, claiming it has
a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical use.
In  November  2012,  voters  in  Washington  approved  the  legalization  of  non-medical  use  of
cannabis, however under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, federal law
pre-empts conflicting state laws. Therefore, the company is operating in an industry that walks
the line between what is legal in the state and illegal federally.
The majority of the states across the US have created exemptions for medical cannabis use, as
well  as  decriminalized  non-medical  cannabis  use  and  the  rest  of  the  states  are  expected  to
follow. However, multiple efforts to reschedule cannabis under the federal Controlled Substances
Act have so far been unsuccessful.
Although we are compliant with state and local laws and regulations, we cannot predict what
may happen in the future, especially if federal lawmakers put pressure on the states to amend
their laws.
ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS
As a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide this information.
ITEM 1B - UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
In  March  2015,  we  received  a  letter  from  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  with
comments related to our acquisition of River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC which are summarized
as follows:
1.
We no longer met the criteria of Rule 3-11 of Regulation S-X and, accordingly, audited financial
statements of River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC were required to have been filed 75 days after
the date of the acquisition.
2.
Since  we  no  longer  met  the  criteria  of  Rule  3-11  of  Regulation  S-X,  the  interim  financial
statements included in the Forms 10-Q for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2014, September
30, 2014, and December 31, 2014 were required to be reviewed by an independent accountant.
We  agree  with  above  comments  and  will  make  every  reasonable  effort  to  remedy  the  above
issues within the next 30 to 60 days.
ITEM 2 - PROPERTIES
On June 30, 2014, the Company acquired River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC, a Washington state
corporation in exchange for 62,000,000 shares.  The market value of the Company’s shares on
the  July  15,  2014,  the  date  the  shares  were  issued,  was  $0.68  per  share  thereby  valuing  the
acquisition at $42,160,000.  River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC holds a 10 year lease on a 40
acre property which will be subleased to licensed cannabis producers.  One 3.86 acre parcel has
been subleased by Fourdub LLC, a licensed Tier 3 Producer.
ITEM 3 - LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are not aware of any pending or threatened legal actions to which we are a party or of which
our property is the subject that would,  if  determined  adversely  to  us,  have  a  material  adverse
effect on our business and operations.
We have from time to time been  involved  in  disputes  and  proceedings  arising  in  the  ordinary
course  of  business.  In  addition,  as  a  public  company,  we  are  also  potentially  susceptible  to
litigation, such as claims asserting violations of securities laws. Any such claims, with or without
merit, if not resolved, could be time-consuming and result in costly litigation. There can be no
assurance that an adverse result in any future proceeding would not have a potentially material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Securities Act, we relied upon the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act.
ITEM 6 - SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward-looking statements. See
“Forward-Looking  Statements”  preceding  Item  1  of  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for
additional factors relating to such statements.
You  should  read  the  following  discussion  and  analysis  of  financial  condition  and  results  of
operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing
elsewhere in this Report.
Overview
Indie Growers Association ("Indie Growers" or the "Company") was organized under the laws of
the State of Nevada on March 24, 2006 to explore mineral properties in North America on April
14, 2014 the Company completed its name change from Viking Minerals Inc. to Indie Growers
Association.
The  company  was  originally  organized  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  and  developing  mineral
claims  (SIC  Code:  1000).    On  June  30,  2014,  the  company  acquired  River  Ridge  Sunshine
Farms LLC, a Washington State corporation, and in so doing, changed its business to that of  real
estate  development  for  the  purpose  of  leasing  land  and  agricultural  buildings  to  licensed
cannabis producers (SIC Code: 5319).
Results of Operations
The Year Ended March 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended March 31, 2014
Revenues
The company had originally recorded rental income of $116,982 from a tenant on the property.
  However,  the  payment  of  rent  was  contingent  on  the  tenant  receiving  a  license  from  the
Washington  State  Liquor  and  Cannabis  Control  Board.    The  tenant  was  ultimately  denied  a
license  and  agreed  to  vacate  the  property  before  the  expiration  of  the  ten  year  lease  term.
 Therefore, no revenue has been recorded in either year.
7
Land Lease
The company leases land from our Chief Operating Office for $1000 per month and subleases it
to licensed cannabis growers. For the year ending March 31, 2015, the company had accrued 9
months  of  lease  payments  starting  in  July  2014  as  a  result  of  the  acquisition  of  River  Ridge
Sunshine Farms.  There was no land under lease in the year ending March 31, 2014.
Management Fees
The  Company  incurred  $31,102,182  in  management  fees  in  the  year  ending  March  31,  2015
compared to $96,250 in the prior year.  The majority of the management fees were stock based
so the difference can be attributed to the difference in the market value of the stock based portion
of the fees on the date of issuance as follows:

General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses (“G&A”) were $58,072 and $12,592 for the years ended
March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses
was due to the new business we entered into after the acquisition of our subsidiary, including a
significant construction project.
For the year ended March 31, 2015, our G&A consisted of $5000 of advertising and promotion,
automobile  expenses  of  $5,616,  equipment  rental  of  $2,230,  insurance  of  $2,147,  office
expenses of $2,199, a settlement with our former tenant of $14,000, fees paid to OTC Markets of
$7,500 and numerous other administrative costs.
Interest Expense
During the year ended March 31, 2015, we recorded interest expenses of $450,285 compared to
$76,180 in the prior period. This increase is attributable entirely to the increase in convertible
debt financing received by the company and the beneficial conversion factor of these financings.
Professional Fees
During the year ended March 31, 2015, we incurred professional fees of $24,530 compared to
$23,112 in the prior period. However, we expect this to increase significantly as the company
addresses the comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission summarized earlier in
this report.
Repairs and maintenance
During the year ended March 31, 2015, we incurred repairs and maintenance costs of $13,364
compared to $nil in the prior period. The increase was due to the construction project undertaken
as part of the acquisition of our subsidiary.
Non-operating Expenses
For the year ending March 31, 2015, our non-operating expenses totaled $42,160,000 compared
to $nil in the prior year.  We wrote off $156,212 of a $185,000 investment in Indie Growers Union
LLC as we were only able to recover $28,778 of the funds we had advanced once we cancelled
the acquisition.  In addition, we determined that our acquisition of our subsidiary should be fully
impaired because the acquisition failed to generate any revenue during the year.
8
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  on  a  going  concern  basis  which
assumes we will be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of
business for the foreseeable future. During the year ended March 31, 2015, we incurred losses of
$31,662,216 in our operating activities. As at March 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of
$519,094  and  an  accumulated  deficit  of  $105,091,051.    Our  ability  to  continue  as  a  going
concern  is  dependent  upon  our  ability  to  generate  profitable  operations  in  the  future  and,  or,
obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from
normal business operations when they come due. There is no assurance that these events will
be satisfactorily completed.
Net cash used in operating activities for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, was $97,923
and  $31,250,  respectively.  This  increase  was  primarily  due  to  the  expenses  incurred  in
connection with our new business as a result of the acquisition of our subsidiary in June 2014.
Net  cash  used  in  investing  activities  for  the  years  ended  March  31,  2014  and  2014,  was
$400,308 and $50,000, respectively. This increase was due to an increase in our investment in
Indie  Growers  Union  LLC,  which  was  later  cancelled,  and  the  construction  of  agricultural
buildings by our subsidiary.
Net  cash  provided  by  financing  activities  for  the  years  ended  March  31,  2015  and  2014,  was
$502,699 and $81,350, respectively. The increase was due to financing provided by our director
and Chief Operating Officer as well as increase in financing for convertible debt.   $64,500 of the
convertible debt was offset by stock issuances in the year ended March 31, 2015.
During  the  next  12  months,  we  anticipate  that  we  will  spend  a  minimum  of  $1  million  on  the
construction of greenhouses and other agricultural buildings. We also plan to incur significant
sales and marketing expenses during the next 12 months in order to attract new tenants to our
property.  However, we must obtain additional financing to do so and so far we have been unable
to obtain sufficient funding on terms that are favorable to us. Furthermore, we may not be able to
generate  adequate  revenues  to  operate  profitably  in  the  future.  These  conditions  raise
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires
us  to  make  judgments,  assumptions,  and  estimates  that  affect  the  amounts  reported.  Note  2  -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of our consolidated financial statements describes
the  significant  accounting  policies  used  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial
statements.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
July 14, 2015
Board of Directors
Indie Growers Association
Carson City, NV
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Indie Growers Association
and its subsidiary (collectively, the “Company”) as of March 31, 2015 and 2014 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then
ended.  These  consolidated  financial  statements  are  the  responsibility  of  the  Company’s
management.  Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  these  consolidated  financial
statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit to
obtain  reasonable  assurance  about  whether  the  financial  statements  are  free  of  material
misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of
its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control
over  financial  reporting  as  a  basis  for  designing  audit  procedures  that  are  appropriate  in  the
circumstances,  but  not  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of  the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures
in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  financial  statement  presentation.  We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the  consolidated  financial  position  of  Indie  Growers  Association  and  its  subsidiary  as  of
March 31, 2015 and 2014 and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for
the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America.
The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  assuming  that  the
Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements,  the  Company  has  suffered  recurring  losses  from  operations  and  has  a  significant
accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from
operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The
consolidated  financial  statements  do  not  include  any  adjustments  that  might  result  from  the
outcome of this uncertainty.

INDIE GROWERS ASSOCIATION
(formerly known as VIKING MINERALS, INC.)
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
March 31, 2015
1. ORGANIZATION
The company, Viking Minerals Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the state of Nevada on
March 24, 2006 with 75,000,000 authorized common shares, par value of $0.001 per share. In
January  2011,  the  company  filed  an  amendment  with  the  state  of  Nevada  to  increase  the
authorized shares to 400,000,000 common shares, par value of $0.001 per share.
On April 14, 2014 the Company changed its name to Indie Growers Association and completed a
1:200 reverse stock consolidation.  All share amounts in these consolidated financial statements
have been restated to reflect this stock consolidation.
The  company  was  originally  organized  for  the  purpose  of  acquiring  and  developing  mineral
claims  (SIC  Code:  1000).    On  June  30,  2014,  the  company  acquired  River  Ridge  Sunshine
Farms LLC, a Washington State corporation, and in so doing, changed its business to that of  real
estate  development  for  the  purpose  of  leasing  land  and  agricultural  buildings  to  licensed
cannabis producers (SIC Code: 5319).
These financial statements are presented on the basis that we will continue as a going concern.
The going concern concept contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business.
At March 31, 2015, the Company had a working capital deficit, stockholders’ deficit and operating
losses for the past two years. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern.   While the Company is attempting to generate sufficient
revenues,  the  Company’s  cash  position  may  not  be  enough  to  support  the  Company’s  daily
operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering.
Management believes that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business
plan and generate sufficient revenues provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a
going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to increase revenues
and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company’s ability to further
implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenues.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company
is unable to continue as a going concern.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basic and Diluted Net Loss Per Share
Basic  net  loss  per  share  amounts  are  computed  based  on  the  weighted  average  number  of
shares  outstanding.  Diluted  net  loss  per  share  amounts  are  computed  using  the  weighted
average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding as if shares had been
issued on the exercise of the common share rights unless the exercise becomes anti-dilutive and
then the basic and diluted per share amounts are the same.
Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect certain of the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at  the  date  of  the  financial  statements  and  the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. The Company regularly evaluates
estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts,
historical  experience  and  various  other  factors  it  believes  to  be  reasonable  under  the
circumstances,  the  results  of  which  form  the  basis  for  making  judgments  about  the  carrying
values  of  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  accrual  of  costs  and  expenses  that  are  not  readily
apparent  from  other  sources.  The  actual  results  experienced  by  the  Company  may  differ
materially  and  adversely  from  the  Company's  estimates.  To  the  extent  there  are  material
differences  between  the  estimates  and  the  actual  results,  future  results  of  operations  will  be
affected. The most significant estimates with regard to these financial statements relate to the
carrying values of unproven mineral properties, expected lives of equipment, determination of fair
values of stock based transactions and valuation of deferred income taxes.
F-6
Capital Assets
A Capital Asset is defined as a unit of tangible property that: (1) has an economic useful life of
more than 12 months; and (2) was acquired or produced for a cost of more than $500, including
acquisition and installation costs on the same invoice.
Capital  Assets  are  stated  at  historical  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated
impairment losses.  Subsequent costs are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized
as  a  separate  asset,  as  appropriate,  only  when  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  benefits
associated  with  the  item  will  flow  to  the  Company  and  the  cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured
reliably.  All  repairs  and  maintenance  are  charged  to  the  statement  of  operations  during  the
financial period in which they are incurred.
Gains  and  losses  on  disposals  are  determined  by  comparing  the  proceeds  with  the  carrying
amount and are recognized in the statement of operations.
Depreciation of capital assets is computed as follows:
Furniture and fixtures
Computer equipment
Buildings and infrastructure
Leasehold Improvements
7 year straight line
5 year straight line
30 year straight line
Straight line over the term of lease
Impairment of Long-lived Assets
The Company reviews and evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  The assets
are  subject  to  impairment  consideration  under  ASC  360-10-35-17  if  events  or  circumstances
indicate that their carrying amounts might not be recoverable.   When the Company determines
that an impairment analysis should be done, the analysis will be performed using rules of ASC
930-360-35, Asset Impairment, and 360-10-15-3 through 15-5, Impairment or Disposal of Long-
Lived Assets.
Investments
Investments  in  companies  that  are  not  consolidated,  but  over  which  the  Company  exercises
significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Whether or not the
Company exercises significant influence with respect to an investee depends on an evaluation of
several  factors,  including,  among  others,  ownership  level.  Under  the  equity  method  of
accounting,  an  investee  company’s  accounts  are  not  reflected  within  the  Company’s  Balance
Sheets and Statements of Operations; however, the Company’s share of the earnings or losses
of  the  investee  company  is  reflected  in  the  Company’s  statements  of  operations  and  the
Company’s carrying value in an equity method investee company is reflected in the Company’s
balance sheets. The Company evaluates these investments for other-than-temporary declines in
value each quarterly period. Any impairment found to be other than temporary would be recorded
through a charge to earnings.
Revenue Recognition
Revenue is recognized when all applicable recognition criteria have been met, which generally
include  (a)  persuasive  evidence  of  an  existing  arrangement;  (b)  fixed  or  determinable  price;
(c)  delivery  has  occurred  or  service  has  been  rendered;  and  (d)  collectability  is  reasonably
assured.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The estimated fair values for financial instruments are determined at discrete points in time based
on relevant market information. These estimates involve uncertainties and cannot be determined
with precision. The estimated fair value of cash, trade payables, and loans approximates their
carrying value due to their short-term nature.
Income Taxes
The  Company  utilizes  the  liability  method  of  accounting  for  income  taxes.  Under  the  liability
method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates  and  laws  that  will  be  in  effect,  when  the  differences  are  expected  to  be  reversed.  An
allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded, when it is more likely than not, that such tax
benefits will not be realized.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
On  June  10,  2014,  The  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain
Financial  Reporting  Requirements,  Including  an  Amendment  to  Variable  Interest  Entities
Guidance  in  Topic  810,  consolidation,  which  removes  all  incremental  financial  reporting
requirements from GAAP for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from
the  FASB  Accounting  Standards  Codification.  For  the  first  annual  period  beginning  after
December 15, 2014, the presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be
required for the public business entities. The revised consolidation standards are effective one
year later, in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The
Company has adopted the amendment as of fiscal year ended March 31, 2015.
There  are  several  new  accounting  pronouncements  issued  by  the  Financial  Accounting
Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  which  are  not  yet  effective.  Each  of  these  pronouncements,  as
applicable, has been or will be adopted by the Company. As of March 31, 2015, none of these
pronouncements  is  expected  to  have  a  material  effect  on  the  financial  position,  results  of
operations or cash flows of the Company.
3. ACQUISITION OF A PROPERTY
On April 8, 2014, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with the unit holders of
Indie  Growers  Union  LLC  of  Washington  state  wherein  the  Company  would  issue  a  total  of
87,500,000 shares of common stock and $185,000 cash in exchange for all of the outstanding
member units and assets of Indie Growers Union LLC.   The company advanced $185,000 but
cancelled  the  agreement  prior  to  issuing  the  shares.    The  company  recovered  $28,788  of  the
$185,000 cash and has recorded an investment loss of $(156,212) in the consolidated statement
of operations.
On June 30, 2014, the Company acquired River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC, a Washington state
corporation in exchange for 62,000,000 shares.  The market value of the Company’s shares on
the  July  15,  2014,  the  date  the  shares  were  issued,  was  $0.68  per  share  thereby  valuing  the
acquisition at $42,160,000.  River Ridge Sunshine Farms LLC holds a 10 year lease on a 40
acre property which will be subleased to licensed cannabis producers.  However, no revenue
was generated from leases in the year ended March 31, 2015 so the company has determined
that the value of this acquisition should be fully impaired.  The impairment of goodwill has been
recorded in the consolidated statement of operations.

shares were issued, was $2.35 per share thereby valuing the management fees at $49,350,000.
  However,  on  December  28,  2014,  one  of  the  directors  resigned  and  relinquished  his  title  to
7,777,778 of the shares.  The net effect of $31,072,222 has been recorded as management fees
in the consolidated statements of operations for this transaction.
On  May  14,  2014,  the  company  issued  2,000,000  shares  of  its  common  stock  for  $2,000  of

6. SIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES
On May 2, 2014, the company issued 21,000,000 shares of its common stock for services to two
of our directors. The market value of the Company’s shares on the May 2, 2014, the date the
shares were issued, was $2.35 per share thereby valuing the management fees at $49,350,000.
  However,  on  December  28,  2014,  one  of  the  directors  resigned  and  relinquished  his  title  to
7,777,778 of the shares.  The shares are subject to a lock-up agreement until July 1, 2016.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, the company received advances from one of our directors
and our Chief Operating Officer of $70,390 ($nil at March 31, 2014).  The advances have no set
repayment terms and do not bear interest.
During the year ended March 31, 2015, the company incurred land lease costs of $9,000 payable
to our Chief Operating Officer.
7. RENTAL INCOME
During the year ended March 31, 2015, the company booked $116,982 in rental income from a
tenant on the property.  The payment of rent was contingent on the tenant receiving a license
from the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Control Board.  However, the tenant was denied
a  license  and  agreed  to  vacate  the  property  before  the  expiration  of  his  lease  for  a  one-time
settlement  fee  of  $14,000.    The  settlement  fee  was  recorded  in  General  and  administrative
expenses on the consolidated statement of operations and the revenue was written off.
8. VENDOR INCENTIVE
In  December  2013,  the  Company’s  current  transfer  agent  paid  off  the  outstanding  balance  of
$5,717 owed to the former transfer agent.  This has been recorded as a deferred vendor incentive
on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  It  has  been  amortized  on  a  straight  line  basis  over  the
contract  term  of  5  years  such  that  each  year’s  portion  of  the  incentive  will  be  offset  against
transfer agent fees in the consolidated statement of operations.
9.
INCOME TAXES
For the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company has incurred net losses from operations and,
therefore, has no tax liability. The net deferred tax asset generated by the loss carry-forward has
been fully reserved.
The provision for Federal income tax at the expected rate of 34% consists of the following:

Current operations

The  cumulative  tax  effect  at  the  expected  rate  of  34%  of  significant  items  comprising  our  net
deferred tax amount is as follows:

As  the  criteria  for  recognizing  deferred  income  tax  assets  have  not  been  met  due  to  the
uncertainty of realization, a valuation allowance of 100% has been recorded for the current and
prior year.

10. CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES
As of March 31, 2015, the Company had accumulated $ 443,754 in convertible promissory notes
($75,945 at March 31, 2014).  The notes due on demand, bear interest at 5%, are unsecured, and
are convertible at $0.001.
The Company assessed the conversion option and determined that during the period the note
had  a  beneficial  conversion  feature  with  intrinsic  values  in  excess  of  the  debt.  Therefore,  the
Company fully amortized a conversion benefit of $432,309 for the current period and recorded is
as an interest expense as of March 31, 2015.
The amount of accrued interest payable on these notes was $17,429 as of March 31, 2015 and is
included in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities.
If  the  balance  outstanding  was  converted  into  common  shares,  the  amount  of  shares  to  be
issued  would  be  443,754,000  common  shares.    The  weighted  average  number  of  shares
outstanding  has  been  computed  as  if  these  shares  were  issued  on  the  date  the  funds  were
advanced to the Company as follows:

ITEM 9 - CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING
AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE
On January 20, 2015, Sadler Gibb & Associates, LLC (“Sadler Gibb”) resigned as the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm.  Sadler Gibb had not issued any audit reports on
the Company’s financial statements and there were no disagreements with Sadler Gibb on any
matter of accounting principles or practices.
On April 22, 2015 the Company engaged BF Borgers CPA PC of Lakewood, Colorado, as its
principal accountant to audit the Company's financial statements.
ITEM 9A - CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be
disclosed  in  the  reports  filed  or  submitted  under  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,
processed,  summarized  and  reported,  within  the  time  period  specified  in  the  SEC  rules  and
forms,  and  that  such  information  is  accumulated  and  communicated  to  management,  as
appropriate,  to  allow  timely  decisions  regarding  required  disclosures.  Our  management
necessarily  applied  its  judgment  in  assessing  the  costs  and  benefits  of  such  controls  and
procedures,  which,  by  their  nature,  can  provide  only  reasonable  assurance  regarding
management's control objectives.
Our  management  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  design  and  operation  of  our  disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based upon
this evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective  as  of  March  31,  2015,  because  of  the  identification  of  a  material  weakness  in  our
internal control over financial reporting which is described below. We intend to continue to review
and  document  our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  including  our  internal  controls  over
financial  reporting,  and  may  from  time  to  time  make  changes  aimed  at  enhancing  their
effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over
financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain
to  the  maintenance  of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly  reflect  the
transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with  U.S.
GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of  our  management;  and  (iii)  provide  reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of
March 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the  Treadway  Commission  in  their Internal  Control-Integrated
Framework. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that that our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective as of March 31, 2015.
Our  CEO  concluded  we  have  a  material  weakness  due  to:  (i)  lack  of  a  functioning  audit
committee; (ii) lack of outside directors on our board of directors; (iii) ineffective oversight in the
establishment  and  monitoring  of  required  internal  controls  and  procedures;  (iv)  inadequate
segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (v) ineffective controls over period
end  financial  disclosure  and  reporting  processes.  A  material  weakness  is  a  deficiency,  or  a
combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
While we would like to segregate duties as much as practicable, there is an insufficient resources
at  this  point  in  time  to  justify  accounting  staff.  We  believe  that  this  is  typical  in  many  start-up
companies. We may not be able to fully remediate our material weaknesses until we increase our
operations at which time we would expect to hire more staff and consider increasing the number
of  directors  on  our  board.  We  will  continue  to  monitor  and  assess  the  costs  and  benefits  of
additional staffing.
10
Notwithstanding the identified material weaknesses, our management believes the consolidated
financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly represent in all material
respects  our  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  at  and  for  the  periods
presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm
regarding  internal  control  over  financial  reporting.  Management's  report  was  not  subject  to
attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to the SEC rules that permit us to
provide only management's report in this Annual Report.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
year  ended  March  31,  2015,  that  has  materially  affected,  or  is  reasonably  likely  to  materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Limitations on Controls and Procedures
Because  of  its  inherent  limitations,  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  may  not  prevent  or
detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent
limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of
effectiveness  to  future  periods  are  subject  to  the  risk  that  controls  may  become  inadequate
because  of  changes  in  conditions,  or  that  the  degree  of  compliance  with  the  policies  or
procedures may deteriorate.

Employment Agreements
We  currently  do  not  have  any  employment  agreements  with  any  of  our  directors  or  executive
officers.
Family Relationships
Natasha Esparza is the daughter of our Chief Operating Officer and his executive assistant.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
To  our  knowledge,  our  directors  and  executive  officers  have  not  been  involved  in  any  of  the
following events during the past ten years:
·
Any bankruptcy petition filed by or against such person or any business of which such person
was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years
prior to that time;
·
Any  conviction  in  a  criminal  proceeding  or  being  subject  to  a  pending  criminal  proceeding
(excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);
·
Being  subject  to  any  order,  judgment,  or  decree,  not  subsequently  reversed,  suspended  or
vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining him from or
otherwise limiting his involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities or to be
associated with any person practicing in banking or securities activities;
12
·
Being  found  by  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction  in  a  civil  action,  the  SEC  or  the  Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to have violated a Federal or state securities or commodities law,
and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated;
·
Being  subject  of,  or  a  party  to,  any  Federal  or  state  judicial  or  administrative  order,  judgment
decree,  or  finding,  not  subsequently  reversed,  suspended  or  vacated,  relating  to  an  alleged
violation of any Federal or state securities or commodities law or regulation, any law or regulation

vacated, of any self-regulatory organization, any registered entity or any equivalent exchange,
association,  entity  or  organization  that  has  disciplinary  authority  over  its  members  or  persons
associated with a member.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance.
Section  16(a)  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934  requires  that  our  executive  officers  and
directors,  and  persons  who  own  more  than  ten  percent  of  a  registered  class  of  our  equity
securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers,
directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish us
with  all  Section  16(a)  forms  they  file.  Based  solely  on  our  review  of  the  copies  of  the  forms
received  by  us  and  written  representations  from  certain  reporting  persons  that  they  have
complied with the relevant filing requirements, we believe that, during the year ended March 31,
2015, all of our executive officers, directors and greater-than-ten percent stockholders complied
with all Section 16(a) filing requirements.
Stockholder Communications
Our  board  has  determined  not  to  adopt  a  formal  methodology  for  communications  from
stockholders on the belief that any communication would be brought to the board’s attention by
each of our executive officers.
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert
We  do  not  currently  have  an  audit  committee  or  a  committee  performing  similar  functions.
Management  as  a  whole  participates  in  the  review  of  financial  statements  and  disclosure.
However, none of our management is a financial expert.

Outstanding Equity Awards
We had no outstanding equity awards as of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2015 or 2014.

As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any new employment agreements.
Employee Pension, Profit Sharing or other Retirement Plans
We do not have a defined benefit, pension plan, profit sharing or other retirement plan, although
we may adopt one or more of such plans in the future.
Risk Assessment in Compensation Programs
Beginning  in  2nd  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2014  we  changed  our  focus  to  serving  the  cannabis
industry  and  we  began  paying  compensation  to  our  employees,  including  executive  and  non-
executive officers. Due to the size and scope of our business, and the amount of compensation
involved,  we  do  not  have  any  employee  compensation  policies  and  programs  to  review  to
determine whether our policies and programs create risks that are reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect on us.

ITEM 12 - SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS
The following table shows the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 31, 2015,
by (i) each person whom we know beneficially owns more than 5% of the outstanding shares of
our common stock; (ii) each of our executive officers; (iii) each of our directors; and (iv) all of our
executive officers and directors as a group.  Unless otherwise indicated, to our knowledge each
of  the  stockholders  listed  below  has  sole  voting  and  investment  power  over  the  shares
beneficially  owned.  Unless  otherwise  specified,  the  address  of  each  of  the  persons  set  forth
below is in care of Indie Growers Association, 311 Division St. Carson City, NV 89703.
The percentage of class beneficially owned is based on 140,881,967 shares of common stock
issued  and  outstanding  as  of  March  31,  2015.  Beneficial  ownership  has  been  determined  in
accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, shares of
common stock which an individual or group has a right to acquire within 60 days pursuant to the
exercise  of  options  or  warrants  or  the  conversion  of  convertible  securities  are  deemed  to  be
outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such individual or group,
but are not deemed to be beneficially owned and outstanding for the purpose of computing the
percentage ownership of any other person shown in the table.
