<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. Foreign Minister of Bangladesh Dr. Dipu Moni, MP, started her presentation by 
expressing profound sadness at heavy loss of lives at collapse of a building in Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p>6. She said that the Grand Alliance Government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina 
focused on building a robust normative and institutional framework during the last four 
years to ensure that all citizens enjoyed all human rights as guaranteed in the Constitution. 
She highlighted the 15th Amendment to the Constitution that restored the Fundamental 
Principles of State Policy for building a democratic, secular and socially just and inclusive 
Bangladesh. She underlined the measures taken to enhance the independence and 
effectiveness of the National Election Commission to hold free, fair and impartial national 
elections. The Foreign Minister informed that in the last four years the Parliament enacted 
196 legislations, related to human rights one way or other, and ensured the function of its 
Standing Committees as effective bipartisan watchdogs. She also enumerated the steps 
taken to ensure the independence of judiciary and enhance the functional independence, 
effectiveness and credibility of the National Human Rights Commission, Anti-Corruption 
Commission and Information Commission. 
</p>
<p>7. The Foreign Minister reaffirmed her Government&#8217;s unequivocal stand on &#8220;zero 
tolerance&#8221; against human rights violation by the law enforcement agencies as well as on 
their impunity. She said that any incident of death during exchange of fire between law </p>


<p>enforcement agencies and criminals is duly investigated as per existing laws and Codes of 
Conduct. She expressed concern over the rising trend of abduction under false 
personification of the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) and said that more than 540 such 
criminals had already been arrested. She reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment to end 
the culture of impunity and recounted the initiatives taken to conclude the trials of the self-
proclaimed killers of the country&#8217;s founding President and members of his family, and to 
hold the ongoing trials of the local perpetrators who committed crimes against humanity 
and genocide during the 1971 War of Liberation through domestic tribunals, pursuing the 
principle of complementarity under the Rome Statute. The Foreign Minister also reiterated 
her Government&#8217;s commitment to build a secular society and not to countenance any threat 
</p>
<p>and attacks against the country&#8217;s religious minorities such as the attacks on Buddhists in 
Ramu the previous year or the recent attacks against the Hindu community. She highlighted 
the Constitutional recognition given to the country&#8217;s ethnic groups and tribal communities 
</p>
<p>through the 15th Amendment and the measures taken to implement some of the critical 
issues under the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accords<b> </b>(CHT). 
</p>
<p>8. The Minister highlighted the role of the National Women Development Policy, 2011 
in advancing women&#8217;s empowerment and the stringent laws on domestic violence 
prevention, anti-trafficking and pornography control to combat violence against women. 
She underlined the Government&#8217;s success in reducing child and infant mortality and current 
</p>
<p>focus on increasing retention rate in schools, combating malnutrition and stunting, and 
eliminating child labour from hazardous sectors. The Foreign Minister referred to the 
National Labour Policy and the recent amendments to the Labour Act of 2006 to ensure 
better workplace safety and collective bargaining for workers. She also raised the human 
rights concerns of migrant workers and flagged the Expatriates Welfare Act, 2013 to 
promote their rights and well-being. The Foreign Minister elaborated on the concrete 
measures taken by her Government to protect the rights of the vulnerable and marginalized 
groups in society, including persons with disabilities and refugees, among others. 
</p>
<p>9. The Minister underscored the impact of poverty on people&#8217;s full enjoyment of 
human rights and reaffirmed the Government&#8217;s commitment to the Right to Development 
as an essential precondition for human rights. She enumerated the positive strides made 
during the last four years to reduce poverty by 10 per cent, enhance food security, improve 
public health through community clinics, and increase investment in the education and 
information technology (IT) sectors. The Minister also underlined Bangladesh&#8217;s challenges 
as a climate-vulnerable country and mentioned the Human Rights Council Resolution 
steered by Bangladesh and the Philippines in 2012 on Climate Change and Human Rights 
in the context of climate justice. She also appreciated the role of civil society and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) in complementing the Government&#8217;s development 
efforts and the media&#8217;s contribution to expanding democratic space for citizens&#8217; 
</p>
<p>participation. The Minister said her Government would continue to promote human rights 
education and awareness to ingrain a culture of human rights in society. Finally, she said 
that during the review period the Government had laid the groundwork for change that

</p>
<p>61. The Minister appreciated the acknowledgment of her Government&#8217;s achievements 
and development model by States while also recognizing the challenges and limitations. 
</p>
<p>62. The Minister responded that children under 18 years of age were outside the 
jurisdiction of the death penalty. The draft National Children Act addressed the issue of 
minimum age for criminal responsibility. She said the death penalty was not unique to 
Bangladesh and its application was restricted to the most serious and heinous crimes under 
due legal process and judicial safeguards. Bangladesh maintained an extremely low rate of 
death sentences, and with provision for parole. 
</p>
<p>63. The Minister reiterated that extrajudicial killing was not permitted by law and as per 
Penal Code, LEAs could resort to use of force or firearms only for self-defence and 
protection of public life and property. She said LEAs had to justify use of force or firearms 
as the means of last resort. She reported that the number of deaths during exchange of fire 
had been reduced by a large margin to 177 during 2009&#8211;2012 from 546 during the 
preceding five years, and that such deaths were only 0.34 per cent of total number of 
arrests. 
</p>
<p>64. The Minister said there was no scope for impunity for LEAs under Bangladeshi laws 
and the Codes of Conduct and Rules of Engagement of the concerned LEAs. Any incident 
of human rights violation or use of excessive or firearms was subject to investigation, 
prosecution, legal and disciplinary actions. The Minister reported that 1,678 Rapid Action 
Battalion (RAB) members had so far been subjected to prosecution and conviction, 
including imprisonment and dismissal. </p>


<p>65. The Minister said allegation of torture and ill-treatment needed to be substantiated 
with evidence. Police Regulation of Bengal, 1912 provided a number of safeguards for 
protection to inmates and prisoners from torture in custody. In case of any proof of torture 
through legal proceedings, stern departmental action was taken against those responsible. 
The Minister sought support from development partners to ongoing police reforms for an 
organizational shift towards a consultative and service-oriented policing where scope for 
ill-treatment or malpractice would be minimized. 
</p>
<p>66. The Minister disagreed with the suggestion that enforced disappearance was 
frequently used by LEAs and clarified that the term did not exist in Bangladeshi laws, 
which recognized kidnapping or abduction as cognizable offences. She underlined that the 
association of LEAs or State machinery with such criminal acts was deliberately done to 
undermine their credibility and create misperception in the public mind. 
</p>
<p>67. The Minister said the Government had rescinded rules and regulations that were 
considered to have impeded freedom of press and has withdrawn the provision of arrest for 
defamation from the Code of Criminal Procedure. The Government had ensured that all 
reported cases of violence against journalists were followed through with investigation and 
prosecution, and some had been brought to closure. 
</p>
<p>68. The Minister said that the Government championed the motto: Each unto his or her 
own religion, but the State belongs to all. She invited the Venerable Mahathero of Seema 
Bihar, Ramu to say a few words, who spoke on peace and communal harmony in the 
country. 
</p>
<p>69. The Minister informed that, in view of recent accidents in the ready-made garments 
(RMG) sector, the Government had, <i>inter alia,</i> started developing a National Occupational 
Safety and Health Policy, formed a Cabinet Committee on the RMG sector and was 
preparing ground for implementing Better Work Programme with the International Labour 
Organization (ILO). 
</p>
<p>70. She said that Bangladesh maintained its cooperation with the Special Procedure 
mechanisms and had confirmed dates for visits by three mandate holders later this year.  On 
repealing Article 377 of Penal Code, the Minister underscored that laws in the country 
should be in harmony with social and religious mores, and that the Government did not 
condone discrimination against any individual on any pretext. 
</p>
<p>71. The Minister said that the draft National Children Act, 2012 would internalize CRC 
provisions. 
</p>
<p>72. She briefed the meeting about women&#8217;s enhanced political empowerment, 
entrepreneurship and economic entitlements, including gender-sensitive labour laws and 
maternity benefits. She discussed six new laws to combat violence against women and steps 
taken to prevent sexual harassment and acid-related violence. 
</p>
<p>73. Australia was concerned at the losses of life, injuries and damages to religious sites 
and property in the most recent confrontations. It called on the Government to continue to 
allow provision of essential humanitarian assistance to Rohingya refugees. 
</p>
<p>74. Austria commended the Rome Statute ratification in 2010 and the adoption of the 
2011 National Women&#8217;s Advancement Development Policy. It welcomed the juvenile 
courts establishment. 
</p>
<p>75. Azerbaijan highlighted the country&#8217;s accession to the International Convention on 
the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families 
(ICRMW) and the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crimes, 
and others. </p>


<p>76. Belarus underlined the active interaction with the Human Rights Council Special 
Procedures. It welcomed the Government&#8217;s commitment to fight human trafficking. 
</p>
<p>77. Bahrain commended Bangladesh on adopting legislation and a National Action Plan 
to combat trafficking in persons and on implementing a health, population and nutrition 
development programme. It noted that Bangladesh was on track to meet MDG-4. 
</p>
<p>78. Benin noted, among others, adoption of several laws and regulatory texts in the field 
of human rights and the rights of women and children. Benin encouraged Bangladesh to 
continue action in the framework of fight against impunity and corruption, money 
laundering and abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p>79. Bhutan noted the establishment of numerous domestic legislative frameworks and 
institutional mechanisms to enhance the protection of rights of the most vulnerable such as 
women, children, persons with disabilities and minorities. 
</p>

elimination of child labour, education, the development of women and for building wells 
free from arsenic throughout the country. 
</p>

protection of human rights against many challenges and despite resources constraints. It

</p>
<p>84. Burundi congratulated Bangladesh on (a) the establishment of a National Human

making public positions. It urged Bangladesh to eliminate child labour.
