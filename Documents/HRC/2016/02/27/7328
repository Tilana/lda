<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
</p>
<p>with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its twenty-first session 
</p>
<p>from 19 to 30 January 2015. The review of Guinea-Bissau was held at the 9th meeting, on 
</p>
<p>23 January 2015. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau was headed by Jos&#233; Ant&#243;nio da Silva 
</p>
<p>Gon&#231;alves, Adviser to the Minister of Justice on Strategic Planning. At its 14th meeting, 
</p>
<p>held on 27 January 2015, the Working Group adopted the report on Guinea-Bissau. 
</p>
<p>2. On 13 January 2015, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
</p>
<p>rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Guinea-Bissau: Botswana, Estonia and 
</p>
<p>Kazakhstan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1 and paragraph 5 of 
</p>
<p>the annex to resolution 16/21, the following documents were issued for the review of 
</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau:

</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
</p>
<p>(A/HRC/WG.6/21/GNB/3). 
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom 
</p>
<p>of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was transmitted to Guinea-Bissau through the troika. 
</p>
<p>Those questions are available on the extranet of the universal periodic review (UPR). 
</p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau recalled that, after the previous Universal Periodic 
</p>
<p>Review in 2010, Guinea-Bissau had undergone a further setback on the road to 
</p>
<p>consolidating democracy, the rule of law, human rights and development when, in 2012, the 
</p>
<p>constitutionally elected Government had once again been overthrown by the military.  
</p>
<p>6. For two long years, the international isolation suffered by Guinea-Bissau and the 
</p>
<p>political crisis that had ensued had adversely affected the socioeconomic status of the 
</p>
<p>population and had led to the resurgence of some deplorable cases of human rights 
</p>
<p>violations. 
</p>
<p>7. It was in that difficult climate, characterized by insecurity, that general elections had 
</p>
<p>been held during the first half of 2014, thanks to the commitment of the international 
</p>
<p>community, in particular the United Nations, the European Union, the Economic 
</p>
<p>Community of West African States and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries. 
</p>
<p>The objectives of a return to the normal functioning of democratic institutions had thus 
</p>
<p>been set within the framework of a political dialogue, which had led to the establishment of 
</p>
<p>an inclusive and representative Government. 
</p>
<p>8. With respect to the implementation of recommendations issued in the course of the 
</p>
<p>first UPR cycle, Guinea-Bissau had made great efforts and had succeeded in implementing </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.15-07685 
</p>
<p>a significant number of the recommendations. Some of the actions were still in the process 
</p>
<p>of being implemented, in particular in the areas of defence, security, justice and public 
</p>
<p>administration; their implementation depended not only on political will but also on a 
</p>
<p>strong commitment on the part of the international community. 
</p>
<p>9. In that context and despite the constraints inherent in the current management of the 
</p>
<p>country arising from its adverse economic situation in both economic and financial terms, 
</p>
<p>government leaders at the highest level had extended their subregional and international 
</p>
<p>contacts in order to ensure the success of the round table to mobilize resources for the 
</p>
<p>implementation of the development programme, which was to be held shortly with 
</p>
<p>international partners. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to the recommendations that had already been implemented, the 
</p>
<p>delegation of Guinea-Bissau drew attention to the creation of a Gender Affairs Department 
</p>
<p>at the Ministry of the Interior, the creation of special units for vulnerable persons in the 
</p>
<p>judicial police force, the creation of centres for access to justice with funds to support the 
</p>
<p>victims of violence, through the Ministry of Justice, as part of reforms in the areas of 
</p>
<p>defence, security and justice, in order to provide legal assistance to the most vulnerable.  
</p>
<p>11. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau also drew attention to the approval by the Council 
</p>
<p>of Ministers, in 2011, of the bill on the protection of witnesses, which aimed to provide 
</p>
<p>more security for witnesses of human rights violations, including those committed against 
</p>
<p>women. Lastly, the delegation noted the drafting, in 2013, of the strategic plan for the 
</p>
<p>elimination of gender-based violence. The delegation also referred to the recent adoption of 
</p>
<p>the Act on female genital mutilation, the Act against trafficking in persons, in particular 
</p>
<p>women and children, the Act against domestic violence, and the adoption of measures to 
</p>
<p>assist the most vulnerable, including women and children, such as the hiring of social 
</p>
<p>service professionals, sociologists and other persons in order to provide assistance in court 
</p>
<p>proceedings.  
</p>
<p>12. Responding to previous questions, Guinea-Bissau indicated, with respect to the 
</p>
<p>promotion of and respect for sexual orientation and gender identity, that until that time the 
</p>
<p>issue had not been the subject of public debate as it had not yet become important enough 
</p>
<p>to be made a priority in the national legislative agenda. The country faced many other 
</p>
<p>issues requiring urgent attention. The question was of course a matter of concern for the 
</p>
<p>country but, for the time being, it had to give way to other human rights issues. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, Guinea-Bissau could not take steps actually to decriminalize homosexual 
</p>
<p>relations since such relations were not criminalized under the law. The Constitution 
</p>
<p>guaranteed that all persons were equal. 
</p>
<p>13. The delegation also said that one of the important steps taken to promote the 
</p>
<p>participation of women in political life and gender equality in decision-making in political 
</p>
<p>life was the adoption of the national action plan on gender equality and equity, as well as 
</p>
<p>the appointment of women to senior posts in the current Government, in particular the 
</p>
<p>Minister for Defence, the Minister of Education, the Minister for Justice, the Minister for 
</p>
<p>Women, the Family and Social Cohesion, the Health Minister, the Secretary of State for the 
</p>
<p>Budget, and the Director General of the Judicial Police, besides the increase in the number 
</p>
<p>and responsibilities of female members of parliament in the People&#8217;s National Assembly.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>14. During the interactive dialogue, 59 delegations made statements. Recommendations 
</p>
<p>made during the dialogue are to be found in section II of the present report. 
</p>
<p>15. Uruguay highlighted the signature and/or ratification of various international 
</p>
<p>instruments and the standing invitation to special procedures mandate holders. It urged </p>


<p>GE.15-07685 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau to launch the necessary reforms to achieve political stability, and to allocate 
</p>
<p>the necessary human and financial resources to the national human rights commission so 
</p>
<p>that it can effectively and independently carry out its mandate. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>16. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela appreciated efforts made by Guinea-Bissau to 
</p>
<p>comply with the recommendations that it had already received. It noted that, despite 
</p>
<p>constraints, Guinea-Bissau had made progress in the area of human rights, citing the 
</p>
<p>national action plan on gender equality and equity, the Domestic Violence Act, and free 
</p>
<p>access to health-care services for certain vulnerable groups. It stated that the international 
</p>
<p>community should offer its cooperation and technical assistance in order to enable the 
</p>
<p>country to continue its progress. It made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>17. Algeria indicated that, despite the particularly difficult context faced, Guinea-Bissau 
</p>
<p>had engaged in praiseworthy institutional and legislative reforms to improve the human 
</p>
<p>rights situation. Additionally, the country had acceded to a number of international and 
</p>
<p>regional human rights instruments. Algeria welcomed the efforts to promote economic, 
</p>
<p>social and cultural rights, through the adoption of policies and programmes on health, 
</p>
<p>education and poverty reduction, and strategies aimed at reforming the justice and 
</p>
<p>penitentiary systems. It encouraged Guinea-Bissau to continue efforts to combat violence 
</p>
<p>against women and, particularly, female genital mutilation. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>18. Angola noted efforts by Guinea-Bissau to return to constitutional order, indicating 
</p>
<p>that this would allow the Government to promote measures to improve human rights 
</p>
<p>protection. It welcomed Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s accession to most international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments, as well as the actions adopted for the stability of national institutions, the 
</p>
<p>access to justice, health care and social and economic rights, and the cooperation with 
</p>
<p>human rights mechanisms, particularly the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and 
</p>
<p>human rights. It urged the international community to continue supporting Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>efforts. Angola made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>19. Argentina welcomed the delegation and the presentation of the national report. It had 
</p>
<p>followed with concern the political, security and human rights situation in Guinea-Bissau, 
</p>
<p>as outlined in Security Council resolution 2186. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>20. Australia congratulated Guinea-Bissau on the progress made since the first review, 
</p>
<p>which had included the adoption of the Domestic Violence Act and legislation on human 
</p>
<p>trafficking. It commended the free elections held in 2014, the ratification of the Second 
</p>
<p>Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the 
</p>
<p>abolition of the death penalty, and the actions taken to reform the defence, security and 
</p>
<p>justice sectors. It also welcomed the criminalization of female genital mutilation but was 
</p>
<p>concerned at reports that the practice was increasing. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. Botswana noted efforts to implement previous recommendations, in particular the 
</p>
<p>adoption of laws aimed at the protection of human rights, which had included the 
</p>
<p>criminalization of female genital mutilation, human trafficking and domestic violence. It 
</p>
<p>commended the strengthening of the justice, defence and security sectors. It noted that the 
</p>
<p>political and economic instability made it difficult for Guinea-Bissau to undertake 
</p>
<p>programmes and policies aimed at protecting human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>22. Brazil welcomed the recent positive developments in different fields of human rights 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection, despite challenges related to the attainment of economic and 
</p>
<p>social rights and civil and political rights. It emphasized that the recent elections had 
</p>
<p>represented a significant step forward, and called upon the Government to continue its 
</p>
<p>efforts towards the consolidation of democratic institutions in the country. Brazil noted 
</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s respect for diversity. It made recommendations. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.15-07685 
</p>
<p>23. Cabo Verde noted the multiple challenges faced by Guinea-Bissau and welcomed 
</p>
<p>the recent emergence of favourable political conditions for the promotion of human rights. 
</p>
<p>It highlighted existing constraints, such as the limited institutional, financial and 
</p>
<p>administrative capacity to develop, negotiate and implement the necessary reforms. It was 
</p>
<p>encouraged by the determination and realism that the new Government had shown, as 
</p>
<p>demonstrated by the actions that had been planned or were being developed. It appealed to 
</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s international partners to provide it with additional support. It made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>24. Canada welcomed the 2014 elections in Guinea-Bissau, which had marked an 
</p>
<p>important step in the country&#8217;s return to democratic government and in its protection of the 
</p>
<p>human rights of the people. It welcomed the country&#8217;s agreement in 2010 to revise the 
</p>
<p>provisions of its legislation prohibiting female genital mutilation, and the promulgation in 
</p>
<p>2011 of a law to that effect, and asked Guinea-Bissau to provide information on the 
</p>
<p>progress made in implementing the law and eradicating that scourge. It made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>25. Chile noted the progress since the first review, namely the ratification of human 
</p>
<p>rights instruments, and the implementation of new laws and programmes, including the 
</p>
<p>reform of the judiciary, the criminalization of female genital mutilation, and the enactment 
</p>
<p>of legislation on domestic violence and reproductive health. It urged Guinea-Bissau to 
</p>
<p>continue that process, with the support of the international community. It made 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>26. China appreciated the ratification of several treaties, the increased investment in the 
</p>
<p>public sector, including on education, health and public services, the enhancement of the 
</p>
<p>role of women in politics, the fight against existing prejudices and stereotypes against 
</p>
<p>women and children, and the implementation of national plans on poverty alleviation and 
</p>
<p>education. China called upon the international community to provide Guinea-Bissau with 
</p>
<p>technical assistance. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Costa Rica noted the ratification of international instruments and urged Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau to align its national legislation with international law and to ensure its effective 
</p>
<p>implementation. It congratulated Guinea-Bissau on the 2014 election process and expressed 
</p>
<p>the hope that this would mark the definitive return of the country to democracy. It noted 
</p>
<p>progress on gender equality and encouraged Guinea-Bissau to continue its efforts to ensure 
</p>
<p>greater inclusion of women in all spheres of society, particularly in public and political life. 
</p>
<p>It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>28. Cuba acknowledged the commitment of Guinea-Bissau to human rights, despite the 
</p>
<p>many challenges faced. It indicated that the reforms undertaken of the justice, defence and 
</p>
<p>security sectors were important steps in implementing certain recommendations received 
</p>
<p>during the first UPR cycle. It urged the international community to continue to support the 
</p>
<p>country&#8217;s efforts to fight HIV/AIDS. It also highlighted measures to combat poverty and to 
</p>
<p>improve education. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>29. The Democratic Republic of the Congo noted efforts made by Guinea-Bissau, 
</p>
<p>despite the interruption of international aid following the political instability that the 
</p>
<p>country had faced. It highlighted the adoption of legislation on trafficking and the 
</p>
<p>criminalization of female genital mutilation. It noted the considerable challenges faced, 
</p>
<p>including in combating poverty, in fighting effectively against transnational crime, 
</p>
<p>particularly drug trafficking and money-laundering, and in improving the school attendance 
</p>
<p>of girls as a way of discouraging forced and early marriages in rural areas. It made 
</p>
<p>recommendations.  
</p>
<p>30. Denmark commended the constructive engagement by Guinea-Bissau in the UPR 
</p>
<p>process as well as the progress that it had made in protecting human rights since its last </p>


<p>GE.15-07685 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>review. Denmark noted that, following its first review, Guinea-Bissau had ratified the 
</p>
<p>Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
</p>
<p>Punishment (CAT) and signed the Optional Protocol to CAT (OP-CAT), in 2013. It 
</p>
<p>indicated that the Convention against Torture Initiative, which aimed to assist Governments 
</p>
<p>in overcoming technical obstacles to ratification, stood ready to explore avenues to provide 
</p>
<p>assistance to Guinea-Bissau if that were deemed helpful. It made a recommendation.  
</p>
<p>31. Djibouti congratulated Guinea-Bissau on presenting its national report, and noted 
</p>
<p>with satisfaction the actions that had been taken to promote and protect human rights, 
</p>
<p>notably the adoption of a plan against trafficking in human beings, particularly women and 
</p>
<p>children. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>32. Egypt recognized the measures that had been taken to enhance human rights, notably 
</p>
<p>the enactment of the law on preventing and fighting against human trafficking, especially 
</p>
<p>that of women and children. It urged Guinea-Bissau to pursue the same positive path, with a 
</p>
<p>view to further promoting human rights. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>33. Estonia commended the ratification of several treaties and encouraged Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau to continue its efforts to become a part of all main international human rights 
</p>
<p>instruments. It noted the progress in implementing previous recommendations, which had 
</p>
<p>included the criminalization of female genital mutilation and the adoption of the Domestic 
</p>
<p>Violence Act. It was concerned about recurrent harmful practices and strongly urged the 
</p>
<p>authorities to step up efforts to eradicate such practices. It was also concerned at the high 
</p>
<p>illiteracy rate, the low school attendance rate and the discrimination against girls. It made 
</p>
<p>recommendations. 
</p>
<p>34. Ethiopia commended the adoption of the National Policy of Equality and Gender 
</p>
<p>Equity, and the National Strategy Paper on Poverty Reduction 2011&#8211;2015. It noted the 
</p>
<p>special attention given to children&#8217;s rights and the aim of improving basic education for all 
</p>
<p>children, as well as progress in combatting infant mortality. Ethiopia encouraged Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau to work further on the existing mechanisms to fully implement the recommendations 
</p>
<p>received during its first UPR review process. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>35. France welcomed the progress made by Guinea-Bissau in restoring democracy and 
</p>
<p>strengthening the rule of law, especially through the proper holding of parliamentary and 
</p>
<p>presidential elections in 2014 as well as by launching major reforms in the security sector. 
</p>
<p>It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>36. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau assured the speakers that it would continue to 
</p>
<p>make efforts to ratify the international instruments that had been mentioned. 
</p>
<p>37. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau replied to questions raised on female genital 
</p>
<p>mutilation, the education of girls, child labour, forced and early marriage, the national 
</p>
<p>institution for the protection of human rights and the reform of the justice system. 
</p>
<p>38. The Government had continued its effort to raise public awareness after adopting the 
</p>
<p>legislation on female genital mutilation. Some of the persons found to have been engaging 
</p>
<p>in that practice had already been convicted. Those steps were a beginning and the 
</p>
<p>Government intended to make further headway, in particular by raising awareness among 
</p>
<p>women who engaged in those practices by tradition and by encouraging women who had 
</p>
<p>abandoned the practices to join in awareness-raising campaigns by explaining all of the 
</p>
<p>harm that such practices caused to children&#8217;s health.  
</p>
<p>39. Regarding the steps taken to promote education, particularly where girls were 
</p>
<p>concerned, the delegation of Guinea-Bissau said that, in partnership with civil society and 
</p>
<p>the World Food Programme, the school meals programme had been improved. The 
</p>
<p>Government also intended to adopt a series of measures aimed at improving the rate of 
</p>
<p>school enrolment and retention for girls. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.15-07685 
</p>
<p>40. Child labour was a real scourge, especially in its worst forms. The Government was 
</p>
<p>sparing no effort to achieve its eradication. It was for that reason that a national survey had 
</p>
<p>been carried out in 5,000 households in order to assess the situation. On the basis of the 
</p>
<p>results, and with the help of its partners, the Government intended to put in place 
</p>
<p>programmes and actions to deal with the problem. 
</p>
<p>41. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau said that the Government had just approved a 
</p>
<p>programme to reform the justice system, for the period 2015&#8211;2019, which generally 
</p>
<p>speaking set out actions to combat impunity and corruption, to improve access to justice for 
</p>
<p>citizens, to improve the judicial infrastructure and to strengthen the capacities of staff 
</p>
<p>working in the justice sector. The programme would be carried out within a wider reform of 
</p>
<p>the civil service and a reform of the defence and security sectors. 
</p>
<p>42. The delegation recalled that the country had just reinstated a democratic system and 
</p>
<p>said that the challenges involved were enormous. The Government hoped, step by step, 
</p>
<p>using existing resources, but also with the support of the international community, to 
</p>
<p>introduce the measures needed to ensure that the National Human Rights Commission 
</p>
<p>received the necessary resources and that it was in conformity with the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p>43. Regarding forced and early marriage, the delegation pointed out that such behaviour 
</p>
<p>was embedded in traditional culture. Eliminating the practices would take a great deal of 
</p>
<p>time and would require careful handling. Nevertheless, progress had been noted on the 
</p>
<p>ground and the Government intended to continue to work on the subject. 
</p>
<p>44. Guinea-Bissau did not have any political prisoners and steps were being taken to 
</p>
<p>improve conditions of detention within the framework of the aforementioned reform of the 
</p>
<p>justice system. 
</p>
<p>45. With respect to equality between men and women, the principle was recognized in 
</p>
<p>articles 24 and 25 of the Constitution.  
</p>
<p>46. Gabon noted that difficulties linked to the political situation had hindered full 
</p>
<p>cooperation with international human rights mechanisms for the promotion and protection 
</p>
<p>of human rights. It appreciated the measures taken in the areas of gender equality and non-
</p>
<p>discrimination, and the reforms in the justice and security sectors. It urged the international 
</p>
<p>community to strengthen its support. Gabon made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>47. Germany welcomed the renewed commitment of Guinea-Bissau to achieving 
</p>
<p>stability and security in the country, and particularly to fighting against the drugs trade, 
</p>
<p>which had led to significant human rights challenges. It appreciated the efforts made to 
</p>
<p>combat poverty and the improvements made with regard to freedom of the press and 
</p>
<p>freedom of opinion. It was, however, deeply concerned at the ongoing human rights 
</p>
<p>problems. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Ghana noted with appreciation the implementation of some of the recommendations 
</p>
<p>that Guinea-Bissau had received during its first cycle, which included the ratification of 
</p>
<p>many key international human rights instruments. It invited Guinea-Bissau to join the core 
</p>
<p>group of the Convention against Torture Initiative, in order for it to benefit from 
</p>

</p>
<p>domestic violence and human trafficking. Slovenia shared the concerns of the Security 
</p>
<p>Council with regard to violations and abuses of human rights and the atmosphere of 
</p>
<p>residual political tension in the country, and recalled the remarks of the Secretary-General 
</p>
<p>that it would be critical for the authorities to ensure the sustainable functioning of State 
</p>
<p>institutions and the timely delivery of basic services. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>72. South Africa commended Guinea-Bissau on the peaceful general elections held in

</p>
<p>75. Sweden stated that impunity remained a key structural problem for the State and for 
</p>
<p>society; efforts to combat impunity were important in order to contribute to stability in 
</p>
<p>society. Sweden noted that the law allowing for sentences of up to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment 
</p>
<p>in cases of corruption in public office and the administration seemed not to have been 
</p>
<p>implemented effectively, and that corruption existed at all levels and in all branches of

</p>

</p>
<p>implementation of recommendations received during the first UPR cycle. It encouraged

</p>
<p>submission of all reports due to treaty bodies. It noted the measures that had been taken in 
</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>

</p>
<p>that that process would reinforce the primacy of civilian authority and reduce the potential 
</p>
<p>for human rights violations by members of the security forces. It urged Guinea-Bissau to 
</p>
<p>accelerate plans to strengthen the justice sector, making it more accessible, reliable and 
</p>
<p>independent. It noted the efforts made to encourage the abandonment of harmful practices, 
</p>
<p>particularly female genital mutilation. It made recommendations.  </p>


<p>GE.15-07685 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>82. The United States of America commended Guinea-Bissau for the free and fair 
</p>
<p>election process in 2014. It also commended the efforts made to implement the law against 
</p>
<p>female genital mutilation or cutting, and encouraged continued efforts to prevent and to 
</p>
<p>respond to all forms of gender-based violence. It remained concerned at the failure to 
</p>
<p>prevent the worst forms of child labour and to address child trafficking. Although Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau had laws prohibiting human trafficking, the Government had not used those laws to 
</p>
<p>prosecute suspected human traffickers. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>83. The Philippines commended Guinea-Bissau on the introduction of reforms in the 
</p>
<p>defence and security sectors, which would strengthen the rule of law and help consolidate 
</p>
<p>peace. The Philippines also welcomed the addressing by Guinea-Bissau of its youth 
</p>
<p>unemployment and underemployment, in spite of its meagre resources. It called on the 
</p>
<p>international community to extend technical cooperation and other assistance to Guinea-
</p>
<p>Bissau. It made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>84. With regard to organized crime, corruption and impunity, the delegation reiterated 
</p>
<p>that, as part of the 2015&#8211;2019 programme of reform of the justice system, steps were being 
</p>
<p>taken to combat those problems and to improve access to justice. The programme had five 
</p>
<p>main objectives: the independence of the justice system, the transparency of the justice 
</p>
<p>system, the effectiveness of the justice system, a justice system equipped with sufficient 
</p>
<p>and appropriate human and material resources, and the reform of the legal framework. The 
</p>
<p>latter point referred not only to national laws, but also to the harmonization of national 
</p>
<p>legislation in order to bring it into conformity with international legislation and instruments.  
</p>
<p>85. In addition to that programme, the Government had renewed its collaboration with 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and a unit to combat drug 
</p>
<p>trafficking in airports would be set up that year. Guinea-Bissau had also worked with 
</p>
<p>UNODC on combating corruption through a unit that would be set up with the assistance of 
</p>
<p>the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL). 
</p>
<p>86. The Government was also taking steps to investigate the crimes mentioned by some 
</p>
<p>delegations. However, the Government intended to conduct an inclusive dialogue for 
</p>
<p>national reconciliation, so that the investigations did not undermine the progress made and 
</p>
<p>so that they were conducted within a framework of reconciliation and transitional justice.  
</p>
<p>87. In the context of the harmonization of national legislation with Guinea-Bissau&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>international obligations, legal provisions would be introduced to combat organized crime, 
</p>
<p>since the concept did not exist in the country&#8217;s legislation.  
</p>
<p>88. With respect to access to justice, the Delegation of Guinea-Bissau stated that, during 
</p>
<p>its first six months in office, the current Government had already begun building two 
</p>
<p>regional courts, situated not in the capital but in regions of the country, with the support of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Development Programme. 
</p>
<p>89. Regarding the registration of births, a national campaign was planned offering all 
</p>
<p>registrations during a period of one year free of charge in order to allow all unregistered 
</p>
<p>births to be recorded. 
</p>
<p>90. Concerning trafficking of children and the commercial and sexual exploitation of 
</p>
<p>girls, Guinea-Bissau recalled that the country had ratified International Labour 
</p>
<p>Organization (ILO) Conventions No. 138, concerning Minimum Age for Admission to 
</p>
<p>Employment, and No. 182, concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the 
</p>
<p>Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. During the time Guinea-Bissau had 
</p>
<p>enjoyed the effective support of an active ILO programme, many measures had been put in 
</p>
<p>place to combat those problems. The delegation recalled the resulting establishment of a 
</p>
<p>national committee on trafficking in human beings and of a national committee on 
</p>
<p>combating child labour. The problem was the lack of resources. Guinea-Bissau had </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.15-07685 
</p>
<p>received support from ILO from September 2010 to February 2014 but, since the 
</p>
<p>completion of the project, the country had been left to continue the activities on its own. 
</p>
<p>91. The delegation provided information on the National Children&#8217;s Parliament, an 
</p>
<p>institution composed of members of youth associations, supported by the Parliament of 
</p>
<p>Guinea-Bissau, which was funded with a small budget and monitored all issues relating to 
</p>
<p>the rights of the child. 
</p>
<p>92. With respect to combating poverty, the delegation referred to measures adopted 
</p>
<p>under the strategic instruments policy, such as the second national strategy for poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction paper, as well as other measures in the social programme aimed at reducing 
</p>
<p>extreme poverty, tackling the non-enrolment of girls in school, rendering the justice system 
</p>
<p>more independent and effective, and combating corruption. 
</p>
<p>93. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau recalled that the situation in the country was 
</p>
<p>difficult and urged the international community to continue to support the country&#8217;s efforts, 
</p>
<p>particularly with regard to the round-table meeting that was being organized, in the course 
</p>
<p>of which the Government would present its strategic priorities and its needs in terms of 
</p>
<p>development of the country and improving the human rights situation. 
</p>
<p>94. The delegation of Guinea-Bissau reiterated that it was ready to cooperate with the 
</p>
<p>special procedures of the United Nations at all times. 
</p>
<p>95. Finally, the delegation thanked all participants for their attention and their 
</p>
<p>encouragement.
