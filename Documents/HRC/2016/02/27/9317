<p><b>INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of 
toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights carried out a fact-
finding mission to the United Republic of Tanzania from 21 to 30 January 2008. This 
preliminary note provides the initial observations and recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur. A full report, including his conclusions and recommendations will be submitted 
subsequently to the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of the United Republic 
of Tanzania for extending an invitation to him. He would like to thank in particular the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and the Ministry of Energy and 
Minerals for their contribution and efforts in organizing the mission while regretting that he 
did not have full opportunity to brief in person relevant officials at the end of his mission, as 
it was not possible to arrange suitable meetings. The Special Rapporteur further regrets that 
he was unable to meet relevant authorities and visit sites which deal with industrial toxic 
wastes and dangerous products such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and 
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>3. During the visit, the Special Rapporteur was able to have meetings with a variety of 
stakeholders including the Vice President&#8217;s Office &#8211; Division of Environment, National 
Environment Management Council, Dar es Salaam City Council, the Ministry of Health and 
Social Welfare, the Tanzania Port Authority, Occupational Health and Safety Authority, and 
the Government Chemist Laboratory Agency. The Special Rapporteur also met with the Lake 
Victoria Environmental Management Project, academics, non-governmental organizations 
and a wide range of civil society, mining consulting companies and individuals and villagers 
in the Lake Victoria area practicing small-scale mining. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited areas within and around Dar es Salaam including the 
Mtoni and Pugukinyamwezi dumpsites. He also visited the Lake Victoria Area including the 
cities and regions of Mwanza, Geita and Shinyanga. In Geita, he had the opportunity to visit 
the Geita Gold Mine and Nyaragusu areas where small-scale and medium-scale gold mining 
is taking place. In Shinyanga, he was able to see areas where small-scale diamond mining is 
taking place. Finally, the Special Rapporteur visited the Williamson Diamond Mine in 
Mwadui.

</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur would also like to thank the United Nations Country Team, 
and in particular the Resident Coordinator&#8217;s office and the United Nations Industrial 
Development Organisation (UNIDO)  for their efforts in assisting in  organizing meetings 
and providing technical advice on the issues addressed by the mission. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6. The objective of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mission to the United Republic of Tanzania 
was to enable him to gather first-hand information on the impact that mining activities are 
having on the human rights of the local population. The Special Rapporteur also looked at the 
use of chemicals and the waste management system for both industrial and domestic waste in 
the country. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS </b> 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Adequate Legal Framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur observed that the Government of the United Republic of 
Tanzania has a comprehensive range of laws and subsidiary instruments that deal with the 
particular issue of toxic and dangerous products and wastes. Some examples that he wishes to 
highlight include the Mining Act of 1998, the Industrial and Consumer Chemical 
(Management &amp; Control) Act of 2003, the National Environmental Management Act of 2004 
and the Land Act of 1999 amongst others. While the Special Rapporteur notes that such legal 
developments are relatively recent, he looks forward to monitoring implementation of these 
laws and their ability to limit the adverse effects of toxic and dangerous products and wastes 
on the environment and on the human rights of the people of the United Republic of 
Tanzania. 
</p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Right to information 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government does appear to have appropriate 
mechanisms in place to deal with issues of chemical management. The United Republic of 
Tanzania has legislation in place protecting the right to information and public participation 
concerning environmental matters as stipulated in Article 178 of the Environmental 
Management Act 2004. It appears, however, that there are constraints on the full enforcement 
of that legislation due to limited capacity of the State. The Special Rapporteur was informed 
by a variety of stakeholders that the public may not have received any or sufficient 
information on the different chemical substances and dangerous products that they are 
exposed to in their workplaces or their communities.  
</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>The Mining Sector 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Small-scale mining 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the large volume of unregulated small-
scale mining that is taking place around the country. He had the opportunity to witness small-
scale mining of both gold and diamonds using chemicals such as mercury and other 
dangerous products during the extraction process without the use of proper safety equipment. 
He is concerned that substantial amounts of mercury are obtained by small-scale miners from 
&#8220;unofficial&#8221; sources which are outside the control of government. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10. In some cases, the miners do not have adequate information about the impact mercury 
can have on their health and the dangers of the improper disposal of tailings and their effect 
on their livelihood and the environment. In a number of areas, land, water, plants and 
livestock may be at a high risk of contamination from mercury and other dangerous wastes. 
In other cases, the Special Rapporteur was informed of small-scale miners who have some 
awareness of the dangers of using mercury and other chemicals in the extraction process. 
However, due to poverty, inadequate information and the lack of a suitable alternative, the 
miners continue to use mercury and other dangerous products without appropriate safety 
measures, endangering both the environment and their own health.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Large-scale mining 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the operations of large mining companies 
in the United Republic of Tanzania. He observed that there seems to be limited Government 
supervision of the operations of big mining corporations. He was informed about tensions 
that have been arising in different parts of the country due to the discontent of local 
communities affected by large scale mining operations. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 12. The Special Rapporteur also notes with concern that large scale gold mining 
companies do not conduct adequate awareness campaigns to sensitize villagers in their areas 
of operation of the dangers posed by contact with wastes from their operations, particularly 
cyanide. The Special Rapporteur was informed of cases in which villagers and livestock have 
come in contact with such waste with serious consequences.

</p>
<p><b>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges and welcomes the sensitization efforts 
undertaken by the Government and other stakeholders for small-scale (artisanal) miners to 
raise awareness of the effects of mercury and other dangerous chemicals used during the 
extraction process for gold and diamonds. However, he urges the Government and other 
stakeholders, including the United Nations Country Team and civil society to step up efforts 
to inform the public of the risks posed by mining as well as by toxic chemicals used in the 
textile industries and tanneries. Different media and format should be used and disseminated 
throughout rural and urban areas in the local languages and dialects. Attention should be paid 
to isolated rural areas and illiterate populations in order for this effort to be effective. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14. The Government should monitor more closely the operations of large-scale mining 
companies particularly with regard to occupational health and safety standards and relations 
between the mining corporations and the surrounding communities.   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to increase the human and 
technical resources of the National Environmental Council (NEMC) in order to enable it to 
carry out its work in both rural and urban areas more effectively. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>16. In order to improve regulation of the environmental and human rights impacts of 
mining activities, the Special Rapporteur urges the Government to develop a database of 
mining-related illnesses that have affected the communities that inhabit the mining areas. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>17.  While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8217;s initiative to ensure that 
environmental impact assessments are carried out before granting mining licenses, it should 
be noted that environmental impact assessments do not fully take into account the human 
rights impact of environmental degradation in mining areas. The Special Rapporteur urges 
the Government and mining corporations to also carry out social impact assessments to better 
protect and promote the human rights of the local population. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>19. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government pursue the option of being 
a candidate country for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The initiative aims 
at strengthening governance by improving transparency and accountability in the extractive 
sector. This would in turn, encourage foreign investors whose resources can be used to fulfil 
the development needs of the country. </p>

<p>20. The Special Rapporteur further recommends that the Government increase its 
engagement, in close cooperation with the United Nations Country Team, with the Special 
Procedures and Treaty Bodies and duly take into account their recommendations.
