FOR HUMAN RIGHTS AND REPORTS OF THE OFFICE OF THE 
    HIGH COMMISSIONER AND THE SECRETARY-GENERAL 
</b></p>
<p><b>The issue of Palestinian pregnant women giving birth at Israeli checkpoints 
</b></p>
<p><b>Report of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its decision 2/102, requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to &#8220;continue with the fulfilment of her activities, in 
accordance with all previous decisions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and to 
update the relevant reports and studies&#8221;. In its resolution 2005/7, the Commission on Human 
Rights requested the High Commissioner to report on the issue of Palestinian pregnant women 
giving birth at Israeli checkpoints owing to denial of access by Israel to hospitals. The Office of 
the High Commissioner (&#8220;the Office&#8221;) understands decision 2/102 as preserving the previous 
annual reporting cycle in respect of this issue, until otherwise decided by the Council. The 
present report to the Council accordingly addresses the developments that have occurred since 
the last report on this issue was submitted to the Council at its fourth session.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>2. On 20 November 2007, the Secretary-General addressed notes verbales to the Permanent 
Mission of Israel and to the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine to the United Nations 
Office at Geneva, in which he indicated that he would appreciate receiving any comments or 
observations that they might wish to submit following Commission resolution 2005/7 and the 
most recent report submitted by the High Commissioner on the issue of Palestinian pregnant 
women giving birth at Israeli checkpoints.<b>1</b>

</p>
<p>3. On 11 December 2007, the Office received a reply from the Permanent Observer Mission 
of Palestine indicating that the Israeli practices described in a report compiled by the Palestinian 
Ministry of Health in early 2007 persist. It also indicates that the number of cases of Palestinian 
pregnant women giving birth at Israeli checkpoints recorded in that report (69 cases) remains the 
same. The above-mentioned Israeli practices and cases of deliveries at checkpoints were 
described in detail in the previous report of the High Commissioner.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p>4. At the time of writing, no reply had been received from the Permanent Mission of Israel. 
</p>
<p>5. In order to gather information on the issue, the Office also wrote on 6 November 2007 to 
the following United Nations entities and specialized agencies represented in the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory: the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the 
Office of the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Process (UNSCO), the 
United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM), the United Nations Relief and Works 
Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund 
(UNICEF), the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the World Food Programme (WFP) 
and the World Health Organization (WHO). 
</p>
<p>6. Replies were received on 23 November 2007 from UNRWA and WHO. Both indicate that 
since all internal Israeli Defense Force (IDF) checkpoints were dismantled in Gaza in 2005, there 
were no cases of pregnant women giving birth at checkpoints in Gaza during the reporting 
period. In addition, WHO reports that since there was no referral for pregnancy-related 
conditions from Gaza to outside hospitals, no delivery was reported at the Erez checkpoint 
(currently the only checkpoint where patients can exit Gaza). Neither UNRWA nor WHO replies 
contain information concerning deliveries at checkpoints in the West Bank. However, on 
3 January 2008, OHCHR received information from B&#8217;Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for 
Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, concerning two cases of deliveries of Palestinian 
women. Both women had been forced to give birth in their respective cars following the refusal 
of the Israeli soldiers guarding a gate north of the village of &#8216;Azzun &#8216;Atmah, which is cut off 
from the rest of the West Bank by the Wall, to allow them to pass to get to a hospital in nearby 
Qalqiliya. A first case occurred on 12 December 2007, in which the delivery took place in the 
car after a delay of over half an hour at the gate. In the other case, which took place on 
15 December 2007, a Palestinian woman from the village began to deliver in her car at 4.30 a.m., 
following a delay of more than one and half hours at the gate. 
</p>
<p>7. WHO further reports that, while the number of Palestinian women giving birth at 
checkpoints is an important indicator, it is not sufficient to assess the accessibility of adequate 
medical services for pregnant women, the changing patterns of behaviour in response to mobility 
restrictions and their implications for the right to health. According to studies referred to by 
WHO,<b>2</b> restricted mobility and increasing poverty have resulted in difficult situations for

<p>Palestinian pregnant women and limited access to health care. Closures (roadblocks and 
checkpoints) continue to have economic, medical and psychosocial implications for Palestinian 
pregnant women as follows: 
</p>
<p> (a) Unpredictable access to maternity services due to restrictions on movement is a 
determinant in medical decisions on induced labour and caesarean sections and it also 
discourages women from seeking quality post-natal care; 
</p>
<p> (b) Obstetricians at West Bank hospitals run by the Palestinian Authority (PA) report 
that complications have increased due to late arrivals after delays at checkpoints and late 
referrals from private hospitals for caesarean operations free of charge; 
</p>
<p> (c) Mobility restrictions impede continuity of medical care throughout the cycle of 
pregnancy (prenatal care, a hospital for delivery and post-natal care may not be accessible in the 
same location) and thus the development of a relationship of trust between medical staff and 
patients; 
</p>
<p> (d) Palestinian pregnant women and their families live with anxiety and stress, especially 
during the last period of pregnancy, of not being assured that they will be able to reach a 
maternity facility and to return home. Transport between the home and the hospital is a constant 
concern; 
</p>
<p> (e) Studies indicate that physical accessibility to services, in addition to their availability 
and affordability, is a factor in Palestinian women&#8217;s choice of place of birth. According to a 
Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) survey carried out in 2004, 20 per cent of 
women interviewed reported that their childbirth location was not the preferred place of delivery; 
of those, 13.7 per cent stated that access was impeded by IDF measures; 
</p>
<p> (f) A drastic change in birth location patterns is reported even if this means a lower 
standard of health care, e.g. an increase in births attended at home or in doctors&#8217; clinics. While 
eliminating the need for displacement, home births involve high risks if not supported by 
emergency obstetric care and the ability to access a hospital when needed. In the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory, emergency obstetric care is limited and access constitutes a vital problem 
with many roads blocked; 
</p>
<p> (g) Changes in utilization patterns have also had an impact on the quality of services: the 
higher caseloads in some maternity hospitals were generally not accompanied by an increase in 
the number of health providers putting further strain on PA hospitals already suffering from 
understaffing and overcrowding;

</p>
<p> (h) In order to avoid having access to a maternity facility delayed or denied, pregnant 
women are reported to move to relatives living in towns (most of the childbirth infrastructure in 
the Occupied Palestinian Territory is located in urban-based hospitals) a few weeks before the 
expected delivery; 
</p>
<p> (i) Mobility restrictions also disrupt social relations depriving pregnant women of 
psychosocial support by the wider family, which in Palestinian culture and society is especially 
important. Close family members are not able to accompany pregnant women to hospital or often 
arrive late. 
</p>
<p>8. WHO further reports that according to data published in April 2007 by PCBS, the infant 
mortality rate has slightly increased from 24.2/1,000 live births in 2004 to 25.3/1,000 live 
births in 2006. The under-five mortality rate has not changed from 2004 to 2006, which 
is 28.2/1,000 live births. 
</p>
<p>9. UNRWA reports scarce medical facilities in Gaza, where 7 out of 17 incubators for 
newborn babies have not been duly maintained due to the lack of spare parts in the local market, 
which appears to have resulted in a decline in health standards among newborns during the 
reporting period. According to UNRWA, the number of infant deaths at Gaza&#8217;s main hospitals - 
Shifa hospital, Gaza paediatric hospital and the Gaza European hospital - was on average 
20 per cent higher during the period of January-October 2007 than during the corresponding 
period in 2006. UNRWA also expresses concern over the significant delays of the process 
applicable for Gazans who require permits from the Israeli authorities to exit Gaza through the 
Erez crossing to receive necessary medical treatment in hospitals outside Gaza. Referring to 
WHO statistics indicating that it has become more difficult for Gazan patients to receive an exit 
permit, UNRWA reports that while 89.4 per cent of patients who applied were granted a permit 
between January and May 2007, during October 2007, only 77.1 per cent of applicants received 
permits. Long delays are particularly detrimental for patients whose conditions are critical and 
necessitate immediate treatment outside Gaza. 
</p>
<p>10. With regard to pregnant women in Gaza, UNRWA reports that health facilities in Gaza can 
provide treatment to most high-risk pregnancy women. Therefore, the number of high-risk 
pregnancy cases referred to hospitals in Israel or east Jerusalem from either health centres of the 
Ministry of Health or health centres operated by UNRWA is not high. Since February 2007, 
UNRWA reports that it has referred five pregnant women in need of tertiary care to Israeli 
hospitals. Among these, four cases resulted in maternal mortality.
