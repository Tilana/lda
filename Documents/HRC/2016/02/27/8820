<p><b>  Visit to Ecuador 
(22 to 26 June 2009) 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 At the invitation of the Government of Ecuador, the Working Group of experts on 
people of African descent undertook an official mission to Ecuador from 22 to 26 June 
2009. In the present report, the Working Group examines the general situation of people of 
African descent in Ecuador, describes the position in which people of African descent find 
themselves and the situations that expose them to discrimination, and outlines the action 
taken at various levels for their well-being. It concludes with recommendations that the 
Working Group believe will, if implemented, make tangible improvements in the situation 
of people of African descent in Ecuador. 
</p>
<p> During its visit to Ecuador, the Working Group found that the problems faced by 
people of African descent in the country related mainly to a lack of access to such basic 
services as adequate housing, health care and education, disproportionately high levels of 
unemployment and representation in detention centres, an undervaluing of the Afro-
descendent contribution to the national identity and the negative representation of Afro-
descendents in the media. The Working Group attributes this, in large part, to structural 
racism that exists as a result of the colonial past of Ecuador, which informs its collective 
psyche to the present day. 
</p>
<p> In this respect, the Working Group appreciates that the Government of Ecuador is 
open, aware of the existing problems and committed to facing these challenges with 
innovative programmes and legislative initiatives. The Working Group is particularly 
impressed by the new Constitution adopted in 2008, which allows for advances to be made 
in the protection and promotion of the human rights of all vulnerable groups, including the 
population of African descent. Such elements as the recognition and protection of the 
collective rights of people of African descent are forward-thinking initiatives that will go a 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p>long way towards redressing historical injustices and disenfranchisement of this sector of 
society. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group praises the creation of the Corporation for Afro-Ecuadorian 
Development (CODAE) and the work that it has been undertaking in guiding Government 
policy on the population of African descent in Ecuador. The experts trust that the new 
institution that replaces it, in accordance with a broad institutional restructuring introduced 
with the adoption of the new Constitution of 2008, will continue to effectively orient 
Government policy to address the challenges faced by Afro-Ecuadorians and ensure their 
equal participation in all aspects of society and the advancement and economic 
development of the country. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group notes the unprecedented amount of resources that the 
Government has invested in social services during the last two years to benefit poorer 
sectors of society particularly, and recognizes that this will have a continuing beneficial 
impact upon many persons of African descent. The experts suggest, however, that targeted 
investment directed specifically towards Afro-descendent communities is also necessary to 
alleviate the serious shortfalls in the provision of fundamental services that some of these 
communities endure. 
</p>
<p> The Working Group welcomes the measures contained within the National 
Development Plan 2007&#8211;2010, designed to encourage the institutional development of 
Afro-Ecuadorian organizations, promote the integration of the Afro-descendent population 
through, inter alia, quotas in State institutions and advance the situation of Afro-Ecuadorian 
women. The experts encourage the Government to redouble its efforts to ensure that all of 
the measures contemplated in the National Development Plan to benefit the Afro-
Ecuadorian population are implemented. 
</p>
<p> The concrete measures recommended by the Working Group include the adoption of 
specific legislation on non-discrimination; the development of a national campaign to 
promote multiculturalism and respect for the dignity of the Afro-Ecuadorian people; the 
adoption of measures to reduce the educational gap that exists between Afro-Ecuadorians 
and the wider population; the introduction of ethno-education for people of African 
descent; the strengthening of Afro-Ecuadorian civil society; measures to eliminate racism 
and discrimination in the media; further efforts to encourage participation of persons of 
African descent in public administration; the establishment of a centre for Afro-Ecuadorian 
studies; the further development of free legal aid services; the creation within the office of 
the Ombudsman of a sub-unit dedicated to issues related to people of African descent and 
the creation of special programmes to promote the education of women of African descent.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Bearing in mind its status as a special procedure of the former Commission on 
Human Rights, the Working Group of experts on people of African descent decided at its 
fourth session to undertake country visits as a means of effectively discharging its mandate. 
The Working Group recognized that such visits could contribute to in-depth understanding 
of the situation of people of African descent in various regions of the world.1  
</p>
<p>2. At the invitation of the Government of Ecuador, the Working Group undertook a 
country visit to Ecuador from 22 to 26 June 2009. The delegation, headed by Joe Frans, the 
Chairperson of the Working Group, also included the expert Mirjana Najcevska. During 
their mission, the experts visited Quito, Guayaquil, Chota and San Lorenzo. 
</p><p>3. In Quito, the Working Group met with the Director-General of Human Rights and 
Social Affairs from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Vice-Minister for Coordination of 
Internal and External Security; the Executive Director of CODAE; the President of the 
National Congress; the Minister of Justice and Human Rights; an adviser on intercultural 
affairs from the Coordinating Ministry for Natural and Cultural Patrimony; the Under-
Secretary for statistics and analysis from the Coordinating Ministry for Social 
Development; the Under-Secretary and staff of the National Secretariat for Planning and 
Development; the Attorney-General of Ecuador; the Director of the Programme for Afro-
Ecuadorian Development of the Quito Directorate for Social Inclusion; the President of the 
National Court of Justice; the National Ombudsman and the Minister of Social and 
Economic Inclusion. They also met with representatives from United Nations agencies, 
international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), academics and 
members of the Afro-Ecuadorian communities in Guayaquil, Chota and San Lorenzo. In 
San Lorenzo, they also visited a primary school with predominantly Afro-Ecuadorian 
students. 
</p>
<p>4. The experts wish to thank the Government of Ecuador for its invitation and for its 
help and assistance before and during their visit to the country. They would also like to 
thank the representatives of international organizations, NGOs, academics and people of 
African descent with whom they met during their mission. In this report, the experts 
examine the situation of people of African descent living in Ecuador. This report describes 
the facts observed and the information received by the Working Group during its visit. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context of people of African descent in Ecuador 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. General situation 
</b></p>
<p>5. The African ancestors of Ecuadorians of African descent began arriving in Ecuador 
as a result of the slave trade and ensuing African diaspora to the Americas that began in the 
sixteenth century. Their marginalization during the period of slavery precluded any 
possibility of social ascension or integration into the wider population. Slavery was 
abolished in Ecuador in 1851 and the slaves were progressively set free over the following 
five years. The emancipation of Afro-Ecuadorians did not mean, however, that they gained 
immediate access to political, economic or property rights. To this end, various movements 
were organized during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries with the aim of 
</p>

<p>GE.10-10207 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>enfranchizing the Afro-Ecuadorian population, but the objective of full enjoyment of all 
rights on an equal basis with those of the majority Ecuadorian culture is yet to be realized. 
6. Today, people of African descent are found all over Ecuador, but are more numerous 
in certain regions. In the province of Esmeraldas, in the north-west of the country, 39.9 per 
cent of the population is composed of people of African descent. The national census of 
2001 estimated the Afro-Ecuadorian population at 4.97 per cent of the national population 
and, five years later, a survey on living conditions in Ecuador (<i>Encuestas de Condiciones 
de Vida en el Ecuador</i>) fixed their number at 5.7 per cent of the population. This survey 
found that people of African descent enjoy standards of living below the national average 
and endure multiple challenges in the areas of access to housing, education, health and 
other fundamental services. The average monthly household income in Ecuador, for 
example, is about US$ 522, while for an Afro-Ecuadorian household it is $400. The 
average monthly personal income for Afro-Ecuadorians is $210.80, while for the white 
population it is $316.60 and the national average is $268. Moreover, according to the 
survey, while 12.9 per cent of Ecuadorians live below the extreme poverty line, the figure 
stands at 13.7 per cent for Afro-Ecuadorians. 
</p>
<p>7. In the area of education, attendance<b> </b>rates show that Afro-Ecuadorians have, on 
average, fewer years of study than whites. According to the 2006 survey, 12.63 per cent of 
Afro-Ecuadorians are illiterate, as compared to 9.13 per cent of the rest of the population. 
People of African descent in Ecuador begin with lower attendance and completion levels in 
primary education and progressively and exponentially fall behind the levels of the majority 
ethnic group throughout secondary education until they are even further underrepresented at 
the level of tertiary education. The attendance rate for secondary education for Afro-
Ecuadorians is 38.8 per cent, whereas for the rest of the population it is 55.3 per cent. Only 
8 per cent of Afro-Ecuadorians attend universities, whereas in the wider population it is 18 
per cent.  
</p>
<p>8. The inequality endured by Afro-Ecuadorians is also apparent in the area of work. 
They are often underpaid in comparison with the majority of the population and are found 
employed as unskilled labour and with precarious job security. The nature of the work that 
Afro-Ecuadorians are engaged in is closely related to their lower average levels of 
education and so they are less represented in professional employment. This situation is 
even more dramatic in the case of Afro-Ecuadorian women, who suffer gender 
discrimination as well, and whose unemployment rate is 17.5 per cent. 
</p>
<p>9. As regards the area of health, Afro-Ecuadorians also experience difficulties in 
accessing the health-care system. The most common diseases among this population are 
related to unsanitary living conditions, often characterized by high levels of environmental 
contamination, poor access to clean water and badly managed disposal of waste materials. 
</p>
<p>10. The poverty that is often characteristic of the living conditions of people of African 
descent in Ecuador is closely related to several factors; from the deep historical roots of 
marginalization during the construction of the nation to the failure of the State to 
adequately implement policies for the purpose of integrating this sector of the population. 
Moreover, their condition is aggravated by the racial discrimination and the structural 
racism to which they are exposed.  
</p>
<p>11. The new Constitution that was adopted in 2008 contains several provisions designed 
to advance the situation of people of African descent and, once the necessary enacting 
legislation is passed, offers a real opportunity to redress the historic and structural 
discrimination long endured by people of African descent in Ecuador. </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p><b> B. Framework for the protection of the human rights of people of African 
descent 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. The international legal framework for the protection of the human rights of people of 
African descent 
</b></p>
<p>12. Ecuador has demonstrated its commitment to combating racism and discrimination 
by signing and ratifying a series of international conventions that deal with racism and 
discrimination: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the two Optional 
Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention on the Elimination of 
All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child. Ecuador also voted for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples. Regionally, Ecuador has also signed and ratified the American 
Convention on Human Rights and the Additional Protocol to the American Convention on 
Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
</p>
<p>13. In 2000, Ecuador adopted the United Nations Millennium Declaration containing the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The Government went on to develop the 
National Development Plan 2007&#8211;2010 to implement the MDGs, and this plan includes 
various provisions designed to improve the situation of the Afro-Ecuadorian population. 
Ecuador has also drawn upon the commitments and recommendations contained within the 
Durban Declaration and Programme of Action in formulating its National Development 
Plan 2007&#8211;2010, particularly as relates to the situation of people of African descent and the 
challenges that face them. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. The national legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>14. Ecuador adopted a new Constitution in 2008 that contains many guarantees that 
advance the fight against racism and discrimination and promote the integration of 
minorities, such as people of African descent. Importantly, its first article affirms that the 
country is, among other characteristics, &#8220;intercultural and multinational&#8221;. Article 11 goes 
on to stipulate that &#8220;no one may be discriminated against for reason of ethnicity &#8230; cultural 
identity &#8230; [or] language&#8221; and that &#8220;the law will punish all forms of discrimination&#8221;. This 
same article also includes the important initiative that &#8220;the State will adopt measures of 
affirmative action that promote real equality in favour of rights holders that are in situations 
of disadvantage&#8221;. The Constitution also establishes that rights and guarantees contained in 
the Constitution and international instruments will be of direct and immediate application 
by, and before, all public servants. That the Afro-Ecuadorian people have collective rights 
is specifically established in article 58 of the Constitution: the article begins to characterize 
these rights, stating that communities, indigenous nationalities and peoples (among them 
the Afro-Ecuadorian people) have the right not to be subject to racism or any other form of 
discrimination based on their origin, ethnic identity or culture. Article 57 furthermore states 
that collectivities affected by racism, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance and 
discrimination have the right to the recognition of the violation and reparation. 
</p>
<p>15. The experts note that the Ecuadorian Penal Code includes provisions on hate crimes 
where a racist motivation for the perpetration of the crime is considered an aggravating 
factor. There is, however, no specific law devoted to non-discrimination. The Act on 
Collective rights of the Afro-Ecuadorian People was enacted in 2006, in which Afro-
Ecuadorian communities are recognized as a people with economic, political, social, 
cultural, civil, territorial and collective rights. This law also creates the National Council for </p>


<p>GE.10-10207 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Afro-Ecuadorian Development, which is charged with developing policy to advance the 
situation of the Afro-Ecuadorian population. 
</p>
<p>16. The Corporation for Afro-Ecuadorian Development (CODAE) also falls under the 
jurisdiction of the Presidency of the Republic. It was evident to the experts that CODAE 
plays a fundamental role in combating discrimination against Afro-descendents through its 
policy development, programmes and outreach to civil society. One of the most important 
initiatives under way at the moment to combat discrimination is the draft National Plan 
against Racism and Discrimination. The main goal of this project is to eliminate the 
different forms and practices of racial discrimination and ethnic-cultural exclusion, thereby 
promoting a pluralist, intercultural and inclusive society. The plan is intended to combat 
racial discrimination by focusing on the human, civil, political, economic, social, cultural 
and collective rights found in a diversity of international instruments. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Framework of the City of Quito 
</b>17. In Quito, a variety of measures have also been taken to promote the inclusion of the 
Afro-Ecuadorian population. In 2001, the City of Quito created the Afro-Descendant&#8217;s Unit 
within the Municipal Directorate of Social and Economic Development. The 
responsibilities of this unit were to establish and apply public policies for the development 
of the Afro-Ecuadorian people which aim at reducing poverty, strengthening self-
management and achieving the democratic integration of Afro-Ecuadorian people. Those 
aims were to be achieved with due regard to Afro-descendants&#8217; own vision of development 
and enhancing their present resources, i.e., their human and social capital. Through this 
initiative, the City of Quito has implemented a diverse range of measures, among which, 
mention should be made of municipal ordinance for social inclusion, with an ethno-cultural 
focus, of the Afro-Ecuadorian community, which stipulates that the City of Quito must 
incorporate the Afro-descendent population into the plans, programmes, projects and 
services that it executes. 
</p>
<p><b> III. People of African descent in Ecuador: general comments 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Participation of people of African descent in all political, economic, 
social and cultural aspects of society and in the advancement and 
economic development of the country 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Working Group experts were informed that CODAE is the national institution 
that formulates State policy for issues related to Ecuadorians of African descent. The 
Working Group was also informed that the Government is working on the National Plan 
against Racism and Discrimination and that, once completed, the actions of all State 
institutions will have to be in conformity with the plan. Both the policy formulation of 
CODAE and the content of the plan identify and address the most important challenges 
facing people of African descent in Ecuador. Through its many meetings held with State 
and Government officials and Afro-descendant communities, civil society representatives, 
academics, the international community and United Nations agencies, the experts found the 
following to be the most pressing issues as regards the participation of people of African 
descent in all political, economic, social and cultural aspects of society and in the 
advancement and economic development of their country. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Access to education 
</b></p>
<p>19. In the Working Group&#8217;s meetings with State authorities, it was emphasized that, for 
the first time, education at the primary level is free in Ecuador, including the provision of </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p>uniforms, textbooks and school lunches. The experts noted, however, that levels of 
illiteracy are higher among the Afro-Ecuadorian population than the national average2 and 
access to education presents an ongoing challenge to this population group. Traditionally, 
levels of school attendance for the Afro-Ecuadorian population have been lower than the 
national average, but the Government&#8217;s policies, particularly the abolition of school fees, 
have had a positive impact on access to education by Afro-Ecuadorian children. Recently, 
Ecuador has been mainstreaming an intercultural aspect in its education system, which has 
allowed indigenous communities to benefit from the provision of lessons in indigenous 
languages and on subjects that are particularly culturally relevant to indigenous 
communities. Intercultural education is yet, however, to be extended systematically by the 
State to Afro-Ecuadorians. The experts were informed that Afro-Ecuadorian history and the 
contributions made by Ecuadorians of African descent to Ecuadorian culture do not figure 
greatly in the school syllabus.  
</p>
<p>20. According to information received, a limited number of Afro-Ecuadorian children 
complete primary education, even fewer continue to secondary education and exceptionally 
few enrol in universities. Less than 1 per cent of university graduates in Ecuador are of 
African descent, although Afro-Ecuadorians constitute 5.5 per cent of the population.3 High 
levels of poverty and the associated attraction of entering the workforce as soon as possible 
contribute greatly to the very low numbers of Afro-Ecuadorians studying at university. The 
experts were also informed that there is a tendency for university lecturers to view Afro-
Ecuadorian students as intellectually unsuited to serious study. As well as affirmative 
measures (such as a quota system in universities for students of African descent), it was 
suggested that there needed to be a support structure at the universities that helps Afro-
Ecuadorian students navigate within what is often a very unfamiliar environment.   
</p>
<p>21. During its meeting with the Quito authorities, the experts were informed that, 
although the education programme is managed at the national level, they are currently 
working on a municipal ordinance that will ensure places in local schools for students from 
disadvantaged groups, such as the Afro-Ecuadorian population. The ordinance will also 
smooth the way for the free school meals programme, which will help prevent students 
dropping out of school. To further improve access to education by vulnerable groups, the 
City of Quito intends to provide a number of scholarships to students from disadvantaged 
backgrounds and require that schools report on the number of Afro-Ecuadorian students 
enrolled and the number that complete their studies. 
</p>
<p>22. While meeting with NGOs in the Chota valley, the experts were informed about a 
project currently being conducted by the Federation of Black Communities of Imbabura 
and Carchi to produce educative modules on the history of Ecuadorians of African descent, 
in the hope that these modules will be included in the syllabus of local schools. During their 
meeting with academics, the experts heard that although ethno-education (Afro-education) 
has taken place informally, an educational programme that caters to the specific needs of 
students from communities of African descent needs to be formalized. Such a programme 
should not be a copy of the ethno-education developed for indigenous communities but 
rather one that is tailored to the particular situation and needs of students of African 
descent. In meetings that the experts held with NGOs and community members from San 
Lorenzo in the Esmeraldas province, participants also underlined that Ecuadorian history 
and other textbooks do not cover the role and contribution of Ecuadorians of African 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 According to the survey on living conditions in Ecuador (ECV), 2006, 9.13 per cent of the 
</p>
<p>Ecuadorian population was illiterate, as compared with 12.63 per cent of Afro-Ecuadorians.  
 
</p>
<p>3
 The most recent census conducted in Ecuador took place in 2001 and found that the Afro-Ecuadorian 
</p>
<p>population constituted 4.97 per cent of the general population. The national survey on living 
conditions, carried out in 2006, found that they made up 5.7 per cent of the population. </p>


<p>GE.10-10207 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>descent sufficiently. As well as the obvious benefits for children of African descent to be 
taught about the history of their forbears, it was pointed out that all Ecuadorian children 
should be educated about the contribution that Afro-Ecuadorians have made to the country 
throughout its history. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Access to fundamental services 
</b></p>
<p>23. Over the last two years, the Government of Ecuador has invested an unprecedented 
amount of resources in social services designed particularly to benefit poorer sectors of 
society. Despite this, during many of their meetings, the experts were informed that Afro-
Ecuadorians still face reduced access to fundamental services such as health care, education 
and adequate housing. The experts were informed that strategies to reduce poverty and 
enhance access to fundamental services are implemented on the basis of identified 
geographical necessity, rather than being directed at specific sectors of society, such as 
people of African descent. The experts consider that, while such an approach is beneficial 
in raising living standards in an identified geographic area, it would still be appropriate to 
have specific programmes aimed at benefiting Afro-Ecuadorian communities, wherever 
they are found.  
</p>
<p>24. The experts were informed of difficulties faced by Afro-Ecuadorian families when 
seeking rented accommodation because of racist attitudes on the part of landlords. This is 
particularly so in the case of large families seeking accommodation. Access to clean water 
was also identified as a problem among many Afro-Ecuadorian communities, including the 
communities that the experts visited in Guayaquil. In one of these communities, the experts 
were informed that drinking water had only recently been introduced and only then as a 
result of the collective efforts of the residents themselves. Access to water was also 
identified as a problem for the Afro-Ecuadorians living in the Chota valley with whom the 
experts met: in this case, it was the insufficient quantity of water to irrigate crops that was 
of concern. 
</p>
<p>25. During their visit to the communities of Cenepa on Trinitaria Island and Portete de 
Tarqui, both in the province of Guayaquil, the experts were greatly moved by the abject 
poverty of these communities and the need for immediate redress. The condition of the 
houses was precarious. The roads were mostly unpaved, unstable wooden walkways 
connected many houses that were perched over a river and improvised electrical wiring was 
draped along the street and in front of the houses, constituting a danger to all who passed 
by. Investment is urgently needed to raise the standard of housing available to the 
communities visited by the experts on Guayaquil. The experts were informed that there 
were no health clinics, public schools or childcare services in either of the communities 
visited and that the residents themselves, with the help of NGOs, meet their basic needs in 
whichever way they can. 
</p>
<p>26. As well as developing governmental programmes to provide adequate fundamental 
services for Afro-Ecuadorian communities where they are lacking, the experts encourage 
the Government to examine the work that is being carried out by NGOs in marginalized 
Afro-Ecuadorian communities, such as Cenepa and Portete de Tarqui, in order to identify 
ways in which it can collaborate with these organizations to improve access to fundamental 
services for people of African descent.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Participation in public life 
</b></p>
<p>27. CODAE plays an important role in identifying and highlighting issues of 
discrimination faced by Afro-Ecuadorians and orienting State policy to redress such 
discrimination. The experts were impressed by CODAE understanding of the challenges 
facing people of African descent and its intention to ensure the realization of the rights 
contained within the new Constitution that benefit the Afro-descendent population. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p>CODAE should not, however, be considered a substitute for participation by people of 
African descent in public life. The experts stress the need to enhance such participation in 
all spheres of public life, including political parties, the judiciary, the police force and 
professions such as education, the legal profession and academia.  
</p>
<p>28. The experts were informed that Afro-Ecuadorians lack a strong and cohesive civil 
society movement to represent and advance their interests. Efforts should be made by civil 
society and the Government to strengthen civil society so that it may effectively advocate 
for the advancement of the situation of Ecuadorians of African descent and contribute to the 
fight against the discrimination faced by them. The experts recognize the many and varied 
measures that the Government has adopted &#8212; and intends to adopt &#8212; to advance the 
situation of people of African descent, but firmly believes that civil society has a vital role 
to play in this regard that should not be overshadowed by State institutions.  
</p>
<p>29. While encouraging the Government to continue with its plans to transform its 
institutions and programmes so as to reflect the intercultural and multinational society 
referred to in the new Constitution, the experts urge the Government to take active steps to 
strengthen participation in public life by Afro-descendent civil society groups and 
movements. In the National Development Plan 2007&#8211;2010, it is stipulated that CODAE and 
the Ministry of Social Welfare will encourage the institutional development of Afro-
Ecuadorian organizations by means of technical cooperation and training in the areas of 
planning, presenting, follow-up and evaluation of programmes and projects. The experts 
welcome this commitment and encourage the relevant authorities to devote all necessary 
resources to this end.  
</p>
<p>30. The experts were informed that four Ecuadorians of African decent had been elected 
to Parliament at the last elections; however, that number is not representative of the 
percentage of the Ecuadorian population of African decent. According to the 2001 national 
census, around 5 per cent of the population is of African descent, while the 4 
parliamentarians make up just 3 per cent of the 124 members of Parliament. The experts 
were encouraged by the fact that an Electoral Council was to be created that would have 
one of its five posts designated to an Ecuadorian of African descent. The experts support 
more such affirmative action initiatives that will have the effect of strengthening 
participation by Afro-Ecuadorians in public life. Another such initiative is evidenced in the 
establishment of the Council for Citizen Participation and Social Control, which must 
include at least one representative of the Afro-Ecuadorian community.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Portrayal in the media and societal attitudes 
</b></p>
<p>31. The experts were informed on several occasions that Ecuadorians of African descent 
are often caricatured and ridiculed in the media. That the Afro-Ecuadorian population is 
often reduced to two-dimensional and humiliating stereotypes by the media is a worrying 
indication of not only a lack of sensitivity by the media, but also underlying racist attitudes 
in Ecuadorian society. In a number of meetings, the experts were told that there is a general 
tolerance in society of racist attitudes towards people of African descent and that 
unflattering stereotypes portrayed in the media are just a reflection of this wider 
phenomenon. The Government is encouraged to implement an awareness-raising campaign 
to educate the public about racism directed at people of African descent. The media should 
be engaged as an active participant in this campaign.  
</p>
<p>32. Members of the public service are not separate from society, and racist attitudes in 
society towards people of African decent are also found in members of such institutions as 
the police force. One case of particular resonance that was brought to the attention of the 
experts on several occasions is that of the detention and alleged mistreatment of 23 young 
men of African descent by the police in a public park on 13 April 2008. According to the 
information received, the reason given by the police for their arrest was that they were </p>


<p>GE.10-10207 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>acting suspiciously. The same source explained that the men were, in fact, preparing for a 
football game. The case is widely seen as one of racial profiling by the police against Afro-
descendents and caused much controversy. It is worth noting that the police carried out the 
operation accompanied by the media. The resulting media coverage in no way advanced the 
cause of combating the negative stereotyping of people of African descent. The experts 
were informed that a police superintendant had been sanctioned over the incident, but not 
the officer who was in charge of the operation. The experts recommend that an independent 
body be charged with the investigation of this and any other case of alleged racial profiling 
by the police. 
</p>
<p>33. The National Plan against Racism and Discrimination that is currently being 
formulated by the Government should include measures that address the portrayal of 
negative stereotypes of Afro-descendents in the media and promote positive change in 
societal attitudes towards this sector of the Ecuadorian community. The experts were 
informed that the National Ombudsman&#8217;s Office had taken action in the case of a racist 
radio advertisement in the lead-up to the last elections, referring the case to the relevant 
electoral body. The Ombudsman&#8217;s Office has a vital role to play in advancing the fight 
against discrimination in Ecuador, and the experts encourage the Office to contribute 
actively to the development of the National Plan against Racism and Discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Poverty 
</b></p>
<p>34. Of all issues negatively affecting Ecuadorians of African descent, the experts found 
that poverty is one of the most pernicious. During their visits to Afro-Ecuadorian 
communities in the province of Guayaquil, the experts found conditions of poverty where 
living standards were well below acceptable international standards. According to the 2001 
census, 70.3 per cent of Afro-Ecuadorians live in poverty, while the national average is 
61.3 per cent. There is also a notable difference between levels of poverty in urban centres 
and rural contexts. While the level of poverty of Afro-Ecuadorians in urban centres is 62.6 
per cent, the level of poverty of Afro-Ecuadorians in rural areas is 87.2 per cent.4<b> </b> 
</p>
<p>35. Poverty among Ecuadorians of African descent is, to a large degree, caused by the 
high levels of unemployment that they experience. Where employment is found, it is often 
unskilled and poorly paid. A large number of households consist of a single mother and her 
children surviving on the sole, small salary that she obtains. The experts were informed that 
over 50 per cent of women of African descent who have employment engage in unstable, 
informal jobs. Some of these women expressed their concerns to the experts that new laws 
that combat the informal economy (illegal importation of goods) place their livelihoods at 
risk and their ability to support their families financially. While the experts recognize the 
Government&#8217;s responsibility to regulate imports, they suggest that projects for alternative 
means of income generation be explored as a way to minimize the impact on the families of 
African descent that have relied on the informal economy to sustain themselves.  
</p>
<p>36. During their meeting with the Quito authorities, the experts were informed that 
Afro-descendents living in the national capital also suffer from high levels of poverty. 
While the percentage of the general population living in poverty (measured on the basis of 
basic necessities unsatisfied) is 33.5 per cent, the number of Afro-descendents living in 
poverty in Quito is 44 per cent. In some neighbourhoods this level rises significantly: to 45 
per cent in Calderon, 56.6 per cent in Tumbaco and 77 per cent in Quinche. In Quito, 
unemployment among Afro-descendents is also identified as a major cause of poverty.

</p>

<p><b>12</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p>37. Poverty has a negative impact on the enjoyment of many rights (such as education, 
housing and health) and reinforces negative stereotypes of Afro-descendents in the wider 
public consciousness. The experts encourage the Government to continue to implement 
programmes to alleviate the poverty endured by Afro-Ecuadorian families and to explore 
new and innovative income-generating projects. The experts took note that the Government 
is developing a plan for the redistribution of land, particularly of unused land owned by the 
Government. This would be an important economic stimulus for Afro-descendent families 
that benefit from this plan and has the potential to contribute significantly to alleviating 
poverty in rural areas. The experts suggest that any such redistribution programme should 
be accompanied by the technical assistance necessary to enable the land to be a viable 
income-generator for the beneficiary. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Policies for the integration of people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>38. Racism in Ecuador is not manifested openly in society. There are no racist 
movements, for example. The Government recognizes that racism exists, however, and has 
taken, and continues to take, measures to combat it. The creation of CODAE represents a 
laudable initiative that demonstrates the Government&#8217;s commitment to improving the 
situation of people of African descent, including by addressing the racism and 
discrimination faced by them. Under the Government&#8217;s plan to implement the new 
constitution adopted, CODAE will be replaced by an Equity Council for Afro-descendents. 
The experts hope that this Equity Council will continue to make important strategic 
contributions to the fight against racism faced by Afro-Ecuadorians. The experts are also 
pleased to highlight that the National Plan against Racism and Discrimination currently 
being developed will include quotas for the number of Afro-Ecuadorian staff to be 
employed in the civil service. 
</p>
<p>39. The experts were pleased to hear that the Quito municipal authorities have taken 
numerous actions in favour of the Afro-Ecuadorian population, including an international 
forum of the Coalition of Latin-American and Caribbean Cities against Racism, a campaign 
to encourage literacy and the completion of studies by Afro-descendent students and the 
strategic municipal plan for overall development of the Afro-descendent population in 
Quito. Special mention should be made of the Municipal Social Council for the Elimination 
of Racial Discrimination that was created by the Quito authorities to combat discrimination 
and promote harmonious coexistence and interculturality. The Council includes both 
Government and civil society representatives. Similarly, the municipal ordinance for social 
inclusion, with an ethnocultural focus, of the Afro-Ecuadorian community is to be 
commended. This ordinance stipulates that the City of Quito must, in an equitable manner, 
incorporate the Afro-descendent population into the plans, programmes, projects and 
services that it executes. 
</p>
<p>40. At the national level, the National Development Plan 2007&#8211;2010 contains many 
policies, programmes and other elements that promote the integration of the Afro-
descendent population. The Ministry of Labour, for example, has a programme &#8220;Work 
without discrimination&#8221; which guarantees that at least 3 per cent of posts and contracts in 
the public and private sector will be for Afro-descendants. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Measures to promote a greater knowledge of and respect for the 
heritage and culture of people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>41. On several occasions, the experts were informed that there was a lack of information 
on the history and culture of Afro-Ecuadorians in school curricula and that this was one of 
the reasons that there was the scant knowledge and appreciation in the general population </p>


<p>GE.10-10207 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>of the contribution that Afro-Ecuadorians have made to the history and culture of the 
country. In a meeting with academics, the experts were informed that, since 1988, the 
culture and specific educational needs of indigenous people have been systematically 
recognized, but not those of Afro-descendents, who have generally been viewed in terms of 
how closely they approximate to the indigenous or mestizo cultures. Interest has been 
shown by the Ministry of Education in introducing ethno-education for Afro-descendents, 
but a programme is yet to be developed. Any such programme would have to be tailored to 
the specific characteristics and needs of the Afro-Ecuadorian population and should not be 
simply an adapted version of that used for indigenous communities.  
</p>
<p>42. The experts were informed that, although at the Simon Bolivar Andean University 
there is an Afro-Ecuadorian documentation fund containing a collection of oral testimonies 
and photographs that could be used in the future as the basis for research and education, 
there is currently no research centre devoted to the study of Afro-Ecuadorian culture and 
history. The creation of such a centre would greatly advance knowledge of and respect for 
the heritage and culture of people of African descent in Ecuador. In the National 
Development Plan 2007&#8211;2010, it is stipulated that the Ministries of Education and of 
Culture will create a centre for study, investigation, production and dissemination of Afro-
Ecuadorian thought and knowledge. Similarly, the plan envisages the creation by the 
Ministry of Education of an Afro-Ecuadorian commission for ethno-education and a 
university-level course of Afro-Ecuadorian studies. The experts are under the impression 
from their interviews, however, that these three measures have not yet been put into place 
and would encourage the relevant ministries to effect them as soon as possible.  
</p>
<p>43. The above-mentioned municipal ordinance for social inclusion, with an 
ethnocultural Focus, of the Afro-Ecuadorian community also stipulates that educational 
institutions in Quito must incorporate Afro-Ecuadorian history and culture in their 
curricula.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Violence and people of African descent 
</b></p>
<p>44. During their visit to Esmeraldas province, the experts received information 
concerning alarming levels of violence that are affecting some communities there, 
particularly Afro-Ecuadorian youths, as a result of the influence of illegal armed actors 
from Colombia and the illicit drug trade. The experts were informed that members of illegal 
armed groups from Colombia are crossing into Ecuador and pressuring farmers to sell their 
land and recruiting young men from Afro-descendent communities. Also, young 
Ecuadorians are crossing into Colombia to work cultivating and harvesting coca. This 
situation is a source of violence that requires the urgent attention of the Ecuadorian 
authorities. 
</p>
<p>45. According to information received, domestic violence is prevalent in Ecuador, 
including within the Afro-Ecuadorian community. There appears to be a tacit cultural 
acceptance of this situation and recourse is also made to violence in other environments, 
such as the classroom, where some teachers use corporal punishment to reprimand children. 
It was explained to the experts that patterns of violence that are learned at home are 
repeated in other areas of daily life and, although this may be the case in Ecuadorian society 
in general, it was emphasized that this is of concern within the community of African 
decent. 
</p>
<p>46. As well as the case of the detention and mistreatment of 23 young men of African 
descent by the police in Carolina Park referred to above, the experts received anecdotal 
accounts of several cases of racially motivated violence against people of African descent. 
None of these cases, they were informed, had reached the stage of being decided upon in a 
court of law. One hindrance to adequately dealing with cases of racism and racial </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p>discrimination is that, according to those interviewed, Ecuador does not have legislation 
that prohibits racism or discrimination per se. The presence of racism is an aggravating 
factor when accompanying the commission of an actionable crime but does not in itself 
constitute a crime. The experts suggest that the Government consider enacting legislation 
that specifically prohibits racism and discrimination.  
</p>
<p>47. People of African descent in Ecuador are overrepresented in detention centres in 
comparison with the general population. The experts were informed that more than 11.6 per 
cent of the incarcerated population is of African descent when, as has already been noted, 
Afro-descendents account for just over 5 per cent of the Ecuadorian population. In the city 
of Quito, 18.4 per cent of the prison population is of African descent, while they make up 
just 3.1 per cent of the city&#8217;s inhabitants. It was explained to the experts that these 
disproportionate figures may be due to the high levels of unemployment, low incomes, low 
levels of education and prevailing racism to which people of African descent are subject. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Gender perspective 
</b></p>
<p>48. The National Development Plan 2007&#8211;2010 contains several provisions designed to 
advance the situation of Afro-Ecuadorian women. Among them, it requires CODAE to 
conduct education campaigns for the general public and authorities in order to eradicate 
racism, discrimination and sexism. It stipulates that the National Council for Ecuadorian 
Women will prompt the formulation of policies to redress poverty among Afro-Ecuadorian 
women and will include a gender and ethnic perspective in all of its programmes and 
policies. It also states that the Ministry of Health, together with the Pan American Health 
Organization, will stimulate the adoption of special measures to guarantee Afro-Ecuadorian 
women&#8217;s right to health.  
</p>
<p>49. The experts believe that more needs to be done to fulfil such commitments, as 
discrimination against women of African descent and the denial of their fundamental rights 
is still widespread. Women of African descent suffer particularly from poverty, poor levels 
of education and health problems. The experts were informed that women of African 
descent are particularly affected by certain skin diseases. This phenomenon should be 
investigated by the relevant health authorities and programmes implemented to address this 
health issue.  
</p>
<p>50. The experts were concerned by the number of Afro-Ecuadorian households headed 
by single mothers and the difficult economic circumstances which they endured. Single 
Afro-Ecuadorian mothers are very often employed in low-paying, unskilled jobs, especially 
as domestic workers, where they are often unregistered, have no health insurance or 
pension and suffer other forms of exploitation. They often begin having children at a very 
young age, reducing their possibilities for completing education and training that would 
allow them more opportunities in the labour market. The experts were told that, as is the 
case in many countries, in Ecuador women are generally paid less than men for the same 
work. This disparity affects women of African descent even more so when combined with 
the racial discrimination that they face. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>The experts note with satisfaction the efforts of the Government of Ecuador to 
protect the human rights of people of African descent and to address the issues 
concerning their well-being. The experts were in a position to establish a sincere and </b></p>


<p>GE.10-10207 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p><b>frank dialogue with governmental authorities on areas of concern and to gather 
information on actions, measures and policies enacted to overcome the problems faced 
by people of African descent living in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>52.<b> The experts are concerned with the existence of a general tolerance in society of 
racist attitudes directed at people of African descent. The experts note that the 
Government is well aware of the problems faced by people of African descent in 
Ecuador and recognizes that racism exists in their country. 
</b></p>
<p>53.<b> The experts welcome the new Constitution adopted in 2008 which contains 
several provisions designed to advance the situation of people of African descent. The 
experts take note that the very specific article in the Constitution, according to which 
Afro-Ecuadorian people have collective rights, could play a positive role in addressing 
discrimination against Afro-Ecuadorian people by enhancing the enjoyment of the 
right not to be subject to racism or any other form of discrimination based on their 
origin, ethnic identity or culture.  
</b></p>
<p>54.<b> The experts perceive the current situation as a period of transition in which the 
results of legislative and institutional changes are yet to be fully seen. The experts 
encourage the Government to continue to adopt the necessary legislation which will 
offer a real opportunity to redress the historic, structural and long-endured 
discrimination faced by people of African descent in Ecuador.  
</b></p>
<p>55.<b> During the visit, the experts identified the existence of a generalized feeling 
among people of African descent of being discriminated against (structural and 
widespread in everyday life) which, according to them, is based on widely held 
stereotypes and prejudices. During the visit, the experts also identified areas where 
people of African descent find themselves in a disempowered situation vis-&#224;-vis the 
mainstream community. These areas are: access to employment, housing, education, 
access to fundamental services, and participation in public life. 
</b></p>
<p>56.<b> The experts endorse the creation of CODAE under the President&#8217;s jurisdiction. 
It was evident to the experts that CODAE plays a fundamental role in combating 
discrimination against Afro-descendents through its policy development, programmes 
and outreach to civil society. The experts view the announced replacement of CODAE 
by an Equity Council for Afro-descendents as a step forward in the fight against 
discrimination. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The experts are also pleased to highlight that the National Plan against Racism 
and Discrimination currently being developed will include quotas on Afro-Ecuadorian 
personnel in the civil service. 
</b></p>
<p>58.<b> The experts praise the efforts of the Ecuadorian authorities in providing free 
education at the primary level which enables people of African descent greater access 
to education. The experts are concerned at the higher levels of illiteracy than the 
national average among the Afro-Ecuadorian population and their traditionally lower 
levels of school attendance. The experts are specifically concerned by the limited 
number of Afro-Ecuadorian children who complete primary education, the lower 
number who continue on to secondary education and the exceptionally few who enrol 
in universities.  
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> The experts are also concerned by the absence of a multicultural approach in 
education which expresses Afro Ecuadorian history, culture and tradition. The 
experts take note of the efforts of civil society to produce educative modules on the 
history of Ecuadorians of African descent in the hope that these modules will be 
included in the syllabus of local schools. The experts invite the Government to support 
and assume a leading role in these efforts. </b></p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p>60.<b> The experts welcome the determination of the Government of Ecuador to fight 
poverty and, at the same time, they wish to stress that &#8212; of all issues negatively 
affecting Ecuadorians of African descent &#8212; poverty is one of the most pernicious. 
When employment is found, it is often unskilled and poorly paid. The experts 
encourage the Government to continue to implement programmes to alleviate the 
poverty endured by Afro-Ecuadorian families and to explore new and innovative 
income-generating projects. 
</b>61.<b> The experts take note of the investment by the Ecuadorian authorities of an 
unprecedented amount of resources in social services designed particularly to benefit 
poorer sectors of society. They recommend, however, that additional measures be 
taken to enable Afro-Ecuadorians equal access to fundamental services such as health, 
education and adequate housing.  
</b></p>
<p>62.<b> The experts are concerned by the implementation of the strategy to reduce 
poverty and enhance access to fundamental services on the basis of identified 
geographical necessity, rather than with a focus on specific sectors of society, such as 
people of African descent. The experts consider that such an approach should be 
supplemented with specific programmes aimed at benefiting Afro-Ecuadorian 
communities, wherever they are found. 
</b></p>
<p>63.<b> The experts were informed that Afro-Ecuadorians lack a strong and cohesive 
civil society movement to represent and advance their interests. They are similarly 
concerned by the apparent lack of systematic and continual communication between 
NGOs, as well as between NGOs and Government.  
</b></p>
<p>64.<b> The experts take note of the efforts of the Ecuadorian authorities in support of 
the participation of people of African descent in public life and decision-making 
processes through various initiatives at the central, regional, municipal and 
community level. They stress the need to enhance such participation in all spheres of 
public life, including political parties, the judiciary, the police force and professions 
such as education, the legal profession and academia. The experts urge the 
Government to take steps to strengthen participation in public life by Afro-descendent 
civil society groups and movements. 
</b></p>
<p>65.<b> The experts also endorse the establishment of an Afro-Ecuadorian 
documentation fund at the Simon Bolivar Andean University. The experts are 
concerned by the absence of a research centre devoted to the study of Afro-
Ecuadorian culture and history. 
</b></p>
<p>66.<b> The experts are specifically concerned by the alarming levels of violence 
affecting some communities, domestic violence within Afro-descendent families and 
cases of detention and mistreatment of people of African descent by the Ecuadorian 
police. The experts underline the present situation of overrepresentation of people of 
African descent in detention centres as compared with the general population. 
</b></p>
<p>67.<b> The experts are concerned by the representation of Afro-Ecuadorians in the 
media, specifically the presence of stereotypes and prejudices connected with Afro-
Ecuadorian people. The experts were informed on several occasions that Ecuadorians 
of African descent are often caricatured and ridiculed in the media. 
</b></p>
<p>68.<b> The experts note the measures contained in the National Development Plan 
2007&#8211;2010 to advance the situation of Afro-Ecuadorian women. The experts perceive 
that gender discrimination is exceptionally rife in the field of protection, poverty, 
education, work and equal remuneration. The experts are specifically concerned by 
the situation of under-age and single-parent mothers and women who are domestic 
workers. </b></p>

<p><b>  Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> The Working Group urges the Government to address the condition of 
widespread poverty of Afro-Ecuadorian people with investment targeted at this 
particular group. 
</b></p>
<p>70.<b> The Working Group calls upon the Government to adopt a specific law to 
combat ethnic, racial and gender discrimination and to establish a monitoring 
mechanism to examine cases of discrimination against people of African descent. 
</b></p>
<p>71.<b> The Working Group urges the Government to enhance its efforts to promote 
respect for Afro-Ecuadorian people, their culture, traditions and contribution to 
Ecuadorian society. To this end, a national campaign should be initiated to promote 
multiculturalism and respect for the dignity of the Afro-Ecuadorian people, their 
culture and traditions. 
</b></p>
<p>72.<b> The Working Group calls upon the Government to take measures to reduce the 
educational gap that exists between Afro-Ecuadorians and the wider population and 
counter inequalities in educational outcomes. 
</b></p>
<p>73.<b> The Working Group emphasizes that all health and other basic services should 
be made readily accessible, as rapidly as possible, to all Ecuadorians of African 
descent. 
</b></p>
<p>74.<b> The Working Group considers that ethno-education is needed to familiarize 
people of African descent with their own history and culture, and also expose the 
wider community to the histories and cultures of others. 
</b></p>
<p>75.<b> The Working Group underlines that Afro-Ecuadorian civil society 
organizations, as well as the Afro-Ecuadorian people themselves, have an essential 
role to play in the construction of a just and democratic multicultural society. The 
Working Group recommends that associations of people of African descent should 
devise strategies for cooperating and establishing a common platform to act as an 
interface with the governmental authorities to voice the concerns and needs of people 
of African descent in Ecuador. They should also plan concerted actions directed at 
improving the situation of people of African descent in the country. 
</b></p>
<p>76.<b> The Working Group considers that the media has a particular responsibility, 
and important role, in combating discrimination and racism directed at the Afro-
Ecuadorian population. In the absence of adequate legislation, the Working Group 
urges the media to adopt measures for monitoring and self-regulation, in order to 
eliminate all vestiges of racism and ethnic discrimination in their programmes and 
other content. Equally, the Government should support specific training of the media 
on overcoming discrimination against Afro-Ecuadorian people. 
</b></p>
<p>77.<b> The Working Group urges the Government to redouble its efforts to ensure the 
full participation of Afro-Ecuadorian people in public affairs and instruct relevant 
authorities to take appropriate measures to ensure that Afro-Ecuadorian people 
participate at all levels of public administration. 
</b></p>
<p>78.<b> The Working Group encourages universities and research institutions to make 
greater efforts to study the culture of Afro-Ecuadorian people. Institutional policies 
should be developed to include the largest possible number of Afro-Ecuadorian 
researchers and professionals in these projects. The Working Group calls on the 
Government to support the establishment of a centre for Afro-Ecuadorian studies as a 
tool for preserving the history, traditions and culture of the Afro-Ecuadorian people. </b></p>


<p><b>18</b> GE.10-10207 
</p>
<p>79.<b> The Working Group urges the Government to further support the ongoing 
development of free legal aid as a measure to combat the overrepresentation of Afro-
Ecuadorian people in detention centres. 
</b></p>
<p>80.<b> As a measure to address stereotypes and prejudice directed at Afro-Ecuadorian 
people, the Working Group emphasizes the necessity of relevant training for specific 
professional groups (police, lawyers, judges and teachers). 
</b>81.<b> The Working Group urges the Government to strengthen the Office of the 
Ombudsman, including by creating a separate sub-unit dedicated to Afro-Ecuadorian 
people. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Working Group emphasizes that particular attention should be paid to the 
situation of Afro-Ecuadorian women (regarding such issues as education and work 
and as victims of violence). Special programmes are needed to educate women and 
provide them with the opportunity to achieve the qualifications necessary to attain 
more rewarding employment. There is also a need for a quota system and special 
protection mechanisms that are easily accessible to women.
