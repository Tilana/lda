<p><b>  Report of the independent expert on the situation of human 
rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, Doudou Di&#232;ne 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 The present report is based on two visits by the independent expert to C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, from 14 to 25 November and from 7 to 13 December 2011, and is intended to 
give an overview of the human rights situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and related institutional 
issues as of 26 December 2011. 
</p>
<p> Since President Alassane Ouattara was sworn into office, the security situation 
has gradually improved. Nevertheless C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has been traumatized by the many 
crises it has suffered in the past decade and is still recovering.  
</p>
<p> In this context, the holding on 11 December 2011 of legislative elections judged 
by all observers to have been well organized from a technical point of view, despite the 
polarization stemming from the handing over of former president Laurent Gbagbo to the 
International Criminal Court on 30 November 2011 and the boycott of the elections by 
his party, was an important step in the country&#8217;s return to normal. Yet many challenges 
remain. Some are linked to deep-rooted causes that pre-date the post-election crisis, 
including the link between access to land and tensions between communities, especially 
in the country&#8217;s western part. 
</p>
<p> The challenges include, among others, restoring security throughout the country 
and along its borders, reforming the security sector, restoring the rule of law and justice, 
combating impunity, promoting reconciliation, strengthening social cohesion and the 
ability to live together, restoring the State&#8217;s sovereignty and re-establishing its services 
countrywide, reviving the economy, reducing poverty, and ensuring the 
protection/return/reintegration of displaced and refugee populations. 
</p>
<p> In this context the independent expert also wishes to highlight the most 
significant human rights violations brought to his attention, such as violations of the 
right to life, acts of torture, degrading and inhuman treatment, arbitrary arrests, rapes, 
violations of freedom of expression, racketeering and extortion, attacks and violent acts 
against religious buildings and leaders, and violations of the right to education, health 
and food. Intercommunity tensions persist in the country&#8217;s western part and require swift 
steps by the Government to facilitate peaceful coexistence among communities and

</p>
<p>prevent intercommunity violence, which often results in serious human rights violations. 
</p>
<p> Most human rights violations result less from the State&#8217;s complicity than from its 
failure to prevent them, especially because of the difficulty of reforming the security 
sector and re-establishing the Government&#8217;s authority over the country&#8217;s entire territory.  
</p>
<p> Combating impunity must remain a priority in order to break the vicious circle 
perpetuated by the repetition of human rights violations in the country since 1999. The 
current transitional justice processes, including the work of the Dialogue, Truth and 
Reconciliation Commission, must tackle the underlying causes of the crisis and focus on 
the victims of human rights violations, respecting their right to receive reparation and not 
to be subjected to renewed human rights violations. 
 The impartiality and independence of transitional judicial and non-judicial justice 
mechanisms must be preserved. In this connection, it is vital to prosecute perpetrators of 
human rights violations regardless of their political, tribal, regional or religious 
affiliations.  
</p>
<p> The deeply rooted culture of coexistence developed over time by the Ivorian 
people as a whole and based on its rich ethnic, cultural and religious diversity must be 
strengthened and nourished by respect for human rights and the principles and rules of 
democracy.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This report is submitted pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 17/21, in 
which the Council established the mandate of independent expert on the human rights 
situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and requested the expert to submit a report on his activities for 
consideration at its nineteenth session.  
</p>
<p>2. The report covers the period from 1 November to 26 December 2011. It is based on 
two visits to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the first from 14 to 25 November 2011 and the second from 7 to 
13 December 2011. It contains a list of recommendations addressed to the Government of 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and to the international community.  
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert would like to thank the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire for 
making it possible for the two missions to be carried out under excellent conditions. During 
the missions, the independent expert listened to the views of all stakeholders in order to 
gather their views and opinions on the human rights situation and possible ways of 
improving it. In this context he met with the country&#8217;s highest authorities. He is grateful to 
President Alassane Ouattara for his frank and clear comments. 
</p>
<p>4. The independent expert met with the Prime Minister, Guillame Soro, the Minister 
for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Human Rights and Civil Liberties, the Minister for 
Justice, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister for the Family, Women and Social Affairs, 
the Minister for Veterans and War Victims, and the chief of staff of the Minister of 
Defence.  
</p>
<p>5. The expert met with the public prosecutor, the military prosecutor, the head of the 
national police force, the chief of staff of the Forces R&#233;publicaines de C&#244;te d`Ivoire, the 
president of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the members of the 
National Human Rights Commission, the vice-president of the Independent Electoral 
Commission, the vice-president of the National Commission of Inquiry and the Special 
Investigative Unit. The independent expert also met with representatives of political parties, 
including the former president, Henri Konan Bedi&#233;; the president of the Parti D&#233;mocratique 
de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire; and leaders of the Front Populaire Ivoirien and Libert&#233; et D&#233;mocratie 
pour la R&#233;publique, including the latter&#8217;s president, Mamadou Koulibaly.  
</p>
<p>6. The independent expert met with representatives of civil society, of human rights 
organizations, of women&#8217;s organizations and of victims, with religious leaders and with 
representatives of the brotherhood of traditional hunters (Dozo). He met with 
representatives of the diplomatic community, including the Special Representative of the 
African Union for C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, and European Union officials. The expert also met with 
the Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and Head of the 
United Nations Operation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (UNOCI), Albert Gerard Koenders, and his 
deputy, Arnaud Akodjenou, who provided key support for his mission.  
7. In addition to Abidjan, the independent expert visited Korhogo, where he met with 
former president Laurent Gbagbo, Odi&#233;nn&#233;, where he met with Simone Gbagbo, and 
Boundiali, Bouak&#233;, Daloa, Katiola and Bouna, where close associates of former president 
Gbagbo are being held. In all those places the expert met with administrative, judicial and 
security authorities to hear their views on ongoing developments in their areas of activity. 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>the UNOCI Human Rights Division and his staff in Abidjan, Odi&#233;nn&#233;, Korhogo, Bouak&#233;, 
Daloa and Du&#233;kou&#233;, for their full cooperation in organizing his visits. 
</p>
<p><b> II. General situation in the country 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Political context 
</b></p>
<p>9. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, long considered a model of development and stability on the African 
continent, has for the past decade endured a tragic armed conflict that has left lasting marks 
in its populations&#8217; individual and collective consciences. A year ago the presidential 
election, which had been expected to close the door on 10 years of conflict, had instead led 
to a crisis resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, thousands of refugees and internally 
displaced people, and destruction of property.   
</p>
<p>10. On 11 December 2011, the country&#8217;s citizens elected, from a field of 1,157 
candidates, 255 representatives for the 2011&#8211;<footnote name="2">2. The police and the gendarmerie lack the human and logistical resources needed 
properly to perform their law-enforcement functions. The police are not fully operational 
and some police stations are still occupied by FRCI members. 
</footnote>016 legislative term. This was the first 
election held since the presidential election of November 2010 and the first legislative 
election since 2000. The Front Populaire Ivoirien was weakened by the post-election crisis 
after the arrest or exile of its leaders, including Laurent Gbagbo, who is now being held by 
the International Criminal Court. Despite the call by the Front Populaire Ivoirien to boycott 
the elections, around ten of its members ran as independent candidates. 
</p>
<p>11. The independent expert visited several polling stations in Abidjan, accompanied by 
diplomats and heads of agencies, as part of the observer mission organized by the Special 
Representative. In the view of regional and international observers, the elections generally 
proceeded smoothly. Recorded incidents were not such as to call the results into question.  
</p>
<p>12. On 15 December 2011 the Independent Electoral Commission published the election 
results, according to which President Ouattara&#8217;s party, Rassemblement des R&#233;publicains, 
had won 127 seats, or 50 per cent of the total. The other results were as follows: Parti 
D&#233;mocratique de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire &#8211; 77 seats, or 30.<footnote name="3">5. The military prosecutor has also launched investigations into crimes and other 
offences committed during the post-election period by officers and members of the armed 
forces and the police when the former Forces de D&#233;fense et de Securit&#233; were in control. 
</footnote>1 per cent; independent candidates &#8211; 35 
seats, or 13.<footnote name="7">. Second Lieutenant Herv&#233; Zakro  
</footnote>8 per cent; Union pour la D&#233;mocratie et la Paix &#8211; 7 seats, or 2.<footnote name="7">7. The independent expert received information on the extortion and harassment to 
which economic actors were subjected by members of FRCI and unidentified armed 
groups. This scourge also contributes to rising food prices, putting more pressure on a 
population that is already severely affected by the post-election crisis. He observed that the 
Government had begun dismantling unofficial checkpoints throughout the country. 
</footnote>6 per cent; 
Rassemblement des Houphou&#233;tistes pour la D&#233;mocratie et la Paix &#8211; 4 seats, or 1.<footnote name="5">6. The independent expert is troubled by reports of attacks and violent acts against 
religious buildings and leaders. Some 40 attacks against religious buildings and leaders by 
FRCI members and unidentified armed men have been documented since the end of August </footnote>7 per 
cent; Mouvement des Forces d&#8217;Avenir &#8211; 3 seats, or 1.18 per cent; and Union pour la C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire &#8211; 1 seat, or 0.<footnote name="3">3. In response to the independent expert&#8217;s question about the detention of the personal 
physicians of the Gbagbo couple, prosecutor Kouadio said that former president Gbagbo&#8217;s 
doctor was charged with &#8220;breach of state security&#8221;, and that Ms. Gbagbo&#8217;s doctor was 
caring for her, at her request and for humanitarian reasons. The independent expert 
especially commends the prosecutor for his candour and for making himself available. The 
prosecutor acted on his request to have Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s physician transferred from his place 
of detention at Compagnie territoriale de Korhogo quarters to the Abidjan Detention and 
Correction Centre. The physician was later provisionally released, along with two 
journalists imprisoned on the same charges.  
34. When asked about the sentiment of victor&#8217;s justice apparently felt by some inside 
and outside the country, prosecutor Kouadio said: &#8220;I will, if I am able to, send investigation 
teams back to the west to look into crimes that were allegedly committed there during the 
post-election crisis.&#8221; The prosecutor described some difficulties with ongoing 
investigations, including a lack of expertise in forensic science. 
</footnote>9 per cent. 
</p>
<p>13. According to the Independent Electoral Commission the level of participation was 
36.<footnote name="5">5. In addition, 27 cases of torture and inhuman and degrading treatment and 22 cases of 
arbitrary arrest involving FRCI members have been reported. There have also been reports 
of abuses by the Dozo resulting from their frequent participation in law-enforcement 
operations. Intercommunity violence, often triggered by murder, adultery, destruction of 
property or actions by FRCI members or Dozo, has been reported in Tahoubly-Ga&#233; (10 km 
west of Bangolo), Karabiri (115 km from Odienn&#233;) and Bateguedea II (30 km from Daloa). 
At least six people died in these incidents, many were wounded and 45 houses were 
destroyed. 
</footnote>6 per cent. This relatively low level can be explained in particular by the traumatic 
effect on the population of the violence that followed the most recent presidential election.  
</p>
<p>14. The independent expert regrets that efforts by the Government and the Special 
Representative of the United Nations to convince all political parties to participate in the 
elections were not successful. Their participation could have strengthened national 
reconciliation and the country&#8217;s fragile democracy. The leaders of the Front Populaire 
Ivoirien with whom the independent expert met interpreted the low level of participation in 
the legislative elections as the population&#8217;s condemnation of the Government through a 
boycott, which the Front Populaire Ivoirien had in fact called for. They also complained 
that their leaders had been detained and their assets frozen. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The challenge of identity 
</b></p>

<p><b>6</b> GE.12-10060 
</p>
<p>political manipulation of ethnicity, exacerbated by the recurring issue of rural land 
ownership. 
</p>
<p>16. In 2004, under his previous mandate as Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms 
of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, the independent expert 
observed during his visit to C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire that its society was marked by something he 
believes is characteristic of all multi-ethnic societies, namely an undercurrent of ethnic and 
cultural tension, which can be transformed into conflict or coexistence, depending on the 
ideological or economic context, but ultimately also depending on the moral outlook and 
practices of political leaders. Against this background of identity-related tension, the 
Special Rapporteur observed that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was racked by division and discrimination. 
</p>
<p>17. In the independent expert&#8217;s view the inter-ethnic fabric has unravelled, especially in 
the west, where issues relating to land ownership and coffee and cocoa growing have 
become a focal point for tensions between indigenous and non-indigenous population 
groups. The independent expert visited Daloa and Du&#233;kou&#233; and observed that, despite the 
seeming calm, tensions between various ethnic and religious groups persist and 
occasionally lead to serious human rights violations. This situation requires immediate 
action by the Government and other stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>18. The independent expert also noted the continued use in certain media, particularly 
online social networks, of rhetoric advocating tribal and religious hatred. This situation is 
alarming and may lead to the polarization of the country&#8217;s society along ethnic, community 
and religious lines and hinder ongoing efforts to achieve national reconciliation. 
</p>
<p><b> C. The challenge of security 
</b></p>
<p>19. Security is a key factor in the country&#8217;s crisis. The Government is making efforts to 
improve security, which remains a problem in most areas. The country is still fragile, as 
during convalescence, after a deep and lasting trauma caused by a climate of insecurity 
affecting the personal, family and professional spheres.  
</p>
<p>20. Security remains a problem in some parts of Abidjan and in the western part of the 
country, which has seen the most serious human rights violations of the post-election crisis. 
The authorities have noted an increase in abuses and serious crime, especially in Abidjan 
and the west. In Abidjan between June and November 2011 this increase in crime mainly 
involved car robberies and armed attacks, particularly in the communes of Cocody and 
Yopougon. 
</p>
<p>21. The police and the gendarmerie, water, forestry, border-control and justice services 
have been restored in the central, northern and western areas, which were formerly under 
the control of the Forces Nouvelles rebels. This vigorous effort by the State to assert its 
authority throughout the country involves restoring the operational capacity of public 
authorities by appointing Government representatives for each administrative district. In 
some areas the process is going smoothly with the cooperation of the Forces R&#233;publicaines 
de C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire (FRCI), which until now performed key State functions. In other areas, 
particularly those formerly controlled by the Forces Nouvelles, including the north and 
west, there are continuing tensions between the new authorities and FRCI commanders. 
</p>

<p>GE.12-10060 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>forces have been redeployed to places in the west such as Blol&#233;quin and Zouan-Hounien, to 
which large numbers of people are returning. In response to repeated abuses perpetrated 
against inhabitants by FRCI troops, the President has taken steps to strengthen collective 
security, which include confining FRCI members to barracks and establishing a military 
police force. 
</p>
<p>24. The independent expert has also received information about difficulties encountered 
in merging the former Forces de D&#233;fense et de S&#233;curit&#233; with former Forces Nouvelles 
rebels in the ranks of the FRCI. The promised creation of a national army reflecting the 
country&#8217;s ethnic, religious and cultural diversity has been delayed because those who 
participated in the rebellion have differing backgrounds and have not all received standard 
military training. On the other hand, the fact that many former Forces Nouvelles officers 
are also former members of the national army may facilitate the building of the new, 
supposedly national army&#8217;s esprit de corps. Furthermore, there has already been 
cooperation between the Forces de D&#233;fense et de S&#233;curit&#233; and the Forces Nouvelles in the 
Integrated Command Centre, set up under the Ouagadougou Political Agreement, which 
could serve as a basis and inspiration for creating a new integrated army. 
</p>
<p><b> D. The challenge of economic recovery 
</b></p>
<p>25. The protracted crisis in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has deeply shaken the country&#8217;s economic 
system because it has lasted so long and been characterized by violent predatory behaviour 
and social marginalization. In the independent expert&#8217;s view, the post-election crisis and the 
sanctions imposed by the international community have negatively affected the country&#8217;s 
economy. The country is cash-starved and many financial establishments and companies 
have closed their doors because of poor security and the suspension of the bank clearing 
system by the Central Bank of West African States. Owing to the long political and military 
crisis, the growth rate fell by 5 per cent in 2011, according to the latest estimates by the 
Bretton Woods institutions, which date from September 2011. 
</p>
<p>26. The Government has clearly identified economic recovery as a priority in order to 
increase opportunities for wealth creation and improve people&#8217;s living conditions. With this 
in mind, the Government has committed itself to conducting its affairs in an effective, 
rigorous and transparent manner. The President has also begun holding periodic 
governmental workshops to ensure better focus and continuous feedback for its action. 
</p>
<p>27. The independent expert takes note of the Government&#8217;s resolve to provide 
employment to former combatants and to young people. He has also learned that a large 
proportion of robberies and attacks on homes appear to be the work of second-string FRCI 
members who, knowing they will not be enlisted into the new army, are committing abuses 
against the population. The independent expert believes that the future of human rights 
protection in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire depends partly on how the Government handles the disarming, 
demobilization and reintegration of former combatants.  
</p>
<p><b> E. The challenge of combating impunity 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Judicial mechanisms 
</b>28. The role of the country&#8217;s legal system in the post-election crisis has been mixed. An 
immediate cause of the crisis was the Constitutional Council&#8217;s controversial decision to 
invalidate the results of the second round of the presidential elections of November 2010 in 
certain northern electoral districts that are strongholds of the Rassemblement des 
R&#233;publicains. This idea was expressed forcefully by the president of the Supreme Court on 
Wednesday, 16 November 2011 in his speech at the ceremonial opening of the 2011&#8211;2012 </p>

<p>session: &#8220;It may seem unseemly to preen in front of the people by showing off statistics on 
decisions handed down during the year when that people has been deeply wounded by a 
particularly bloody post-election crisis which it attributes to a court decision.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>29. The independent expert also noted that the violence following the second round of 
the presidential elections of November 2010 had damaged 17 of 34 courthouses. Twenty-
two of 33 prisons were also damaged and looted. On 17 October 2011, the President signed 
decrees 2011-298 and 2011-299 pertaining to the appointment of 75 judges to the 3 appeals 
courts and 195 to the country&#8217;s 9 higher courts and its 25 lower courts. On 4 November 
2011, at the ceremonial opening of the new court session, the President announced that 
budgetary funding for the judicial system would rise by 2 per cent to 3 per cent and be 
accompanied by a lump sum of 225 billion CFA francs over a five-year period. 
</p>
<p>30. The independent expert commends the work done by UNOCI, with donor support, 
to renovate and furnish the 17 courthouses affected by the crisis. Of the 34 jurisdictions, 32 
are now operational, although 25 of the courthouses are not yet properly equipped. In 
September and October 2011 6 prisons were renovated, bringing the number of working 
prisons to 10 out of 33.  
</p>
<p>31. On 24 June 2011 the Government established the Special Investigative Unit at 
Abidjan&#8217;s court of first instance. It has a renewable 12-month mandate to investigate events 
that occurred in the country on or after 4 December 2010. 
</p>
<p>32. With regard to legal proceedings under way, the Abidjan public prosecutor informed 
the independent expert that more than 5,000 individuals had already been questioned, 
including 78 for financial offences and plundering, and more than 830 persons in the 
country&#8217;s western part. In addition to investigating financial offences that had harmed the 
State and international organizations, he has initiated an investigation into crimes against 
State security and certain violent crimes, including the kidnapping of the director of the 
Novotel Hotel (in connection with which 22 people have been arrested and imprisoned) and 
the assassination of Colonel Dosso. He added that he had not yet launched an investigation 
into crimes against the physical integrity and assets of individuals.

<p>jurisdiction in two letters to the Court&#8217;s Prosecutor dated 14 December 2010 and 3 May 
2011. 
</p>
<p>37. On 3 October 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber III authorized the prosecutor to investigate, 
<i>proprio motu</i>, crimes falling under the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction which had allegedly been 
committed in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire since 28 November 2010, as well as any future crimes that 
might be committed in the prevailing situation. Former president Laurent Gbagbo was 
handed over to the International Criminal Court by the Ivorian authorities on 29 November 
2011 pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the Court on 23 November 2011. According to 
the Court, Laurent Gbagbo bore individual criminal responsibility, as an indirect 
perpetrator, for four counts of crimes against humanity, involving murder, rape and other 
sexual violence, acts of persecution and other inhuman acts, which were allegedly 
committed in the context of post-election violence on the territory of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire between 
16 December 2010 and 12 April 2011. 
</p>
<p>38. On 5 December 2011 Pre-Trial Chamber III of the International Criminal Court set 
18 June 2012 as the opening date for the confirmation of charges hearing in the case <i>The 
Prosecutor v. Laurent Gbagbo</i>. The decision was announced during Laurent Gbagbo&#8217;s first 
appearance before the Court. During the hearing, Pre-Trial Chamber III, in the presence of 
the prosecution and the defence, ascertained Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s identity and ensured that he had 
been informed of the charges against him and of his rights under the Rome Statute. 
</p>
<p>39. In response to the independent expert&#8217;s questions about coordination between 
domestic prosecution and the International Criminal Court, the Ivorian judicial authorities 
confirmed that on 18 October 2011 the Government had signed a cooperation agreement 
with the Court. It was in the framework of that agreement that the Government had helped 
to enforce the warrant for the former president&#8217;s arrest. According to the authorities, the 
transfer of Mr. Gbagbo to The Hague had been carried out in full compliance with the 
country&#8217;s laws on judicial cooperation and extradition. The arrest warrant, signed and 
sealed on 23 November 2011, had been duly served on Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s lawyers. He had been 
informed of his rights and the prosecutor had prepared a report of the hearing to establish 
identity. The prosecutor had also prepared a report of the arraignment. Mr. Gbagbo&#8217;s 
lawyers appeared, at the prosecutor&#8217;s request, before the court&#8217;s indictment division, which 
handed down its decision. Laurent Gbagbo&#8217;s lawyers contended that the former president&#8217;s 
transfer constituted a kidnapping. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Non-judicial mechanisms 
</b>40. The Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established under order 
No. 2011-167 of 13 July 2011. Its purpose is to work independently to ascertain the truth 
about past and recent national socio-political events in order to achieve national 
reconciliation based on respect for the Ivorian people&#8217;s differences and coexistence. 
</p>

<p><b>10</b> GE.12-10060 
</p>
<p>43. Having held consultations with various stakeholders, the independent expert wishes 
to stress that the establishment of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission did 
not follow the usual pattern of such commissions elsewhere in the world. The president of 
the Commission was appointed before the Commission&#8217;s terms of reference had been 
established, and the Commission&#8217;s legal framework had been adopted without national 
consultations. From the substantive angle, the order establishing the Commission does not 
seem to have sufficiently emphasized the role of justice in the Commission&#8217;s mandate and 
fails to include all the necessary guarantees of independence and effectiveness. 
</p>
<p>44. Despite these limitations, the independent expert believes that the Commission&#8217;s 
members can fulfil their mission if they receive the necessary support from the 
Government, the various components of Ivorian society and the international community. 
All the stakeholders with whom he met acknowledged the crucial role that the Commission 
could play in the country&#8217;s return to stability. They nevertheless emphasized that 
reconciliation would take time, as the wounds were still fresh, so to speak. The 
establishment and functioning of the Commission should proceed in a deliberate manner, 
and wide consultations should be held with social groups in order to enhance the 
Commission&#8217;s legitimacy and seek the views of various populations on those aspects of its 
mandate that were not made sufficiently clear at the outset. In developing its rules of 
procedure and other strategic and operational documents the Commission will have a 
further opportunity to affirm its independence. 
</p>
<p>45. The independent expert welcomed the spirit of openness shown by the 
Commission&#8217;s president Charles Konan Banny, the commitment of the Commission&#8217;s 
members and technical staff and the willingness of technical and financial partners to 
support the process of transitional justice in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
46. Decree No. 2011-176 of 20 July 2011 established the National Commission of 
Inquiry, whose mandate is to investigate violations of human rights and humanitarian law 
that occurred between the presidential elections of 31 October and 28 November 2010 and 
15 May 2011. The commission has a six-month mandate which can be renewed once. 
</p>
<p>47. The independent expert has determined that C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire is undergoing a 
transitional justice process with not only domestic and international judicial aspects but also 
non-judicial aspects involving several mechanisms such as the National Commission of 
Inquiry, the Special Investigative Unit, the military prosecutor&#8217;s investigations, the 
Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the International Criminal Court. 
However, coordinating these mechanisms remains a challenge. 
</p>
<p>48. The independent expert met with members of the National Human Rights 
Commission, who provided him with a copy of their 2010 report on human rights violations 
that were observed throughout the election process. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights situation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Civil and political rights 
</b></p>
<p>49. During his visit the independent expert gathered information about violations of the 
right to life, acts of torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, arbitrary detentions, rapes, 
violations of the freedom of expression, and attacks and acts of violence against religious 
buildings and leaders. 
</p>
<p>50. Non-State actors such as members of the Dozo, a brotherhood of traditional hunters, 
continue to play an important role in maintaining law and order, especially in the country&#8217;s 
west. The independent expert was told of abuses committed by some Dozo and by informal </p>


<p>GE.12-10060 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>groups with ties to former president Gbagbo. Many weapons remain in circulation and 
could be used illegally. 
</p>
<p>51. There have been at least 15 reported cases of violations of the right to life, of which 
9 are attributed to FRCI members and the remaining 6 to intercommunity violence. On 7 
December FRCI fighters manning the checkpoint at the entry to the Adjouffou 
neighbourhood of Port-Bou&#235;t in Abidjan opened fire without warning on four young 
people. Two of the victims died immediately, a third was seriously wounded and a fourth, 
as yet unidentified person managed to escape. The FRCI members loaded the two corpses 
and the wounded person onto their vehicle and drove off towards Abidjan. The wounded 
person allegedly died at the hospital and the three bodies were claimed by the families on 
12 December at Treichville University Hospital. The three individuals were Mr. Jean 
Claude Nahou&#233;, aged 36, a security agent for the Lavegarde company, Mr. Modeste Loto, 
aged 26, a student and Mr. Guy Maxime Djahi Gnoanlou, aged 35, a nurse. 
52. On 17 December a young man named Fofana Adama was arrested by an FRCI 
patrol and later died at the Vavoua hospital as a result of mistreatment by Government 
forces. In response the population organized a protest in front of FRCI headquarters, which 
very quickly became violent. FRCI members then opened fire, causing the death of five 
people. The population then ransacked all the houses belonging to FRCI. UNOCI and 
Government authorities intervened to re-establish order in the town. A similar incident was 
reported that same day at Sangon, not far from Abidjan, where a conflict between the FRCI 
and local inhabitants left at least one person wounded by gunfire. 
</p>
<p>53. In a communiqu&#233; dated 18 December 2011 General Bakayoko, chief of general staff 
of FRCI, tried to shed light on these confrontations between armed youths and FRCI 
fighters, who mortally wounded five youths. A wounded FRCI fighter was evacuated by 
UNOCI personnel, who also helped restore calm in Vavoua. The communiqu&#233; also stated 
that the President pays tribute to the memory of the dead and presents his sincere 
condolences to their families. The President instructed the Minister of Defence and the 
Minister of the Interior to restore calm in Vavoua. According to the communiqu&#233;, Corporal 
Doumbia Amara and the six soldiers who made up the FRCI patrol and were the presumed 
perpetrators of the incident were handed over to the brigade of the second legion of the 
Daloa gendarmerie for investigation. The others involved were transferred to Seguela. 
</p>
<p>54. After this further fatal incident involving FRCI, on Monday, 19 December President 
Ouattara met with the Minister of the Interior, the Deputy Minister of Defense and military 
leaders. After the meeting the Deputy Minister of Defense, Paul Koffi Koffi, speaking to 
the press about the meeting, said that the events at Vavoua had been set off by an 
unauthorized patrol by unofficial FRCI members and youths who joined them. According 
to the Deputy Minister of Defense, the President called for &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; for 
&#8220;indiscipline&#8221;, the establishment of a military police force and the rapid setting up of a unit 
to disarm such people and integrate them into the regular army. 
</p>

<p><b>12</b> GE.12-10060 
</p>
<p>2011. The recurrence and scale of the attacks, the victims and targets chosen and the modus 
operandi of these armed men suggest that the acts were carefully planned and orchestrated. 
Priests and laypeople were manhandled, humiliated and stripped naked in the attacks, and a 
number of ceremonial objects and items belonging to the clergy were removed. 
57. Because of this situation, since 17 October 2011 the Archbishop of Abidjan, Jean-
Pierre Kutwa, has met with the President and the FRCI leadership and requested and 
obtained the implementation of security measures to reassure the clergy and Christian 
worshippers. Police officers and gendarmes have been dispatched to some parishes. Despite 
these security measures, the attacks have continued. 
</p>
<p>58. On 24 November 2011, three journalists employed by <i>Notre Voie</i>, an opposition 
newspaper, were arrested for publishing articles criticizing the Government and on the 
devaluation of the CFA franc. The independent expert wishes to reiterate his commitment 
to freedom of expression, which is an essential element of democracy. The only exceptions 
to this freedom are a very limited number of situations involving incitement to ethnic, 
racial, religious or national hatred, as determined by a competent court. The expert also 
wishes to stress that media professionals must act in an ethical way. 
</p>
<p>59. The independent expert has received information about violent acts committed by 
FRCI members during Front Populaire Ivoirien meetings held in Bounoua on 19 November 
2011. Supporters of former president Laurent Gbagbo were arrested, dragged around, 
humiliated and then beaten. While no gunshot injuries were reported, eight people were 
reportedly injured in deliberate assaults. A meeting between local authorities and FRCI 
representatives enabled the planned meeting to be held without further incident at Kadjo 
Amangoua square in Bonoua, where it was chaired by the acting secretary-general of the 
Front Populaire Ivoirien. 
</p>
<p>60. The independent expert draws attention to the fact that maintaining law and order is 
first and foremost the task of the police, with the gendarmerie playing a secondary role. 
Military personnel must avoid reacting to provocation. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Refugees and internally displaced persons 
</b></p>

<p>GE.12-10060 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>Monitoring of borders and areas of return by teams from the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees made it possible to record the spontaneous return, in mid-
October 2011, of some 130,000 refugees from camps and border areas. 
</p>
<p>65. According to information provided by humanitarian actors, an estimated US$ 
291,989,445 is needed to help finance humanitarian response and emergency preparedness 
efforts. Although donors rapidly provided funding at the start of the humanitarian crisis, the 
humanitarian emergency action plan is not sufficiently financed. As of November 2011, 
humanitarian partners had access to only 34 per cent of the required funds, or US$ 
100,543,115. This lack of resources has particularly affected the humanitarian response in 
the Moyen Cavally region, even though the area between Guiglo and the Liberian border 
near Toulepleu and Zouan-Hounien was declared an emergency zone in April. 
</p>
<p>66. The independent expert is concerned that humanitarian actors are not sufficiently 
present on the spot to facilitate the return of thousands of internally displaced persons and 
refugees to these same areas and to assist and protect the most vulnerable, contribute to the 
renovation of thousands of destroyed houses and restore basic social services. A 
humanitarian response in this region could prevent new intercommunity tensions. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Women and children 
</b></p>
<p>67. Women and children have suffered greatly from the post-election crisis in C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire. The independent expert held a meeting with women&#8217;s representatives who warned 
of a resurgence of sexual and physical violence against women, especially in the west; there 
had been 71 alleged cases of rape and 215 cases of physical violence since the end of the 
post-election crisis. The perpetrators are sometimes men in uniform. The independent 
expert also received information about eight rapes, some involving girls between the ages 
of 5 and 14, that were committed in Abidjan, Bouak&#233;, Bondoukou, Issia (40 km from 
Daloa) and San-P&#233;dro. In Bouak&#233;, the victim was found dead. After these acts, four people 
were supposedly arrested. The other presumed perpetrators escaped. During his visit to 
Bouak&#233;, the independent expert was informed about 42 cases of female genital mutilation 
performed in October 2011 in Kotolo, a village in the commune of Dabakala, including 1 in 
which a 4-year-old girl died.  
</p>
<p>68. Despite campaigns by chocolate manufacturers, child labour on the country&#8217;s cocoa 
plantations remains a concern. Many children still perform dangerous tasks such as using 
machetes, spraying pesticides and handling heavy loads. This situation is a violation of 
children&#8217;s basic rights. It is important for the Government to recognize the right of the child 
to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to 
be hazardous or to interfere with the child&#8217;s education, or to be harmful to the child&#8217;s health 
or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development. 
</p>
<p>69. The Government has examined the issue and steps have been taken to address the 
problem of child labour in the cocoa sector. In fact, at the extraordinary Council of 
Ministers session of 3 November 2011, the President signed two decrees establishing, 
respectively, national and inter-ministerial monitoring committees on child trafficking, 
exploitation and labour.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Prisons 
</b></p>
<p>70. The independent expert visited the prisons of Korhogo, Odienn&#233;, Boundiali and 
Katiola, the Abidjan Detention and Correction Centre and the Abidjan military prison, 
where individuals arrested in connection with the post-election violence are being held. 
Conditions of detention for the prisoners visited were generally satisfactory. No cases of </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.12-10060 
</p>
<p>torture or inhuman and degrading treatment were pointed out during the visits. Prisoners 
have access to legal services.  
</p>
<p>71. However, in Korhogo former president Laurent Gbagbo, who was in a physically 
weakened state, complained that he was unable to communicate with his family and friends 
and that it was impossible to exercise in the prison courtyard. Two days before the expert&#8217;s 
arrival Laurent Gbagbo had been taken to the Korhogo hospital for an X-ray of his right 
arm. He also said that a team of doctors sent by the Government had visited him to assess 
his overall state of health.  
</p>
<p>72. In Odienn&#233;, Ms. Simone Gbagbo acknowledged that her conditions of detention 
were generally satisfactory. She seemed in good shape despite her diabetes and the lack of 
appropriate treatment. While she had no contact with her spouse or family, she had access 
to her legal defence team. She requested that her personal physician, who had been 
imprisoned without charge, be freed. 
</p>
<p>73. The independent expert is concerned at the conditions of detention of 27 prisoners, 
including 23 high-ranking military officials and 4 civilians, who are being held at the 
Compagnie territoriale de Korhogo in a cell measuring approximately 5m&#178;, in unsanitary 
conditions, without medical care or visits, and who are sometimes deprived of water and 
electricity for two-week periods. 
</p>
<p>74. In Boundiali, of the 25 high-ranking individuals initially detained, 15 had been 
released pending trial. A number of prisoners, such as those in Katiola, say they were 
mistreated during their arrest by FRCI members and were seriously injured without 
receiving the necessary treatment. 
</p>
<p>75. Most of the high-ranking and military officials with whom the independent expert 
met are charged with undermining State authority, failure to obey instructions, illegal 
arrests and detentions, killings, misuse of public funds, arms trafficking, illegal possession 
and sale of arms and munitions, concealment of corpses, and rapes, tribalism and 
xenophobia. They claim that the accusations against them are false and complain that their 
property has been plundered and, in most cases, their assets frozen. They said that they 
were receiving medical care as needed. They would nevertheless like to have more medical 
care adapted to their specific medical needs. They receive visits, albeit irregularly, from 
their immediate families and their siblings and parents. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Economic, social and cultural rights  
</b></p>
<p>76. The independent expert observed that the country&#8217;s economy is disintegrating 
because of the post-election crisis and the loss of means of production and subsistence 
stemming from mass violence and destruction. Supply chains, the banking system and 
commercial activity have been severely disrupted. As a result, the majority of the 
population is suffering from the disintegration of the national and local economies and is 
sinking ever deeper into poverty and precariousness.  
</p>

<p>GE.12-10060 <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>closing of schools for several months in most of the country, and more than 200 cases of 
looting or destruction of schools. At the height of the crisis at least a million children were 
deprived of schooling, while 150 schools need to be renovated and re-equipped.  
</p>
<p>79. According to some humanitarian actors, in the country&#8217;s western region thousands 
of children are denied their right to education by unsafe conditions and by population 
movements. 
</p>
<p>80. The independent expert also noted that many people have lost their identity 
documents and are consequently unable to access educational services or mechanisms to 
recover property and obtain compensation for losses. The independent expert has been 
informed of the large number of children who, because of the crisis, have not been able to 
obtain birth certificates.   
</p>
<p>81. Malnutrition remains a problem throughout the country. According to the 
authorities, more than 30 per cent of the population suffers from malnutrition. In 2000 the 
level of chronic malnutrition in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was 25.4 per cent. In 2006, with the grave 
crisis of September 2002, the level rose to 34 per cent. In 2011 the rate reached 27.3 per 
cent. In some regions, such as the north and west, the level is quite critical. The level in the 
western region of 37.7 per cent is particularly worrisome. In the west and south-west the 
area of cultivated land has decreased because of population movements and difficulty 
getting seeds and other agricultural inputs.  
</p>
<p>82. The expert notes that the Government&#8217;s policy whereby public health establishments 
should provide free care is not always followed in some parts of the country.  
</p>
<p>83. The issue of land rights in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire has been exacerbated by the various crises 
since 1999 and the resulting population movements and remains a major cause of 
intracommunity conflict, especially in the west. This situation is a major impediment to 
achieving peace and stability in the country, as well as to economic and social 
development, which in turn hinders efforts to reduce extreme poverty and implement 
sustainable environmental policies.   
</p>
<p>84. The Rural Land Act, which was passed on 18 December 1998 and promulgated on 
23 December 1998, along with the regulations implementing it (3 decrees and 15 
implementing orders) form the legal framework which makes it possible to convert 
customary (unwritten) rights into modern property rights and to secure access to land by 
those holding rural lands under customary law, as well as those with no access to land 
ownership.  
</p>
<p>85. Despite the application of this law, land issues remain a source of conflict. Such 
conflicts can be viewed as challenges to property rights which hinder social cohesion and 
result in lower agricultural production and in population movements.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Despite improved security, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire remains a fragile country that is 
recovering from several successive crises and still faces numerous challenges relating 
to security reform, economic recovery, peacebuilding and reconciliation.  
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>In this context, the comprehensive protection and promotion of human rights 
remains an absolute priority and is a factor in the voluntary and dignified return of 
internally displaced persons and refugees.  </b></p>


<p><b>16</b> GE.12-10060 
</p>
<p>88. <b>The independent expert wishes to emphasize that efforts to combat impunity 
through the implementation of transitional justice mechanisms can, provided they are 
impartial, also contribute to the return of displaced persons and refugees and the 
strengthening of national cohesion. It is thus essential for the international community 
to continue to support the Government&#8217;s efforts to tackle the many challenges 
associated with the country&#8217;s rebuilding.  
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The equating of land with ethnicity constitutes a real time bomb in the struggle 
for political power in post-Houphouet Boigny C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. The seriousness of the 
human rights violations perpetrated after the elections shows that these outbreaks are 
part of a downward spiral that is destroying the lives, property and basic human 
values of the Ivorian people. There has been so much violence for so long that a 
culture of violence is taking root in the people&#8217;s imagination and collective 
unconscious.  
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The independent expert nevertheless believes that there is hope for C&#244;te 
d&#8217;Ivoire, whose history, geography and population make it a veritable microcosm of 
the region in which it lies. The resilience of the Ivorian people, as demonstrated by the 
democratic processes under way, shows how real and solid is the culture of 
coexistence, so that in the end all political attempts to divide the people along ethnic, 
cultural or religious lines have had limited success. Attacks on the national identity 
have been stymied by the Ivorian people&#8217;s long and deep-rooted experience of living 
together. This in turn is based on a peaceful and cordial multiculturalism grounded in 
intercultural values, mechanisms and practices developed over time by communities 
that migrations, economic factors, and family and cultural ties have brought together 
on the territory of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Recommendations to the Government 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>The independent expert recommends that the Government of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire 
focus its efforts on (a) rebuilding democracy and consolidating the State apparatus; 
(b) promoting democracy and human rights; (c) promoting economic and social 
development; (d) revitalizing coexistence; and (e) strengthening cooperation and 
regional and subregional solidarity. 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Rebuilding democracy should focus on (a) achieving inclusive political 
pluralism that respects the diversity of the Ivorian people; (b) drafting a consensual 
democratic charter on ethical principles in politics; and (c) establishing independent 
institutions and mechanisms with the necessary human and material resources to 
guarantee the objectivity and impartiality of basic features of democracy such as 
elections, financing of political parties, equal access to information and 
communication, and respect for basic freedoms. 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>The independent expert recommends that cultural, ethnic and religious 
pluralism be enshrined in the Constitution as a basic value of the nation. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Government should work to ensure the success and sustainability of the 
Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, including by: (a) strengthening its 
mandate, including truth, justice and reconciliation; (b) coordinating the work of the 
various investigative bodies and mechanisms (National Commission of Inquiry and 
Special Investigative Unit) with that of the Dialogue, Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission; and (c) acknowledging the major challenge of uncovering truth by 
identifying serious human rights violations, their perpetrators and their root causes.  </b></p>


<p>GE.12-10060 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The expert also recommends that once it has finished its work, the Dialogue, 
Truth and Reconciliation Commission prepare and publish a white paper on human 
rights violations during the period 2002&#8211;2011 and on the identification of places that 
symbolize these violations for all the Ivorian people. 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>In combating impunity the justice system will need to balance the need to 
punish with the promotion of national reconciliation by impartially and systematically 
prosecuting all those who committed serious human rights violations between 2002 
and 2011. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The independent expert recommends that the Government provide the 
judiciary with the necessary human and material resources, and that it relieve the 
detention system by freeing those who have committed minor crimes and bringing the 
remaining prisoners to justice swiftly with due respect for recognized judicial 
safeguards.</b> 
</p>
<p>98. <b>The expert recommends that civil and political rights be harmonized with 
economic, social and cultural rights. In this connection the Government must make 
every effort to promote the country&#8217;s economic development and the collective 
prosperity of the Ivorian people, respecting the equality between regions and 
communities, including by implementing a socio-economic development and recovery 
plan for young people and women by establishing a dedicated cross-cutting 
government entity.</b>  
</p>
<p>99. <b>The Government should develop a nationwide rural land policy in consultation 
and cooperation with the concerned communities in order to gain a clear picture of 
the issue of land and its prosperity, break the link between land and ethnicity and 
foster cooperation and complementarity in land use for shared prosperity.</b> 
</p>
<p>100. <b>The implementation of a broad programme to educate people about human 
rights and their importance, including (a) the active promotion of the traditional 
values, practices and mechanisms of all the communities in order to foster coexistence 
and mutual respect; (b) the promotion, throughout the educational system, of a 
culture of peace, diversity and pluralism; and (c) the delivery of human rights 
education to all members of the security forces. </b> 
</p>
<p>101. <b>The expert encourages the Government to promote international regional and 
subregional cooperation, particularly in the spirit of the joint council of ministers of 
C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire and Burkina Faso. </b> 
102. <b>The expert also recommends that the Ivorian people&#8217;s rich cultural and artistic 
creativity, in particular that of the country&#8217;s youth, be encouraged not only to express 
feelings and emotions curbed and stifled by years of crisis but also the positive values 
of pluralism and coexistence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> 2. Recommendations to the international community 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>The international community must increase its involvement in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire by 
(a) steadfastly supporting the ongoing democratic process, in particular the 
strengthening of political pluralism; (b) providing assistance to the Dialogue, Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission; (c) strengthening the judiciary and the security 
apparatus; (d) supporting the promotion of human rights, particularly through 
education and material support to human rights defence organizations; and (e) 
strengthening UNOCI, particularly its Human Rights Division.</b> 
</p>
<p>104. <b>The expert calls on all international and regional financial institutions and 
bilateral partners to contribute through active cooperation to the economic recovery </b></p>
