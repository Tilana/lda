<p><b>  19</b>/&#8230;  <b>The role of good governance in the promotion and protection of 
human rights 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of 
</p>
<p>achievement of all peoples and all nations, and also the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
</p>
<p>of Action, which affirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent 
</p>
<p>and interrelated, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolution 7/11 of 27 March 2008 and all other 
</p>
<p>resolutions relating to the role of the good governance in the promotion of human rights, as 
</p>
<p>well as the United Nations Millennium Declaration,  
</p>
<p><i> Welcoming</i> the resolve of States parties to the United Nations Convention against 
</p>
<p>Corruption to fight corruption, in line with the commitment made in the 2005 World 
</p>
<p>Summit Outcome1 to make it a priority at all levels, and also welcoming the provisions of 
</p>
<p>the Convention that have led to the development of a mechanism among States parties to 
</p>
<p>review their progress on combating corruption, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> the ongoing work by several important initiatives towards the deepening of 
</p>
<p>good governance practices at the national, regional and international levels, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
*
 Non-Member State of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>

<p><i> Recognizing</i> the importance of a conducive environment, at both the national and 
</p>
<p>international levels, for the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and 
</p>
<p>of the mutually reinforcing relationship between good governance and human rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that transparent, responsible, accountable and participatory 
</p>
<p>government, responsive to the needs and aspirations of the people, including women and 
</p>
<p>members of vulnerable and marginalized groups, is the foundation on which good 
</p>
<p>governance rests, and that such a foundation is an indispensable condition for the full 
</p>
<p>realization of human rights, including the right to development, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> that good governance at the national and international levels is essential 
</p>
<p>for sustained economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and 
</p>
<p>hunger, as reflected in the 2005 World Summit Outcome, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> <i>also</i> in the above context that free trade, trade liberalization, market 
</p>
<p>access, infrastructural development, transfer of technology and capacity-building are key 
</p>
<p>factors contributing to economic development, sustainable development and poverty 
</p>
<p>eradication, and stressing further in this regard the imperative need for the international 
</p>
<p>community, through international cooperation and effective partnerships, to achieve the 
</p>
<p>Millennium Development Goals by 2015, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> the increasing awareness in the international community of the 
</p>
<p>detrimental impact of widespread corruption on human rights, through both the weakening 
</p>
<p>of institutions and the erosion of public trust in government, as well as through the 
</p>
<p>impairment of the ability of Governments to fulfil their human rights obligations, 
</p>
<p>particularly the economic and social rights of the most vulnerable and marginalized, 
</p>
<p><i> Realizing</i> that the fight against corruption at all levels plays an important role in the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights and in the process of creating an environment 
</p>
<p>conducive to their full enjoyment, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that effective anti-corruption measures and the protection of human 
</p>
<p>rights, including through strengthening transparency in government, are mutually 
</p>
<p>reinforcing and that the promotion and protection of human rights is essential to the 
</p>
<p>fulfilment of all aspects of an anti-corruption strategy, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> the importance of policy coherence and coordination in intergovernmental 
</p>
<p>processes in the area of the promotion and protection of human rights, on the one hand, and 
</p>
<p>of anti-corruption, on the other, 
</p>
<p><i> Stressing</i> <i>also</i> the importance of developing and implementing national legislation 
</p>
<p>on the promotion of access to information, as well as on the promotion of the 
</p>
<p>administration of justice to strengthen transparency, accountability and good governance at 
</p>
<p>the national level, and as applicable to the public sector, the private sector and social 
</p>
<p>partners, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> the right of every citizen to have access, in general terms of equality, to 
</p>
<p>public service in his/her country, as enshrined in article 21 of the Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights and article 25 (c) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> that a professional, accountable and transparent public service 
</p>
<p>upholding the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity is an essential 
</p>
<p>component of good governance,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> that the knowledge, awareness and attitude of public servants as 
</p>
<p>well as the promotion of a human rights culture within the public service play a vital role in 
</p>
<p>the respect for and implementation of human rights in society,  </p>


<p> 1. <i>Welcomes</i> the growing trend towards the universal ratification of the United 
</p>
<p>Nations Convention against Corruption, and encourages States that have not yet ratified this 
</p>
<p>important international instrument of ethical conduct, integrity and accountability to 
</p>
<p>consider doing so;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Underlines</i> the fact that the primary responsibility for ensuring that 
</p>
<p>professional public services uphold the highest standards of efficiency, competence and 
</p>
<p>integrity, predicated on good governance practices, including impartiality, rule of law, 
</p>
<p>transparency and accountability, lies with the State at the national level, consistent with its 
</p>
<p>international obligations, constitutional provisions and other enabling legislation;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Invites</i> the Secretary-General to ensure the upholding of the integrity and 
</p>
<p>relevance of the United Nations system in the service of humanity by, inter alia, the 
</p>
<p>promotion of system-wide coherence in the policies and operational activities of United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies, funds and programmes at the country level, while ensuring that these are 
</p>
<p>complementary to national objectives and priorities;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Invites</i> States Members of the United Nations, national human rights 
</p>
<p>institutions and non-governmental organizations to provide the Office of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>High Commissioner for Human Rights with information on good practices and their views 
</p>
<p>regarding the organization, training and education of the public service in the promotion 
</p>
<p>and protection of and respect for human rights, including with regard to impartiality, 
</p>
<p>accountability and transparency and the highest standards of efficiency, competence and 
</p>
<p>integrity, as well as activities developed to assist and support the public service at the 
</p>
<p>country level in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Requests</i> the High Commissioner, in consultation with relevant United 
</p>
<p>Nations agencies, funds and programmes, to prepare and present to the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Council, at its twenty-forth session, a comprehensive report outlining the role of the public 
</p>
<p>service as an essential component of good governance, including a compilation of best 
</p>
<p>practices based on information received from the above-mentioned stakeholders. 
</p>
<p>    </p>
