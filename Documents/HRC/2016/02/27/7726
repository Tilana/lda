<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 7/8 and 16/5, the Special Rapporteur 
on the situation of human rights defenders conducted an official follow-up visit to Togo 
from 7 to 11 October 2013, at the invitation of the Government. The purpose of the visit 
was to re-assess the situation of human rights defenders in Togo in the light of the first visit 
undertaken in 2008 and the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, 
Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human 
Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.1 An examination of the environment in which human 
rights defenders operate was of particular importance to the assessment, including the legal 
and administrative framework, institutional policies and mechanisms for the promotion and 
protection of human rights. 
</p>
<p>2. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the Prime Minister and senior with 
officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and The Consolidation of 
Democracy, Security and Civil Protection, Justice, and Labour. She also met with the 
President of the Supreme Court. The Special Rapporteur met with the High Authority for 
Broadcasting and Communications (HAAC), the Vice-President and members and staff of 
the National Human Rights Commission, and representatives of the Bar Association.  
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur also met with the members of the United Nations country 
team and with members of the diplomatic corps. She had meetings with a wide range of 
defenders and representatives of civil society, including a group from the regions. The 
Special Rapporteur thanks all those who took the time to meet with her and share their 
valuable experiences and insights, and in particular the Office of United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Togo for helping once again to organize the 
mission visit and providing the support necessary.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Background and methodology 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur conducted a first visit to Togo from 28 July to 4 August 
2008, at the invitation of the authorities. She undertook the visit together with the Special 
Rapporteur on human right defenders of the African Commission on Human and Peoples 
Rights, Reine Alpini-Gansou &#8211; the first joint visit by United Nations and African Union 
Special Rapporteurs. The mission was deemed a good practice, given that it enhanced the 
visibility of the mission, brought joint expertise and helped in the follow-up to the issues 
raised.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur conducted her follow-up visit from 7 to 11 October 2013. 
She thanks the Government of Togo for inviting her to visit the country once again. She 
nevertheless regrets that, on this occasion, the follow-up visit could not be conducted 
jointly with the Special Rapporteur of the African Commission owing to conflicting 
agendas.  
</p>
<p>6. When the Special Rapporteur first visited the country in 2008, the transition and 
reconciliation process was just commencing. In August 2006, the Government of Togo and 
all opposition parties signed a global political agreement. In 2008, nationwide consultations 
were held, reflecting the demand for truth, justice, reparation and reconciliation. She 
subsequently urged the Government to meet that demand and satisfy the expectations of the 
people of Togo and the international community. In 2009, the Truth, Justice and 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 General Assembly resolution 53/144, annex. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>Reconciliation Commission was established to investigate past violations and to address 
impunity.  
</p>
<p>7. In April 2009, the President&#8217;s half-brother was arrested in an alleged coup. The 
presidential elections of 2010 were held in a peaceful manner, despite the allegations of 
fraud made by the opposition. Although international observers noted that inadequate 
transparency measures had undermined their confidence in the elections, they did not 
challenge the outcome.  
</p>
<p>8. The parliamentary elections held in July 2013 were also conducted peacefully. The 
ruling party, Union pour la Republique (UNIR) secured an absolute majority in Parliament, 
winning 62 seats out of 91, while the new opposition coalition, Collectif Sauvons le Togo, 
took 19 seats.  
</p>
<p><b>  </b>9. The objective of the follow-up visit was to re-assess several years since the first 
visit, in the same spirit of cooperation and dialogue, the environment in which human rights 
defenders operate, also from the viewpoint of the observations and recommendations made 
by the Special Rapporteur in her first report,2 and to highlight new relevant developments.<b>  
</b></p>
<p>10. To facilitate her assessment, the Special Rapporteur referred to her previous report 
to identify progress and gaps that have emerged since her first visit. To this end, a table was 
prepared containing the main findings and recommendations made in the previous report, 
together with a summary of the inputs provided by the main stakeholders (see annex).  
</p><p>11. The information gathered during follow-up visits may, however, go beyond the 
issues initially raised in the previous report. The present report therefore provides an 
account of both aspects, namely, a follow-up assessment and an updated overview of the 
situation of human rights defenders in Togo. 
</p>
<p><b> III.  Legal and institutional framework for the promotion and 
protection of human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International level 
</b></p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur commends the authorities for their efforts to strengthen the 
legal and institutional framework, mainly through their engagement in the universal 
periodic review process and with United Nations treaty bodies. Some of the most important 
developments include the introduction of amendments to the Criminal Code, notably a 
definition of torture, and to the Individuals and Family Code (code des personnes et de la 
famille) with a view to ensuring compliance with international human rights obligations 
and standards. The Special Rapporteur believes that there is now a need to expedite the 
adoption of such amendments and to implement them so that the people of Togo may see 
real change. She encouraged the Government to ratify the United Nations treaties to which 
Togo is not yet a party,3 including the Rome Statute.

 The Optional Protocol to the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights

<p>(signed in 2009), the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of Migrant Workers 
and Members of Their Families (signed in 2011), the International Convention for the Protection of 
All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (signed in 2010), the Second Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on 
the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  </p>

<p>13. The universal periodic review of Togo was held in 2011. The Special Rapporteur is 
pleased to note that the process at the national level was participatory and inclusive, and 
that civil society actors and human rights defenders were involved. She encourages the 
Government to extend a standing invitation to the special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council.  
</p>
<p><b> B. National level 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Fight against impunity: national reconciliation process 
</b></p>
<p>14. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur encouraged the authorities to establish a truth, 
justice and reconciliation commission, and to include all victims, to provide victims, 
witnesses and perpetrators with adequate protection, to address violations committed 
against defenders, and to involve defenders fully in the reconciliation process.4 
</p>
<p>15. The Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission was established in 2009; it 
delivered its final report and recommendations in 2012. The establishment of and work 
done by the Commission was an important step towards addressing impunity for past 
violations and paving the way for national reconciliation.  
</p>
<p>16. During her follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to note that civil 
society was fully involved in the process, including through the work done by the 
Commission. Today, victims and society eagerly wait to see the effective implementation 
of the recommendations made by the Commission, and to forward in the reconciliation 
process.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Judicial system 
</b>17. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur underlined the efforts made by the authorities to 
strengthen the judicial system through the five-year reform programme, which was 
intended to address major shortcomings, including the lack of independence of the 
judiciary, access to justice and capacity of magistrates. She expressed her concern at reports 
of indirect and direct intimidation of magistrates in rural areas and nepotism in the 
nomination and promotion of magistrates.5 
</p>
<p>18. During the follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur observed that important 
challenges remained before the judicial system, including the above-mentioned issues. She 
took note of the information provided by the authorities about the adoption of the Statute of 
Magistrates, the law on legal aid, the setting-up of a training centre for justice professionals 
(centre de formation des professions de justice (CFPJ)), the construction of new prisons, 
and the creation of new jurisdictions. She welcomes the information, which indicated that a 
study on access to justice was being conducted.  
</p><p>19. With regard to the independence of the judiciary, the Special Rapporteur noted the 
creation of the Superior Judicial Council and the General Inspectorate of Judicial Services. 
She was pleased to learn about initiatives to improve the working conditions of judges at 
the Supreme Court level, and to strengthen their capacities and access to necessary 
resources.  
</p>
<p>20. During her visit, however, the Special Rapporteur noted that the impact of the 
reform programme implemented between 2006 and 2010 was perceived as insufficient. The 
independence of the judiciary, access to justice, and impunity for human rights violations

</p>
<p>were raised as some of the main difficulties in the transition and democratization process, 
as well as for the work of human rights defenders. Testimonies and reports indicated that 
impunity was widespread, and that legal proceedings against certain perpetrators, in 
particular State security forces, were rare, and that these actors enjoy almost total immunity 
for wrongful acts.6 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur believes that the strengthening of the judiciary and the fight 
against impunity should continue to be a priority for the Government and international 
donors.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Freedom of opinion and expression  
</b></p>
<p>22. During her visit in 2008, the Special Rapporteur expressed concern at the instances 
of intimidation and harassment against the media, and the illegitimate restrictions on the 
freedom of expression of those working on human rights issues.7 She also warned about the 
lack of professionalism of certain media and advised journalists to enhance the credibility 
of their profession by raising the standards of their work.8  
</p>
<p>23. During the follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur expressed her concern that 
defamation was an offence in the Criminal Code (art. 58) that carried heavy penalties, 
including fines. She moreover received information indicating that articles 82 and 95 of the 
Press and Communications Code (1998) were being used against journalists who reported 
on corruption cases.  According to article 82, those found guilty of broadcasting and 
publishing any information &#8220;at variance with reality&#8221; with the aim of &#8220;manipulating the 
conscience or misrepresenting information or acts&#8221; or any reproduction by a national media 
house or broadcasting of &#8220;news contrary to reality&#8221;, whether published or broadcast by 
foreign media, are punishable by steep fines and even temporary suspension of their 
publishing or broadcasting licence. Article 95 envisages a large fine for defamation, 
including against public officials, in connection with articles 90 and 91.  
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur reiterates that the criminalization of defamation has a 
chilling effect on freedom of expression, as it can lead to self-censorship by certain 
defenders, particularly journalists. It can unduly restrict the exercise of a fundamental right 
and contribute to the stigmatization of the work of the media and journalists. The 
criminalization of defamation may also lead to a considerable reduction in the space 
available to exercise the fundamental right to freedom of expression, which plays a key role 
in claiming other rights.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur recommends that defamation be repealed from criminal 
jurisdiction and be handled in civil jurisdiction, with penalties that are proportionate to the 
harm done. Such an act would be in accordance with the spirit of article 19 of the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and article 6 of the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders. 
</p>
<p> 26. The High Authority for Broadcasting and Communications (HAAC) is an 
independent institution charged with guaranteeing the protection and freedom of the press. 
It may grant installation and broadcast licenses to private television channels and radio 
stations. It elects its own president, vice-president and rapporteurs.  
</p>
<p>27. After her first visit in 2008, the Special Rapporteur raised concerns about the lack of 
clarity regarding the guiding procedures of the Authority, and pointed out that, in a number

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.2

</b></p>
<p>of instances, it had arbitrarily sanctioned journalists during the exercise of their right to 
freedom of opinion and expression.9 The Special Rapporteur felt the need to stress that, 
although certain Togolese journalists lacked professionalism, she believed that, when 
reviewing journalists&#8217; work, the Authority had to strike a balance between freedom of 
expression and ethics.10 
</p>
<p>28. Although relations between the Authority and the media have been tense for some 
time, they have reportedly intensified since 2008. The powers of the Authority were 
reviewed in 2009 after the National Assembly voted to amend Law No. 2004-021. The 
amended law provided that the Authority could seize the competent judicial authority and 
request it to, inter alia, &#8220;make final withdrawal of licence with seizure of equipment&#8221; and 
&#8220;suspend a newspaper from appearing on the stands for six months, in addition to the 
withdrawal of its press card&#8221; (art. 63). The law granted the Authority the prerogative to 
&#8220;organize hearings for media practitioners who may have committed serious offences&#8221; (art. 
67).  
</p><p>29. In 2011, the Human Rights Committee expressed its concern at what it considered 
unjustified restrictions to freedom of expression by HAAC, and recommended that the 
Government take all measures necessary to ensure its independence and impartiality.11 
</p>
<p>30. In February 2013, the organic law governing the functioning and attributions of 
HAAC was again amended to extend its regulatory and disciplinary powers (arts. 26, 30-31, 
57-58, 60, 62-63, 67), including of its President (art. 64). It appears that main stakeholders, 
in particular the media, were not consulted about the modifications. The changes have 
reportedly afforded the Authority disciplinary powers that do not have to be sanctioned by 
the courts. The Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court is defined as the only and 
last court of resort (art. 65) without option to appeal its decisions.  
</p><p>31. Two days after the introduction of the above-mentioned amendments, the President 
of Togo requested the Constitutional Court to review some of the problematic provisions 
introduced. In March 2013, the Constitutional Court issued a decision in which it 
established that certain provisions of the new law on HAAC were unconstitutional, 
including articles 58, 60 (points 5 and 6), 62 (last point); 63 (points 3 and 4), 64 and 67.  
32. The Special Rapporteur considers that the above-mentioned amendments to the law 
on the functions and powers of HAAC may be a reaction to the deterioration of the 
environment in which the media operate. Nonetheless, while regulation by a strong and 
independent body might be at times necessary, the Special Rapporteur believes that self-
regulation is an option that should be considered. This would allow the media and 
journalists themselves to be engaged actively in restoring credibility to their profession.  
33.  In this context, the Special Rapporteur believes that the role, functions and 
capacities of the Togolese Media Observatory, established by journalists in 1999, could be 
strengthened. She was pleased to learn from the Government that HAAC was currently 
working with the Observatory on a protocol to facilitate co-regulation. In this process, 
media and journalists should be supported by all stakeholders.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>34. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur was informed that the exercise of the right to 
freedom of peaceful assembly was problematic. According to the Act on Freedom of 
Association and Assembly of 1901, the exercise of this right is governed by a regime of

</p>
<p>notification: organizers were required to inform law enforcement authorities of a planned 
demonstrations, permission for which may refuse if the demonstration is considered a threat 
to law and public order. The Special Rapporteur reported on certain cases where the 
exercise of this fundamental freedom had been problematic.12  
</p>
<p>35. The new law adopted in 2011 establishing the conditions for the exercise of the right 
to freedom of peaceful assembly significantly improved and clarified the framework 
governing the exercise of this basic freedom. The law applies to peaceful public gatherings, 
with the exception of private demonstrations and spontaneous gatherings. It establishes a 
regime for notifying the authorities, and requires that detailed information about the nature 
of the gathering and the organizers be submitted to relevant authorities in charge of the 
territorial administration at least five days beforehand.  
</p>
<p>36. Article 17 of the 2011 law forbids demonstrations in public places between 10 p.m. 
and 6 a.m. Article 23 envisages the possibility of challenging the decision of relevant 
administrative authorities if considered to be an abuse of power, in which case the 
Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court may be seized (art. 24).  
</p><p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes this new development and the fact that the law 
meets international standards. She nonetheless recalls that any blanket ban or restriction (in 
this case in relation to time) could be regarded as an &#8220;intrinsically disproportionate and 
discriminatory measure&#8221; as defined by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to peaceful 
assembly and association.13 
</p>
<p>38. In the above connection, the Special Rapporteur draws attention to certain best 
practices highlighted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to peaceful assembly and 
association,14 including that notification requirements should be subject to a proportionality 
assessment, not unduly bureaucratic and be required (ideally) only for large meetings or 
those which may disrupt traffic. If organizers fail to notify authorities, they should not be 
penalized and spontaneous gatherings should be allowed. In addition, administrative 
officials receiving notifications should be regularly subject to oversight and benefit from 
targeted training to ensure that the exercise of this right is not subject to arbitrary 
restrictions.  
</p>
<p>39. During her follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur learned about some instances 
where the excessive use of force by the police against participants in peaceful assemblies 
had led to casualties. The tragic incident in Dapaong in April 2013, where two students died 
following the intervention of the police during a peaceful demonstration in support of a 
teachers&#8217; strike, was brought to her attention. In the light of that incident, she recommends 
that the police and law enforcement personnel continue to be trained in crowd control and 
be properly equipped to handle protests.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur was also informed about violent acts committed by 
demonstrators, particularly around elections. In this regard, she underlined the importance 
that defenders remain peaceful at all times when exercising the right to freedom of peaceful 
assembly. They should assist in monitoring demonstrations, ensuring that those who 
demonstrate do it peacefully. The violent acts of some demonstrators should not, however, 
detract from the essentially peaceful nature of demonstrations.15  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur also reiterates the recommendations made by the previous 
mandate holder, that the monitoring of assemblies can provide an impartial and objective

<p>account of events, including a factual record of the conduct of both participants and law 
enforcement officials; the very presence of human rights monitors during demonstrations 
may deter human rights violations. Human rights defenders should therefore be able to 
operate freely in the context of freedom of assembly.16 The Special Rapporteur believes that 
defenders would benefit from training on monitoring demonstrations, as well as on 
documenting and reporting on related human rights violations.  
</p>
<p><b> 5. Freedom of association and labour rights 
</b></p>
<p>42. After her visit in 2008, the Special Rapporteur raised the issue of registration 
certificates and the excessive delays in obtaining them.17 During her follow-up visit, she 
found that the situation had improved, although she was informed that there was still no 
framework to regulate the establishment and functioning of networks or coalitions.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur believes that the existing legal framework governing the 
right to associate freely should be reviewed with a view to move towards a modern regime 
of notification where organizations are not required to register with the authorities in order 
to be able to operate. The notification procedure should be clearly established by law, and 
not be burdensome or costly. During her previous visit, the Special Rapporteur was pleased 
to note that discussions on adopting a law relating to the organization and functioning of 
civil society organizations were under way.  
</p>
<p>44. During her follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur learned about the environment in 
which trade unions operate, including the exercise of the right to collective bargaining and 
to strike, an issue that had not been raised during her first visit. The right to freedom of 
association is enshrined in article 39 of the Constitution; Act 2006-10 of 13 December 2006 
on the Labour Code reaffirms this right. Article 9 of the Labour Code prohibits employers 
from applying pressure in support or against trade union organizations, while articles 256 et 
subsequent articles recognize the right to strike only if all other avenues for amicable 
settlement have been exhausted.18  
</p>
<p>45. After having held meetings with relevant authorities and trade unions, the Special 
Rapporteur was able to conclude that, while progress had been made in recent years with 
regard to the current legal framework, trade unions and those claiming labour rights face 
important challenges, including serious restrictions on the right to associate freely and the 
right to strike by companies in the export processing zone. According to reports available, 
companies operating in the export processing zone were until recently exempt from certain 
provisions of the Labour Code regarding the recruitment and individual and collective 
dismissal of workers, mediation and labour conflict resolution, and the classification of 
professional categories.19  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the efforts made to harmonize the regulatory 
framework for labour in the export processing zone with existing national legislation. In 
addition, three unions have been created to defend the rights of workers in the free zone.  
</p>
<p>47. The Special Rapporteur emphasized that the right to claim for the respect and 
exercise of basic labour rights should be protected. Unions members should be able work in

<p><b> 6. Ministry for Human Rights and the Consolidation of Democracy 
</b></p>
<p>48. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur highlighted the work and role played by the 
Ministry for Human Rights and the Consolidation of Democracy. She referred to the four-
year national plan of action for the promotion and protection of human rights and the civil 
society unit established within the Ministry as positive aspects. She warned, however, about 
the Ministry&#8217;s lack of resources to fulfil its mandate and the absence of awareness-raising 
activities about the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.20  
</p>
<p>49. During her follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn that civil 
society was regularly consulted by the Ministry and that the universal periodic review 
process had brought authorities and civil society together. She was informed by the 
authorities that, as a result of this experience, relations between the Ministry and civil 
society would be formalized.  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur was, however, disappointed to discover that the national 
plan of action had not been implemented owing to lack of funding, although some activities 
had been carried out with the support of the United Nations Development Programme and 
OHCHR. She also expressed her concern at the fact that the civil society unit within the 
Ministry continued to lack the necessary human and financial resources to conduct properly 
its activities, including the capacity-building of defenders and their own staff. She noted the 
feedback received from non-governmental organizations indicating that the unit had been 
&#8220;somewhat inactive&#8221;; indeed, some of them were not even aware of its existence.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur learned that the Ministry for Human Rights will be 
facilitating the work of the High Commissioner for National Reconciliation and 
Strengthening of National Unity, a role established following the adoption of Decree No. 
2013-040/PR on 4 May 2013. The High Commissioner will be responsible for 
implementing the recommendations of the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. 
The Special Rapporteur hopes that the Commission will be able to carry out its work 
effectively and independently, with the necessary resources.  
</p>
<p><b> 7. National Human Rights Commission  
</b></p>
<p>52. As a result of her visit in 2008, the Special Rapporteur welcomed the mediating role 
played by the National Human Rights Commission and the fact that it was in the process of 
establishing a focal point for defenders, something that she considered a best practice to be 
replicated elsewhere. She warned about the chronic lack of funding of the Commission and 
the lack of visibility within the State apparatus and parts of civil society.21  
</p>
<p>53. In May 2013, the Commission was reaccredited with A status by the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions, with some 
recommendations made by the Subcommittee on Accreditation.  
</p>
<p>54. With regard to funding, the Subcommittee deemed the Commission&#8217;s budget to be 
inadequate for effective operation and for it to perform its core functions. Furthermore, the 
Subcommittee noted that the Commission did not prepare its budget; it is actually prepared 
by the Ministry of Finance, and disbursed on a monthly basis. The Subcommittee was of

<p><b>A/HRC/25/55/Add.2  
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>the view that such an arrangement could restrict the Commission&#8217;s capacity to plan and 
carry out long-term projects.  
</p><p>55. The Subcommittee noted that two posts of Commissioner had been vacant since 
November 2012. It also noted that, of the 17 members, only the position of Chairperson 
was full-time and that 25 per cent of employees were seconded, including to senior 
positions. The Subcommittee recommended that vacant position be filled, that full-time 
positions be provided for, and that staff be selected through an open, transparent and merit-
based system. Such measures would promote stability and enable the institution to 
discharge its mandate effectively.  
</p>
<p>56. As the Special Rapporteur has already pointed out, national human rights institutions 
should have broad and solid mandates and be adequately equipped so that they can be 
autonomous and independent. In this context, she strongly recommends that national 
institutions be adequately resourced and be able to propose and manage their own budgets 
independently.22 
</p>
<p>57. Further to the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture 
on 20 July 2010, the Government of Togo designated the Commission to host the National 
Preventive Mechanism. Subsequently, the Commission&#8217;s enabling legislation and 
organizational structure was reviewed, taking into account the Mechanism&#8217;s requirements 
and the recommendations of the International Coordinating Committee following the 
review of the Commission in May 2013. The Special Rapporteur trusts that the draft 
legislation currently under preparation will take into account the inputs and comments of 
relevant stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>58. During the follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur met with the members of the 
Commission. She considers that the framework for engagement with defenders is not well 
established, and that the Commission operates on the basis of bilateral meetings and 
partnerships. The focal point for defenders has been set up and is operational, which she 
considers positive. She is, however, concerned at information indicating that defenders are 
sceptical about the role of the focal point. She was also discouraged to learn that defenders 
do not always report their issues to the Commission owing to a lack of trust in the 
institution and, generally, the State apparatus. The Special Rapporteur believes that the 
focal point should be fully institutionalized within the Commission to make it operational 
and effective. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur also expressed her concern at the situation created following 
the publication by the Commission of a report on allegations of torture and ill-treatment on 
the premises of the National Security Agency in February 2012. The report was 
commissioned by the Minister for Justice to investigate the allegations concerning persons 
involved in the coup d&#8217;&#233;tat in 2009. According to the information received during the 
follow-up visit, the findings of the report were partially contested by the Government.  
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur was informed that, the President of the Commission, Koffi 
Kount&#233;, fearing for his life, fled left the country several days after the publication of the 
report and is still abroad. The Commission has been following the implementation of the 
recommendations made in the report.  
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned about the above-mentioned events and the 
current situation of the former head of the Commission. She urges the authorities to take the 
measures necessary to ensure that Mr. Kount&#233; and his family are safe and that he may 
return safely, if he wishes to do so.

</p>
<p><b> IV. Situation of human rights defenders 
</b>62. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur regretted the fragmentation of civil society and 
expressed her concern at the stigmatization of its work by some authorities. She referred to 
a climate of mistrust between authorities and defenders, and recommended that the 
Government take action to end stigmatization and to enhance the capacity of defenders. She 
also recommended that defenders end fragmentation among themselves and improve 
coordination to strengthen their protection, particularly outside the capital. She urged both 
the Government and the community of defenders to recognize the work of women 
defenders, and to empower them.23  
</p>
<p>63. During her follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur noted that the environment in 
which defenders work in Togo continues to be highly polarized and politicized, as she had 
observed in 2008. During her visit, she was informed about an initiative taken by groups of 
defenders to engage actively in political activities during the 2013 parliamentary elections 
by contributing to the establishment of Collectif Sauvons le Togo (see para. 8 above). In the 
view of the Special Rapporteur, the initiative has actually undermined the environment in 
which defenders work and has, unfortunately, strengthened the current trend of authorities 
and certain media outlets to stigmatize their work by branding them as &#8220;political 
opposition&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>64. In this context, the Special Rapporteur called upon defenders and other actors to 
work in an impartial, independent and objective way. Civil society working on human 
rights issues should monitor the activities of the State and its obligations, and document and 
report objectively on violations. She was reassured by the fact that defenders were aware of 
this role and that some groups were already working to re-establish the credibility of that 
role. Defenders should be supported in this process.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur also considered the situation of certain groups of defenders 
with regard to her first visit in 2008, such as women defenders and those working for the 
rights of women, journalists and media workers. She also learned about the situation of 
other groups of defenders, including those working for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual 
and transgender persons. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Women human rights defenders and those working for the rights of 
women 
</b></p>
<p>66. In 2008, the Special Rapporteur highlighted the plight of women defenders and 
noted the particular difficulties of women working in rural areas and the attitude of some 
local authorities regarding their work. Women defenders were vulnerable to criticism and 
ostracism in their own families and communities, and lacked the necessary resources and 
synergies to work effectively. The Special Rapporteur recommended that the Government 
recognize their role and remove obstacles to their legitimate work.24 During the follow-up 
visit, she observed important progress in the environment in which women defenders work, 
including in relevant legislation, the establishment of the Ministry for the Promotion of 
Women in 2010 and the adoption of a national policy on gender equality and equity in 
</p><p>2011.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur also received reports of a significant change in the 
authorities&#8217; perception of the role of women defenders and their attitude towards them. She

</b></p>
<p>was pleased to learn that networking among women defenders had improved in recent 
years, which had helped to make their work more visible and effective. The Special 
Rapporteur believes these are positive developments that should be acknowledged, and 
welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to addressing gender inequalities and combating 
stereotypes.  
</p>
<p>68. Regarding the environment in which women defenders work, however, the Special 
Rapporteur believes that the challenges still outweigh the successes, particularly the 
adverse social attitudes, cultural practices and perception of the work of women defenders 
and those who work for the rights of women. As the Committee on the Elimination of 
Discrimination against Women underlined in 2012, patriarchal attitudes and deeply-rooted 
stereotypes about the role of men and women in family and society still persist.25 In this 
context, women defenders are still too often seen as &#8220;trouble makers&#8221; because of their 
activism, particularly if they work on sexual and reproductive rights, and also branded as 
&#8220;home-breakers&#8221; and &#8220;difficult&#8221; women.  
</p>
<p>69. Another endemic problem faced by women defenders and those who work for the 
rights of women is the scarcity of resources necessary to have a real impact on the ground. 
The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the challenging situation of those working 
in rural areas, given that they operate in remote locations and are often more exposed to 
pressure from family, the authorities and society without the support of networks.  
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to continue to support and 
acknowledge the work of women defenders, and to remove the obstacles to their work, 
including by redressing gender inequalities and combating social stereotypes.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Journalists and media workers 
</b></p>
<p>71. During her first visit, the Special Rapporteur expressed her concern at the 
intimidation and harassment of the media and the illegitimate restrictions on freedom of 
expression of those working on human rights issues (see paragraphs 22 and 23 above). 
During the follow-up visit, the Special Rapporteur was concerned to see that the 
environment in which the media operate seems to have worsened and is even more 
polarized than in 2008. Media outlets and journalists work in a highly politicized 
environment in which viewpoints are easily associated with political opinions and even 
parties. Free journalism is very young and not always exercised with enough 
professionalism or respect for basic ethical and deontological principles. Some newspapers 
publish photographs of persons arrested or in handcuffs, sometimes accompanied by 
declarations of guilt given by the police,26 in violation of the basic principle of the 
presumption of innocence. It should neither be tolerated by the authorities nor practised by 
the media.  
</p>
<p>72. News continues to be reported with a high degree of sensationalism and little 
apparent capacity to engage in investigative, professional journalism. This makes it all too 
easy for certain authorities and other stakeholders to brand the media and journalists as 
politically motivated and to discredit their work. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes recent discussions on freedom of expression facilitated by OHCHR Togo, 
leading some journalists to reconsider their role and conditions overall.  
</p><p>73. The Special Rapporteur received testimonies of continued harassment and 
intimidation of journalists who work on human rights-related issues, report information of

</p>
<p>cases of corruption of Government officials or publically criticize the Government. Some of 
them have faced criminal lawsuits for defamation or charges under the Press and 
Communications Code.  
</p>
<p>74. In 2010, the Head of State filed defamation suits against three press organizations 
(<i>Freedom</i>,<i> L&#8217;Independant Express</i> and the weekly <i>La Laterne</i>) for publishing information 
denouncing corruption within the State apparatus. They were charged with &#8220;spreading false 
news&#8221;, &#8220;defamation&#8221; and &#8220;attack on honour&#8221;, offences under the Criminal Code and the 
Press Code. Later that year, the complaints were withdrawn and the cases were closed.  
</p>
<p>75. In November 2010, three independent radio stations based in Lom&#233; (X-Solaire, 
Metropolys and Providence) that generally report on human rights issues were shut down 
by the Post and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority on the grounds that they did not 
possess licenses for the frequencies they were assigned to and for &#8220;equipment and premises 
that do not comply with standards in force&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the above-mentioned actions could unduly 
restrict the exercise of a fundamental right in a democratic and pluralistic society, and 
stigmatize the work of the media and journalists, which play a key role in the defence and 
promotion of human rights. She recalls that free and independent media are an indicator of 
a healthy and open democracy, where constructive criticism and thorough analysis of public 
affairs is encouraged. In this connection, she reaffirms the spirit of article 6 of the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Defenders working for the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and 
transgender persons 
</b></p>
<p>77. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is a new group that 
the Special Rapporteur identified during her follow-up visit. Many of those working on 
LGBT issues have only organized themselves in recent years, often around HIV-AIDS and 
other health-related issues. The working environment for defenders is often difficult and 
hostile owing not only to pressure from society and families but also the existing legal 
framework.  
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur was informed that one important element contributing to 
this difficult environment is that same-sex relations between consenting adults are, under 
article 88 of the Criminal Code, a criminal offence punishable by one to three years of 
imprisonment and a fine.27 Mindful of the fact that this legal provision has not been used for 
a number of years, the Special Rapporteur concurs with the Human Rights Committee and 
other United Nations experts,28 and believes its mere existence goes against established 
international human rights standards and may unduly infringe upon, inter alia, the right to 
privacy, the right to health and the right not be to discriminated against. She also believes 
that the criminalization of sexual relationships between consenting adults can further 
stigmatize those advocating for the rights of LGBT persons and make them more 
vulnerable to pressure and attacks, as experience in other countries in the region has shown.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur also expresses her concern at the use of certain legal 
provisions by law enforcement officials without proper investigation of facts in the case of 
unsubstantiated accusations against defenders and activists. She was informed that some 
activists have faced accusations of rape and abuse of minors that have not always been 
properly investigated by the police owing to the prevailing stigma surrounding the work of

</b></p>
<p>these defenders, assumptions about their sexual orientation and deeply-rooted 
discriminatory attitudes and stereotypes.  
</p>
<p>80. This group of defenders also faces threats, intimidation and harassment in their own 
communities in connection with their activities and their own sexual orientation. Such 
incidents are not always reported for fear of criminal charges and social stigma. The 
coverage of the issue by certain media seems to have contributed to exposing these 
defenders to more risks. 
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to do their utmost to ensure that 
defenders may work in a safe and enabling environment, publically support their work, and 
consider revising the relevant legal framework.  
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The Special Rapporteur welcomes the progress made in the environment in 
which defenders work, including the important steps taken to address impunity for 
past violations and foster national reconciliation, the efforts to strengthen the 
judiciary, and to support the work of women defenders by redressing gender 
inequalities and combating social stereotypes. She was also pleased to note that 
authorities and civil society have found a common space for constructive engagement 
in human rights issues. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Some important challenges observed by the Special Rapporteur during her visit 
in 2008, however, remain. They include the implementation of the legal framework 
governing fundamental freedoms, in particular freedom of expression and peaceful 
assembly; the role and situation of certain key institutions, such as the High Authority 
for Broadcasting and Communications</b><i> <b></b></i><b>and the National Human Rights Commission; 
and the excessive polarization of the environment in which defenders work.  
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> The Special Rapporteur appreciates the important role played by the National 
Human Rights Commission in the transition and consolidation of democracy and for 
the respect and promotion of human rights in Togo. She was, however, concerned to 
learn that certain groups of defenders had lost their confidence in the institution.  
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Special Rapporteur noted that defenders worked in a highly politicized 
environment. She believes that efforts are required to regain focus and to ensure that 
work is conducted in an impartial, independent and objective manner.  
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>86<b>. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Togo: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Expedite the ratification of United Nations international treaties to 
which the State is not yet a party, consider ratifying the Rome Statute, and consider 
extending a standing invitation to special procedures of the Human Rights Council;

independently, and that its focal point for defenders is fully institutionalized;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (j) In connection with the above, ensure that the recommendations made by 
the National Commission contained in its 2012 report on torture are implemented; 
that those considered responsible for such acts are brought to justice; and that the 
necessary measures to ensure that Koffi Kount&#233; and his family are safe and he may 
return safely, if he sowishes, are taken;

particular women and those working for the rights of LGBT persons, by removing 
obstacles to their work and amending relevant legislation; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (n) Ensure that labour rights, including collective bargaining and the right 
to strike, can be exercised without undue restrictions or intimidations of any kind.  
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the High Authority for Broadcasting 
and Communications:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Exercise regulatory powers with due diligence and attention to the 
balance between ethics and the right to freedom of opinion and expression; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Consider strengthening existing self-regulatory mechanisms with a view 
to involving journalists and the media in the exercise of this function; 
 (c) Ensure that journalists and the media are supported and trained in basic 
deontological principles of the profession. </b></p>

<p>88.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the National Human Rights 
Commission:

<p><b> (a) Implement the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Accreditation 
of the International Coordinating Committee of National Human Rights Institutions 
with regard to strengthening the independence and effectiveness of the institution; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Do its utmost to regain the confidence of human rights defenders and be 
a strong, independent institution capable of credible and impartial scrutiny of the

<p><b> (f) Ensure responsiveness and accessibility of the institution for all citizens, 
and engage actively with all groups of human rights defenders, in particular those 
working on women&#8217;s rights and against discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation and gender identity. 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that human rights defenders: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Conduct their work professionally in order to hold the State to account, 
and maintain dialogue with the authorities to foster the protection and promotion of 
human rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Strengthen existing networks and ensure that they function effectively, in 
both urban and rural areas;

<p><b> (c) In the case of journalists and media professionals working on human 
rights issues, carry out their work by observing professional ethics and deontological 
principles;

<p><b> (d) Ensure the dissemination of information about the Declaration on 
Human Rights Defenders and the role of defenders at the domestic level; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that demonstrations are held peacefully and are properly 
monitored, and that violations are documented and reported.

</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: National consultations registered 
more than 18,000 requests; audiences were 
organized during which all stakeholders, 
including defenders, were interviewed. Report of 
April 2012 on the consultations led to 
establishment of post of High Commissioner for 
National Reconciliation and Strengthening 
National Unity.  
</p>

but was undermined by lack of resources. Still 
awaiting implementation of recommendations.

rights defenders in reconciliation process (para. 111) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Most respondents felt that they had been

<p><b>Government</b>: Elections were transparent and 
peaceful. All stakeholders, including human rights 
defenders, were involved, and received training.

current backlog is organizational rather than 
financial.

</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government strengthen 
capacity and visibility of the Ministry and of the 
National Human Rights Commission (para. 102) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Little information provided by 
respondents, although one was aware that 
recommendation was made during universal

<p>No specific training for Togolese soldiers serving in 
United Nations peacekeeping missions on work of 
human rights defenders and the Declaration on

</p>
<p>Reports of direct and indirect intimidation of 
magistrates in rural areas and nepotism in

</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: These issues are being addressed 
through creation of Superior Judicial Council and 
General Inspectorate of Judicial Services.  
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Respondents did not provide much 
information, although some claimed that posting 
to a rural zone is possibly a form of punishment 
for magistrates.  
</p>
<p>Magistrates and judicial officers lack training on the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders (para. 45)

<p>Lack of clarity regarding the guiding procedure of 
Authority (HAAC); cases of arbitrary sanctions of 
journalists exercising the right to freedom of opinion 
and expression (para. 60) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Information confirmed. Some referred to 
unreliable journalism as possible reason behind 
decisions of HAAC.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government ensure that 
HAAC lays out the criteria under which activities of 
organizations are assessed and that its actions are 
fair and transparent (para. 106) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Some modifications made to 
improve operations of HAAC.  
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Only some respondents confirmed 
modifications mentioned by the Government.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that HAAC, the Minister for 
Communication and other specialized institutions 
engage in capacity-building (in particular, training 
on journalist ethics) and confidence-building 
activities for journalists (para. 107) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Training sessions are periodically 
held for journalists on ethics and professionalism.

<p><b>C.</b>  <b>National Human Rights Commission 
</b></p>
<p>During meetings with NGOs, the National Human 
Rights Commission noted that members of civil 
society had requested the Commission to design a 
consultative framework, undertake joint activities 
with NGOs in campaigning, sensitizing and training 
(para. 51) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Consultations are periodically held 
between civil society and the Commission.

a focal point for human rights defenders under way 
(para. 53)

(para. 55) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Confirmed by all. Reports indicated that 
situation had worsened since the Kount&#233; affair.  
</p>
<p>Commission lacks visibility within State apparatus 
and some parts of civil society. Widespread 
misconception of the role of the Commission by the 
State authorities and civil society noted (para. 56) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Some reported that lack of visibility was 
due to lack of financing, but also possibly to lack 
of direction.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government support bill 
calling on the inclusion of references to the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in national 
legislation prepared by the Commission. The 
Ministry for Human Rights and the Consolidation of 
Democracy and the Parliamentary Human Rights 
Commission must support the law before the 
Parliament (para, 105) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: No relevant information provided, 
possible because bill had not been discussed in 
Parliament.  
</p>
<p><b>D.</b>  <b>Civil society 
</b></p>
<p>Civil society is largely fragmented and lacks 
coordination when advocating respect for human 
rights (para. 64) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Some indicate that situation was mainly 
due to political divisions, although this was 
possibly changing. Others believed that the 
situation was the same, despite efforts to 
overcome divisions. 
</p>
<p>Defenders stigmatized as belonging to political 
opposition by some authorities, tribal leaders and 
segments of the population. This misperception is 
more acute in the capital, where it generates a 
climate of mistrust between authorities and 
defenders. Local authorities must be sensitized on 
the work of defenders (para. 65) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Observation was confirmed by some 
respondents, who believed that efforts to sensitize 
need to be increased. Some referred to over-
politicization of civil society organisations, which 
had worsened the situation.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government take concrete 
steps to give legitimacy to human rights defenders, 
in the capital and in the regions, by dispelling 
stigmatization of accusations of affiliation to

Recommended that the Government continue to 
ensure that human rights defenders operate within a 
conducive environment (para. 97) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Law on public demonstrations was 
adopted in 2011 in order to facilitate freedom of 
association. Discussions were under way on a law 
relating to the organization and functioning of 
civil society organizations.  
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Disagreed with the Government. Some 
stated that the environment was already 
conducive, while others referred to threats and 
violations.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government enhance the 
capacity of human rights defenders (para. 98) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Human rights defenders&#8217; 
organizations were periodically trained on 
freedom of expression, the role of civil society 
and the recommendations made by the Truth, 
Justice and Reconciliation Commission.  
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Information sessions should be held, 
which OHCHR Togo reportedly already does. 
</p>
<p>Recommended that human rights defenders end the 
fragmentation of their community and find a strong, 
single voice (para. 114) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Agreed that more forums and round table 
discussions should be organized. 
</p>
<p>Recommended that human rights defenders improve 
coordinating networks aimed at strengthening the 
protection of defenders, particularly those outside 
the capital (para. 115) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Defenders in rural areas should form a 
network, which existing networks would be ready 
to support. A project funded by the European 
Union to this end has existed since 2012.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that human rights defenders 
recognize the work of women human rights 
defenders, and empower them (para. 116) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Technical and financial support for 
women&#8217;s organizations should be strengthened. 
There were indications that women&#8217;s 
organizations were being empowered. 
</p>
<p>Recommended that human rights defenders expand 
capacity among defenders in the capital and in the 
regions to make full use of existing national, 
regional and international human rights mechanisms 
and institutions (para. 117) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Lack of finance, capacity and training 
were the main problems. Events had been 
organized to address the situation.  
</p>
<p><b>E.</b>  <b>Women defenders 
</b></p>
<p>Women defenders are vulnerable to criticism and 
ostracism among their own families and 
communities. They further encounter discrimination 
within organizations or trade unions they operate. 
(para. 70) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Organizations are becoming sensitized 
and some believe the situation is improving, 
though others believe it remains the same.

</p>
<p>Other difficulties reported include scarcity of 
funding and resources for centres run by women 
defenders (para. 72) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Scarcity of funding and resources is 
common throughout the country, not specific to 
centres run by women defenders. 
</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government recognize the 
legitimate work of women human rights defenders, 
acknowledge it as human rights work, ensure the 
removal of all obstacles that impede their work, and 
take proactive measures to support such work (para. 
101) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: One respondent indicated that the 
Government solicits advice from women 
defenders more than others. Another reported that 
the Government had not taken any action on this 
recommendation.  
</p>
<p><b>1.</b>  <b>Right to freedom of association 
</b></p>
<p>Systematic delays by the Ministry of Territorial 
Administration in delivering registration certificates 
to NGOs. Without this certificate, NGOs have no 
access to funding, and cannot file a complaint before 
a court or operate outside the capital (para. 74)  
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Four respondents reported persisting 
difficulties, while others indicated that the 
situation had improved somewhat.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government speed up the 
delivery of registration certificate to NGOs, thereby 
facilitating their activities (para. 99) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Some reported that the process was still 
slow, others that it had improved somewhat.  
</p>
<p><b>2.</b>  <b>Right to freedom of peaceful assembly 
</b></p>
<p>In accordance with the 1901 Act on Freedom of 
Association and Assembly, the right to peaceful 
assembly is governed by a regime of notification, 
which may be refused if the demonstration is 
considered a threat to law and public order (para. 
77) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Law no. 2011-010 was referred to as a 
positive development, although its application 
was problematic. Permission had been denied to 
hold assemblies, and some demonstrations had 
been met with police violence.  
</p>
<p>In Kpalim&#233;, defenders raised concerns about the 
difficulty to organize demonstrations or public 
events; they reportedly need to seek the permission 
of the gendarmerie (para. 79) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: General agreement that, even under the 
new law, this remains a problem.  
</p>
<p><b>3.</b>  <b>Right to freedom of opinion and expression 
</b></p>
<p>Cases of assault and threats against journalists and 
illegitimate restrictions to the exercise of their right 
to freedom of opinion and expression by HAAC 
were reported during the visit in 2008 (paras. 82-87) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: According to most respondents, the 
situation had not improved. Some reported the 
closure of radio stations, cases of intimidation of 
journalists, violent repression of protests and the 
prerogatives of HAAC. One reported that the 
situation had greatly improved; the problem was 
that now journalists did not respect the parameters 
of professional conduct in their field. 
</p>

therefore advised journalists to enhance the 
credibility of their profession by conducting 
investigative journalism (para. 88) 
</p>
<p>and media workers.  
</p>
<p><b>4.</b>  <b>Impunity 
</b></p>
<p>The question of impunity for violations committed 
against human rights defenders is a major concern 
(para. 89) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: The issue remains a major concern. Many 
respondents saw impunity as the rule, and justice 
as the exception.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that the Government make the fight 
against impunity for violations against human rights 
defenders a priority; the Truth, Justice and 
Reconciliation Commission must address seriously 
and thoroughly all violations committed against 
human rights defenders (para. 109) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: The implementation of the 
recommendations made by the Commission 
should make justice independent and effective, 
and a sensitization programme with regard to 
human rights will be implemented.  
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: According to some respondents, even 
though the Commission had finished its mandate, 
the authors of violations were still free.  
</p>
<p><b>F.</b>  <b>Other recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>Recommended that the Government translate the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders in Kabye, 
Ewe and other main local languages (para. 100) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Intends to do this. 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Declaration has not yet been translated. 
Some think this is not pertinent, as many people 
do not read in these languages, or at all, and those 
who do also read English or French. 
</p>
<p>Recommended that all stakeholders carry out 
countrywide civic education to enhance the 
appreciation of the activities of human rights 
defenders (para. 118) 
</p>
<p><b>NGOs</b>: Many stated that this had not been done.  
</p>
<p>Recommended that all stakeholders disseminate the 
Declaration on Human Rights Defenders and the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the 
occasion of their tenth and sixtieth anniversaries 
respectively (para. 119) 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: A forum was organised in which 
more than 50 organizations of human rights 
defenders had participated. Authorities intend to 
intensify these actions.

<p><b>NGOs</b>: A forum was held on 10 December 2012 
at which the proposal was discussed, although no
