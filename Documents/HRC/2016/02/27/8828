<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance

</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><b> I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 8th meeting, held on 3 December 2009, Mr. Tia Kon&#233;, President of the 
Supreme Court of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, introduced the national report, which had been the subject 
of an information campaign with special emphasis on the role of civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>6. The delegation drew attention to the difficult situation in C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, the result of 
10 years of political and military crisis. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was hoping that a solution would 
finally be reached under the Ouagadougou Political Agreement. The crisis had left the 
national territory divided, the authority of the State weakened and the human rights 
situation worse than before. 
</p>
<p>7. The State had nevertheless not renounced its international obligations, 
notwithstanding its right to suspend the exercise of rights and freedoms in accordance with 
the spirit and letter of the international instruments to which it was party. It had continued 
to nurture the process of democratization and consolidation of the principles of the rule of 
law. 
</p>
<p>8. The delegation recalled the legal and institutional framework of C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, in 
particular the Constitution, which devoted 22 articles to human rights, and the legislation 
that enabled citizens to invoke those articles directly. The Ivorian State was aware that 
more needed to be done to bring domestic law and its implementation into line with the 
international instruments it had ratified. </p>


<p><b>4</b> GE.10-10140 
</p>
<p>9. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had made commitments at the subregional level (Economic 
Community of West African States (ECOWAS)) and the regional level (African Union), 
and in the framework of the International Organization of la Francophonie, and had ensured 
it had the resources needed to fulfil its international human rights obligations.  
</p>
<p>10. Under the Ivorian legal system, the separation of powers was constitutionally 
guaranteed and judicial independence recognized. The judiciary had undergone a series of 
reforms to improve its operation. The Ivorian political system of protection was a 
combination of classical and modern mechanisms. Parliament&#8217;s role as overall guarantor of 
freedoms had been consolidated through the effective exercise of its legislative and 
executive oversight functions. 
</p>
<p>11. The executive had created special ministries to promote human rights, namely the 
Ministry to Combat AIDS, the Ministry for Solidarity and War Victims, the Ministry of the 
Family, Women and Social Affairs, and the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights. 
Additional mechanisms had recently been created, such as the Office of the Ombudsman 
and the National Human Rights Commission. Political parties, the media, NGOs (over 200 
human rights organizations) and trade unions were other actors helping to protect and 
promote human rights. 
</p>
<p>12. With regard to fair trial, the Government had taken steps to strengthen the 
independence of the judiciary. As to prison conditions, overcrowding and the frequency of 
escapes had prompted the Government to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure so that 
first-time offenders were no longer placed in pretrial detention and the periods of pretrial 
detention were reduced. 
</p>
<p>13. In order to guarantee the right of everyone to take part in public life, the 
Government had made special arrangements to enable every Ivorian, free of charge, to 
obtain a birth certificate and a national identity card, and to be registered on the electoral 
rolls. The President had authorized all the signatories to the Linas-Marcoussis Agreement to 
stand in the next presidential elections. 
</p>
<p>14. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had taken steps to curb human rights violations attributable to the 
defence and security forces and had instituted proceedings against those concerned. The 
delegation confirmed that the amnesty laws and the presidential pardons granted in the 
course of political negotiations did not apply to the perpetrators of serious human rights 
violations. Once the crisis was over, the Ivorian State intended to take a proactive approach 
to consolidating the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>15. The Ivorian State was continually investing in economic, social and cultural rights. 
The priority given to education and training was illustrated by its work on educational 
infrastructure, the registration of schools in the regions and the creation of an educational 
system commensurate with the resources available. 
</p>
<p>16. In the area of health, C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire had adopted a National Health Development Plan 
for 2009&#8211;2013. Health programmes and projects for the major transmissible and non-
transmissible diseases had been introduced. 
</p>
<p>17. Government action on the environment included the creation of a Ministry of the 
Environment and a Ministry of Urban Waste Management, and the establishment of 
monitoring and research mechanisms. 
</p>
<p>18. Sectoral rights were a particular concern of the Ivorian State. Women received 
special protection: the law prohibited not only all forms of sex discrimination in access to 
employment but also all forms of violence against women, including female genital 
mutilation. In addition, a directorate of the Ministry of the Family, Women and Social 
Affairs had been set up in 2006 to monitor sexual equity and equality and other similar 
measures. </p>


<p>GE.10-10140 <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>19. Children&#8217;s rights remained one of the Government&#8217;s chief concerns, and numerous 
strategic measures had been put in place to combat abuse of all kinds, particularly child 
trafficking and smuggling. 
</p>
<p>20. In accordance with the instruments ratified by C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, numerous legal 
provisions had been adopted for the protection and social advancement of persons with 
disabilities, notably in respect of employment. 
</p>
<p>21. Government action focused also on persons displaced as a result of the political and 
military crises since 1999. A Ministry for Solidarity and War Victims had been created, a 
bill on compensation for war victims had been drafted and other measures had been taken 
in cooperation with national and international partners. 
</p>
<p>22. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire was aware that a successful solution to the crisis would depend on an 
open, transparent and fair electoral process, and called on the international community to 
support the Integrated Command Centre. C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire also intended to honour its 
commitment to submit periodic reports to the treaty bodies. 
</p>
