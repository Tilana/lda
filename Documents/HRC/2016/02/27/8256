<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. This document contains information provided by States, and other stakeholders, including National Human Rights 
Institutions and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), relating to the follow-up measures to the recommendations of the Special 
Rapporteur and his predecessors made after conducting country visits. In paragraph 5 d) of its resolution 16/23 on torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of March 2011, the Human Rights Council urged States &#8213;To ensure 
appropriate follow-up to the recommendations and conclusions of the Special Rapporteur.&#8214; The report submitted to the fifty-ninth 
session of the Commission (E/CN.4/2003/68, para. 18), indicated that Governments of States to which visits have been carried out 
would regularly be reminded of the observations and recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur after such visits. 
Information would be requested on the consideration given to the recommendations, the steps taken to implement them, and any 
constraints that may prevent their implementation.  Information from NGOs and other interested parties regarding measures taken in 
follow up to his recommendations would be welcome as well.   
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur follows the format of the follow-up report which was modified in 2008 with the aim of rendering it 
more reader-friendly and of facilitating the identification of concrete steps taken in response to the specific recommendations and 
their results. For this reason, follow-up tables have been created for each State visited by the mandate holders in the past ten years. 
The tables contain the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur and his predecessors, a brief description of the situation when 
the country visit was undertaken, an overview of steps taken in previous years and included in previous follow-up reports and 
measures taken in the current year on the basis of information gathered by the Special Rapporteur, from governmental and non-
governmental sources.  
</p>
<p>3. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur submitted to the respective Governments for their consideration 
and comments the information on follow-up measures he had gathered. Letters were sent to the following States: China (People&#8216;s 
Republic of), Denmark, Equatorial Guinea, Georgia, Greece, Indonesia, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Nepal, Nigeria, 
Paraguay, Papua New Guinea, the Republic of Moldova, Spain, Sri Lanka, Togo, Uruguay and Uzbekistan. The Special Rapporteur 
is grateful for the information received. 
</p>
<p>4. Owing to restrictions, the Special Rapporteur has been obliged to reduce the details of responses; attention has been given to 
reflect information that specifically addresses the recommendations, and which has not been previously reported. 
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur notes that invitation to the Special Rapporteur to conduct follow-up country visits constitutes a good 
practice that should be replicated. </p>

</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to China in 
</b></p>
<p><b>November 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.6, para. 82) 
</b></p>
<p>6. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of China requesting information and 
comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to implementation of the recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets 
that the Government has not responded to his request. He looks forward to receiving information on China&#8216;s efforts to follow-up to 
the recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the reports of excessive use and length of pre-trial detention, the lack of 
guarantees to challenge the lawfulness of detention and the continuing allegations about the use of forced labour as a corrective 
measures, ill-treatment of suspects in police custody, and harassment of lawyers and human rights defenders. He reiterates that the 
period of holding detainees in police custody should not exceed 48 hours, and that no detainee should be subjected to unsupervised 
contact with investigators. He regrets not having received information on the application of non-custodial measures and looks 
forward to receiving information on the use of alternative measures for non-violent or minor offences. 
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur expresses serious concern about the proposed amendments to China&#8216;s Criminal Law Procedure, 
which is currently being considered by the National People&#8216;s Congress, as it would permit the legalization of secret detention. He 
urges the Government to refrain from introducing the proposed amendment to China&#8216;s Criminal Law Procedure as it will represent a 
major obstacle to its efforts to preventing torture and ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government that detention 
in secret places facilitates the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself 
constitute a form of such treatment. 
</p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that torture is defined as a serious crime as a matter of priority 
in accordance with Article 1 of the Convention against Torture, sanctioned with penalties commensurate with the gravity of torture 
and  ensure that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture is explicitly excluded and is not invoked 
as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made.1 This 
exclusionary rule is fundamental for upholding the absolute and non-derogable nature of the prohibition of torture by providing a 
disincentive to use torture.2 It is imperative to ensure the inadmissibility of any extrajudicial statement that is not freely and 
promptly ratified before a court of law, and a specific prohibition of the use of extrajudicial statements even as &#8213;inferences&#8214; or 
</p>
<p>&#8213;presumptions&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>10. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to consider ratifying the Optional Protocol to the CAT (OPCAT), 
establish an independent and effective complaints procedure for victims of torture, and make a declaration under article 22 of the 
CAT providing the Committee against Torture with the competence to receive and consider individual complaints.

<p>a) The crime of torture 
should be defined as a 
matter of priority in 
accordance with article 1 of 
the Convention against 
Torture, with penalties 
commensurate with the 
gravity of torture. 
</p>
<p>No explicit definition of torture 
in domestic legislation; the 
existing legislation relevant to 
the prohibition and 
criminalization of torture did 
not satisfy the requirements of 
art.1 and 4 of CAT; in 
particular, it lacked the 
following elements:  
- mental torture;  
- the direct or indirect 
involvement of a public official 
or another person acting in an 
official capacity; and 
- Infliction of the act for a 
specific purpose. 
The penalization of acts of 
torture was stipulated in art. 
247 and 248 of the Criminal 
Law (CL), however a number 
of other regulations permit 
exceptions (see infra Rec c)). 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is reported that despite 
the introduction of new categories of offences relating 
to torture by the SPP, the definition of torture and the 
prohibition and criminalization of torture in Chinese 
law do not satisfy the requirements of Art. 1 and 4 
CAT. It is reported that by including only a list of 
situations amounting to torture and ill-treatment, 
other torture methods risk to fall outside the law. 
Reportedly, in practice, the punishment against 
perpetrators of torture is very light in comparison to 
the gravity of the crime. It is alleged that it is still 
common that perpetrators of torture escape criminal 
punishment or any punishment at all. 
 
Reportedly, Chinese law, while criminalising torture, 
still fails to do so under a definition which conforms 
with international standards, in particular Article 1(1) 
of the UN Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment (the Convention against Torture). 
Chinese law remains inadequate in three ways: 
 
Reportedly, the types of pain and suffering included 
within criminal law provisions for torture and other 
ill-treatment are insufficiently comprehensive and do 
not include mental pain and suffering. Articles 247 
and 248 of the Chinese Criminal Code refer only the 
use of force or physical abuse. A definition in line 
with the Convention against Torture would capture 
the common practice, on the part of the Chinese 
authorities, of resorting to inflicting severe mental 
anguish on individuals held in detention. It is alleged 
that there has been frequent documentation of such 
treatment against human rights defenders, lawyers, 
and other political activists through threats and 
punishment of their family members, including house 
arrest, harassment, and infringement of rights of the 
wives and children of Chen Guangcheng and Liu

<p>Xiaobo, among others. It is alleged that the 
Government campaign of &#8213;transformation&#8214; of Falun 
Gong practitioners in detention, aimed at forcing 
them to submit and renounce their beliefs, and similar 
efforts to coerce Tibetans to denounce the Dalai 
Lama, are allegedly core features of the 
Government&#8216;s campaign against those groups they 
perceive as subversive, and should also be viewed as 
a form of mental torture.  
</p>
<p>1)  
Reportedly, the range of the purposes of torture is 
restrictive. Chinese laws and regulations refer most 
often to torture for the purpose of coercing a 
confession or collecting information, as in Article 43 
of the Criminal Procedure Law which prohibits the 
extortion of confessions or obtaining evidence 
through torture. This reportedly does not extend to the 
use of torture for other purposes including &#8213;coercing 
him or a third person&#8214; which in the Chinese context 
would cover practices such as coercing an individual 
to abandon his or her beliefs, religious or otherwise, 
nor for &#8213;any other reason based on discrimination of 
any kind.&#8214; It is alleged that this would, for instance, 
exclude the mental and physical torture aimed at 
coercing individual detainees to renounce their faith 
or denounce their religious leaders, such as the 
&#8213;transformation&#8214; of Falun Gong practitioners in 
detention, or coercion of Tibetan detainees to 
denounce the Dalai Lama. According to testimonies 
received by NGOs, the mental torture associated with 
this process is, for some individuals, worse than the 
physical torture they may have to endure. 
Reportedly, provisions criminalising torture and other 
ill-treatment in Chinese law are restrictive in that they 
do not include temporary or quasi-governmental 
actors or non-governmental actors operating with the 
complicity, consent or acquiescence of a public 
official. This reportedly precludes the expanding use </p>

torture individuals in detention and the use of quasi-
governmental personnel to beat up and intimidate 
human rights activists outside of detention. 
</p>
<p>2)  
<b>Government:</b> In 2006, the Ministry of Justice issued 
regulations prohibiting torture and ill-treatment by 
specific categories of public officials, such as &#8213;Six 
prohibitions for prison guards&#8214;, &#8213;Six prohibitions for 
Re-education Through Labour&#8214; (RTL), etc.  
 
</p>
<p>- In the Regulations on Case-Filing Standards in 
Cases of Rights Infringement through Dereliction 
of Duty, the Supreme People&#8216;s Procuratorate 
</p>
<p>(SPP) lists several acts amounting to the crime of 
coercing a confession, such as beatings, binding, 
prolonged use of cold, hunger, exposure or 
scorching to abuse detainees, severely injuring 
suspects or leading a suspect to commit serious 
self-injury or directly or indirectly ordering 
others to use torture for the purpose of extracting 
a confession.   
</p>
<p>b) All allegations of torture 
and ill-treatment should be 
promptly investigated by an 
independent authority with 
no connection to the 
authority investigating or 
prosecuting the case against 
the alleged victim. 
</p>
<p>According to Article 18 of the 
Criminal Procedure Law (CPL), 
the SPP is the mechanism 
responsible for investigating 
and prosecuting crimes 
committed by State 
functionaries. The Procurators 
are also mandated to monitor 
the police and prisons and 
exercise oversight functions. In 
his dual function of prosecution 
and monitoring the SPP is not 
an independent authority, as its 
primary interest is vested in

<p><b>Government:</b> The National Human Right Action 
Plan 2009-10 (NHRA) foresees the establishment and 
improvement of supervisory mechanisms for law 
enforcement and administration of justice by 
establishing responsibility and accountability 
systems. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is reported that as of 
2009, the Government rejects the release of concrete 
data about enforcement efforts and increased 
transparency in the criminal justice system.  
Reportedly, in most cases no effective investigations 
were conducted in torture cases documented by 
human rights organizations. It is alleged that if 
investigations were initiated, they failed to meet the

<p>The police, SPP and courts are reportedly not 
independent and remain under the supervision of 
the Chinese Communist Party, including through 
&#8213;Politics and Law Commissions&#8214;.   
</p>
<p>c) Any public official 
indicted for abuse of torture, 
including prosecutors and 
judges implicated in 
colluding in torture or 
ignoring evidence, should be 
immediately suspended from 
duty pending trial, and 
prosecuted.

<p>The Public Security Organs' 
Regulations on Pursuing 
Responsibility for Policemen&#8216;s 
Errors in Implementing the Law 
and other regulations stipulated 
that &#8213;responsibility for &#8215;errors&#8216;,

<p>including forcing confessions 
or testimony will not be 
pursued where the law is 
unclear or judicial 
interpretations inconsistent&#8214; 
</p>
<p>and allowed for a number of 
exceptions.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Perpetrators of torture 
are reportedly rarely suspended, indicted or held 
legally accountable. 
 
While there are reports of some public officials being 
prosecuted as a result of allegations of torture, such 
cases tend to be in high profile cases that have 
received considerable media attention. Reportedly, 
allegations of torture arising in politically sensitive 
cases seldom result in adequate investigation or 
prosecution. It is reported that individuals from 
politically targeted groups, including Uighurs, 
Tibetans, Falun Gong, democracy activists and 
human rights defenders, who allege torture or other 
ill-treatment in police custody or detention, are rarely 
able to pursue their case, and the authorities rarely 
open investigations into the allegations or bring the 
accused to justice. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>d) The declaration should be 
made with respect to art. 22 
CAT recognizing the 
competence of the 
Committee against Torture 
to receive and consider 
communications from 
individuals who claim to be 
victims of a violation of the 
provisions of the CAT. 
</p>
<p>No declaration has yet been 
made to recognize individual 
complaint procedure. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Reportedly, Chinese 
authorities have provided no public indication that 
they are engaged in serious discussion concerning 
making a declaration with respect to article 22 of the 
Convention against Torture, or that they have a plan 
for moving in this direction. The ability of the 
Committee against Torture to receive and consider 
communications regarding the cases of individuals 
who have suffered torture or other ill-treatment is 
critical given the weak mechanisms within China for 
individuals to pursue allegations of such violations.

Procuratorate &#8211; responsible for preparing cases for 
prosecution. Suspects may be held up to seven days 
before the police submit a request to the People&#8216;s 
Procuratorate for approval of their arrest. In the case 
of a &#8213;major suspect involved in crimes committed 
from one place to another, repeatedly, or in a gang&#8214;, 
the time allowed for submitting a request for approval 
of arrest may reportedly be extended to 30 days. The 
People&#8216;s Procuratorate then has seven days from the 
time of receiving the written request for approval of 
arrest to decide on the request. It is alleged that after 
arrest, criminal suspects may be held for up to two 
months for investigation, and in &#8213;complex cases&#8214; this 
may be extended for an additional month, with the 
approval of the People&#8216;s Procuratorate at the next 
higher level. In &#8213;particularly grave and complex 
cases&#8214; the Supreme People&#8216;s Procuratorate must 
submit a report to the standing committee of the 
National People&#8216;s Congress for approval of 
postponing the hearing of the case. Other types of 
&#8213;grave&#8214; cases may also be extended for two months. 
Others factors, including if the criminal suspect did 
not provide his or her real identity, and if the police 
discover an additional crime which the suspect is 
believed to have committed, allow the authorities to 
extend the period of detention.  
- It is reported that this situation creates a conflict of 
interest as the same authorities are responsible for 
interrogating suspects and gathering evidence in 
support of prosecutions and also for monitoring 
places of detention and the conduct of police and 
public officials.

prevent torture.3 The regulations oblige the 
procuratorate to hear and question suspects directly 
when making the assessment in five circumstances, 
including when the suspect asks to be heard, is 
underage, or there are clues or evidence that torture or 
other unlawful means were used during initial police 
investigations. Previously such direct hearings could 
only take place in major cases where the evidence 
against the suspect was questionable. 
- It is reported that in practice individuals are often 
held in police detention for periods longer than 
allowed for by law prior to and following arrest. It is 
reported that during this time, which in some cases 
may last in excess of a year and for some many years, 
individuals may not be able to hire a lawyer, may not 
have access to their family, and with family members 
not even being informed of their whereabouts. 
- Amendments to the State Compensation Law 
adopted in April 2010, to take effect in December 
2010 also provide  (Article 17) that those illegally 
detained or detained beyond the time limits stipulated 
in the Criminal Procedure Law and subsequently are 
not prosecuted or are acquitted, have the right to 
compensation.  
- It is reported that in the last few years numerous 
cases of death in custody as well as the numerous 
miscarriages of justice resulting from confessions 
coerced through torture and other ill-treatment were 
reported in the Chinese media, leading to a public 
outcry within the country. This reportedly led the

</i></p>
<p>dealing with the regulation and law enforcement of 
detention facilities throughout China. In April 2009, 
the SPP stated that there had been 15 unexplained 
deaths in custody to date that year.  
- Reportedly, there are dozens of reports of deaths in 
custody received by NGOs  &#8211; many from politically 
sensitive groups including Uighurs, Falun Gong, 
Tibetans, and petitioners -- suggest that the cases 
reported on by the media and acknowledged by the 
authorities are likely to be only a small proportion of 
the total.  
- The above-mentioned amendments to the State 
Compensation Law include measures aimed at 
strengthening the legal framework to address deaths 
in custody. Previously, the burden of proof that the 
death had been caused by &#8213;negligence&#8214; rested on the 
family that lodged the complaint. Now the revised 
law requires compensation to be paid if an individual 
in detention is found dead or incapacitated and the 
detention centre or prison fails to provide evidence 
that the death was not caused by &#8213;negligence&#8214; on the 
part of the authorities.  
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2009:</i></b>  It is reported that 
as of 2009, no steps had been taken to change the 
CPL and stop the practice of excessive periods of pre-
trial detention. 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2008:</i></b>  It is reported that 
extensive time periods specified for summons, formal 
arrest by the police, approval of the arrest by the 
procuratorate, and special arrangements for some 
categories of suspects remained in force. It is alleged 
that suspects could still be held legally in police 
custody for up to 37 days prior to approval by the 
procuratorate.

guarantee prompt judicial review before an 
independent judicial authority of the lawfulness of the 
arrest have been taken. It is alleged that the courts are 
not independent and remain politically controlled.  
The use of administrative detention at the discretion 
of the police and without legal procedure, such as 
house arrest and detention in &#8215;black sites' remain 
widespread. It is alleged that the use of black jails 
was systematically applied against petitioners during 
the Olympic Games and its preparations.

</p>
<p>confessions obtained through 
torture could not form the basis 
of a criminal charge, however it 
did not exclude their 
admissibility in judicial 
proceedings.  
- The Government has 
acknowledged the 
pervasiveness of torture for the 
purpose of extracting 
confession and the SPP 
announced in 2005 that 
eliminating confession through 
torture was among its priorities. 
- Piloting systems of audio and 
video recording in interrogation 
rooms had been started. 
</p>
<p>interpreted by international and Chinese legal 
scholars as marking a positive step in that they 
underscore the seriousness with which national-level 
authorities view the problem of illegally obtained 
evidence. However, given past history the real test 
will be the effective implementation of the new 
regulations by local courts.  
- It should be noted that the regulations cover 
evidentiary rules within formal criminal proceedings 
only, and not within the many forms of administrative 
detention. 
- Also of concern is the absence of clear standards for 
the assessment of evidence. Article 6 provides that if 
a defendant or his or her defence counsel allege that 
the defendant&#8216;s pre-trial confession was obtained 
illegally &#8213;the court shall request that he or she provide 
relevant leads or evidence with respect to the alleged 
illegal obtaining of evidence, such as the person(s), 
time, place, manner, and content.&#8214;. It reportedly does 
not specify which of these are necessary and/or 
sufficient for the court to make a determination for 
the defendant&#8216;s claim. Article 7 is similarly unclear 
regarding the nature of the evidence that is necessary 
and/or sufficient for a prosecutor to provide to show 
the court that a confession was in fact obtained 
legally.  
- Of further concern is the length of time by which a 
prosecutor may delay a trial for further investigation 
or in order to obtain additional evidence to 
demonstrate that a confession was obtained legally. 
The articles in question, articles 7, 8 and 9, do not 
specify time limits for such postponement. Moreover, 
the court is required to agree to such a postponement 
requested by the prosecutor. If the defence makes a

<p>similar request for postponement, the court has 
discretion to agree &#8213;if it deems it necessary&#8214;. (Article 
9).  
- The conditions under which the appeals court, or 
court of second instance, is required to investigate a 
defendant&#8216;s claim that a pre-trial confession was 
obtained illegally also appear limited. Article 12 
provides for courts of second instance to investigate a 
defendant&#8216;s claim, but it is only obliged to do so if the 
court of first instance did not investigate the 
allegation and used the confession as the basis of the 
conviction. 
This may conflict with China&#8216;s Criminal Procedure 
Law which requires courts of second instance to 
conduct a full review of all facts.5 
- The Rules concerning Death Penalty cases stipulate 
that &#8213;only evidence that has been examined and 
verified to be true through an investigation process in 
court involving presentation, identification and cross 
examination may be used as a basis for conviction 
and determining sentence&#8214;(Article 4). However, it 
appears such scrutiny will not apply to evidence 
collected using &#8213;special investigative measures&#8214; 
(shanggui, opaque methods employed in counter-
terrorism, state security, or other &#8213;complex  cases&#8214;). 
Under Article 35, such evidence may serve as a basis 
for conviction &#8213;if the court has verified it to be true&#8214; 
which it must do without revealing the methods 
employed by the special investigators. This is in 
direct contravention of the legal principle that 
statements obtained by torture must be rejected as 
evidence on principled grounds, irrespective of the 
aspect of reliability.   
The Rules concerning Death Penalty cases reinforce

<p>that neither a defendant&#8216;s declaration obtained 
through illegal means such as coercing confession, 
nor witness statements obtained through violence, 
threats and other illegal means may serve as the basis 
for conviction (articles 19 and 12). 
- It is alleged that in practice, Criminal Law Article 
306, and other administrative sanctions impose 
significant additional constraints on lawyers 
considering mounting a defence based on allegations 
of torture. Article 306 provides criminal liability and 
imprisonment of up to seven years for defence 
counsel who coerce or entice witnesses to &#8213;change 
testimony in defiance of facts or give false 
testimony&#8214;, a charge which has been made against 
defence lawyers who allege that evidence used by the 
prosecution was obtained through torture, thus 
deterring the pursuit of such allegations.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2009:</i></b>  Reportedly, there 
is no right to access a lawyer before the initial 
interrogation. It is reported that the use of evidence 
obtained through torture remains admissible and is 
still being used in judicial proceedings. The police 
reportedly retain full control over the recording and 
the disposal of the video material which has led to 
videotapes in alleged torture cases to go &#8213;missing&#8214;. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Art. 96 of the CPL provided for access 
to a lawyer after initial interrogations. In 2006, the 
Public Order Administration Punishment Law of the 
National People&#8216;s Congress Standing Committee 
</p>
<p>Article entered into force, which prohibited the use of 
evidence obtained by torture as the basis of a criminal 
charge (art. 75). The same year the SPP announced 
the nationwide implementation of audio-video 
recording of interrogations of criminal suspects in the 
procuratorates by the end of 2007.

should conform to fair trial 
provisions, as guaranteed in 
art. 14 of ICCPR, including 
the following: 
- the right to remain silent 
and the privilege against 
self-incrimination;  
- the effective exclusion of 
evidence extracted through 
torture; 
- the presumption of 
innocence; 
- timely notice of reasons for 
detention or arrest; 
- prompt external review of 
detention or arrest;  
- timely access to counsel;  
- adequate time and facilities 
to prepare a defence; 
appearance and cross-
examination of witnesses; 
and 
- Ensuring the independence 
and impartiality of the 
judiciary. 
</p>
<p>- The CPL was not in 
conformity with international 
fair trial standards (e.g. it did 
not provide for the right to 
remain silent and privilege 
against self-incrimination); 
- The Rules on the Handling of 
Criminal Cases by Public 
Security Authorities permitted 
exceptions to the 24 hours time 
period for family notification; 
- Extensive periods of police 
custody permitted by law, no 
independent judicial review of 
arrest and detention; 
- Article 96 of the CPL 
provides for access to a lawyer 
only after the first interrogation; 
- Lack of independence of the 
judiciary;  
- Presumption of innocence not 
respected; and 
- Access to a lawyer and the 
right to defence was severely 
limited. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> According to the NHRA, the State 
encourages the revision and abolition of laws, 
regulations and regulatory documents inconsistent 
with the Lawyers Law to guarantee the right to legal 
counsel. 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is alleged that there 
continue to be numerous ways in which China&#8216;s CPL, 
police, procuratorates and court practices fail to 
conform with international fair trial standards, and 
recent legal and regulatory amendments fail to 
address many of these failings.  
Reportedly: 
- There have been no legal amendments, enacted or 
proposed, that would guarantee the right to remain 
silent; 
- There have been no legal amendments, enacted or 
proposed, that would grant to suspects a presumption 
of innocence, or that places the burden of proof on the 
prosecution;  
- Right to counsel remains restricted:  
- Suspects are not allowed to meet with their lawyer 
until after their first interrogation by police;  
- Lawyers still need to give notice to the police before 
meeting with their clients and the police have up to 
48 hours to make the necessary arrangements;  
- In &#8213;serious and complicated&#8214; cases, a meeting with 
counsel may take place up to five days after an 
application is made;

<p>- Police retain the discretion to be present during 
meetings between lawyers and their clients, according 
to &#8213;necessity and circumstances&#8214;;  
- In cases involving &#8213;state secrets&#8214;, the CPL requires 
that the appointment of a lawyer and meetings 
between lawyers and clients are approved by the 
&#8213;investigative organ&#8214;;  
- The revised State Secrets Law (SSL) from 2010 
fails to make provisions for the right of defendants 
suspected of a &#8213;state secrets&#8214; crime to access their 
lawyer.6 
- In more than a dozen cases investigated by NGOs, 
Falun Gong practitioners were either told they were 
not allowed to hire a legal counsel of their choice due 
to the nature of their case, or were not permitted 
access to their chosen or appointed lawyer without 
permission of the police or security organs. Lawyers 
who represent, or seek to represent Falun Gong 
practitioners, have come under intense  harassment 
and intimidation by the authorities, and two had their 
licences permanently revoked in 2010 after walking 
out in protest at irregularities during a trial of a Falun 
Gong practitioner.   
- In many other politically sensitive cases investigated 
by NGOs lawyers are intimidated and harassed, 
pressurized not to represent politically sensitive 
groups such as Tibetans, Uighurs and Falun Gong 
practitioners and prevented from seeing their clients 
or accessing necessary documents to mount a full 
defence.  
 
While the revised CPL of 1997 provides that People&#8216;s 
Courts are to &#8213;exercise judicial power independently 
in accordance with law&#8214;, the proceedings of local 
courts are routinely interfered with by local political

independence.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2009: </i></b> It is reported that 
the unconditional right of confidential access to a 
lawyer after initial interrogation (Lawyers Law) 
makes an exception for cases involving State secrets. 
The law contradicts the broad restrictions of legal 
counsel in the CPL. It is alleged that the vague 
concept of State Secret was used extensively and 
arbitrarily to deny access to legal representation, 
access to case files and to hold trials in camera.   
</p>
<p>(k)The power to order or 
approve arrest and 
supervision of the police and 
detention facilities of the 
procurators should be 
transferred to independent 
courts  
</p>
<p>There is no provision under 
Chinese law for individuals to 
be brought promptly before an 
independent judicial authority 
to assess the lawfulness of the 
detention. Decisions over an 
extension of custody and pre-
trial detention rested with the 
Public Procuratorate. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources 2008:</i></b>  Reportedly, the 
Public Procuratorate remains in charge of decisions 
over extending police custody and pre-trial detention. 
 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>l) Art. 306 of the Criminal 
Law, according to which any 
lawyer who counsels a client 
to repudiate a forced 
confession, for example, 
could risk prosecution, 
should be abolished. 
</p>
<p>Together with art. 38 of the 
CPL, which made &#8213;interfering 
</p>
<p>with the proceedings before 
judicial organs&#8214; an offence, 
</p>
<p>article 306 of the CL could be 
invoked to harass, intimidate 
and sanction lawyers. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Art. 37 was added to the 
newly amended Lawyers Law stating that lawyers are 
not legally responsible when acting on behalf of their 
clients or speaking for a defendant. Reportedly, this 
does not apply to lawyers &#8213;whose speech endangers 
the national security, or who maliciously slanders 
others and seriously disturbs the order of the court&#8214;. It 
is reported that Art. 306 CL and 38 CPL continue to 
be used to intimidate lawyers and impede their efforts 
to defend clients and take on sensitive cases.  
- The repression and harassment of lawyers who take 
on &#8213;sensitive&#8214; cases has reportedly increased. In May 
09, 18 lawyers, handling some of the most important 
human rights cases in 2008, lost their licenses. By the 
end of August, six cases of attacks on lawyers or their 
involvement in &#8213;accidents&#8214; were reported. Several

<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   It is reported that the 
previously conducted &#8215;in-house&#8216; education campaigns 
have not yielded appreciable results in the past. China 
has not fulfilled the obligation to widely educate its 
employees and citizens about human rights and the 
prohibition of torture. It has furthermore blocked 
access of civil society actors to information and 
human rights training courses. Websites reporting on 
human rights violations are reportedly blocked, 
censored or closed down by the authorities.

penalty. 
</p>
<p>The SPC restored its power of 
review in October 2005. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : It is reported that China 
continues to refuse to release national statistics on the 
application of the death penalty classifying such 
information as &#8213;state secrets&#8214;. It is estimated that 
there have reportedly been more than 5,000 
executions in 2008. Other observers estimate that 
death sentences were reduced by half since the review 
was returned to the SPC. In the absence of public 
statistics, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of 
such numbers. The appeal process in death penalty 
cases remains closed to outside observers.  
- Plans to implement the full audio-visual recording 
of appellate court proceedings in death penalty cases 
were announced. 
</p>

</p>
<p>r) The scope of the death 
penalty should be reduced, 
e.g. by abolishing it for 
economic and non-violent 
crimes. 
</p>
<p>Chinese law provided for the 
death penalty in relation to a 
wide range of offences that did 
not reach the international 
standard of &#8213;most serious 
</p>
<p>crimes&#8214;; among the more than 
</p>
<p>60 capital offences, there were 
many economic and other non-
violent crimes. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The SPC was reportedly 
working on a judicial interpretation of &#8213;the most 
serious and vile&#8214; crimes, for which the death penalty 
should be applied exclusively. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2009:</i></b>  It is reported that 
the number of capital offences remains the same. It is 
alleged that the Government still executes persons for 
non-violent, political crimes and there are no 
indications that the practice may change.

dramatically in the last couple of years, in a trend that 
goes sharply against the recommendation by the

indicted in 2007. It is reported that on July 13, 
China&#8216;s SPC issued detailed statistics regarding the 
handling of various categories of criminal offenses. 
According to these statistics the number of first-
instance trials concluded involving &#8213;endangering state 
security (ESS) rose to around 760 in 2009, from 
around 460 in 2008.7 The SPC report also stated that 
the proportion of individuals charged with 
&#8213;endangering state security&#8214; crimes that received 
heavy sentences&#8212;defined as a prison term of five 
years or more, life imprisonment, or a death sentence 
(including suspended death sentence) rose by 20 
percent in 2009. 
- Concern is raised in particular regarding the impact 
of the increased use of &#8213;endangering State security&#8214; 
and other political crimes to charge and convict 
ethnic minorities for alleged &#8213;splittist&#8214; activities, 
particularly in the context of the unrest in both the 
Tibet Autonomous Region and the XUAR in 2008 
and 2009. According to information published in the 
Xinjiang Yearbook, from 1998 to 2003, more than 
half of all trials involving the charge of &#8213;endangering 
state security&#8214; were adjudicated in the XUAR.   
- According to the report of the president of the 
XUAR Higher People&#8216;s Court in January 2010, there 
was an increase from 268 in 2008 to 437 cases of 
&#8213;endangering state security&#8214; adjudicated in the 
XUAR, an increase of 63%. Sentences of at least 10 
years in prison, life imprisonment or the death penalty 
had reportedly been imposed on 255 individuals.8

against human rights defenders involved in peaceful 
advocacy and active use of legal avenues for redress 
of violations including torture and ill treatment.9   
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2009:</i></b>  It is reported that 
the Government has taken no steps towards the 
abolition of political crimes. It is alleged that many 
people are still detained and sentenced for crimes 
such as &#8213;endangering state security&#8214; (ESS). It is 
reported that the specific targeting of human rights 
lawyers has increased (see supra, recommendation j). 
In addition, political prisoners face discrimination in 
the sentence reduction and parole process. While a 
1997 notice by the SPC prescribes to handle their 
cases &#8213;strictly&#8214;, notices issued by municipal and 
</p>
<p>provincial high courts have shown to prohibit parole 
for ESS prisoners. According to an analysis of

prisoners is roughly 50% lower than for other 
prisoners.

After the 1997 changes, 
political dissidents, journalists, 
writers, lawyers, human rights 
defenders, Falun gong 
practitioners and members of 
the Tibetan and Uighur ethnic, 
linguistic and religious 
minorities continued to be

prison terms.

Labour&#8214; and similar forms 
</p>
<p>of forced re-education in 
prisons, pre-trial detention 
centres and psychiatric 
hospitals should be 
abolished. 
</p>
<p>RTL and other forms of 
administrative detention had 
been used for many years 
against political groups, Falun 
Gong practitioners and human 
rights defenders, accused of 
politically deviant and dissident 
behaviour, disturbance of the 
social order or similar petty 
offences. Some of these 
measures of re-education 
through coercion, humiliation 
and punishment were aimed at 
altering the personality of 
detainees up to the point of 
breaking their will. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The discussions on RTL 
in the National People&#8216;s Congress have not yielded 
</p>
<p>official results. However, the available statistical data 
suggest that the use of RTL is declining, partly due to 
the sending of drug-related offenders to &#8213;coercive 
quarantine for drug rehabilitation (CQDR)&#8214;,  a new 
</p>
<p>form of administrative detention for drug addicts 
initiated under the new Drug Prohibition Law 
(effective 1 June 08). Concerns over the treatment of

<p><b>  Follow-up Report to the Recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on Torture (Manfred Nowak) in the report of 
</b></p>
<p><b>his visit to Denmark from 2 March to 9 May 2008 (UN Doc. A/HRC/10/44/Add.2) 
</b></p>
<p>11. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Denmark, requesting 
information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not responded to his request. He looks forward to receiving information on 
Denmark&#8216;s efforts to follow-up to the recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat 
torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur takes note of Denmark&#8216;s responses provided to the recommendations10 made in the course of its 
Universal Periodic Review on 2 May 2011. The Special Rapporteur trusts that the definition of torture, as covered by the existing 
provisions of the Danish Criminal Code, is in full conformity with the Convention against Torture, by which torture is defined as a 
serious crime, sanctioned with penalties commensurate with the gravity of torture.   
</p>
<p>13. On the issue of the continued practice of solitary confinement, the Special Rapporteur stresses that solitary confinement is a 
harsh measure which may cause serious psychological and psychological adverse effects on individuals regardless of their specific 
conditions. He defines prolonged solitary confinement as any period of solitary confinement in excess of 15 days.11   
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur encourages the authorities to ensure that detained persons held in solitary confinement are afforded 
genuine opportunities to challenge both the nature of their confinement and its underlying justification through the courts of law. 
This requires a right to appeal all final decisions by prison authorities and administrative bodies to an independent judicial body 
empowered to review both the legality of the nature of the confinement and its underlying justification. Thereafter, detained persons 
must have the opportunity to appeal these judgements to the highest authority in the State and, after exhaustion of domestic 
remedies, seek review by regional or universal human rights bodies.12  
</p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the implementation by the Danish Parliament of the Directive 2008/115/EF of the 
European Parliament and the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning third-country nationals 
illegally staying in member States, which sets an absolute limit to the length of detention of foreigners pending deportation. He 
expresses concern about the reports indicating that many asylum seekers continue to remain detained in Elleb&#230;k for long periods of 
time and in excess of the 6-month period prescribed in the EU Directive 2008/115/EF. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
many of those individuals who are victims of trafficking, mentally ill or torture victims, are reportedly subjected to unduly long 
waiting periods and are allegedly held in solitary confinement.

<p>16. On the issue of diplomatic assurances, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the June 2011 decision of the High Court of 
Denmark, upholding the decision of Hiller&#248;d Court not to permit extradition on the grounds that diplomatic assurances. He further 
welcomes Denmark&#8216;s assurances that pursuant to section 31 in the Danish Aliens Act a foreigner may not be returned to a country 
where he/she will be at risk of the death penalty or of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, 
or where the foreigner will not be protected against being sent on to such a country. The safeguard against refoulement is absolute.13 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Government did not accept the UPR recommendation to assess in an open and 
transparent manner the consequences of flights conducted over Danish territory.14 He reiterates his previous recommendation to 
ensure that investigations into alleged CIA rendition flights using airports in Denmark including Greenland are carried out in an 
inclusive and transparent manner.

</i></p>
<p><i>Steps taken in previous years and (See

</i></p>
<p><i>Information received in the reporting

<p><i>period 
</i></p>
<p>(a) Incorporate a specific 
crime of torture in the 
criminal law. 
</p>
<p>Section 157 (a) of the Criminal 
Code referred to torture as 
aggravating circumstance in 
relation to existing crimes and 
increased the maximum 
penalties for such acts. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Committee on Criminal 
Law has thoroughly assessed the need for 
the adoption of a specific provision on the 
crime of torture in Danish criminal law. It 
did not recommend this mainly due to the 
fact that all acts considered to be covered by 
Art. 1 CAT, are covered by existing 
provisions of Danish criminal law. The 
current legislation &#8211; including the provision 
in Section 157 (a) of the Criminal Code is a 
sufficient and adequate response to the need 
to criminalize torture.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The Minister of 
Justice re-affirmed that the position of the 
Government, expressed in para 157 (a) of 
the Danish Criminal Code, considering 
torture as an aggravating circumstance, but 
not as a specific crime, remains unchanged.    
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The status has not changed. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The 
situation remains unchanged. Several 
politicians have expressed an interest in 
working for the inclusion of a specific 
crime of torture in the Danish criminal 
law.  
</p>
<p>On 1 July 2011, Denmark formally 
communicated to the Working Group of 
the UPR that it had accepted the UPR 
recommendation to ensure that all acts 
of torture are specific offences under its 
criminal law. Denmark considers that all 
acts of torture are cirminalized in the 
Danish Criminal Code, thus implying 
that there is no need for a specific crime 
of torture in the criminal code. 
</p>
<p>(b) Further reduce the use of 
solitary confinement, based 
on the unequivocal evidence 
of its negative mental health 
effects upon detainees. 
</p>
<p>Solitary confinement of remand 
prisoners on the basis of a court 
decision was used to isolate 
suspects during criminal 
investigations in pre-trial 
detention, whereas 
administrative solitary 
confinement (reduced or total 
exclusion from association with 
other detainees) may be 
imposed on remand and 
convicted prisoners on the basis 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In 2009, there 
was no new legislation concerning solitary 
confinement. The statistics for 2008 were 
not available.  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> A report from the Danish 
Director of Public Prosecutions from 31 
October 2008 shows that there has been a 
significant decrease in the use of solitary 
confinement of remand prisoners in 2007 
compared to previous years. The total 
number of days remand prisoners were in 
solitary confinement was 13.838 in 2006 and 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  
Reportedly, administrative solitary 
confinement imposed on remand 
prisoners and convicted prisoners cannot 
be appealed to independent judicial 
review, but only appealed 
administratively to the Prison 
Directorate and ultimately the Minister 
of Justice. In addition, there is no upper 
limit to the extent of this measure, nor is 
the person subjected to this measure 
entitled to access to the information that </p>

</p>
<p>A report from the Danish Prison and 
Probation Service shows that the number of 
solitary confinements imposed as 
punishment for disciplinary infractions has 
decreased from 715 persons in 2006 to 631 
persons in 2007.16 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No new 
legislation has been adopted regarding 
solitary confinement since 2007. 
</p>
<p>- On 30 March 2010, the Ministry of Justice 
received a report from the Director of Public 
Prosecutions on the use of solitary 
confinement in 2008, according to which: 
</p>
<p>i. The total number of cases of solitary 
confinement has increased 20% from 273 
cases in 2007 to 327 cases in 2008, while the 
average duration of solitary confinement 
decreased from 27 days in 2007 to 21 days 
in 2008. 
</p>
<p>ii. Four persons under the age of 18 were 
placed in solitary confinement. 
</p>
<p>iii. Solitary confinement was used in 5,3% 
of all instances of pre-trial detention. In 
approximately 91% of the cases it was used 
in relation to serious criminal offences.   
</p>
<p>- On 1 June 2010, the amendment of the 
Criminal Code lowering the age of criminal 
liability from 15 years to 14 years, could 
potentially impact on the use of solitary 
</p>
<p>forms the basis for the decision. The 
measure can be imposed on prisoners on 
suspicion that they are pressuring or 
threatening other inmates, but evidence 
to substantiate such suspicions does not 
have to be presented or procured.

<p>- Although the Government acknowledged 
the need to decrease the number and 
duration of solitary confinement, it 
continues to use solitary confinement to  
secure the criminal investigation in serious 
offences, such as organized crime, gang 
crime, severe drug crime and terrorism.  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> According to the report of the 
Danish Ministry of Justice from June 200917, 
from 2004 to 2007, there has been some 
decrease in the use of solitary confinement 
of remand prisoners with significant 
decrease registered during the period of 
2006-2007 and an increase in the number of 
remand prisoners in solitary confinement 
registered in the period of 2007-2008.  
</p>
<p>The average length of solitary confinement 
has decreased in recent years. The total 
number of days remand prisoners were held 
in solitary confinement was 13.838 in 2006, 
7.189 in 2007 and 6.910 in 2008.  In 2008, 
the total number of days remand prisoners 
were in solitary confinement was the lowest 
since the registration started in 2001.

<p>The Danish Ministry of Justice is currently 
reviewing the recommendations issued by a 
working group under the Danish Prison and 
Probation Service in 2010 on limiting the 
use and duration of exclusion from 
association with other detainees. 
</p>
<p>(c) set an absolute limit to the 
length of detention of 
foreigners pending 
deportation, and review the 
practice of habeas corpus 
under section 37 of the Aliens 
Act. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There was no 
amendment to the Aliens Act concerning a 
maximum limit to the length of deprivation 
of liberty for foreigners pending deportation. 
A bill amending the Aliens Act was adopted 
in Dec.08. The bill states that, unless there 
are particular reasons against it, the Danish 
authorities should instruct illegal immigrants 
who cannot be deported to take residence at 
asylum centre Sandholm and report to the 
local police at specific times.19  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> By 5 November 2009, 45 
aliens were detained in Elleb&#230;k of which 18 
were waiting to be returned or deported. 31 
aliens who had been expelled and who are 
awaiting an effectuation of the decision of 
expulsion were remanded in custody. 
Furthermore, the National Commissioner of 
Police, Aliens Department, took over 27 
cases of aliens who have been detained or 
remanded in custody in order to be deported 
from the local police districts. In a majority 
of these 58 cases, detention will therefore 
only be for a short period of time.

<p>The Directive 2008/115/EF of the EU 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  On 22 
March 2011, the Danish Parliament 
implemented Directive 2008/115/EF of 
the European Parliament and the 
Council on common standards and 
procedures in Member States for 
returning illegally staying third-country 
nationals. This included time limits for 
detention (six months and an additional 
12 months where there may be lack of 
cooperation by the third-country 
national or delays in obtaining the 
necessary documentation from third 
countries, in line with the EU Directive 
rules).  
</p>
<p>Many asylum seekers continue to 
remain detained in Elleb&#230;k for long 
periods of time and longer than the 6-
month period prescribed in the EU 
Directive 20080/115/EF.

<p>Reportedly, many of those individuals 
are victims of trafficking, mentally ill or

Victims of trafficking can be accommodated 
in a crisis centre exclusively targeted to 
them, a crisis centre for victims of domestic 
violence, a women&#8216;s crisis centre housing 
female asylum seekers and trafficked 
women under the Danish Red Cross, as well

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The report 
issued by the inter-ministerial working 
group for combating human trafficking in 
June 2010, specifies the steps undertaken to 
implement the government&#8216;s plan of action 
for the period of 2007-2010. The types of 
support provided to victims include, inter 
alia, services such as medical, psychological 
and dental treatment, legal and social 
services. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> General awareness raising 
campaign is planned to take place in the end 
of 2010 and early 2011 to enhance the 
knowledge on trafficking among the general 
public. Through workshops, seminars and 
public debate settings, the campaign also 
aims at reaching professionals working with 
trafficking or in some way interacting with 
victims of trafficking. Furthermore, victims 
of trafficking from both EU-countries and 
non EU-countries shall have targeted 
information about their rights and the 
possibilities for assistance available to them 
in Denmark.  
</p>
<p>According to the evaluation carried out 
among 1004 persons following the public 
awareness raising campaign in 2006, 1/3 
answered that they had fairly good 
knowledge about trafficking, 1/3 responded 
that they had bad knowledge of the topic, 
and 1/3 indicated that they had neither a bad 
nor good knowledge of the topic. A new 
survey carried out in 2009 among 1261 
persons showed that 82% had heard about 
trafficking in women, 22% had heard about 
trafficking in children to Denmark, 9% had 
heard about trafficking in men to Denmark, 
15% had never heard about the topic, and </p>

arrangements exist for male 
and female detainees to be 
accommodated in the same 
premises, the decision of a 
woman to be placed together 
with men is based on her 
completely free and informed 
decision, and scrupulously 
monitor appropriate 
safeguards to prevent abuse. 
</p>
<p>Practice of accommodating 
male and female detainees in the 
same premises, based on the 
principle of normalization; 
while in most places such 
arrangements were voluntary, 
this was not the case in Nuuk 
Prison in Greenland.

<p> 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Special attention will be paid 
to the placement of female inmates in 
connection with the establishment of the 
new institution in Nuuk, which is planned to 
open in 2013. 
</p>
<p>According to the Chief Governor of 
Institutions in Greenland, no cases of 
violence or sexual abuse of women have 
been registered in the existing institution in 
Nuuk even though close relationships are 
sometimes formed between female and male 
inmates. In addition, nothing indicates that 
the women form relationships with male 
inmates for protection purposes. 
</p>
<p>Staff will continue their awareness of the 
female inmates and of the need to intervene 
if there are any signs of imbalance in the 
relationship or problems between male and 
female inmates. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Director of the Prison 
and Probation Services in Greenland has 
reported that there have been no changes in 
the situation concerning female detainees in 
Nuuk Prison. The practice of the prison and 
Probation Service to place inmates-male or 
female-as close to home as possible, implies 
that women serving a sentence in Greenland 
will be placed in units together with male 
inmates. The Director of the Prison and 
Probation Service in Greenland has been 
instructed to monitor the situation closely, 
and should problems related to placing 
female inmates together with male inmates 
arise, the Prison and Probation Service will

</p>
<p>- Unforeseen events during the planning 
process have delayed the opening of the new 
institution in Nuuk until late 2015. The 
conditions of female detainees in the new 
institution will be at the centre of attention.  
</p>
<p>- According to Copenhagen Prisons, male 
inmates are rarely placed in women&#8216;s unit. 
As of 2010, a new unit in the Herstedvester 
Institution was only for female inmates. The 
female inmates have the possibility to work 
and study together with male inmates if they 
wish to, however in the new unit it is 
possible to choose to work and engage in 
activities during leisure time without the 
presence of male inmates.  
</p>
<p>- A research project focusing on female 
inmates was concluded in November 2010 
and will form the basis for an assessment on 
how to improve the conditions for female 
inmates.

diplomatic assurances as a 
means of returning suspected

Greenlandic airports (e.g. 
Narsarsuaq) were used by the 
CIA to transport prisoners as

established to investigate these 
allegations. 
</p>
<p>Greenland and the Faroese Islands, written 
by the Inter-ministerial Working Group, was 
released the 23 October 2008. 
</p>
<p>There is no basis to conclude that the 
Government bears (co-)responsibility for 
illegal activities of the CIA or other foreign 
authorities. The existing Danish control 
regimes are adequate to ensure that the 
relevant authorities have the necessary 
possibilities to intervene should the 
authorities receive concrete knowledge of 
any rendition flight heading towards or 
being in Danish, Greenlandic or Faroese 
airspace.22 
</p>
<p>In connection with the publication of the 
report on Secret CIA-flights in Denmark, 
Greenland and Faroe Islands on the 23 Oct. 
08, the Government endorsed the 
recommendations made by the Inter-
ministerial Working Group and immediately 
initiated the implementation process of the 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>In accordance with the recommendations, 
the Government informed the US of the 
Danish position and law in relation to 
renditions, through a note verbal of 27 Oct. 
</p><p>08. In the note, it strongly condemned the 
use of extraordinary renditions. Just prior to 
the publication of the report the Danish 
Government received on the 22 October a 
future guarantee from the US underlining 
that no rendition will take place through the 
airspace or territory of the Kingdom of

<p>alleged CIA rendition flights was not 
carried out with the inclusion of 
independent experts and civil society to 
ensure a fully inclusive and transparent 
process.  
</p>
<p>It is alleged that <i>Wikileaks</i> has 
reportedly made a number of documents 
public underlining the double sided 
dispositions of the Danish Government 
into the alleged CIA rendition flights. 
Reportedly, in a released 
correspondence between the American 
embassy in Denmark and the US State 
Department, the Danish Government has 
reportedly stressed the importance of 
resolving the issue on the rendition 
flights in the most agreeable manner, 
while the Government in the Danish 
media has reportedly portrayed anger 
and frustration over not being able to get 
straight answer from the American 
authorities on the rendition flights. 23

<p>On 1 July 2011, Denmark rejected the 
UPR recommendation to assess the 
flights that were conducted over Danish 
territory and landings that took place in 
the context of the CIA extradition

<p>on several occasions discussed the matter 
with the USA and clearly indicated that 
Denmark do not accept the use of Danish 
Greenlandic and Faroese airspace nor 
airports for flights and stopovers, which are 
not in accordance with international law.  
</p>
<p>By Government&#8216;s decision and in light of 
the new information about the landing of an 
aircraft in Narsarsuaq and the possible 
linkage between these aircrafts and the CIA, 
the Interministerial Working Group for the 
Compilation of the Report Concerning 
Secret CIA Flights in Denmark, Greenland 
and on Faroe Islands (The CIA Working 
Group) was established to investigate all 
prior information on alleged CIA flights in 
Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands 
and to report on examination of the existing 
information. The report also contains 
information concerning events outside of 
Denmark, which are of importance to the 
case.  
</p>
<p>The working group concluded that based on 
the existing information it has not been 
possible to confirm or deny the &#8213;CIA&#8216;s 
Danish Connection&#8214;. On the basis of the 
working group&#8216;s conclusions , the CIA 
Working Group recommended that the 
Government informs the USA that any kind 
of renditions through Danish Greenlandic 
and Faroese airspaces without the explicit 
permission of the Danish authorities will be 
an unacceptable violation of Danish 
sovereignty; inform the USA that Denmark 
disapproves extrajudicial renditions, which 
take place outside the realm of the relevant 
national and international law; consistently 
at any given opportunity rejects all means 
which violate the rights of the detainee, </p>

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  On 25 June 
2009, several organizations appealed to the 
Minister of Integration and Asylum Affairs, 
arguing that rejected asylum seekers from 
Iraq should be issued a humanitarian 
residence permit. The organizations 
encouraged the Government to observe the 
recommendations from UNHCR not to 
forcibly deport rejected asylum seekers who 
had been in Denmark for a long period of 
time to certain parts of Iraq. In total, 282 
persons, including women, children and 
especially victims of torture, who might not 
be able to receive the proper treatment in 
their home of origin, given the current 
situation in Iraq, await deportation.25  
In August 2009, a group of 18 rejected male 
asylum seekers who had occupied a church 
in Copenhagen were arrested by the police 
with the aim of deporting them to Iraq. This 
caused public debate. The detention of 
possible victims of torture with the aim of 
deportation was criticized by a former 
member of CAT.  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Denmark is continuing its 
active international policy against torture, 
and sponsored several res. Both at the GA 
and at the HRC.

reported that the previous conditions of 
granting humanitarian residence permit 
by the Ministry for Refugee, 
Immigration and Integration Affairs to 
persons who suffer from a physical or a 
mental illness, and who, among others, 
cannot receive the necessary medical 
treatment in their home country, is no 
longer a fair and correct account of the 
practices pursuant to a new proposal for 
an amendment made in March 2010, 
called L187 26 in which the Government 
modified the requirement to obtain a 
humanitarian residence permit by stating 
that the treatment must be <i>not at all 
</i>available in the country of origin. This 
condition was emphasised in the 
explanatory comments to the bill. As 
such, the personal circumstances of the 
individual; neither his or her financial 
resources nor the distance he or she 
resides from the appropriate medical 
facilities, are taken into consideration. In 
2010, the Government amended the 
rules on acquisition of permanent 
residence (Aliens Act no 572/2010) to 
allow well-integrated immigrants to 
acquire a permanent residence permit 
after 4 years. The law does not specify

<p>their cases thoroughly reviewed by the 
refugee authorities based on a factual and 
individual assessment of all relevant 
information. The Refugee Appeals Board 
shall stay updated and informed about the 
general situation in the countries from which 
Denmark receives asylum-seekers, and the 
board has an extensive collection of 
background information which includes &#8211; 
but is not limited to &#8211; recommendations and 
guidelines from UNHCR. Iraqi asylum-
seekers who have had their cases reviewed 
by the refugee authorities also have the 
opportunity to apply for a residence permit 
on humanitarian grounds. According to the 
Danish Aliens Act, Section 9 b, subsection 
1, a residence permit on humanitarian 
grounds can be granted to a foreign national 
who is registered by the Immigration 
Service as an asylum seeker in Denmark. 
The applicant must be in such a situation 
that significant humanitarian considerations 
warrant a residence permit. The Parliament 
decided that humanitarian residence permits 
should be the exception, not the rule. 
</p>
<p>Applications for a residence permit on 
humanitarian grounds are considered by the 
Ministry of Refugee, Immigration and 
Integration Affairs. The Ministry conducts a 
factual assessment of each individual 
application. In making this individual 
assessment, the Ministry places importance 
on the applicant&#8216;s personal situation. 
According to the Ministry&#8216;s practice, a 
humanitarian residence permit may be 
granted to persons who suffer from a 
physical or a mental illness of a very serious 
nature, who cannot receive the necessary 
medical treatment in their home country, as 
well as persons who, upon return to a home

<p>the conditions or situations that entitle 
the applicants to dispensation, such as 
severe physical impairment or mental 
illness, due to severe trauma (torture) as 
is the case with the legislation on 
acquisition of citizenship.  
 
According to a circular on naturalization 
(no 61/2008), persons suffering from 
post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) 
are explicitly excluded from obtaining a 
dispensation, even if the condition is 
chronic and documented by a certificate 
issued by a medical doctor. 
 
Reportedly, the tightening of the rules 
on citizenship and permanent residence 
has in some instances made the situation 
for torture survivors, who are 
undergoing rehabilitation very difficult, 
due to the uncertainty of their legal 
status.  
 
Reportedly, an increasing number of 
torture survivors in Denmark have had 
to forego rehabilitation due to extreme 
poverty. This is due to the fact that 
many torture survivors receive the so-
called starting allowance, which was 
introduced in 2002 with the purpose of 
increasing the incentives for refugees 
and immigrants to seek employment 
(Act on Active Social Policy 2002). The 
starting allowance amounts to 650 EUR 
per month, while the regular 
unemployment benefit, cash allowance, 
amounts to 1.320 EUR. Reportedly, 
living on such a small amount does not </p>

<p>country with difficult living conditions, will 
be at risk of developing or experiencing a 
worsening of a severe disability.  
</p>
<p>According to the practice of the Ministry, 
there is a possibility of granting a residence 
permit on humanitarian grounds based on 
the applicant&#8216;s long stay in Denmark.  
</p>
<p>Section 9 b, subsection 1, of the Danish 
Aliens Act does not allow for granting 
humanitarian residence permits to groups of 
persons, as it is granted on the basis of a 
concrete assessment of a case. 
</p>
<p>The Ministry&#8216;s ruling regarding a 
humanitarian residence permit is final and 
cannot be appealed. If an asylum seeker 
receives a final rejection, he/she must leave 
Denmark immediately, but will be granted 
adequate time to prepare for departure. In 
this connection, authorities will show due 
consideration to a rejected asylum seeker 
who is suffering from acute illness, is in an 
advanced stage of pregnancy, or has given 
birth shortly before the final ruling. If a 
rejected asylum seeker refuses to leave 
Denmark voluntarily, it is the responsibility 
of the police to ensure his/her departure. 
</p>
<p>In general asylum seekers are at any time 
during the asylum procedure offered 
treatment. Newly arrived asylum seekers are 
offered an appointment with a Danish Red 
Cross nurse. Asylum seekers who have been 
subjected to torture receive consultations 
with a psychologist or psychiatrist and 
receive physiotherapy. In some cases the 
Danish Immigration Service has to approve 
the treatment. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   Denmark has 
</p>
<p>allow for payment of transport fees to 
and from rehabilitation centres. Whereas 
some torture survivors have been able to 
have their transport fees reimbursed by 
the Danish Regional authorities, those 
not covered by these rules must instead 
seek reimbursement from their local 
municipality, who in some instances 
have not granted reimbursement. This 
means that, reportedly, a number of 
torture survivors are unable to receive 
treatment.

</p>
<p>-Denmark lacks a genuine specialization in 
the area of rehabilitation in the health care 
system and does not promote development 
of basic and higher education of health 
professionals with regard to rehabilitation. 
Moreover, since the introduction of 
municipal reform in 2007, rehabilitation has 
been delegated to municipalities, where 
expertise is often lacking.  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Medical competence is an 
integral part of the medical specialty 
rheumatology. Medical doctors undergoing 
specialization in rheumatology need to 
acquire and demonstrate specific skills in 
treating patients in need of rehabilitation.  
</p>
<p>- The number of medical specialists in 
rheumatology is expected to increase by 
more than 50% until 2030, thus significantly 
increasing the availability of skilled medical 
practitioners in the Danish health care 
system.    
</p>
<p>Municipalities are responsible for providing 
the appropriate and necessary rehabilitation 
services to people in need of assistance. In 
recent years, the central authorities have 
launched a number of initiatives to support

allocating &#189; billion Danish kroner for

</p>
<p>&#8213;The fact that a person claims to have been 
exposed to torture cannot, according to the 
Ministry&#8216;s practice, lead to the granting of a 
humanitarian residence permit. However, 
seriously mental or physical illness as a 
result of torture can form the basis for a 
humanitarian residence permit. The 
Ministry&#8216;s practice regarding humanitarian 
residence permit based on a combination of 
a serious illness and torture is restrictive.&#8214;

<p>(i)The Special Rapporteur 
recommends, as a priority for 
the Greenland Home Rule 
Government, that it develop 
and implement an adequately

Greenland in cooperation 
with actors with relevant 
experience, such as the 
Ministry of Welfare and 
Gender Equality.

<p>High incidence of assault and 
sexual offences against women 
in Greenland: a study by the 
National Institute for Public 
Health showed that 60 per cent 
of women in Greenland aged 18 
to 24 were victims of assaults or 
threats; a third of whom were 
victims of aggravated assaults. 
34 per cent of these women 
were victims of sexual assaults; 
12.5 per cent already when they 
were children. Among female 
victims, 58 per cent claimed that 
the offender was their husband 
or live-in partner.  
</p>
<p>The Home Rule Government 
had committed to elaborating a 
&#8213;National strategy for 
prevention of rape, sexual 
harassment and assaults&#8214;.

currently being developed and the two main 
ambitions are to fully integrate the specific

<p>- with a view of increasing the competence 
of the personnel at the crises centres, the 
personnel has started attending 6 training 
courses scheduled for 2010-2012. 
</p>
<p>- In 2010, the Government of Greenland 
increased the grants for the crises centres 
substantially.  
</p>
<p>- To address the widespread problem of 
violence among adolescents, the Ministry of 
Social Affairs is exploring the possibilities 
of cooperation with an NGO or foundation.  
</p>
<p>-In 2011, the Government of Greenland will 
pass the Children and Youth Strategy to the 
Parliament for its approval. The strategy 
includes such issues as failure of child care, 
violence and addiction.    
</p>
<p>-A range of initiatives have already been 
implemented under the public health 
programme &#8213;Inuuneritta&#8214;, one of the focus 
areas of which is preventing violence and 
promoting sexual health: 
</p>
<p>- From 2009, educational courses called

<p>- As a result of close cooperation between 
the public health programme and 
municipalities and schools, an initiative on 
crime prevention and violence among youth 
has been launched among children of 8th

de aislamiento y otros medios de limitar el movimiento de los reclusos durante per&#237;odos prolongados. Considera recomendable que 
el Estado proporcione informaci&#243;n a este respecto. Sin embargo, el Relator Especial toma nota sobre la rehabilitaci&#243;n y 
modernizaci&#243;n de la c&#225;rcel p&#250;blica de Malabo y Beta, y exhorta al Gobierno a seguir con esta labor en los dem&#225;s centros de 
detenci&#243;n. Considera adem&#225;s un paso positivo el convenio firmado entre el Gobierno y el Comit&#233; Internacional de la Cruz Roja 
(CICR) que facilita visitas peri&#243;dicas de los delegados del CIRCR a los centros penitenciarios ecuatoguineanos para verificar las 
condiciones f&#237;sicas y psicol&#243;gicas de los detenidos as&#237; como el trato que se les da.  
</p>
<p>21. El Relator Especial toma reitera su recomendaci&#243;n de otorgar a los inmigrantes detenidos todos los derechos de las personas 
privadas de libertad reconocidos en los instrumentos internacionales, incluido el derecho a ponerse en contacto con sus 
representaciones consulares. </p>

<p>(76) El Relator Especial considera que 
para que Guinea Ecuatorial cumpla sus 
obligaciones en virtud del derecho 
internacional y su Constituci&#243;n es 
indispensable realizar una amplia 
reforma institucional y legal para crear 
&#243;rganos de aplicaci&#243;n de la ley basados 
en el estado de derecho, una judicatura 
independiente y mecanismos eficaces 
de supervisi&#243;n y rendici&#243;n de cuentas. 
Solo si se adoptan estas medidas podr&#225; 
aplicarse la Ley N&#186; 6/2006 que, en 
principio, constituye una buena base 
para prevenir y luchar eficazmente 
contra la tortura.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Fuentes no gubernamentales</i></b> : De 
manera general, no ha habido cambios 
institucionales significativos que 
permitan esperar una evoluci&#243;n 
positiva en el pa&#237;s. 
En la sesi&#243;n parlamentaria de marzo 
2009 se estudi&#243; y aprob&#243; el proyecto 
de reforma de la Ley Org&#225;nica del 
Poder Judicial, que aporta algunos 
cambios en la administraci&#243;n de la 
Justicia, aunque sigue sin haber 
independencia entre los diferentes 
poderes del Estado. 
 
<b>Gobierno:</b> Las disposiciones legales 
en materia de derechos humanos 
reconocen la responsabilidad del 
estado por los da&#241;os y perjuicios que 
pudiera sufrir un ciudadano como 
consecuencia del funcionamiento 
normal o anormal de las instituciones 
y &#243;rganos del Estados 
En materia de protecci&#243;n de los 
derechos del ciudadano, se ha creado 
un mecanismo no jurisdiccional (que 
incluye el Departamento Encargado 
del Sector Social y Derechos Humanos 
adscrito a la Presidencia del Gobierno,

tortura cuyo objetivo esencial es 
prevenir, prohibir y castigar con 
car&#225;cter permanente los actos de 
tortura y armonizar por consiguiente la 
legislaci&#243;n nacional con el Derecho 
Internacional. La ley proh&#237;be la tortura

por funcionario p&#250;blico u otra persona 
actuando en ejercicio de funciones 
oficiales o por instigaci&#243;n o con el 
consentimiento o aquiescencia de tal

responsabilidad civil del Estado para 
el resarcimiento  de todos los da&#241;os y 
perjuicios resultantes de este crimen 
contra la humanidad, ya sea contra la 
victima o sus derechohabientes. La ley 
prev&#233; una pena de prisi&#243;n menor de 
seis meses y un d&#237;a a seis a&#241;os de 
privaci&#243;n de libertad, multa de

<p>Guinea Ecuatorial, como lo indic&#243; el 
Gobierno durante la revisi&#243;n bajo el 
Examen Peri&#243;dico Universal. El 
Presidente Obiang lo confirm&#243; en su 
discurso del 1&#186; de septiembre de 2010 
en el Parlamento. 
</p>
<p>(77) Por lo que hace a la comunidad 
internacional, el Relator Especial 
observa que, a ra&#237;z del descubrimiento 
de reservas considerables de petr&#243;leo en 
el territorio de Guinea Ecuatorial, 
muchas empresas transnacionales est&#225;n 
operando en el pa&#237;s. Asimismo, varios 
donantes bilaterales y multilaterales 
est&#225;n ejecutando programas de 
asistencia t&#233;cnica, tambi&#233;n en las 
esferas del mantenimiento del orden y 
la administraci&#243;n de justicia. El Relator 
Especial invita a los actores de la 
comunidad internacional presentes en el 
pa&#237;s a que tengan en cuenta que el 
Relator Especial ha constatado que la 
polic&#237;a practica la tortura 
sistem&#225;ticamente, y velen por que, en 
sus actividades e iniciativas conjuntas, 
no sean c&#243;mplices de violaciones de la 
prohibici&#243;n de la tortura y los malos 
tratos.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Fuentes no gubernamentales</i></b> : 
Algunas empresas transnacionales 
subvencionan becas de estudios para 
los hijos de grandes dirigentes y 
emplean a agentes del r&#233;gimen y 
rechazan el empleo de personas no 
deseadas.

<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to Georgia in 
</b></p>
<p><b>February 2005  
</b></p>
<p><b>(E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.3, paras. 60-62) 
</b></p>
<p>22. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Georgia, requesting 
information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations. He 
expresses his gratitude to the Government for providing detailed information on steps taken during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p>23. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the report of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention following the country visit to 
Georgia from 15 to 24 June 2011, and the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), on its visit to Georgia carried out from 5 to 15 February 2010. 
</p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur is encouraged by efforts made by the Government to reduce the risk of ill-treatment and excessive 
use of force by the police at the time of apprehension, interrogation and transfer of detainees. He calls upon the Government to 
strengthen the procedural safeguards during the arrest, interrogation and transfer of detainees by inter alia ensuring proper 
registration of suspects at the time of apprehension and access to a lawyer of their choice.  
</p>
<p>25. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Action Plan for the Prevention of Torture and other Cruel or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment in Georgia and the objectives set therein for the period of 2011-2013, takes note of the establishment of Inter-Agency 
Coordinating Council Combating Ill-treatment (The Council), its new Strategy on Fight against Ill-treatment and looks forward to 
receiving its respective Action Plan and Evaluation Report for 2010-2011.  
</p>
<p>26. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the low number of initiated criminal prosecutions of cases of torture and 
other ill-treatment allegedly committed by public officials implicated in colluding on, or ignoring evidence of, torture or ill-
treatment and expresses concern that their names have neither been disclosed to the public nor to the Public Defender. The Special 
Rapporteur highlights the importance of ensuring public acknowledgment of the plight of the victims, including the facts and 
acceptance of responsibility and public apology. 
</p>
<p>27. It is imperative to expedite prompt, impartial and thorough investigations into allegations of torture and cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment and launch timely prosecutions and conclude them without delay, where the evidence warrants 
it. 27 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur received reports indicating that detainees refrain from filing complaints out of fear of reprisal. There 
is no protection afforded by the State to victims of torture. He calls on the Government to introduce independent, effective and 
accessible complaints mechanisms within all places of detention by installing telephone hotlines or confidential complaints boxes 
and ensure that complainants do not suffer any reprisal.

<p>29. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the measures envisaged under the new Code on Imprisonment of October 
2010, to address the issues pertinent to prison overcrowding, and encourages the Government to further improve the effectiveness 
of existing alternatives to pre-trial detention and consider the introduction of new alternatives through encouraging the use of non-
custodial measures such as bail, reporting to a police station, or house arrest.  
</p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to take steps to ensure that medical staff in places of detention is 
independent, by transferring them from the Ministry of Corrections and Legal Assistance to the Ministry of Health and provide 
training for the forensic medical services in the medical investigation of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>31. The Special Rapporteur received reports indicating that the NPM has reportedly been unable to oversee all places of 
detention comprehensively. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure budgetary allocations and equip it with 
sufficient human and other resources to ensure its effective functioning in accordance with the OPCAT.  </p>

<p>Anti-torture Action Plan and 
criminal justice reform. 
</p>
<p> The Anti-Torture Action Plan was 
adopted on 12 June 2008 by Presidential 
Decree 301;  
On 13 December 2008, the President of 
Georgia signed Decree No. 591 creating 
the Criminal Justice Reform Inter-Agency 
Coordinating Council. Its main objectives 
are: 
To elaborate relevant recommendations 
regarding the Criminal Justice Reform in 
line with the principles of the rule of law 
and the protection of human rights; 
To review and periodically revise the 
existing Criminal Justice Reform 
Strategy; 
To coordinate intergovernmental activities 
in the elaboration of the Criminal Justice 
Reform Strategy; and 
To elaborate proposals and 
recommendations regarding issues related 
to penal reform, probation, juvenile 
justice and legal aid. 
The members of the Council are high 
level governmental representatives 
(deputy ministers and heads of relevant 
services); members of the Judiciary, and 
the Public Defender of Georgia. 
Membership is open to representatives of 
international organizations and non-
governmental organizations, as well as to 
criminal justice system experts. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The 
Strategy of Criminal Justice System 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The Code of Administrative 
Offences envisages administrative 
detention as a sanction for violation of 
relevant provisions of the respective Code. 
Article 32 defines that administrative 
detention shall be applied to only as a last 
resort in cases explicitly defined by the 
Code for the term of up to 90 days. Only 
judge of relevant city (district court) is 
entitled to sentence person to an 
administrative detention.  
 
In 2011, the Parliament of Georgia has 
prepared new draft Code on 
Administrative Offences, with a view to 
ensuring its greater conformity with 
international human rights standards.  
 
The team of experts revised existing Draft 
Code in line with the proposed 
recommendations. The draft Code will be 
submitted for further expertise to the 
Council of Europe in the upcoming weeks.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Reportedly, 
the maximum period of punishment for an 
administrative offence has increased with 
three months. Since the Code of 
Imprisonment does not apply to detention 
in temporary police isolators, 
administrative detainees seem to be 
practically deprived of any legal 
safeguards and rights, such as regular 
contact with the outside world. In addition, </p>

<p>Reform was approved by the Parliament 
and the Government. The Government 
elaborated and approved the Action Plan 
for the Implementation of the Criminal 
Justice Reforms but most goals set by the 
strategy paper have not been achieved. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Regarding the Anti-torture 
Action Plan, two Working Groups have 
been established: one related to public 
awareness measures and a second one for 
the preparation of the new Action Plan 
envisaged for the next 2-3 years.  
The revised Criminal Justice Reform 
Strategy incorporates a specific chapter on 
juvenile justice and on probation. The 
Criminal Justice Reform Inter-Agency 
Council (&#8215;the Council&#8216;)  has created four

<p>Working Groups (juvenile justice, penal 
system reform, probation and legal aid) 
which are to elaborate recommendations 
and conduct field studies in order to adapt 
the Strategy and the Action Plan of the 
Criminal Justice Reform.  
- The Council has entrusted its secretariat 
to monitor the implementation of the 
Strategy and the related Action Plans on a 
permanent basis. The respective reports 
prepared by the Secretariat will be 
publicly available. 
- A draft Code on Imprisonment was 
elaborated, which (1) provides for a 
complaint procedure for prisoners (draft 
article 99); (2) provides that a complaint 
related to the allegation of torture or 
</p>
<p>the possibility to lodge an appeal against 
an order of administrative detention is not 
duly followed and implemented in 
practice; and compensation for illegally

under Article 144 para. 1 (Torture) of the 
Criminal Code that were allegedly 
committed by public officials. Two of 
these cases were closed, while the others 
are in progress. Two investigations are

Council) established in 2007 has 
elaborated first Action Plan and monitored 
its two year of implementation. In 2010, 
the Council adopted a new Strategy on 
Fight against Ill-treatment and its 
respective Action Plan. The new Strategy 
prioritizes development of effective 
complaint procedure for persons deprived 
of liberty; development of prompt, 
impartial and effective investigation of all 
allegations of ill-treatment; protection, 
compensation and rehabilitation of victims 
of ill-treatment; improvement of internal 
and external monitoring systems for early 
detection and prevention of ill-treatment in 
detention facilities, capacity building of 
relevant state and other institutions. The 
evaluation report for 2010-2011 will be 
published at Council&#8216;s website both in 
Georgian and in English languages.

the Government on the visit to Georgia 
carried out by the European Committee for 
the Prevention of Torture or inhuman and 
degrading treatment or punishment from 5 
to 15 February 2010, no cases of torture 
have been revealed during the committee&#8216;s 
examination. In addition, the CPT has also 
noted 80% decrease in number of ill-
treatment cases from the police in course 
of last five years.  
 
The Criminal Justice Reform (CJR) Inter-
Agency Coordination Council, which was 
created in 2008, continues its activities in 
the criminal justice sphere. The 
Government periodically drafts progress 
reports on the implementation of the 
reforms within the framework of the 
criminal justice reform strategy and action 
plans. The progress reports are published 
on the webpage of the Ministry of Justice 
of Georgia. The information about the 
ongoing reforms is publicly available at 
the Council&#8216;s website. Within the 
framework of the Criminal Justice reform 
the following legislative acts were 
adopted: the new Criminal Procedure 
Code of Georgia, New Imprisonment 
Code, the Juvenile Justice Prevention 
Strategy and the Prison Overcrowding

In 2011, investigation was commenced in 
relation to approximately 10 cases of ill-
treatment in the penitentiary establishment 
No. 8 in Gldani, No. 15 in Ksani and 
Medical Establishment No. 18 in Gldani. 
Investigations in these cases are ongoing.

<p>On 4 March 2011, the Prosecutor&#8216;s Office  
of Georgia commenced investigation on 
the suicide case of the prisoner Z.O. based 
on Article 115 of the Criminal Code of 
Georgia. The investigation is currently 
underway.  
 
In cooperation with Public Defenders 
Office the adapted versions of the lists of 
procedural rights for persons with 
administrative and criminal charges has 
been elaborated and translated into 
English, Russian, Azeri and Armenian 
languages.  
Since March 2011, these lists in five 
languages (including Georgian) are 
provided in all temporary detention 
isolators, displayed in the form of posters 
at visible places (at cells, rooms of 
investigation) and corresponding version 
is handed to each detainee upon

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Due to recent 
police reforms and increased 
professionalization, noticeable 
improvements have been achieved in 
relation to eradicating torture during 
police interrogations and police detention.  
 
Reportedly, there are persistent accounts 
of torture and other forms of ill-treatment 
of detainees within the penitentiary 
system. The ill-treatment consists mostly 
of beatings, but also of other forms of 
humiliation, such as insults and 
provocations. In addition, &#8213;telefono&#8214; 
(slamming the ears with both hands) and 
the hanging upside-down are reportedly 
used as torture methods in prison. Newly 
arrived detainees are reportedly subjected 
to a &#8213;welcoming beating&#8214; after being 
transferred to prison. According to some 
sources, there was an average of one fatal 
beating per year in prison. In late March 
2011, one detainee had reportedly died of 
his severe wounds inflicted on him by 
prison guards in Gldani Prison No. 8. 
Reportedly, the situation of torture and ill-
treatment vary between different facilities. 
The facilities most often referred to in this 
connection are Gldani Prison No. 8 and 
Prison No. 15 in Ksani. Both the 
administration of prisons and the prison 
guards are allegedly involved in abuses of 
detainees. In addition, special task forces,

Despite prisoners&#8216; complaints alleging

launched under Art. 333 of the Criminal

144.3 (inhuman or degrading treatment) of

<p>Not in place. CPC para. 73(f) states that a medical 
examination is an absolute right that can 
neither be denied nor restricted. Article 
73(f) refers to medical expertise (needed 
for the determination of important factual 
circumstances of a case), which is subject 
to a court decision; 
 
Article 922 of the Law on Imprisonment

CPC article 263, provides that, if

prisoner has injuries, the prosecutor can 
initiate a preliminary investigation, even

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The newly 
introduced adversarial system has 
reportedly brought about an increased 
indifference of the judiciary <i>vis-&#224;-vis</i> 
complaints or signs of ill-treatment of 
defendants before court.  
Reportedly, there were deficiencies both in 
law and in practice regarding the crucial 
role of the judiciary in combating torture, 
including in relation to shifting the burden 
of proof and the inadmissibility of 
evidence obtained by torture.  
 
Under the current legal system, full 
medical examinations are reportedly no 
longer mandatory at the time of entry to 
the penitentiary but only take place upon 
request; persons entering prison are only 
screened for obvious injuries or diseases. 
The medical staff at prisons is employed 
by the MCLA and is reportedly under 
considerable pressure of the prison 
administration; thus, their ability to do 
their work independently is seriously 
challenged. </p>

<p>October 2005 require the automatic 
opening of a case if reports on torture are 
received and fix maximum delays for 
preliminary investigations. 
</p>
<p>Under the new Criminal Procedure Code 
(CPC) in force since October 2010, the 
right of a defendant envisaged under Art 
75 (f) of the old Code remained 
unchanged. 
 
The new CPC does not envisage 
obligation of a judge to ask a defendant 
about physical injuries even if the injuries 
are visible. Only Art. 212 of the new CPC 
provides that the judge before approving a 
plea bargaining shall make sure that the 
defendant was not subjected to torture, 
inhuman and/or degrading treatment.  
In majority of administrative cases 
brought before the court, the detainees 
suffered from numerous visible injuries as 
a result of being beaten up by police, 
however, the judges examining their cases 
under the Code of administrative 
Offences, never inquired about the reasons 
of those physical injuries. Even when 
lawyers ask judges to indicate in the 
protocol that the detainees had physical 
injuries, reportedly in none of those cases 
was investigation launched on the basis of 
this information. 
 
Similarly, in several criminal cases, even 
when the defendants indicated in the court 
that the confession was extracted by 
torture and ill-treatment, no investigation 
was initiated and judges did not inquire 
further details.  
Reportedly, neither the current CPC nor 
the Code of Administrative Offences 
envisage obligation of a judge to inquire </p>

structural units to ensure that every person 
in their subordination, who carries out 
investigative activities in connection with

on Imprisonment, in case of violation of 
the human rights of inmates, the 
convict/pre-trial has the right to file a 
complaint against the staff of the 
penitentiary establishment. A pre-

authorized to file a confidential complaint. 
The complaint boxes are placed in every 
penitentiary establishment, and are 
accessible for all inmates. According to 
the Code on Imprisonment, complaints on 
torture, inhuman and degrading treatment 
are considered as a special case and shall 
be reviewed immediately with due respect 
of confidentiality.  
 
In 2010 and 2011, the Penitentiary 
Department of MCLA proactively

118 of the Criminal Code (&#8215;Less serious

In 2009, preliminary investigations were

which 5 were closed, while 13 cases are 
still ongoing. Preliminary investigations 
were initiated in one case under article 
333 of the Criminal Code. 
</p>
<p>addition, for the interest of justice, the 
Chief Prosecutor of Georgia has the 
authority, on ad-hoc basis, to re-allocate 
investigation of the criminal case from one 
prosecutorial jurisdiction to the other, 
excluding any bias in investigation of the 
ill-treatment case by the prosecution 
against public officials.  
 
Under Article 100 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code, investigator or prosecutor 
are required to promptly initiate 
investigation once they receive 
information regarding the crime.  
 
In 2011, investigation was commenced in 
23 cases under Article 144.1 (torture), out 
of which in 6 cases investigation was 
halted and 3 cases reached prosecution. 
During the same period, out of 5 
investigations commenced under Article 
144.3 (inhuman and degrading treatment 
or punishment); 2 investigations were 
halted and 1 case reached prosecution.

no investigation has been carried out into 
the allegations of ill-treatment by the 
police of participants of the peaceful 
demonstration of 15 June 2009. Despite 
numerous complaints submitted to the 
prosecutor&#8216;s office about cases of ill-
treatment while in detention and 
afterwards, no investigation has been 
carried out. Several police officers have 
reportedly been given disciplinary 
penalties envisaged under the Police Code </p>

Reportedly, 83 cases of ill-treatment by 
the police had been reported in 2009; none 
of which had allegedly happened in 
isolators, but during arrest, interrogations 
and transfer of detainees.  
Investigations and prosecutions into 
allegations of torture are reportedly neither 
effective nor prompt. Allegations of ill-
treatment are frequently ignored and 
victims not questioned.  One apparent 
obstacle to prompt and effective 
investigations seems to lie in timely 
obtaining forensic evidence of the alleged 
ill-treatment.  
 
The Forensic Bureau, which has formerly 
been under the Ministry of Justice, has 
recently become an independent legal 
entity. However, reportedly the Bureau 
only has old equipment at its disposal; its 
doctors are well trained but under a lot of  
pressure from the prosecutors. 
Furthermore, access to an independent 
forensic examination is almost impossible 
to obtain. 
There is also lack of skills to investigate 
cases of ill-treatment, inconclusive 
medical evidence and lengthy forensic 
examinations.

<p>the services of the police. The police and 
the prosecution are perceived by many 
stakeholders as not independent.  
 
The new CPC does not regulate the 
jurisdiction of the investigative bodies 
over investigating the crime. It is now 
regulated under Article 2 of the Decree # 
178 of the Ministry of Justice, dated 29 
September 2010, which is mostly similar 
to what was stated in Art 62 of the old 
CPC.  
However, in practice there are cases, when 
this requirement is not fulfilled. Crimes, 
which might involve responsibility of a 
police officer, to certain extent (most 
important investigative measures are 
conducted), if not fully, is investigated by 
the investigators of Ministry of Interior, 
the same Ministry to which the police 
subordinates. 
 
Reportedly, prisoners reporting ill-
treatment in penitentiary institutions to the 
NPM members usually refuse to apply for 
opening investigation on those facts, as 
they allegedly do not want to have 
problems with the prison administration. 
According to non-governmental sources, 
in 2008 five cases under Art 144.1 of the 
CC (torture) were examined by the first 
instance court and nine under Art 144.3 
(inhuman and degrading treatment). In 
2009, no cases have been examined by the 
national courts under Art 144.1, and only 
one case was examined under Art 144.3. </p>

<p> Amendments to the CC along with 
Internal Guidelines of the Prosecutor 
General regarding Preliminary 
Investigation into allegations of torture, 
inhuman and degrading treatment adopted 
on 7 October 2005 introduced a number 
of safeguards, notably supervision by a 
judge and presence of a defence lawyer; 
The guidelines also provide that no plea 
agreements should be used with respect to 
victims of torture and/or with respect to 
persons accused of torture, threat to 
torture and inhumane and degrading 
treatment.  
No legal-administrative act regulating 
plea agreement proceedings exists within 
the Office of the Prosecutor General; 
however, the Prosecutor has issued 
Internal Guidelines of a recommendatory 
character as an authoritative guideline for 
prosecutors in accordance with 
recommendations by international 
experts. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The new Criminal 
Procedure Code (CPC), 2010, is based on 
a number of fundamental principles, such 
as the independence of judiciary, 
adversarial proceedings and the jury trials. 
It provides several important safeguards 
against torture and ill-treatment, upholds 
the impermissibility to influence the 
freedom of the will of a person by means 
of torture, violence, cruel treatment, as 
well as by means of affecting the memory 
or mental state of a person (Article 4.2.).  
Under Article 100 of the CPC, investigator 
or prosecutor are required to promptly 
initiate investigation once they receive 
information regarding the crime. At the 
same time, Georgian legal framework 
ensures independent and effective 
investigation into the facts of torture and 
ill-treatment if committed by the 
policeman.  
 
Under the new CPC, it is prohibited to 
enter into plea agreement which limits the 
defendant&#8216;s constitutionally guaranteed 
right to request prosecution of relevant 
people in cases of torture and inhuman or 
degrading treatment (Article 210.5.). 
Before approving plea agreement, the 
court must get confirmation from the 
defendant that torture, inhuman or 
degrading treatment was not exercised on 
the defendant from the police or other law 
enforcement agency. The judge must in 
addition inform the defendant that should 
the defendant decide to file a complaint 
about being subjected to torture, inhuman </p>

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Detainees are 
often afraid to complain about alleged 
torture and ill-treatment out of fear of 
reprisals, negative consequences for their 
possibility to enter into a plea bargaining 
agreement or reverse effects on parole.  
 
Reportedly, retaliation for complaints of 
torture and ill-treatment by prison staff 
takes various forms, including in many 
cases, persons complaining of abuses 
being put under a stricter regime or 
threatened that their situation was going to 
be worsened in case they complained. The 
impediments to complain were reportedly 
graver in the prison system. The practice 
of plea bargaining in Georgia, where some 
80% of all convictions are reportedly plea 
bargained and the acquittal rate stands at 
the extremely low rate of 0.01%, has an 
adverse effect on the launching of 
complaints in case of ill-treatment by the 
police.

failure to identify the perpetrator is not a 
hindrance for a victim to bring an action 
before the civil courts on the basis of state 
liability, came into force on 1 January 
2007; 
CPC articles 219-229 deal with 
compensation for damages sustained as a 
result of illegal actions by law-
enforcement organs.  
Campaigns aimed to raise awareness are 
foreseen by para. 5(3) of the Anti-Torture 
Action Plan; the latter also contains 
detailed provisions on adequate medical 
treatment and rehabilitation. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The major 
goal of the criminal justice reform is to 
create conditions for the rehabilitation and 
re-integration of convicts, an aim set by 
article 39 of the Criminal Code of 
Georgia. At the moment, no measures are 
in place to ensure such re-integration.

<p><b>Government: </b>Supporting inmates&#8216; 
resocialization process is among the top 
priorities of the MCLA. For this purpose, 
various rehabilitation programs are being 
actively implemented within the 
penitentiary and probation system, 
including: 
</p>
<p>a. Preparation for release program  
b. Psychiatric health program  
c. Employment opportunities for

<p>prisoners  
d. Contact with outside world 
e. Education 
f. Community Service  
</p>
<p> 
Victims of ill-treatment/excessive use of 
force have enforceable right to 
compensation for non-pecuniary damages. 
Article 92 of the CPC foresees opportunity 
to initiate civil/administrative procedure to 
request a compensation for damages 
suffered during the criminal proceedings 
or as a result of an unlawful court 
decision. In 2009, compensation was 
granted to one victim of ill-treatment from 
law-enforcement authorities.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Under the 
new CPC, Art 92 deals with the 
compensation for damages.

appointment of judges is vague; members 
of the High Council of Justice appointed 
by the President and the Parliament can 
veto any candidate for being appointed as 
a judge. 
3. After the reform, new mechanism of 
transfer of judges from one court to 
another is actively used in practice; in 
other words, a judge from the first instance 
court in Tbilisi can be transferred without 
any justification and time-limit to any 
other district, city and/or appellate court in 
any other region of the country. This 
mechanism is frequently used as 
punishment and/or reward.  
4. Reportedly, there is no objective criteria 
set by the law for giving benefits to 
judges, which leads to the subjective 
decisions taken in this regard. 
5. Grounds for disciplinary responsibilities 
under the law are too broad, which might 
lead to subjecting judges to disciplinary 
sanctions for a minor misdoing; this is 
particularly striking because the procedure 
of disciplinary responsibility of the judges 
is secret and cannot be disclosed to 
anyone; after the reform no one is familiar 
with the details of its implementation in 
practice. </p>

removed from confinement in 
pre-trial detention facilities,

appear for trial, at any other 
stage of the judicial 
proceeding, and should 
occasion arise, for execution 
of the judgement) (i) and 
Recourse to pre-trial

be increased. 
</p>
<p> The Prosecutor General issued Internal 
Guidelines dated 26 January 2007 
promoting the application of non-
custodial measures in particular bail;   
CPC article 159 holds that detention as a 
measure of restraint as a rule is not used 
towards seriously ill persons, minors, 
persons over a certain age (women 60 and 
men 65), women who are 12 or more 
weeks pregnant or have a baby (of up to 
one year), and also towards persons who 
have committed a crime out of 
negligence. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The prison 
population is steadily increasing. There 
are too many people on probation per 
probation officer, which limits the 
supervisory function of the probation 
service to the formal registration 
procedure. 
 
<b>Government: </b>The number of persons in 
pre-trial detention amounts to 2.912. In 
the first nine months of 2009, the 
percentage of the cases in which pre-trial 
detention was applied was between 42 
and 52 %. The percentage of cases in 
which bail was granted varied between 28 
and 43 %. The percentage for custodial 
bail granted varied between 11 and 17 %. 
In 0,4  to 2,3 % of all cases, a personal 
guarantee was recognized as sufficient.  
- Regarding the reform of the probation 
service, a separate Strategy and an Action 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The Code on 
Imprisonment, apart from easing the legal 
status of inmates, has considerably refined 
the mechanism of early conditional 
release, making it much more flexible, 
efficient and transparent.  
New Code on Imprisonment established 
Early Conditional Release Councils 
(ECHR Councils) within the MCLA, ECR 
Councils review issues in relation to early 
conditional release, commutation of the 
remaining term of a sentence into a less 
grave punishment and substitution of the 
remaining term of a sentence into a 
Community Service. There are three ECR 
Councils; two for adults and one 
specializing on juveniles. Each Council 
consists of 5 members: representatives 
from the MCLA, the National Probation 
Agency, local non-governmental 
organization, the High Council of Justice 
and a local municipality.  
Due to creation of ECR Councils, the 
number of conditionally released convicts 
has increased by 4% in 2011 in 
comparison to 2010.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p>The Probation Agency has established the 
Probation Early Release System at the end 
of 2011. This council is modelled based on 
the ECR Councils within Penitentiary. It 
has recently held the first meeting and 
released 270 probationers.

<p>Plan were elaborated. Work continues on 
the assessment and further development 
of the legislation related to the probation 
system. In August 2009, the Probation 
Service introduced a dactyloscopy system 
improving tracking and registration 
process. This allows probation officers to 
focus on social work and individual 
rehabilitative schemes. Efforts are being 
undertaken to create employment 
opportunities in different firms for the 
probationers. In addition, probationers 
receive regular classes on foreign 
languages and in computer programmes.   
 
</p>
<p>CPC does not have any provision similar 
to the Art 159 of the old CPC.  
According to Art 205 of the current CPC, 
detention, as a preventive measure can be 
used exclusively in cases where it is the 
only means: a) to prevent risk of 
absconding and obstruction of justice by 
the defendant; b) to prevent obstruction  in 
obtaining evidence; c) to prevent further 
commission of a crime by the defendant . 
Similar approach is guaranteed under Art 
198 of the CPC. Although there are six 
forms of restrictive measures envisaged 
under Art 199 of the new CPC, reportedly, 
according to the statistical data of the 
Supreme Court of Georgia, the percentage 
of using restrictive measure other than bail 
and detention has been less than 2 % in 
2009, and less than 1 % in 2010, in 
comparison to 47.3 % bail and 51.1 % 
detention in 2009, and 45.1 % bail and 
54,2 % detention in 2010.

<p>Financial resources allocated have 
drastically increased and considerable 
refurbishment programs are underway,

The outsourcing of food provision has 
already produced tangible results and 
allows providing special diets for those

Many prison facilities underwent 
substantial reconstruction to bring them in 
line with international standards and the 
Action Plan for the Reform of the 
Penitentiary System for 2007-2010 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Penitentiary Reform 
Strategy as well as Concept on Addressing 
Prison Overcrowding stresses importance 
to increase use of pre and post-trial 
alternatives such as diversion among 
adults and juveniles, use of non-custodial 
measures and community service as a 
sanction.  
 
The new Code on Imprisonment of 
Georgia that entered into force on 1 
October 2010, represents a step forward 
for overall reform of the penitentiary </p>

The official capacity of the prisons as of 
26 January 2009 has been determined by 
Decree No. 24 of the Minister of Justice 
of Georgia (see appendix 2, table 1);  
The Medical Monitoring Unit of the 
General Inspection supervises the 
activities of the medical services of 
penitentiary establishments, as well as the 
conditions of detention and leads actions 
aimed at combating HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis and other illnesses;  
Employment and educational programs 
have been gradually introduced , libraries 
improved. 
 
<b>Government:</b> The Ministry of Correction 
and Legal Assistance (MCLA) adopted a 
Penitentiary Strategy and an Action Plan 
which focus on the implementation of the 
draft Code on Imprisonment and measures 
tackling prison overcrowding. In addition, 
measures are being taken regarding the 
food supply (outsourcing of food supply; 
establishment of shops in all penitentiary 
institutions that provide a possibility for 
prisoners to buy additional food and 
hygiene items). In addition, new medical 
departments administering and monitoring 
the healthcare system were set up at 
penitentiary establishments (primary 
healthcare units have been set up and 
equipped with modern equipment 
including dentist cabinets in all 16 
penitentiary establishments; 2 modern 
</p>
<p>system by setting prisons standards and 
rights of detainees. It addresses the issues 
pertinent to prison overcrowding, 
development of strong conditional release 
system (release on parole), wider 
application of the alternatives to pre-trial 
detention, promotion of the community 
work and development of the proper 
infrastructure. 
 
MCLA is carrying out infrastructural 
reforms in order to improve inmates&#8216; 
living conditions. In the framework of 
these reforms, three new penitentiary 
establishments were opened and some 
were renovated in 2010. In 2011, living 
conditions of 80% of inmates are 
commensurate with European standards.  
 
Mother and Child Unit was built in the 
territory of the penitentiary establishment 
for women in 2010 which created better 
living conditions for every child born in 
the penitentiary establishment while their 
mothers are serving their sentence.  
 
One of the main priorities of the MCLA is 
to broaden the access of inmates to 
medical care. Nowadays, each penitentiary 
establishment has its own medical unit, 
operating 24/7. The medical service 
involves a full-service dental facility 
comprising of dental therapy, surgery and 
orthopaedics, as well as consultations of 
psychiatrists and psychologists. In </p>

Furthermore, a healthcare strategy for the 
Penitentiary System is being developed. 
MCLA is working on new educational 
programmes for both juvenile and adult 
inmates. A general education curriculum 
was elaborated for juvenile inmates by the 
Ministry of Education and Science. In 
2009, three inmates successfully passed 
the National Unified Entry Exams and 
were enrolled in higher educational 
institutions. Vocational programmes such 
as language and computer classes 
continue to take place at penitentiary 
institutions.   
</p>
<p>addition, there is a special medical facility 
for convicted inmates, where almost all 
types of surgeries may be performed.  
All inmates have a full medical control 
while entering in the penitentiary 
establishment. The medical examination is 
also mandatory when inmate is transferred 
from one penitentiary establishment to 
another before allocation to the concrete 
cell.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In certain 
establishments prisoners reportedly 
complain about the food ration and quality 
of meal. 
Despite the reform undertaken in the 
healthcare system of penitentiary 
institutions, inadequate medical treatment 
of prisoners remains the most serious 
problem in almost all establishments. 
Prisoners reportedly complain about 
delayed medical treatment and delayed 
transfer to the medical institutions.

Imprisonment about routine medical 
check-ups, medical examination after 
being transferred from one establishment 
to another and/or when entering the prison

</p>
<p>(OPCAT). 
In summer 2006 monitoring councils for 
psychiatric hospitals and orphanages were 
set up under the Public Defender&#8216;s office; 
In December 2008, the Ministry of Justice 
presented a draft proposal regarding the 
designation of the Public Defender of 
Georgia as national preventive 
mechanism (NPM) in accordance with 
OPCAT.  
Article 93 of the Law on Imprisonment 
refers to Local Monitoring Commissions 
and the criteria for the appointment of the 
Members; Ministry of Justice Decree No. 
2190 sets out the corresponding rules; 
Local Monitoring Commissions may enter 
a penitentiary institution at any time 
without prior notification of the prison 
administration to conduct monitoring, 
receive complaints etc. 
On the basis of a 2004 Memorandum of 
Understanding between the Ministry of 
Interior and the Public Defender, 
representatives of NGOs authorized by 
the Ombudsman can enter temporary 
detention facilities without prior notice; 
although the possibility of sending reports 
to the Prosecutor&#8216;s office is provided, this 
</p>
<p>has not been done in more than three 
years. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> :  There are no 
independent monitoring systems in place. 
The Local Monitoring Commissions 
cannot be considered independent since 
</p>
<p>Preventive Mechanism and relevant 
amendments to the Organic Law on Public 
Defender have been made. The Public  
Defender established Preventive and 
Monitoring Unit within the Office which 
is mandated to carry the functions of the 
national preventive mechanism, i.e., visit 
and monitor all places of deprivation of 
liberty in Georgia.  
 
The prevention and Monitoring unit under 
the Public Defender conducts monitoring 
of temporary detention cells, penitentiary 
institutions, military detention cells, child 
care institutions, psychiatric institutions, 
homes for the elderly. The Prevention and 
Monitoring team has elaborated 
monitoring methodologies for all types of 
institutions separately which serve as a 
guideline for the monitoring.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Despite the 
commendable work of the Public 
Defender and the NPM, there is room for 
improvement of the system. The NPM is 
reportedly unable to monitor all places of 
detention comprehensively, given the 
reported number of some 24.000 detainees 
held within the prison system alone.  
The creation of the NPM has reportedly 
been used as an excuse to abandon public 
oversight in places of detention. Although 
it is generally admitted that there have 
been problems with the functioning of 
these committees, their complete abolition </p>

<b>Government:</b> The 1996 Organic Law of 
the Public Defender of Georgia was 
amended by Parliament  on 16 July 2009 
and now provides for the following: (1) 
The Office of the Public Defender (PDO)  
was officially designated as a National 
Preventive Mechanism (article 31 (1)), 
being expressly obliged to cooperate with 
all relevant international human rights 
bodies/institutions in line with the NPM 
mandate and creation of the National 
Preventive Group (article 31 (3 )); (2) 
Adequate resources to be provided  for 
carrying out its mandate (article 31 (2)); 
(3) Unimpeded access to all places of 
detention, access to relevant information 
and right to conduct private interviews 
(article 19 (1) and (2)); Confidentiality 
criteria: respect towards 
confidential/private data of detainees 
(article 19 (3)); (4) Expertise and 
professionalism of the members of the 
National Preventive Group; (article 191 
(2)); (5) Right to make recommendations, 
including the presentation of the NPM 
report before the Parliament of Georgia 
(article 21); and (6) Privileges for the 
members of the National Preventive 
Group: they have a right withhold giving 
</p>
<p>had a number of adverse effects to the 
prevention of torture and ill-treatment. The 
former relative transparency of the 
Georgian prison system has been 
abandoned and human rights defenders 
reportedly no longer have any first-hand 
information of the situation of detainees 
but only get this information through 
defence lawyers.  
According to the legal provisions 
establishing the NPM, the Public Defender 
can be assisted by a group of civil society 
experts, the so-called &#8213;Special Preventive 
Group&#8214;, in carrying out the NPM mandate. 
</p>
<p>The current Public Defender has 
established a roster of 22 civil society 
experts after issuing an open call for 
applications. However, the legal 
provisions relating to the inclusion of civil 
society experts in the NPM were 
reportedly criticized due to the lack of 
clarity. On the one hand, the terminology 
&#8213;can be assisted&#8214; leaves the door open to a 
</p>
<p>lot of discretion for the Public Defender 
and could, in principle, be interpreted in a 
manner that civil society experts are 
completely excluded from the NPM; on 
the other hand, the selection of civil 
society members was not considered to 
have been entirely transparent and 
objective. </p>

<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in the report of his visit to Greece from 10 to 20 
</b></p>
<p><b>October 2010 (A/HRC/16/52/Add.4) 
</b></p>
<p>32. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Greece requesting information and 
comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his predecessor&#8216;s recommendations. He expresses 
his gratitude to the Government for providing detailed information on the implementation of the recommendations issued in this 
report.  
</p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), on the visit to Greece carried out from 19 to 27 January 2011.  
</p>
<p>34. He recognises the challenges faced by the Government in copying with the influx of irregular migrants in recent years and 
welcomes the open acknowledgment by the authorities of the structural deficiencies in Greece&#8216;s detention policy of irregular 
migrants. The Special Rapporteur believes that while many of the problems are caused by a lack of financial resources, some 
important steps could be taken that are not resource-dependent, to redress the current situation. The Special Rapporteur calls upon 
the Government to ensure that the migrants and refugees are offered adequate screening and reception centres, in humane 
conditions, operated by civil authorities.  
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur received reports indicating that despite the repeated assurances of the Government and the ongoing 
reforms, the situation of migrants, including unaccompanied migrant children, remains unchanged and in some instances has further 
deteriorated in terms of severe overcrowding, unhygienic conditions and poor health-care provision. The Special Rapporteur calls 
upon the Government to take measures to improve the treatment and standards of care of irregular migrants and refugees held in 
detention facilities, including legislative provisions to ensure that those arrested while trying to enter or leave the country on false 
documents are not detained for a prolonged period; that all persons deprived of their liberty are registered from the very moment of 
their detention and ensure that law enforcement officials keep accurate registers and custody records, and that pre-trial detainees are 
separated from convicted prisoners, and juveniles are separated from adults in all detention facilities.  
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption of law 3907/2011 of 18 January 2011, establishing reception centers and an 
independent asylum service. He urges the Government to pass the draft directive that will process the backlog of first instance 
asylum cases and to ensure a speedy transition to the implementation of the pending draft law on refugees and asylum seekers. He 
takes note of the draft new Penal Code submitted to the Minister of Justice, Transparency and Human Rights and of the initiative to 
reform the criminal and criminal procedure law aimed at decriminalizing certain offences and reducing prison sentences and 
applying non-custodial measures.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur welcomes Law 3938/2011 establishing, within the Ministry of Citizen&#8216;s Protection, an Office 
responsible for collecting, recording and investigating complaints of acts of torture and ill-treatment. He urges the Government to 
establish independent mechanism for the investigation of allegations of torture and other forms of ill-treatment by police officers 
under a different authority than the Ministry of Citizen&#8216;s Protection and to ensure that the police detention is subject to rigid  time 
limits and judicial review by a court. </p>

Government to establish an independent and effective national preventive mechanism mandated to carry visits to all places of 
detention.  
</p>
<p>39. Finally, the Special Rapporteur expresses concern about reports of inhumane and degrading treatment, including routine 
sedation, the use of cage beds to their and other abuse of children and adults with disabilities residing at the Children&#8216;s Care Center 
of Lechaina in Ilias Prefecture in Greece. He calls upon the authorities to conclude the investigations into the reported death of three 
people at the center, launch public prosecutions without delay, where the evidence warrants it and make the names of perpetrators 
known to public. </p>

timeframe for the issuance of 
asylum decisions-the accelerated 
process takes three months and 
the normal process six months. 
The asylum procedure will be 
handed over to Refugee 
Committees comprised of 
qualified civil authorities. In the 
meantime, there was supposed to 
be a procedure in place to deal 
with the transitional period in 
between the old and new system, 
however, this transitional period 
has been stalled for over one 
year.

aliens, resorting to detention only as a last resort and if absolutely 
necessary and proportionate in the individual case. Vulnerable groups, 
including asylum seekers, unaccompanied minors, families, single 
women, persons with disabilities should in principle not be detained. 
Women should always be separated from men and children from 
adults. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur 
witnesses unaccompanied minors 
being held with adults in a 
number of facilities, such as 
Omonia CID, Feres Border 
Guard Station as well as Fylakio 
and Venna Migration Detention 
Centers.  
The procedure to identify 
minors, and assess their age and 
vulnerability appears to be 
completely inadequate as many 
juveniles reported being 
registered as adults. 
 
Male and female detainees were 
generally found to be separated 
in the places of detention visited. 
However, due to the recent 
influx of aliens over the Greek-
Turkish border and the 
overcrowding of the facilities 
located in the Evros region, the 
Special Rapporteur found 
women detained with men at the 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Despite 
Government&#8216;s repeated assurances and the 
</p>
<p>ongoing reform process, the situation for 
migrants, including for unaccompanied 
migrant children, remains woeful and in 
some instances has worsened. It is reported 
that migrants, including vulnerable groups, 
are held for weeks or months in detention 
conditions that amount to inhuman and 
degrading treatment, despite available 
alternative facilities that would offer 
adequate conditions.  
 
The Children&#8216;s Care Center, situated in 
Lechaina (Ilias Prefecture), hosts persons 
with disabilities, including adults, is in dire 
conditions. There is insufficient number of 
doctors and nurses; systematic sedation; and 
practices such as tying children and adults 
with development disabilities to their beds 
to reduce self-harm and the use of wooden 
cage beds. The care center does not have the 
required qualified personnel. The residents 
do not appear to be given regular medical 
nor rehabilitation services.  </p>

</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Reportedly, at 
the end of 2010, up to 1,000 documented 
migrants, who had recently crossed from 
Turkey into Greece, were held in extremely 
overcrowded detention conditions that 
failed to provide minimum hygienic 
standards for detainees. The number of 
migrants detained exceeds the capacity 
limits of some facilities, including in Venna 
and Fylakio detention centres and Tychero 
police station detention cells, Feres police 
station detention cells, and Soufli police 
station detention cells.   
 
Reportedly, guards at detention centers beat

<p>Since taking office in October 
2009, the Government has made 
the issue of detention of irregular 
migrants and refugees a priority

immediately at risk, the Government does 
not consider alternatives to detention, nor

and the relevant information is kept in their 
personal file. For any psychiatric incident 
that the facility&#8216;s doctor considers that it

<p>particularly appalling at 
Venizelos Airport Police Station 
in Athens. At the CIDs of 
Omonia, Agiou Panteleimonos 
and Akropolis in Athens, the 
conditions of detention were 
particularly appalling.  
The border guard stations in 
Soufli and Feres were facing 
immense problems due to the 
mass influx of aliens over the 
Greek-Turkish border. The 
situation at the Feres Border 
Guard Station was particularly 
severe, holding 123 detainees in 
a facility designed for 28.  
 
Some prisons (Korydallos, 
Komotini) were hosting three 
times more prisoners than their 
maximum capacity.  
 
In the two migration detention 
centres in the Evros region, 
Fylakio and Venna, the 
conditions were inadequate to 
meeting the most basic needs of 
detainees.  
 
A positive example was the 
Mersidini Migration Detention 
Centre in Chios, where adequate 
care was provided to detainees. 
The detainees were able to 
access the outside, their cells 
were clean and well-equipped, 
and the most basic needs were 
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Justice, Transparency and 
Human Rights has elaborated a programme 
for the construction of new detention 
facilities in order to increase prison capacity 
and thereby improve detention conditions. 
 
The detention facility of Central Macedonia 
III (at Nigrita, Serres region) has already 
been delivered and one ward operates; it 
now accommodates 118 prisoners, to be 
increased to 600 in full operation.  
 
A 50-person ward has also been delivered at 
the detention facility of Larissa. Moreover, 
the delivery and operation of the detention 
facilities of Drama and Chania (with a 
capacity of 600 persons each), which have 
been almost completed, will reduce even 
more the problem of overcrowding. Finally, 
a Prisoner Detoxification Centre is being 
constructed at Kassandra, Halkidiki  
 
The full operation of the new detention 
facilities depends on the ability to hire new 
staff, which is however, currently restricted 
by the legislative fiscal constraints.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Reportedly, 
detainees lack adequate medical care and 
access to outdoor areas. Reportedly, in one 
of the detention cells of the Tychero police 
station, migrants had to sleep on cardboard 
and the concrete floor and remained without 
access to toilets. Generally, migrants are 
detained without any consideration of their 
vulnerability. Unaccompanied children,

<p>The Special Secretary of the Ministry, by

create and regularly update a relevant

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Asylum 
seekers, among them numerous 
unaccompanied children, who have spent as 
much as 50 days in squalid conditions, were 
reportedly discouraged by Greek detention 
guards from lodging claims.  
 
Although the Greek Government has 
pledged to hold perpetrators of violence 
accountable, in practice there has been little 
evidence of meaningful steps towards this 
goal. There is a continued climate of 
impunity and widespread reluctance by 
victims to file complaints due to an absence 
of a safe complaints mechanisms, 
insufficient numbers of interpreters, and a 
lack of trust in authorities.

an office responsible for addressing

<p><b>Juveniles</b>  <b> </b> jj. Detention for unaccompanied minors should be a last resort 
measure. In order to ensure adequate protection to juveniles, the 
Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Interior should cooperate 
closely to ensure that they are placed in separate reception centres. 
</p>
<p>Unaccompanied minors are 
systematically held in detention, 
instead of being held at reception 
centers under the authority of the 
Ministry of Health designed 
exclusively for them. Minors 
have no possibility to enroll in 
schools and to receive a proper 
education.  
Most of the unaccompanied 
minors had not been adequately 
informed about the asylum 
procedure and their rights, and 
were generally ignorant about 
the system.

<p>The level of medical and

and they receive no financial

many are forced to live on the 
streets and have to resort to 
illegal activities to survive.

under the Greece-Turkey readmission 
agreement, some unaccompanied children 
out of 120 children held in Fylakio

they can only be released once they are 
assigned a place in a care centre.

<p><b>Women</b>  <b> </b> ll. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the CAT recommendation to 
amend article 137A of the Penal Code on torture so as to explicitly 
include rape and others forms of sexual violence as a form of torture 
rather than the phrase &#8213;a serious breach of sexual dignity&#8214; as found in 
</p>
<p>the existing legislation.<b>

<p>The women held at Venizelos 
Airport Police Station were held 
in much better conditions than 
the men. However, they 
complained about the lack of

Many women detained in 
migration detention centers were 
even more affected by the 
appalling conditions of detention 
and the lack of hygiene as they 
had to take care for small 
children.  
 
One of the most serious 
complaints received was the 
ongoing practice of interbody

reported that the practice of

<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to Indonesia 
</b></p>
<p><b>from 10 to 23 November 2007 (A/HRC/7/3/Add.7) 
</b></p>
<p>40. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Indonesia requesting information 
and comments on follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his predecessor&#8216;s recommendations. He expresses 
his gratitude to the Government for providing relevant information on the implementation of the recommendations issued in this 
report.  
</p>
<p>41. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the Government&#8216;s efforts to ensure that all allegations of torture and ill-
treatment committed by personnel of the Indonesian National Armed Forces and Indonesian National Police are investigated, and 
regrets not having received data on the number of complaints of torture and ill-treatment received, including the results of any 
investigation undertaken in this respect, prosecutions initiated and number of convictions. He commends the Government for 
undertaking steps to establish various complaints mechanisms, including the Sub-Section of Complaint Services and the Internal 
Supervision Unit of the Penitentiary and looks forward to receiving statistics with respect to investigations of allegations of torture 
and efforts to address the quasi-total impunity for security personnel, the police and military, for current as well as past violations.  
</p>
<p>42. The Special Rapporteur takes note of Law No. 39/1999 and the Regulation of the Commander of the Indonesian National 
Armed Forces on Acts against Torture and Other Inhuman Treatment in Enforcing the Law in the Indonesian National Armed 
Forces, and regrets that the draft bills to introduce legal provisions containing a definition and prohibition of torture in line with the 
Convention have not been adopted. He expresses concern that torture is equated to &#8213;maltreatment&#8214; in the Criminal Code thus 
lacking several elements of the definition of torture in article 1 of the Convention against Torture, such as the elements of purpose, 
mental pain or suffering, and agency. The Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to define torture as a matter of priority in 
accordance with articles 1 and 4 of the Convention against Torture, with penalties commensurate with the gravity of torture.  
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the clarification received regarding the provision of the Criminal Procedure Code 
allowing detainees the right to challenge the validity of detention, and expresses hope that this procedure is effectively used in 
practice. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern that there have been no new developments regarding reducing the time limit 
for police custody from 61 days to maximum of 48 hours. 
</p>
<p>44. The Special Rapporteur notes that the Indonesian Constitutional Court has increased the minimum age of criminal 
responsibility at 12 years old. He encourages the Government to expedite the revision of the Law on Juvenile Justice System and 
the adoption of a restorative justice system for children in conflict with the law.  
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for the efforts made to improve detention conditions, in particular with a 
view to providing health care, improving the quantity and quality of food, ensuring the separation of minors from adults and of pre-
trial prisoners from convicts.  
</p>
<p>46. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the appeal to the Government to make a declaration under article 22 of the 
CAT providing the UN Committee against Torture with the competence to receive and consider individual complaints. He 
commends the Government for commencing the ratification process of the OPCAT providing for a National Preventive Mechanism.

there was no legal provision containing a 
definition and prohibition of torture in 
line with the United Nations Convention 
against Torture (UNCAT). The draft bill 
to rectify these shortcomings is still 
pending. Similarly, no amendments have 
been made with regard to introducing 
penalties which would be commensurate 
to the gravity of the crime. Komnas 
HAM (the National Human Rights 
Commission) can take up individual 
complaints; however, it is only mandated 
to formulate recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The revision of the Penal 
Code is underway. The Ministry of Law 
and Human Rights, the Supreme Court, 
the Office of the Attorney General and 
the Indonesian Parliament are involved in 
drafting the bill to this effect which will 
include the definition of torture in 
accordance with the Convention against 
Torture. The review of the current system 
is a lengthy process and the bill will be 
adopted only when it is passed as a 
whole.

<p>Torture, as stipulated in Article 1, section 
4 of Law no. 39/1999 on Human Rights, 
is defined as  &#8213;every act conducted 
intentionally, which causes severe pain or 
suffering, whether physical or mental, in 
order to obtain confession or information 
from somebody or a third person, 
punishing him for an act he or a third

Armed Forces No. 73/IX/2012<b> </b>from 20 
September 2010 on Acts against Torture 
and Other Inhuman Treatment in 
Enforcing the Law in the Indonesian 
National Armed Forces defines torture 
(Article 1) and provides legal sanction on 
any violations to such acts (Article 12), 
as stipulated in the Indonesian Penal 
Code (Articles 351-355). Torture is 
equated with maltreatment which shall be 
punished with imprisonment ranging 
from 2 to 9 years. Such maltreatment is 
processed through the Public Court with 
the investigation by the Police, the 
prosecution by the Attorney and the trial 
by the District Court.  </p>

Among other sanctions, the Code 
imposes the punishment of stoning to

married; 100 cane lashes for adultery 
committed by those individuals who are 
unmarried; caning for individuals 
engaging in sexual activities out of

Representative (DPRA) in September 
2009, the provincial government of Aceh 
submitted an official letter rejecting this 
Qanun in its present form and requested a 
revision of the provisions relating to 
stoning in the above-mentioned law. The 
Governor of Aceh has not yet signed 
Qanun Jinayah.  His approval is 
mandatory before a provincial law can be 
formally enacted (article 23 (1), Law no. 
11/2006).

mostly institutionally linked to

therefore not independent. 
</p>
<p>of internal and external mechanisms exist 
in Indonesia to monitor police work, but 
none of these institutions had the 
mandate, independence and authority to 
hold police officers accountable for 
human rights violations. An independent 
public complaints board that would 
guarantee that police officials who 
violate human rights would be brought to 
justice and victims receive reparations 
was still lacking. Komnas Ham can 
investigate allegations of torture as an 
independent institution and has the 
authority to conduct monitoring or 
inquiries into allegations of torture, but it 
can only make recommendations.

<p>78. As a matter of urgent 
priority, the period of police 
custody should be reduced to a 
time limit in line with 
international standards 
(maximum of 48 hours); after 
this period the detainees 
should be transferred to a pre-
trial facility under a different 
authority, where no further 
unsupervised contact with the 
interrogators or investigators 
should be permitted. 
</p>
<p>While the Criminal Procedure 
Code authorized a maximum 
length of 61 days only in very 
specific circumstances, the 
imposition of such a long period 
was applied as a standard 
procedure; 
</p>
<p>Detainees remained under 
exclusive police authority for a 
period exceeding many times the 
maximum period permitted under 
international law, making abuses 
more likely, and furthermore 
rendering the detection of torture 
significantly more difficult since 
visible traces were likely to have 
disappeared once the detainee had 
been released or transferred. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Currently, there are no 
new developments regarding the length 
of police custody. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Detention is regulated by 
Law No. 8/1981 on Criminal Proceeding 
Code, particularly Articles 24-29. A 
warrant of detention or warrant of further 
detention shall be served on a suspect/an 
accused who is strongly presumed to 
have committed an offense based on 
sufficient evidence. The detention shall 
meet the following requirements: it shall 
be preceded by a warrant of detention; a 
copy of such warrant must be provided to 
the suspect/the accused person&#8216;s family; 
such warrant shall only be valid for at the 
most 20 days.

of detention of a suspect/an accused may 
be extended on the basis of proper and

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Although 
there are a number of internal and 
external mechanisms monitoring police 
work in 2009, none of these institutions 
has the mandate, independence and 
authority to hold police officers 
accountable for human rights violations. 
There is no independent public 
complaints board that would guarantee 
that police officials who violate human 
rights are brought to justice and victims 
receive reparations. Torture survivors, 
however,  have the possibility to address 
their complaints to Komnas HAM and its

<p>The National Commission on

monitors the situation of violence 
against women in the country, but 
undertakes visits to places of 
detention only on an ad hoc basis. 
</p>
<p>With the aim of strengthening the 
implementation of its tasks, Komnas 
HAM has been developing amendments 
to the Laws on Human Rights (39/1999) 
and Human Rights Courts (No. 26/2000).  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Indonesian National 
Police is currently studying the proposal 
of Komnas HAM (National Committee 
for Human Rights) regarding 
unannounced visits and private 
interviews, in accordance with a review 
of the Memorandum of Understanding 
between the National Committee for 
Human Rights and the Indonesian 
National Police. 
</p>
<p>The Security Unit and the Field 
Intelligence Unit of the Indonesian 
National Armed Forces also conducts a 
strict supervision, particularly in the 
conflict areas. 
</p>
<p>Excessive violence    
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur 
recalls that excessive violence 
during military and police 
actions can amount to cruel, 
inhuman or degrading 
treatment. The Government of 
Indonesia should take all steps 
necessary to stop the use of 
excessive violence during 
police and military operations, 
above all in conflict areas such 
as Papua and Central 
Sulawesi. 
</p>
<p>There were consistent allegations 
about the use of excessive force 
by security forces, who routinely 
engaged in largely indiscriminate 
village &#8213;sweeping&#8214; operations in 
search of alleged independence 
activists and their supporters, or 
raids on university boarding 
houses, using excessive force. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In 2009 the 
army, police and particularly mobile 
paramilitary units (Brimob) conducted 
largely indiscriminate village &#8213;sweeping&#8214; 
operations in the Central Highlands of 
Papua, often using excessive, sometimes 
lethal force against civilians. Soldiers 
routinely arrested Papuans without legal 
authority, transferred them to military 
barracks and ill-treated them. Prison 
guards continued to torture inmates 
inside Abepura prison.<b>  
</b></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The security issues in 
Papua have been addressed based on the 
prevailing laws and regulations in 
Indonesia. In addition to the various laws 
prohibiting the use of torture and ill-
treatment in prisons, the government has 
also adopted a policy to address the 
demands of prisoners to be supervised by 
local prison officers from the Papua 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Military personnel 
assigned in Papua carry out their duty in 
accordance with the main duty of the 
Indonesian National Armed Forces. Any 
military personnel who commit an act 
inconsistent with the law will be duly 
processed before the law.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Concerning the case of Abepura, the 
Indonesian National Police explained 
that the protestors used violence against 
the police officers resulting in the death 
of four officers. The protesters also got 
hurt in the event. The investigation by 
the National Committee for Human 
Rights (<i>Komnas HAM</i>) found no 
evidence of violation of human rights by 
the personnel of the Indonesian National 
Police.

<p>the Indonesian National Police 
successfully caught the offenders and 
seized the weapons for committing the 
violence. They have been duly processed 
before the law and most of them have 
been sentenced to 5 to 15 years of 
imprisonment. At present, the situation in 
Poso is more conducive and is back to 
normalcy.  
</p>
<p>In carrying out their duty, police officers 
refrain from committing discriminatory 
acts based on particular religion or ethnic 
group. 
</p>
<p>Conditions of detention    
</p>
<p>87. The Government of 
Indonesia should continue 
efforts to improve detention 
conditions, in particular with a 
view to providing health care, 
treat rather than punish 
persons with mental 
disabilities, and improve the 
quantity and quality of food. 
The Government, in all 
detention contexts, should 
ensure the separation of 
minors from adults and of pre-
trial prisoners from convicts 
and train and deploy female 
personnel to women&#8216;s sections 
of prisons and custody 
facilities. 
</p>
<p>Conditions of detention varied 
considerably throughout the 
country, facilities in urban areas 
were overcrowded,  while prisons 
outside of Java offered enough 
space; 
</p>
<p>Overcrowded facilities, e.g. 
Chipinang prison, were 
confronted with sanitary and 
health difficulties, corruption, and 
inter-prisoner violence; 
</p>
<p>Numerous complaints about the 
quality of food were voiced;  
</p>
<p>Punishment cells as well as new 
arrival areas were not in line with 
international standards;  
</p>
<p>Persons with mental disabilities 
were often held in punishment 
cells; 
</p>

were not separated in many 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: The Ministry of Justice 
and Human Rights made several 
improvements in detention centres and 
prison facilities: 
</p>
<p>- the detention centre and prison facilities 
in Cipinang Prison have been expanded 
into prisons, temporary detention centres 
and prisons for detainees charged with 
narcotic substances, 
</p>
<p>- From 2007 to 2009, Cipinang Prison 
has conducted reintegration programs for 
detainees on conditional release, or cuti 
bersyarat (temporary conditional release). 
Between 2007 and September 2009, 
16.400 prisoners were released.   
</p>
<p>- A MoU was signed with the Ministry of 
Health on the improvement of sanitation 
and the development of internal 
infirmary units equipped with standard 
treatment facilities in all prisons, which 
are expected to be implemented in 2010.

<p>The Ministry of Justice and Human 
Rights has made several improvements to 
the detention centre and prison facilities, 
such as: 
</p>
<p>a. improving the menu by changing 
the 7-day-variation to 10-day-
variation of the menu and 
providing the calories needed; 
</p>
<p>b. improving the health service for 
detainees by increasing the 
budget. The latter, however, is 
not sufficient to meet the ideal 
standard health treatment. In 
addition, the Indonesian 
National Police has intensified 
the Center for Coordinated 
Service in the Police Hospitals 
as well as Public Hospitals in 
the areas prone to trafficking in 
persons.

<p>90. The age of criminal 
responsibility should be raised 
as a matter of priority. 
Through further reform of the 
juvenile justice system, 
Indonesia should take 
immediate measures to ensure 
that deprivation of liberty of 
minors is used only as a last 
resort and for the shortest 
possible period of time and in 
appropriate conditions. 
Children in detention should 
be strictly separated from 
adults. 
</p>
<p>Criminal responsibility started in 
Indonesia at the age of 8;  
</p>
<p>Small children were put in 
detention facilities and prisons, 
very often mixed with much older 
children and adults.  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Article 16, paragraph 3 of 
Law No.23/2002 on the Protection of 
Children states that &#8213;any arrest, detention 
or imprisonment of children shall be 
applied pursuant to the prevailing laws 
and regulations and will only be 
considered as the last resort.&#8214; Articles 26, 
27 and 28 of Law No.3/1997 on Trial 
Proceedings for Children stipulate that 
imprisonment, detention and fines 
applied to children can only be half of the 
penalties applied to adults.

<p>The Supreme Court, the Ministry of 
Justice and Human Rights, the National 
Police, the Attorney-General, and the 
Ministry for the Empowerment of 
Women and the Protection of Children 
are carrying out the following measures 
in close cooperation with other 
stakeholders: 
</p>
<p>- Expedite the revision of Law No. 3 of 
1997 regarding Juvenile Justice System 
to focus on raising the minimum age of 
criminal responsibility from 8 years old 
to 12 years old, and adopt a restorative 
justice system for children in conflict 
with the law; 
</p>
<p>- Continue dissemination of the 
Convention and the Laws on Juvenile 
Justice and on Child Protection, 
especially to law enforcement personnel 
involved in  juvenile criminal justice 
system;

<p>- Intensify trainings on juvenile criminal

a judicial review from the Indonesian 
Commission for Child Protection, the 
Indonesian Constitutional Court has 
decided that the minimum age of a 
person who can be held legally 
accountable before the law is 12 years 
old.  
</p>
<p>a. In March 2012, the Government 
has proposed a revision to Law 
No. 3/1997 on Trial Proceedings 
for Children, which is currently 
under the discussion in the 
Parliament. The revision 
includes: 
</p>
<p>b. Raising the minimum age of a 
person who can be held legally 
accountable before the law, 
from 8 years old to 12 years old; 
</p>
<p>c. Detention and imprisonment are 
considered as the last resort;  
</p>
<p>d. Changing the term 
&#8213;imprisonment&#8214; to &#8213;special 
treatment&#8214;;

<p>e. The arrangement of a child-
friendly justice system;

<p>f. The approach of restorative 
justice for children in conflict 
with the law.

effective mechanisms to 
enforce the prohibition of 
violence against women, 
including in the family and 
wider community, above all 
through further awareness-

Empowerment and Child Protection 
Bureau at the regency/municipality,

<p>Minister of Social Affairs, and the 
National Police, several institutions for 
the defense and protection of victims of 
domestic violence have been established, 
including the Women and Children 
Service Units in 305 Provincial and 
District Police Offices; 22 Crisis 
Centres/Women&#8216;s Trauma Centres; 20 
Integrated Crisis Centres in General 
Hospitals; and 42 Integrated Service 
Centres in Police Hospitals.  
</p>
<p>Registration and reports on the action 
taken in handling acts of violence, 
exploitation and discrimination against 
women have been carried out through 
national surveys as well as through the 
reporting system in the Service Units 
since 2007. It is further strengthened by 
the establishment of reporting and 
registry facilitation teams in 15 provinces 
and 242 regencies/districts. In addition, 
coordinating forums between General 
Hospitals, Provincial, and District Police 
Offices, as well as social reintegration 
and rehabilitation service units have been 
established in almost half of the country.  
</p>
<p>The National Action Plan on the 
Elimination of Violence against Women 
has emphasized the need for prevention, 
empowerment and rehabilitation efforts 
for the victims of domestic violence. The 
enactment of Law No 21/2007 on the

<p>92. The Special Rapporteur 
requests the international 
community to support the 
efforts of Indonesia in 
reforming its criminal law 
system. In particular, all 
measures to establish well-
resourced and independent 
national preventive 
mechanisms in compliance 
with international standards 
that cover the entire territory 
of Indonesia should be treated 
as a priority and supported 
with generous financial 
assistance.

</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in the report of his visit to Jamaica 
</b></p>
<p><b>from 12 to 21 February 2010 (A/HRC/16/52/Add.3) 2010 (A/HRC/16/52/Add.3) 
</b></p>
<p>47. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Jamaica, requesting 
information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The 
Government of Jamaica responded by providing information on the measures taken with regard to the implementation of the 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the fact that torture is prohibited under the Charter of Fundamental Rights and 
Freedoms; however he remains concerned that there remains no definition of torture as a separate offence in the criminal law.  28  The 
Special Rapporteur welcomes the steps taken to review the Convention against Torture with a view to considering its ratification.  
</p>
<p>49. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the reported cases of torture and ill-treatment by law enforcement bodies, 
including the reported <i>de facto</i> extrajudicial killings by police, and the lack of prompt and thorough investigations launched into 
allegations of ill-treatment or excessive use of police force and number of convictions held. He calls upon the authorities to ensure 
prompt and through ex officio investigations for all allegations of ill-treatment or excessive use of police force by clarifying the 
mandates of the Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions with 
respect to the conduct of investigations and prosecutions.29  
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur notes that although the Office of the Public Defender is mandated to visit police lock-ups, it has 
reportedly been facing ongoing difficulties for undertaking preventive visits to places of detention due to recently withdrawn 
requirement of 48-hour advance notice prior to undertaking the visit and an incident of death threat to ones if its members. He calls 
upon the Government to establish an effective independent national human rights institution, and provide it with adequate financial 
and human resources.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that according to the information received, the detention periods in pre-charge 
detention have reportedly ranged from three to 25 days, in violation of domestic law. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government 
to reduce, as a matter of priority, the period of police custody to a maximum of 48 hours; ensure that access to lawyers of the 
suspect&#8216;s own choosing is granted from the very moment of apprehension and that no further unsupervised contact with the 
interrogators or investigators should be permitted.  
</p>
<p>52. The Special Rapporteur observes that although complaints and allegations of abuse are reportedly sent to the Inspectorate 
Unit of the Ministry of National Security for investigation, the fact remains that this mechanism is marred by allegations of a lack of 
independence and ineffectiveness and that the complaints are essentially addressed to the same body alleged to have perpetrated the

<p>ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving statistics and information on complaints received by these 
mechanisms, including the number of individuals prosecuted and convicted, and the reparations awarded to the victims. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur takes note with appreciation of various bills introduced in 2010 to address the root causes of violent 
crime and encourages the Government to focus on preventative measures. 
</p>
<p>54. While the Special Rapporteur notes the efforts to improve the situation in the police lockups at May Pen and Montego Bay 
police stations, he regrets that they continue to hold remandees. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern that although the 
conditions at remand and correctional facilities are generally better than in police stations; many prisons remain overcrowded, 
lacking sanitary facilities. He calls upon the Government to ensure that detention conditions comply with international minimum 
sanitary and hygienic standards and that detainees are provided with basic necessities, such as bedding, food and health care.  
</p>
<p>55. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government decided not to consider the abolition of the death penalty. He agrees 
with his predecessor&#8216;s recommendation on abolishing capital punishment because, under the conditions of its imposition and 
</p>
<p>execution in Jamaica, the practice constitutes cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or, in some cases, torture. 
</p>
<p>56. Finally, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to reconsider its decision not to re-accede to the First Optional 
Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, providing the Committee with the competence to examine 
individual complaints, with a view to ensuring that the rights of individuals to an effective remedy are strengthened.30

(a)  Issue a public condemnation of 
torture and ill-treatment, including 
excessive use of police force; 
</p>
<p> <b>Government: </b>The Government does not condone or subscribe 
to the torture, ill-treatment or abuse of its citizens. Statements 
and public declarations to this effect have been made at various

with respect to article 22 of the 
Convention; 
</p>
<p>  <b>Government: </b>Jamaica is reviewing the Convention against 
Torture with a view to taking a decision on ratification. The 
Jamaican Constitution, however, expressly prohibits torture, 
inhuman or degrading punishment or other such treatment. 
There is, therefore, specific constitutional redress against 
torture. In addition, there are provisions in the Offences against 
the Person Act, which criminalize offences such as assault 
occasioning bodily harm, wounding with intent and unlawful 
wounding, which comprise elements of the act of torture as 
defined by the Convention.  
 
There is opportunity for visits to be undertaken to places of 
detention. It is critical, however, that advance notice is given 
since the police have an obligation to ensure safety and 
security of visitors, members of the force, prisoners and 
members of the public as well as an obligation to safeguard 
judicial processes such identification parades. Representatives 
of the Office of the Public Defender, for example, can visit 
police lock-ups and there is a procedure in place, in keeping 
with the aforementioned obligations 
</p>
<p> 
Access cannot be facilitated if the procedure is not upheld, as 
has occurred in the past.

that it is reviewing the CAT to decide whether or not to ratify

<p> 
It is reported that there are on-going difficulties for 
undertaking preventative visits to places of detention. When in 
September 2010, the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) 
attempted to visit the Hunts Bay Police Station in Kingston, 
OPD personnel were barred from accessing the cells. Initial 
calls to the Commissioner of Police resulted in the granting of 
access on the condition that the OPD give 48 hours notice to 
the station.32  However, the stipulation was later withdrawn 
due to public outcry and OPD objections.33  It is alleged that 
within a week of the incident at Hunts Bay, another member of 
the OPD received a death threat that stipulated the inspector 
would be killed if they came to inspect the Spanish Town 
police lock-up.34

<p> <b>Government: </b>While Jamaica is not party to the First Optional

international human rights body through the Inter American 
Commission on Human Rights (IACHR). The rights 
considered in a petition to the IACHR under the <i>American 
Convention on Human Rights </i>are analogous to the rights 
considered by the Human Rights Committee under the ICCPR. 
The rights listed in the ICCPR are also assured under the

those rights can be upheld in Jamaican courts by way of 
Constitutional redress. <b>

<p>civil society, protect all victims of torture in the Jamaican 
context, and does not provide a remedy to individuals who are 
subject to abuse by state agents which relates not only to acts 
that cause physical pain but also acts that cause mental 
suffering to the victim. 
</p>
<p>(f) Ensure prompt and thorough ex 
officio investigations for all 
allegations of ill-treatment or 
excessive use of police force by an 
authority that is independent from 
the investigation and prosecution. 
Any officer known to be abusive 
should be removed from custody 
duties. Heads of police stations and 
detention facilities should be made 
aware of their supervisory 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>Many investigations are not prompt or 
effective, and prosecutions in cases 
involving the security forces are rare.  
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The Government is committed to the prompt 
and thorough investigation of all allegations of ill-treatment or 
excessive use of force by the police force. The procedure 
governing the removal of officers from frontline duty is 
contained in the <i>Police Services Regulations and the 
Constabulary Force Act.  
</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Officers who are alleged to have committed acts with criminal 
implications are suspended from the service (i.e. active duty).  
 
If it is unclear whether the matter will result in disciplinary 
action, the officer is assigned to desk duty so that he/she does 
not interfere with the investigations. This measure remains in 
effect until the circumstances determine whether disciplinary 
measures need to be taken.  
The Independent Commission of Investigations (INDECOM) 
continues to carry out its investigations of alleged excesses and 
abuse by agents of the state. It is incorrect to suggest an 
&#8213;ongoing power struggle&#8214; between the Office of the Director 
of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) and INDECOM as the matter 
of concern related to the legislative provisions accorded to 
INDECOM and how this may conflict with the Constitutional 
Provisions related to the powers of the DPP. This matter is the 
subject of recommendations in INDECOM&#8216;s Special Report to 
Parliament made in November 2011, which are to be 
considered by the Parliament.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The Independent Commission of 
Investigations (INDECOM) has initiated investigations on 
cases of excessive use of force.  However, as mentioned in (j), 
there is an on-going power struggle between the Director of 
Public Prosecutions (DPP) and INDECOM as to which agency 
has the authority to charge police officers.  This is reportedly 
exacerbated by challenges to investigating and prosecuting </p>

<p>police officers. It is reported that the practices of witness 
intimidation, coercion, and extensive judicial delays are 
widespread.  Reportedly, the Government continues to ignore 
requests to impose sanctions on official&#8216;s accused of ill-
treatment, and instead leaves them on full-duty whilst 
investigations are carried out.  In some cases, officers are even 
promoted. Investigations are reportedly relying on the evidence 
of civilian eye-witnesses as opposed to forensic/scientific

fearful to attend court, there is rarely enough substantial 
evidence available to convict the officers.

<p><b>Safeguards and prevention  </b>  
(g) Reduce, as a matter of urgent 
priority, the period of police custody 
to a time limit in line with 
international standards (maximum 48 
hours); 
</p>
<p>Appalling conditions in police custody might 
be bearable for a maximum of 48 hours, but 
the fact that detainees remain there for 
several months or even years amounts to 
inhuman treatment.  
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Under the <i>Constabulary Force (Interim 
Provisions for Arrest and Detention) Act, </i>a person may be 
remanded in custody for a period not exceeding seventy-two 
hours. This may only be done, however, if a Justice of the 
Peace is satisfied that the arrest or detention of the person is 
reasonably required in the interest of justice, having regard to 
such further investigations as may be required. At the 
expiration of that period of remand, the law requires that the 
person be taken before a Resident Magistrate. Where a Justice 
of the Peace is not satisfied that the arrest or detention of the 
person is reasonably required in the interests of justice, he 
must order that the detention of the person be released 
forthwith. The requirement that a Justice of the Peace make a 
determination in each case provides a safeguard for the 
protection of the rights of the detainee. The Ministry of Justice 
is actively sensitizing new and current Justices of the Peace 
about their responsibility and duty under this Act. The Legal 
Aid Council has also intensified its drive toward seeking Writs 
of Habeas Corpus in situations where persons are detained for 
extended periods without being charged.  
</p>
<p><b>Non-governmental sources:</b> It is reported that the 
Government has reportedly opted to extend pre-charge 
detention to 72 hours through the <i>Constabulary Force (Interim 
Provisions for Arrest and Detention) Act </i>(introduced 
immediately after the State of Emergency in 2010). The Act 
aims to improve the police force&#8216;s ability to &#8213;catch perpetrators </p>

the pre-charge detention period from 24 hours to 72 hours for 
one year (July 2010 &#8211; June 2011). As of July 2011, this 
temporary Act has been extended for an additional year.  Even 
with the time limits imposed by this legislation, according to 
the Jamaica Constabulary Force&#8216;s own data, the length of time 
for people being held in pre-charge detention can range from 
three (3) to twenty five (25) days, in violation of domestic law 
and international law.36  Thus, the detention periods have 
reportedly been extended without regard to the fact that 
individuals are disproportionately held in breach of the law for 
periods longer than that prescribed by Jamaican law.  In 
addition, it is alleged that there is no central register of 
detainees available to human rights defenders or legal 
representatives.  
</p>
<p>(h) Establish accessible and effective 
complaints mechanisms in all places 
of detention. Complaints by 
detainees should be followed up by 
independent and thorough 
investigations, and complainants 
must be protected from reprisals; 
</p>
<p>  <b>Government: </b>Allegations of abuse are investigated by an 
internal Inspectorate. Serious cases or those which would 
question the actions of the staff are sent to the Inspectorate 
Unit of the Ministry of National Security for investigation. The 
Department of Correctional Services is now duty bound to 
report all cases of serious injury/death of inmates involving 
staff members to the INDECOM for investigation.  
 
In the case of lock-ups, allegations of abuse are recorded and 
reported to the Senior Commanding Officer, and are 
investigated by the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF).

Government occasionally allows human rights NGOs to visit 
prisons and prisoners are able to make complaints to the Office 
of the Public Defender without censorship.38  However, there is 
reportedly no system designed to safeguards inmates suffering 
from mental illness and their ability to make independent 
complaints. 
</p>
<p>(i) Ensure that justices of the peace 
and resident magistrates conduct 
regular visits to all police lock-ups;   
</p>
<p>Police lock-ups in Jamaica are used as de 
facto remand centres, where persons 
awaiting trial can be held for several months 
or years, despite current practices worldwide 
of holding detainees at police lock-ups for 
up to 48 or maximum 72 hours.  
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>As part of the Government&#8216;s move to place 
emphasis on restorative justice and conflict prevention, the 
Minister of Justice has urged Justices of the Peace to be the 
checks and balances of State abuse and judicial excess. To this 
end, Justices of the Peace are sensitized by the Ministry of 
Justice about their duties regarding persons in Police Lock-ups. 
Resident Magistrates have also been sensitized and have 
renewed their commitment to making more frequent visits to 
Police Lack-ups.  
 
The JCF maintains a central database of all juveniles in police 
custody at the national level. In respect of adult inmates, a 
central register is kept in each police Division and these are 
available for inspection.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Reportedly, justices of the peace 
are frequently used for and known to &#8215;rubber stamp&#8216; the 
</p>
<p>continued detention of individuals based upon the police 
version of events without adequately reviewing the legality of 
the detention. It is reported that the Minister of Justice has 
recently publicly taken up the issue related to the practice of 
signing arrest warrants without having reasonable grounds for 
detention.  This issue is compounded by advocates and human 
rights defenders not having access to a central database stating 
the names of those detained and the length of the detention.

sufficient powers and resources to 
investigate all forms of police 
misconduct, including allegations of 
extrajudicial killings, torture and ill-
treatment ; 
</p>
<p>The Bureau of Special Investigations and the 
Office of Professional Responsibility are 
institutions within the Jamaican 
Constabulary Force, while the Police Public 
Complaints Authority is a State-funded

<p><b>Government: </b>The INDECOM came into effect on 16 August 
2010, to investigate abuses by members of the security forces 
and other state agents. INDECOM operates from three 
locations: Kingston, Mandeville and Montego Bay. A total of 
Jamaican USD 200 million was allocated for its operations for 
the fiscal year 2011/2. INDECOM, in its Special Report to 
Parliament, has made a number of recommendations for legal 
reform which are to be considered.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  INDECOM commenced 
operations on 16 August 2010.  INDECOM has been provided 
with resources from the Parliament to employ investigators, a 
process which has only recently concluded.  However, it is 
reported that since INDECOM commenced their investigatory 
procedures, it has become evident that their powers to 
adequately and effectively ensure accountability of police 
officers have been hampered by the lack of cooperation 
between INDECOM and the DPP.39 The Government has 
reportedly acknowledged that it may need to clarify (and 
strengthen) the powers granted to INDECOM under the 
Independent Commission of Investigations Act.

Renewal Programme, which has an initial target of conducting 
social interventions in one hundred (100) vulnerable and 
volatile communities over the medium term (3 -5 years).

<p>Security has begun to work with other Ministries, Departments 
and Agencies to develop an inter-departmental Crime 
Prevention and Community Safety Strategy utilizing a 
participatory and coherent approach that will result in the 
implementation of policies designed to prevent crime, reduce 
violence, particularly youth and gang related violence.  A 
Crime Observatory is also in place and will be expanded. 
There continues to be a reduction in major crimes, including 
murder, over the last 2 years. The Government of Jamaica is 
also currently seeking to have Anti-Gang Legislation passed.  
 
Other programmes that have made inroads in communities 
include the Citizens Security and Justice Programme (CSJP) 
which is in its second 4-year phase; and the Safe School 
Programme that places emphasis on addressing violence and 
their causes in schools. An example of another educational 
initiative being pursued is the Alternative Secondary 
Transitional Education Programme (ASTEP), which is 
designed to provide a safety net for children at the end of the 
primary level who will require special intensive support and 
intervention, to successfully advance to the secondary level. 
The programme focuses on developing the literacy skills of 
students.  
 
The flow of weapons into Jamaica remains a challenge, 
especially since the country is not a manufacturer of small 
arms and light weapons. In keeping with the need to ensure 
that source countries undertake greater responsibility in 
preventing the illicit traffic of such weapons, a key priority for 
Jamaica remains increased collaboration with bilateral and 
regional partners to reduce the availability of illicit firearms 
and narco-trafficking to Jamaica as well as to facilitate cross-
border identification and prosecution of traffickers. Of note is 
the fact that there is a regional task force on crime and security, 
which is responsible for law enforcement and national security 
in Member Countries of the Caribbean Community 
(CARICOM), and which is complemented by the 2011 
CARICOM Declaration on Small Arms and Light Weapons. 
At the national level, the Government of Jamaica is working to </p>

As part of the National Programme for the Eradication of 
Poverty (NPEP), the Government addresses the needs of poor 
households under the Programme of Advancement Through 
Health and Education (PATH). The PATH is a conditional 
cash transfer programme which was implemented in 2001 to 
assist poor households in rural and urban areas in breaking the 
inter-generational cycle of poverty. While the main 
beneficiaries of the Programme are children, it also benefits the 
elderly, persons with disabilities, pregnant and lactating 
women, and a small number of indigent adults of working age.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is reported that in 2010, the 
Government introduced six crime bills40 to address the current 
situation of violence in Jamaica. However, instead of focusing 
on preventative measures, the Anti-Crime Acts focus on crimes 
that have already been committed and seem intent on 
correcting perceived or existing flaws in the operations of the 
police, the courts, and the correctional services.  Reportedly, 
despite many promises very little has been done to concretely 
break the links of criminal gangs to political parties, to tackle 
corruption, and poverty. There appears to have been some 
success in curbing the trade in firearms linked to the smashing 
of a distribution network emanating in the Police Armoury.41

are provided with basic necessities, 
such as adequate floor space, 
bedding, food and health care; 
convicted prisoners should be 
provided with opportunities for 
work, education, recreation and 
rehabilitation activities; 
</p>
<p>facilities were generally better than in police 
stations; however, many prisons were found 
to be overcrowded, lacking sanitary facilities 
and any meaningful opportunities for 
education, work and recreation. Corporal 
punishment was routinely applied in remand 
and correctional facilities.  
</p>
<p>international standards, it is severely hampered by a lack of 
financial resources due to budgetary constraints. The 
Government is, however, trying to improve conditions with the 
limited resources that are available and is actively seeking 
funding for the construction of new prison facilities. In the 
interim, however, repairs have been affected to a number of 
cells, dormitories and prison facilities in order to improve the 
living conditions of inmates. There is also closer monitoring of 
inmate/staff relationship and enhanced training opportunities 
for prison staff to reduce the number of incidents of abuse as 
well as of conflicts between staff and inmates. Inmates are also 
exposed to education and skills training. The Government will 
continue to use its best endeavours to address the situation in 
prisons and lock-ups. This is an area which will require 
international support and assistance. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  While there has been little 
progress to address the horrendous conditions in the prisons, 
there has been encouraging progress with rehabilitation 
programs. Whereas there were previously none, the 
Commissioner of Corrective Services has now committed to 
implementing programs in four (4) prisons around the island.42

</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Mentally ill persons who are detained are not 
kept in Police Custody but are usually transported to the

them to remain in custody, they are taken to the Facilities 
manned by the Department of Correctional Services (e.g. 
Horizon Adult Remand Centre and the Fort Augusta Adult 
Correctional Centre) as these facilities are better equipped to 
treat mentally ill offenders. At the correctional facilities, 
persons with mental issues are divided into two groups (a) 
those which are unfit to plea and are held indefinitely until the 
court rules on the matter and (b) those that have been 
sentenced. For those that are unfit to plea, it is a requirement 
by law that their situation be reviewed frequently. As such, the

<p><i>Information received in the reporting period  
</i></p>
<p>Department of Corrections provides a report to the Court at 
least each quarter on these individuals. The Court reviews the 
reports and decides whether to keep them in the facility or 
release them. As for those that are sentenced, they fall into the 
normal treatment plan where they see a psychiatrist and 
psychologist on a regular basis. Allegations of abuse in 
correctional facilities are investigated by an internal 
Inspectorate. Serious cases or those which would question the 
actions of the staff are forwarded to the Inspectorate at the 
Ministry of National Security. 
 
Section 14 (h) (ii) of the Charter speaks to the detention of 
individuals with mental disorders or addicted to drugs or 
alcohol where necessary, for his care or treatment or for the 
prevention of harm to himself or others. Detention is only to 
last for so long as is needed for that person&#8216;s care or treatment. 
It is, therefore, not agreed that this will amount to an 
indeterminable time which would conflict with that person&#8216;s 
right to be free from inhumane treatment. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No progress has  
been made on this recommendation. 
 
Reportedly, the Charter of Rights permits the detention of 
individuals for psychiatric analysis for an undetermined period, 
without legislating a scheduled time within which the detention 
for such purposes should be reviewed.  This permits and 
legalizes the detention of individuals in circumstances that may 
constitute inhuman and degrading treatment for an indefinite 
period of time.

<p>(o) Remove all children in conflict 
with the law from adult detention 
facilities, and ensure that children in 
need of care and protection from the 
State are not held with those in 
conflict with the law; 
</p>
<p>With regard to an &#8213;uncontrollable child&#8214;, 
there is no clear definition or criteria for its 
identification in the legislation. The wide 
discretion currently allowed to the judiciary 
has led to a relatively large number of 
detentions of children under such orders. 
The lack of separation of children and 
juveniles in need of care and protection, 
uncontrollable juveniles and those in conflict 
with the law makes it extremely difficult, if 
not impossible, to address the individual 
needs of children.  
The Fort Augusta Correctional Centre for 
Women and the Horizon Remand Centre for 
men are adult institutions that also hold 
children.  
</p>
<p><b>Government<i>: </i></b> The Government is working to reverse the 
current practice of the incarceration of children in police lock-
ups and to implement measures to protect children in juvenile 
correctional facilities.  
 
There is segregation in detention and prison facilities between 
juveniles and adults, persons on remand and convicts. Female 
juveniles at the Fort Augusta prison, for example, are kept in 
separate dormitories, except for those occasions during the day 
when they are being exposed to training and educational 
classes. As a result of the opening of the Metcalfe Street 
Secure Juvenile Centre, no male juveniles are being housed in 
any adult facilities under the control of the Department of 
Correctional Services. The space created by the Metcalfe Street 
Facility will allow girls on remand to be relocated to the Rio 
Cobre and St. Andrew remand centres previously occupied by 
boys. In addition, the Department of Correctional Services will 
continue to manage the Hill Top Juvenile Correctional Centres 
for boys and the Diamond Crest Juvenile Correctional Centre 
for girls. The Government is currently taking steps to prepare a 
facility for the remand of girls who are in conflict with the law. 
 
The Jamaica Constabulary Force continues to provide the 
Child Development Agency (CDA) with a weekly report of 
children who are being held in lockups. The Agency&#8216;s team 
continues to make the necessary arrangements for children to 
be removed to a Place of Safety or a pre-approved alternate 
site.  This is typically achieved within 48 hours as required by 
the Child Care and Protection Act, 2004 (CCPA). As at 
December 5, 2011, 32 children (30 males, 2 females) were in 
police custody.  This number varies and is not necessarily 
reflective of children being held in a police lockup for a 
prolonged period. 
  
As at the December 15, 2011, there were forty-five (45) 
children in conflict with the law who are being housed in the 
child protection residential system.  Efforts are made to 
monitor these placement to ensure that there is no or very 
minimal disruption to care delivery to the general children </p>

Over the past five months, the CDA initiated a pilot project 
designed to separate children with severe behaviour 
management issues from other children.  This pilot is now in 
place for the Glenhope Place of Safety (severe behaviour 
management issues) and Homestead Place of Safety (care and 
protection). The pilot will be reviewed in March 2012 and the 
findings of which will inform the necessary policy changes and 
next steps going forward. 
 
The term &#8215;uncontrollable&#8216; is usually used to refer to instances 
where a child exhibits or otherwise acts out maladaptive and 
socially unacceptable behaviours that makes it challenging or 
difficult for parents or guardian to effectively provide care on 
their own and which may result in their seeking intervention 
from third-parties, one of whom is the Jamaican State. This 
matter will be reviewed as part of a more comprehensive 
review of the Child Care and Protection Act, which will 
commence in 2012.  Section 8, Subsection 1A of the Child 
Care and Protection Act 2004, indicates that a child is 
considered to be in need of care and protection if that child 
&quot;having no parent or guardian, or having a parent or guardian 
unfit to exercise care and guardianship, is falling into bad 
associations, exposed to moral danger, or beyond control&#8214;.   
 
Section 24 of the Child Care and Protection Act 2004 governs 
the application of judgment on matters which children are 
deemed &#8213;beyond control&#8214; herein also referred to as 
&#8215;uncontrollable&#8216;, refers as follows: &#8213;(Subsection 1) The parent 
or guardian of a child may bring the child before a juvenile 
court and where such parent or guardian proves to the court 
that he is unable to control the child, the court may make an 
order in respect of the child if satisfied &#8211; (a) that it is expedient 
so to deal with the child, and (b) that the parent or guardian 
understands the results which will follow from, and consents to 
the making of, the order.

care of any fit person, whether a relative or not, who is willing 
to undertake the care of the child; or (ii) to be placed for a 
specified period, not exceeding three years, under the 
supervision of a probation and after-care officer, a children&#8216;s 
officer or of some other person to be selected for the purpose 
by the Minister.&#8214; 
 
A National Plan of Action for Child Justice (2010-2014) was 
approved in October 2011. This Plan of Action is a multi-
sectorial response to the needs of children in conflict with the 
law as well as those in need of care and protection. 
<b> </b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Despite the Government&#8216;s 
assurance that children would be removed from adult detention 
facilities. It is reported that the reality is that children continue 
to be held together with adults. The new facility, Metcalfe 
Street Juvenile Remand Centre for boys, which opened in June 
2011, serves the detention of male juveniles only and thus does 
not effectively address the entirety of children being held in 
facilities alongside adults. Despite the opening of the new 
centre, as of 3 September 2011, 28 children remained in police 
lockups. 
It is alleged that female juveniles continue to be routinely 
incarcerated in Fort Augusta and Horizon Remand (adult 
prisons). 
</p>
<p>(p) Transfer the responsibility of 
places of detention for juveniles to 
the Child Development Agency; 
</p>
<p> <b>Government: </b>After careful assessment by all stakeholders, it 
was decided that the management of places of detention for 
juveniles will remain the responsibility of the Department of 
Corrections. To strengthen service delivery, the Child 
Development Agency remains an active member of an 
intersectoral working group, led by the Ministry of National 
Security, to establish an independent inspectorate to carry out 
annual audit inspections of Correctional and Remand Centres 
for both adults and children. The aforementioned National Plan 
of Action for Child Justice is also expected to treat with the 
issues affecting children in state of custody.

</i></p>
<p><i>Information received in the reporting period  
</i></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Reportedly, even when the police 
attempts to have officers from the Child Development Agency 
(CDA) retrieve children who have been detained, the CDA 
fails to do so.  Reportedly, this thereby &#8213;forces&#8214; the police to 
keep them housed with adults in contravention of national 
legislation.  In addition, there continue to be inadequate 
facilities available for children who are in the State&#8216;s care and 
</p>
<p>custody. Too often children who are in conflict with the law 
and children who are in need of care and protection, are 
detained in the same facilities. 
</p>
<p>(q) Establish clear guidelines 
concerning punishments at children&#8216;s 
homes, places of safety and 
correctional facilities, and ensure 
that its use is recorded in the register; 
</p>
<p>There was a poor completion of complaint 
entries in the police registers.  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The imposition of corporal punishment as part 
of a sentence is no longer legal. The Courts prohibit its use as 
part of a sentence for a commission of a crime. Legislative 
provisions ban its use in early childhood education facilities 
and places of safety. The Child Care and Protection Act 
(CCPA) outlaws the use of corporal punishment within a 
Children&#8216;s Home, a Place of Safety or by a Fit Person. This is 
further underscored by the Child Care and Protection 
(Children&#8216;s Homes) Regulations, 2007 in Paragraph 19 
Sections 1 and 2 which states that &#8213;No licensee or member of 
staff of any children&#8216;s home shall strike, cuff, slap or use any 
other form of physical violence towards any child who resides, 
or is, at the home. No child at a children&#8216;s home shall be 
permitted to administer any form of punishment upon any 
other child.&#8214; Should any such act occur it is classified and 
reported to the Child Development Agency&#8216;s Monitoring 
Officers as a Critical Incident, and is thereafter investigated 
and acted upon as is required by law. 
 
 
The CDA continues to stress alternate methods of punishment 
which do not compromise the safety, well-being and dignity of 
any child.  In an effort to promote the use of alternate methods 
of punishment, the Agency has developed a protocol &#8213;Child 
Abuse Prevention &amp; Control within Residential Child Care 
Facilities (RCCF) Handbook&#8214; and is making final preparation 
for its dissemination and staff sensitization.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  A private members Bill was 
tabled in October 2010, to effectively repeal the Flogging 
Regulations Act and the Crime (Prevention of) Act, which 
condone the acts of flogging and whipping as punishment.  
The Bills continue to be debated. 
</p>
<p><b>Death penalty  </b>  
(r) Abolish the death penalty<b> </b>On 26 November 2008, parliament voted to 
</p>
<p>keep the death penalty. At the time of the 
visit, six people remained on death row. No 
death sentence has been executed since 
1988, however there is a rise in fatal 
shootings by the police, which are often 
alleged to amount to extrajudicial killings, as 
well as the apparent lack of investigation and 
accountability of those responsible. 
The prisoners in death row in the Gibraltar 1 
section in the St. Catherine centre were held 
in isolation.  
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>There are no plans by the Government, at this 
time, to abolish the death penalty.  
 
With respect to allegations of extrajudicial killings, the 
Government is committed to ensuring that all such cases are 
appropriately investigated. The establishment of the 
INDECOM is also expected to effectively respond to an 
investigation allegations of abuse by agents of the State.  
 
As regards the issue of the number of persons killed during the 
operations in West Kingston (73), the circumstances of their 
death remain the subject of investigation. 
 
Emphasis is being placed on enhancing the training being 
offered to security personnel with a special focus on the 
fundamentals of ethics, use of force and human rights. Training 
in the area of human rights is being provided in collaboration 
with human rights NGOs. The overall objective is to reduce 
the number of complaints of police excesses and restore public 
confidence in and support for the police. The Jamaica Defence 
Force also put in place revised rules of engagement which 
focus on further reducing the chances of civilian deaths when 
members of the Force carry out their operations.

<p>Morgan43 case. The legal position established by Pratt and 
Morgan prevented death row prisoners from being subjected to 
inhuman and degrading treatment by reason of: (a) the 
conditions under which persons sentenced to death are 
detained pending execution of the sentence; and (b) the length 
of time which elapses between the date on which the sentence 
is imposed and the date on which the sentence is executed.  It 
is reported that the failure to ensure that individuals sentenced 
to death in Jamaica are able to seek the review of their 
sentence on the basis established by Pratt and Morgan 
constitutes the entrenchment within Jamaican Law of a 
provision within the Charter that is wholly inconsistent with 
the fundamental rights protected under the Covenant. 
 
Further, it is reported that the <i>de facto </i>executions by police 
remains unacceptably high, with the number of those killed 
having increased to 320 in 2010 (not including the 73 
confirmed killed during the State of Emergency).  Reportedly, 
this now results in 1 in 5 of all killings in Jamaica occurring at 
the hands of the police. 
</p>

recommends that the relevant United 
Nations bodies, donor Governments 
and development agencies consider 
the administration of 
justice as the highest priority, in 
particular the fight against violent 
crime, policing 
and the penitentiary system.

<p><b>Jordan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to Jordan in 
June 2006 (A/HRC/4/33/Add.3, paras. 72-73) 
</b></p>
<p>57. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Jordan, requesting 
information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his predecessor&#8216;s 
recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not responded to his request. He looks forward to 
receiving information on Jordan&#8216;s efforts to implement the recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to 
prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>58. The Special Rapporteur notes that although the definition of torture has been included in article 208 of the Criminal Code, no 
steps have been undertaken to incorporate the prohibition of torture into the Constitution, as recommended by the Committee 
against Torture (CAT) in 2010.44  
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur welcomes written and oral instructions issued by the General Intelligence Directorate to its 
personnel about refraining from using physical abuse, he remains concerned that no public official has ever been prosecuted for 
having committed torture under article 208 of the Criminal Code, and that only disciplinary sanctions and lenient penalties were 
imposed on public officials found guilty of abuse or torture. In this connection, he calls on the Government to define the offence of 
torture in accordance with articles 1 and 4 of the CAT, with penalties commensurate with the gravity of torture and distinct from 
other crimes. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received data on the number of complaints of torture and ill-treatment received by 
the Public Security Directorate and the National Centre for Human Rights (NCHR), including the results of any investigation 
undertaken in this respect. He urges the Government to ensure the effective and independent functioning of these complaint 
mechanisms and looks forward to receiving statistical data on the number of complaints, investigations, prosecutions and 
convictions of cases of torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned about the reported cases of domestic violence against women and strongly 
encourages the Government to provide women at risk of violence with protection and support without placing them in &#8213;protective&#8214; 
</p>
<p>custody but housing them in specific victim shelters.  
</p>
<p>62. Finally, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his recommendation to consider the ratification of the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture (OPCAT) and the establishment of a National Preventive Mechanism. He recalls the appeal to the 
Government to make declaration with respect to article 22 of the CAT, recognizing the competence of the CAT to receive and 
consider communications from victims of torture.

<p>(a) The absolute prohibition of 
torture be considered for 
incorporation into the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>No specific provision relates to 
the prohibition of torture, or 
cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The fact that the Jordanian 
Constitution does not contain a provision on the 
offence of torture, does not imply that torture is in 
any way permissible. The absence of such a 
constitutional provision cannot be legally 
construed as derogating from the legal obligations 
laid down in the CAT, nor can it be interpreted as 
a failing of the Constitution.  
1.The Constitution contains general norms which 
place individual rights and freedoms in a general 
framework.  
2. Torture is defined as a criminal offence in 
article 208 of the Criminal Code, which was 
recently amended to include explicit reference to 
the offence of torture, as was article 49 of the 
Military Criminal Code. 
3. After being published in the Official Gazette, 
the Convention against Torture has become part of 
the Jordanian penal legislation. 
4.The Constitution guarantees that everyone has 
the general and absolute right to seek a legal 
remedy. Under article 256 of the Civil Code, a 
plaintiff is entitled to seek damages for any injury 
suffered. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(b) The highest authorities, 
particularly those responsible for 
law enforcement activities, declare 
unambiguously that the culture of 
impunity must end and that torture 
and ill-treatment by public officials 
will not be tolerated and will be 
prosecuted. The message should be 
spread that torture is an extremely 
serious crime which will be 
punished with severe (long-term) 
</p>
<p>- Implicit societal tolerance for 
a degree of violence against 
alleged criminal suspects and 
convicts.  
- Though unspoken, many were 
aware that abuse of suspects 
and detainees occurs and 
resigned that little could be 
done about it.  
- Little public discussion about 
the situation of torture.  
</p>
<p>- HE King Abdullah and the director of the Public 
Security Directorate (PSD), Lt. Gen Muhammad 
Mahmud al-&#8215;Aitan issued clear instructions that 
there was to be no torture.  
- The General Intelligence Directorate (GID) has 
issued written and oral instructions addressed to all 
personnel to refrain from abusing any detainee 
physically, verbally or emotionally, and providing 
for an increase in penalties for violations.

conferences, publications and booklets. The Media 
Office and Amman FM Radio receive complaints 
and remarks from citizens and residents in Jordan 
and guide them in following up their complaints. 
In addition, operational procedures were carried

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   According to the 
NCHR 2008 annual report, the PSD  adopted some 
effective measures in 2008, including: i)  
Integrating the Anti-Torture Convention into basic 
and training curricula, as well as lectures and 
promotion tests for PSD personnel, particularly 
those working at CRCs, with the view to 
entrenching the Convention&#8216;s provisions and

Carrying out investigations regarding complaints 
of human rights violations, including torture, 
despite the fact that the results are in general still 
modest; iii} Showing seriousness in dealing with 
complaints of torture  and ill-treatment and 
referring some of these complaints to the Police 
Court.

criminalizes any acts of torture and imposes 
punishments for perpetrating torture, inciting its 
exercise, or approval or acquiescence thereof by 
any official or any person acting in an official 
capacity. The penalties imposed on the perpetrator 
of this crime have been set forth under articles 
208/1 and 208/3 of the Penal Code, including 
imprisonment for six months to three years against 
exercising any kind of torture to obtain confession 
of a crime or information in connection thereof. 
This penalty would be increased to temporary hard 
labor if the act of torture has led to illness or 
serious injury. Furthermore, the court may not stop 
the enforcement of the sentenced punishment in 
the crimes listed in article 208, and it may not 
consider extenuating circumstances. 
Non-governmental sources:  The minimum prison 
sentence regarding article 208 of the penal code is 
three months to three years&#8216; imprisonment, and 
</p>
<p>torture is considered a misdemeanour. 
(d) The special court system within 
the security services &#8211; above all, 
police and intelligence courts &#8211; be 
abolished, and their jurisdiction be 
transferred to the ordinary 
independent public prosecutors and 
criminal courts. 
</p>
<p>The special court system did 
not work effectively. The 
presumption of innocence was 
illusory, primacy was placed on 
obtaining confessions, public 
officials essentially 
demonstrated no sense of duty, 
and assumed no responsibility 
to investigate human rights 
violations against suspected 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Most recently, an amendment to the 
Public Security Law has been enacted, whereby a 
civil judge shall be a member of the police court 
composed of a chairperson and two members 
(three judges in total).  
- The claim that the State Security Court accepts 
&#8213;confessions&#8214; allegedly obtained under torture 
</p>
<p>while in custody is an unfounded and 
undocumented allegation. Special courts, 
including the State Security Court, are legal and

internal special courts served 
only to shield security officials 
from justice. 
</p>
<p>based on the Jordanian Constitution. The State 
Security Court has limited authority over limited 
criminal offences against the country&#8216;s security 
</p>
<p>and public order. The litigation procedures of the 
special courts and the regular courts are similar. 
Public prosecutors apply the provisions of the 
articles set forth in the Criminal Proceedings Law 
No. 9 of 1961. By virtue of article 159 of this law, 
the court does not accept a proof or evidence that 
has been obtained under any kind of physical or 
mental coercion and considers it false and of no 
legal effect. A complainant has the right to 
challenge his statement before the prosecutor and 
court if he believes that it was obtained through 
physical or mental coercion by the law 
enforcement unit. The decisions of the special 
court are subject to appeal before the Court of 
Cassation, which is classified as a court of merit 
and court of law, and a trial or any of its stages can 
be voided if it was proved to be in violation of the 
Criminal Proceedings Law. 
- The Court of Cassation handed down a number 
of rulings annulling the verdicts of these courts 
because defendants had been put under physical 
and mental duress during questioning.

- A human rights directorate 
within the Ministry of Interior 
was mandated to follow up on

Prisoners can complain to the Ministry of 
Interior&#8216;s PSD through Legal Affairs prosecutors 
</p>
<p>who are present all the time in seven prisons: 
Muwaqqar, Qafqafa, Swaqa, Jweideh men, 
Jweideh women, al-&#8215;Aqaba and Birain. The 
prison-based prosecutors work closely with 
officials in the Complaints and Human Rights 
Office of the PSD, who visit the prisons every two 
weeks and empty the sealed complaints boxes; 
- In February 2008 the NCHR was allowed to open 
an office inside Swaqa prison to receive 
complaints from prisoners on a weekly basis; 
However, the NCHR was not allowed access to 
Swaqa prison during disturbances which occurred 
in the prison in April 2008. The PSD has 
reportedly stopped cooperating with the NCHR 
following its critical reporting of the April 2008 
events. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Under the Jordanian legislation, any 
person who alleges to be a victim of torture, may 
seek a judicial remedy and is entitled to request 
compensation in accordance with article 256 of the 
Civil Law.  
- The Office of Grievances and Human Rights in 
the PSD deals with complaints. Complaints are 
also received through reporting in person to the 
Office or submitting the complaint through official 
and unofficial correspondence. The complaints are 
then investigated, verified and followed up in an 
effective, immediate, comprehensive and impartial 
manner in order to reach a just conclusion.  </p>

<p>- Special monitoring and complaints office was set 
up in the Public Security Department and reports 
directly to the Director of Public Security. A key 
aim of the office is to verify that police procedures 
are correct and are implemented in a legal 
framework that is fair and just. The functions of 
the office can be summarized as follows: 
(a) Receiving complaints from the public about 
any violations or erroneous practices carried out 
by public security services personnel; 
(b) Coordinating with the relevant authorities in 
regard to these complaints; 
(c) Investigating complaints in accordance with 
due process norms and submitting the findings to 
the Director of Public Security; 
(d) Receiving reports submitted by complaints 
offices in police departments and taking the 
necessary action thereon; 
(e) Submitting report to the Director of Public 
Security setting out the complaints received, the 
action taken and appropriate recommendations; 
(f) Following up on complaints, resolving them 
and informing the parties concerned of the 
outcomes; 
(g) Producing regular publications for unit chiefs 
containing information on any wrong practices 
among their staff; these publications help to raise 
awareness and offer advice and guidance in line 
with the directives issued by the Director of Public 
Security. 
- Within correctional and rehabilitation centres, the 
Grievances Office or the public prosecutors are in 
charge of these complaints and of all legal 
procedures. Complaint boxes affiliated with this 
Office were placed in all correctional and 
rehabilitation centres.  </p>

routinely ask persons brought from 
police custody how they have been 
treated and, even in the absence of 
a formal complaint from the 
defendant, order an independent 
medical examination in accordance 
with the Istanbul Protocol. 
</p>
<p>It appeared that judges and 
prosecutors did not ask 
detainees how they had been 
treated in police custody. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Ministry of Interior instructed 
all administrative governors to allow lawyers to 
attend interrogations of suspects conducted by the 
administrative governors.  
- A medical care clinic was established within the 
detention centre, where two doctors and two 
nurses are available around the clock, in addition 
to a dental clinic and a pharmacy. Each detainee is 
examined by a doctor and given the necessary 
treatment; a medical file is opened for him and a 
counselor is made available for psychological 
consultation. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b> In general, detainees 
are not asked, but the NCHR monitors some 
individual cases. 
</p>
<p>

<p>(j) Those legally arrested should 
not be held in facilities under the 
control of their interrogators or 
investigators for more than the 
time required by law to obtain a 
judicial warrant of pre-trial 
detention, which should not exceed 
48 hours. After this period they 
should be transferred to a pre-trial 
facility under a different authority, 
where no further unsupervised 
contact with the interrogators of

him or her within 24 hours. An 
individual could bring action

him or her in custody for over 
24 hours without questioning.

</i></p>
<p>(k) The maintenance of custody 
registers be scrupulously ensured, 
including recording of the time and 
place of arrest, the identity of the 
personnel, the actual place of 
detention, the state of health upon 
arrival of the person at the 
detention centre, the time at which 
the family and a lawyer were 
contacted and visited the detainee, 
and information on compulsory 
medical examinations upon being 
brought to a detention centre and 
upon transfer. 
</p>
<p>On paper, a file regarding each 
detainee informed about the 
time of arrival, state of health, 
details, reason for detention, 
authority which issued the 
arrest warrant or verdict, and 
all details relating to the 
person&#8216;s time at the centre. 
</p>
<p>Upon arrival, detainees were to 
undergo a medical check-up 
and the police doctor should 
prepare a medical report, 
indicating whether there were 
any traces of torture. If that was 
the case, a forensic report had 
to be prepared and judicial 
authorities were to be notified. 
However, this process was not 
effective in practice.  
</p>
<p>- A register at the GID contained information 
about any detainee&#8216;s name, nationality and charge. 
</p>
<p>Another register recorded visitors, and a third 
register contained medical records. Outside of the 
GID, detainees did not receive a standard medical 
examination.  
- In regular prisons registers generally contained 
the name of the detainee or prisoner, the 
nationality and charge, if any; the doctors had 
medical files of those seeking and receiving 
medical care, although no entry exam was 
performed.

<p>(l) Confessions made by persons in 
custody without the presence of a 
lawyer and that are not confirmed 
before a judge shall not be 
admissible as evidence against the 
persons who made the confession. 
Serious consideration should be 
given to video and audio taping of 
interrogations, including of all 
persons present. 
</p>
<p>A confession could be accepted 
as the only evidence in a case if 
the court was convinced that it 
was made voluntarily and 
willingly (article 159 CCP). 
The Court of Cassation has 
overturned a number of 
convictions on the grounds that 
security officials had obtained 
confessions from defendants 
under torture. 
</p>
<p>The Court of Cassation has issued several rulings 
with regard to confessions made as a result of 
violence: e.g.  ruling No. 1513/2003 of 4 May 
2006, which held that &#8213;statements obtained as a 
result of violence and coercion cannot be relied 
upon to convict a defendant&#8214;. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Article 159 of the Criminal 
Procedures Law stipulates that any evidence or 
statement obtained by physical or mental coercion 
and in the absence of the public prosecutor is 
considered void, and of no legal effect. It will not 
be accepted, unless the prosecution provides 
evidence of the circumstances, under which it was 
obtained and the court is convinced that the 
indicted, suspect or defendant has provided such 
evidence or statement voluntarily. The defendant

- The Court of Cassation handed down a number 
of rulings annulling verdicts of courts, because 
defendants had been put under physical and mental 
duress during questioning. Ruling No. 450/2004 of 
17/3/2004 states: &#8213;If the court concludes that the 
confession which the defendant made to the police 
was obtained under circumstances which must cast 
doubt on its veracity and under the effects of 
physical duress and torture, then the court is 
entitled to disregard the confession.&#8214; Also, ruling

<p>No. 1513/2003 of 4/5/2006 stipulates: &#8213;Statements

<p>similar rulings annulling court verdicts include: 
No. 820/2003 of 23/11/2003; No. 552/99 of

convicted persons from persons 
awaiting trial.  
</p>
<p>prisoners; Qafqafa, Swaqa and Muwaqqar prisons 
seem to be intended exclusively for convicted 
prisoners. 
- Convicts are further segregated according to age, 
health, crime, and general behaviour. Under article 
3(d) of the 2007 Law on the Correction and 
Rehabilitation Centres, the classification is to be 
made by a psychiatrist, a general doctor and a 
social worker. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Pre-trial and 
convicted detainees are separated. 
</p>
<p>(s) The Criminal Procedure Code 
be amended to ensure that the 
automatic recourse to pre-trial 
detention, which is the current de 
facto general practice, be 
authorized by a judge strictly only 
as a measure of last resort, and the 
use of non-custodial measures, 
such as bail and recognizance, are 
increased for non-violent, minor or 
less serious offences. 
</p>
<p>   
</p>
<p>(t) Due to extremely harsh prison 
conditions and routine practice of 
torture, the Al-Jafr Correction and 
Rehabilitation Centre be closed 
without delay. 
</p>
<p>Detainees are routinely beaten 
and subjected to corporal 
punishment amounting to 
torture. The isolation and 
harshness of the desert 
environment compounds the 
already severe conditions of the 
prisoners.  
</p>
<p>The Government closed Al-Jafr Prison in 
December 2006.  
<b>Government:</b> Al-Jafr Prison was closed down by 
order of His Majesty the King on 17 December 
2006, and was converted into a vocational training 
school. In addition, new reform and rehabilitation 
centres with a capacity to accommodate more than 
1000 inmates each are being constructed, one in 
Muwaqqar that was fitted out and recently began 
to admit prisoners, and another in Mafraq which is 
still under construction. The aim is to resolve once 
and for all the overcrowding problem in some 
centres and to leave scope for classifying prisoners

Prevention Law for being at risk of 
becoming victims of honour crimes 
be housed in specific victim 
shelters where they are at liberty 
but still enjoy safe conditions. 
</p>
<p>No allegations of ill-treatment 
were received in the Juweidah 
(Female) Correction and 
Rehabilitation Centre.  
There is a policy of holding 
females in &#8213;protective&#8214; 
</p>
<p>detention, under the provisions 
of the 1954 Crime Prevention 
Law, because they are at risk of 
becoming victims of honour 
crimes.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  A victims&#8216; centre 
became operational in 2007, however, not all 
women in protective custody have been moved to 
the centre. Furthermore, the centre seeks 
reconciliation and does not have a mandate to 
protect the women at risk. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Protection is provided to potential 
victims of &#8215;honor killings&#8216;, or those who are 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to domestic violence, in a safe house 
called the &#8213;Domestic Reconciliation House&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>Psychological, rehabilitation programmes, 
vocational trainings, medical and legal assistance 
is available to victims of domestic violence. 
- According to the protection houses&#8216; regulations, 
new instructions were issued to allow civil society 
organizations to establish and run sanctuaries to 
contribute to promoting the concept of protection 
in the society, and use the collaborative approach, 
such as the sanctuary affiliated to the Jordanian 
Women&#8216;s Union and the one affiliated to the 
</p>
<p>Jordan River Foundation in raising the level of 
protection in the society.

<p>(v) Security personnel shall 
undergo extensive and thorough 
training using a curriculum that 
incorporates human rights 
education throughout and that 
includes training in effective 
interrogation techniques and the 
proper use of policing equipment, 
and that existing personnel receive 
continuing education 
</p>
<p>None of the directors of 
prisons, pre-trial or police 
detention centres had allegedly 
been aware of any allegations 
of torture. 
</p>
<p>- Initiatives within the PSD include: distribution of 
the Convention against Torture to law enforcement 
personnel and encouragement of senior officers to 
bring it to the attention of their subordinates; 
- Inclusion of CAT in all basic training curricula, 
lectures and promotion exams for security 
personnel; 
- Several programmes and training courses have 
been implemented in this regard; the Royal Police 
Academy incorporated some sessions about torture 
and prisoners&#8216; rights in its curriculum.

Complaints and Human Rights, in conjunction 
with the NCHR and other civil society 
organizations have been intensified to prevent 
wrongful acts, to report and to ensure 
accountability. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Jordan&#8216;s decision not to accede to 
the OPCAT should not be viewed as a lack of 
commitment to strengthening and enhancing the 
protection of persons deprived of their liberty. 
Jordan is determined to enhance the existing 
mechanisms mandated to undertake periodic visits 
to places of detention. The non-accession of 
Jordan to the OPCAT at this stage does not 
necessarily preclude the possibility to reconsider 
such position in the future. 
-A number of bodies such as the Grievances and 
Human Rights Office of the PSD, the NCHR, 
ICRC, and some international NGOs have been 
carrying out regular visits to all investigation and 
detention centres, as well as rehabilitation facilities 
to ensure compliance and respect for human rights.

<p>2009, between the PSD and the NCHR for the 
purpose of facilitating its role in conducting 
unannounced visits to all rehabilitation centres in 
the kingdom. Prior to that, a human rights office 
related to the NCHR was established at Souagha 
Rehabilitation Centre. 
Amendments to the law, pertaining to correctional 
facilities and rehabilitation centres n&#176; 9 of 2004, 
have been proposed that include provisions on the 
conditional release system, as well as provision to 
further facilitate visits and periodic inspection of 
these centres.  
The Minister of Justice or his delegates has the 
power to carry out visits at any given time to 
correctional facilities to ensure the implementation 
of court decisions. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : The Optional 
Protocol has not been ratified, but the NCHR 
conducts unannounced visits to places of 
detention, in cooperation with the PSD, as a 
preventive measure. 
</p>
<p>(y) Systematic training 
programmes and awareness-raising 
campaigns be carried out on the 
principles of the Convention 
against Torture for the public at 
large, security personnel, legal 
professionals and the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>The Government informed it 
promotes human rights 
concepts through awareness-
raising programmes 
disseminated by the media and 
recently incorporated these 
concepts into the academic 
curricula. In various meetings 
with government officials the 
Special Rapporteur found a 
lack of awareness of the 
seriousness of torture. 
</p>
<p>- Training sessions for judges in the Judicial 
Institute emphasize the need to combat torture in 
prisons. Prosecutors, together with judges, have 
been trained by national and international NGOs 
on the Convention against Torture and on juvenile 
justice matters;  
- Several training workshops have been carried out 
by the National Human Rights Centre.

was disseminated among the members of security 
forces who were instructed to adhere to its 
provisions and include its articles in their training 
courses.

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The NCRH, the PSD, 
the Ministry of Justice and the Mizan Law Group 
for Human Rights are implementing a programme 
entitled &#8213;Karama&#8214;, aimed at eradicating the use of

<p>torture and ill-treatment, and ensuring that such 
acts are criminalised, investigated, prosecuted and 
punished, and that victims receive redress, in 
accordance with Jordan&#8216;s international legal 
obligations. The objectives of the project are: i) To 
strengthen the professional capacity of relevant 
law enforcement institutions to prevent torture and 
ill-treatment and to respond appropriately and 
effectively when such acts occur; ii) To strengthen 
the  professional capacity of state and civil society 
organizations so as to facilitate that torture and ill-
treatment are documented, prosecuted and 
redressed in accordance with international legal 
standards; iii) To institutionalise and enhance the 
cooperation between the  state and civil society so 
as to further the eradication of torture and ill-
treatment; and iv) To promote a strengthening of 
Jordan&#8216;s national legislation so as to enhance the 
</p>
<p>prevention of torture and ill-treatment and the 
criminalisation of torture. 
- The program will run from October 2008 to 
September 2010, and it is funded by the Danish

<p><b>Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Kazakhstan from 5 to 13 May 2009 (A/HRC/13/39/Add.3) 
</b></p>
<p>63. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Kazakhstan requesting 
information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his predecessor&#8216;s  
recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided any information with regard to the 
implementation of the recommendations. He looks forward to receiving information on Kazakhstan&#8216;s efforts to implement the 
recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the amendment of the definition of torture in article 141-1 of the Criminal Code; however, 
he observes that it is not fully in conformity with the definition of torture in article 1 of the Convention against Torture as it does 
not refer to physical and mental suffering arising from unlawful actions of public officials. In addition, the specific offence of 
torture is not punishable by appropriate penalties commensurate with the gravity of the offence, as required by article 4, paragraph 
2, of the Convention. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that torture is established as a serious crime, 
sanctioned with appropriate penalties.  
</p>
<p>65. The Special Rapporteur questions the effectiveness of the complaints mechanism envisaged in the Manual (Guidelines) of 
the Office of the Public Prosecutor, as an accessible complaint channel with due guarantee of protection against reprisals. In this 
connection, he stresses the need to establish an effective and independent mechanism to investigate all allegations of torture and ill-
treatment by law enforcement agencies promptly, independently and thoroughly.  
</p>
<p>66. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the reported incidence of violence and excessive use of force by law 
enforcement officials against participants in the protests held in December 2011 in Mangistau region, allegedly leading to the loss 
of life of at least 15 persons. He welcomes the Presidential instruction to ensure transparent investigation into the events and 
launching of internal investigations for alleged abuse of power by law enforcement officials. He regrets not having received any 
information about the number of judicial or other inquiries carried out in relation to this case.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the consideration by the Parliament of the draft bill introducing amendments in the 
Criminal Procedure Code to grant access to defence counsel and allow for notification of family members from the moment of 
actual deprivation of liberty, and expresses hope that this rule will be effectively implemented in practice.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving more information on concrete steps undertaken to implement the 
Government&#8216;s plans to strengthen further non-custodial pre- and post- trial measures provided for in the concept of the Legal Policy 
for 2010-2020.  
</p>
<p>69. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the Law on Refugees is not fully consistent with the provisions 
implementing the principles of non-refoulement stipulated by article 3 of the Convention. He strongly encourages the Government 
to adopt a legislation regulating expulsion, deportation and extradition in line with its international obligation under article 3 of the 
Convention.  </p>

acts on combating torture and protecting 
detainees&#8216; rights were adopted, including: 
- Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan of 10 
December 2009, &#8213;On amending and 
supplementing several legal acts with a view 
of improving the system of execution of 
punishment and the correctional system&#8214;; 
- Decree No 1039 of the President &#8213;On the 
measures of increasing the effectiveness of 
the judiciary and law enforcement bodies in 
the Republic of Kazakhstan&#8214;; 
- Government decree No 71 of February 
2010, approving the Government&#8216;s Plan of 
</p>
<p>Action for 2010-2012 on the 
implementation of the recommendation of 
the UN Committee against Torture; 
- Normative decree No 7 of the Supreme 
Court of 28 December 2009 &#8213;On the 
</p>
<p>administration of criminal and criminal-
procedural norms on the issues of personal 
liberties and freedoms, personal security and 
dignity, fight against torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment&#8214;;  
- The Prosecutor General&#8216;s decree No 7 of 1 
February 2010 about &#8213;Instructions on 
</p>
<p>revision of complaints about torture and 
other illegal methods of ill-treatment of 
persons involved in criminal proceedings 
and deprived of their liberty, and their 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The authorities introduced a 
number of measures intended to prevent torture, including 
widening access to places of detention to independent 
public monitors and committing publicly to a policy of 
zero tolerance on torture.   
 
During the UPR review in February 2010, the Government 
delegation reiterated that the Kazakhstani authorities were 
committed to a policy of zero tolerance on torture, and that 
they &#8213;would not rest until all vestiges of torture had been 
</p>
<p>fully and totally eliminated&#8214;.  
 
However, human rights and prison reform monitors report 
that the public condemnation of torture has been confined 
to statements and directives by national entities and 
officials, such as the Office of the Prosecutor General in 
the capital Astana, senior officials at the Ministries of 
Internal Affairs and Justice, the Presidential 
Administration. At regional and local levels no such public 
statements have reportedly been made and human rights 
monitors have expressed serious concern that directives 
from central national offices are not implemented by 
regional and local law enforcement forces. </p>

- Draft order of the Minister of Justice &#8213;On 
amending and supplementing several orders 
of the Minister of Justice&#8214;, to ensure 
</p>
<p>absolute prohibition of torture, courteous 
treatment of detainees, and protection of 
detainees&#8216; rights in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international standards. 
(b) Amend the law to ensure that torture is 
established as a serious crime, sanctioned 
with appropriate penalties and fully brought 
into line with the definition provided for in 
the Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>Torture is outlawed by article 347-1 of the 
criminal code, but its definition is more 
restrictive than the one contained in article 1 
CAT, as it limits criminal responsibility to 
public officials and does not criminalize 
torture committed by any other person 
acting in an official capacity or by 
individuals acting at the instigation or with 
the consent or acquiescence of public 
officials. Article 347-1 states that &#8213;physical 
and mental suffering caused as a result of 
legitimate acts on the part of officials shall 
not be recognized as torture&#8214;, with the term 
</p>
<p>of &#8213;legitimate acts&#8214; as being vague.  
 
<b>Government</b>: The draft Bill providing 
amendments in the definition of torture in 
article 347-1 of the Criminal Code in line 
with article 1 of the CAT has been 
submitted to the Parliament on 30 December 
2010. Since torture is qualified as a grave 
crime, there is no need to make amendments 
in the legislation in terms of the definition 
of the gravity of crime. 
</p>
<p>

accessible in practice, ensure that any signs 
of torture are investigated ex officio, and 
protect complainants against reprisals.

overwhelming majority of complaints are 
almost automatically rejected. 
Staff of the investigation isolators does not 
consider it their responsibility to detect and 
address torture or ill-treatment perpetrated 
by law enforcement agencies. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Data regarding complaints 
alleging offences committed by officials of 
the penitentiary system, received in the past 
5 years, is as follows: 2005 - 17; 2006 &#8211; 54; 
2007 &#8211; 219; 2008 &#8211; 280; 2009 &#8211; 288. Thus, 
in the past five years, the number of 
complaints have increased 16.94 times. 
In 2009, out of 122 registered cases on 
violations of citizens&#8216; constitutional rights, 
</p>
<p>disciplinary measures were applied in 
relation to 128 employees of law 
enforcement bodies (including 56 senior 
officials). In 2008, 2 members of organs of 
internal affairs were sentenced to various 
terms of imprisonment with charges of 
torture. In 2009, 2 cases were filed against 
members of law enforcement with charges 
of using torture. In 2010, one employee of 
the criminal correctional system was 
charged with using physical force against 
detainees. 10 employees of the criminal 
correction facility were charged with 
exceeding the official power. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Although the 
Manual (Guidelines) of the Office of the 
Public Prosecutor, established by an Order 
of the Prosecutor General of 1 February 
2010, provides for complaints mechanisms,

<p>or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, especially with 
regard to initiating prompt, thorough, independent and 
impartial investigations into allegations of torture or other

</p>
<p>Reportedly, according to the Prosecutor General&#8216;s office, in 
</p>
<p>2009, only two allegations of torture by security officers 
had been confirmed and criminal cases had been opened 
against the offending officers. It reportedly dismissed as 
unfounded all allegations of torture by security officers 
raised by a number of people whose cases had been taken

<p>it is questionable whether these mechanisms 
are effective. According to para. 17 of the 
Guidelines, detainees are asked about their 
treatment during the interrogation. This 
provision does not protect a person against 
torture nor does it provide an effective 
mechanism to receive information, as the 
investigator questioning the detainee may be 
the one involved in executing acts of torture.  
- In a number of penitentiary institutions, 
prisoners do not receive outgoing numbers 
attached to their complaints and complaints 
are reportedly not transmitted to relevant 
agencies for further action. In penitentiary 
institutions in the Karaganda region, 
detainees have not been able to get an 
appointment with the head of the 
penitentiary or with the lawyer. Prisoners 
who reported ill-treatment are often 
threatened and intimidated by the prison 
administration. 
</p>
<p>(d) Establish an effective and independent 
criminal investigation and prosecution 
mechanism that has no connection to the 
body investigating or prosecuting the case 
against the alleged victim. 
</p>
<p>The dual role played by the prosecutors 
(endorsing of indictments prepared by 
the police &amp; monitor compliance by 
criminal justice bodies and law enforcement 
officials with the law and to protect the 
rights of citizens and residents) leads to the 
paradox situation that torture or ill-treatment 
are raised at a latter stage of a criminal 
process, and they have to be processed by 
the prosecutor&#8216;s office, the latter, by 
</p>
<p>demanding an investigation, basically 
admits that it has not fulfilled its monitoring 
role. Thus, prosecutors tend to ignore grave 
violations.

the role and responsibility of the Prosecutor 
over the pre-trial procedure in terms of 
ensuring the lawfulness of criminal

- Minimizing options for alternative 
jurisdiction, including attributing to the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs the investigation of criminal cases 
related to illegal transaction of narcotic and 
psychotropic substances, and to the relevant 
bodies of financial police, the investigation 
of criminal cases in the area of economic 
and corruption-related crimes while 
maintaining alternative jurisdiction with 
national security organs only in cases of 
accumulation of committed acts.  
- Delegating the examination of criminal 
cases with charges of torture allegedly 
committed by law enforcement agents to 
another entity authorized to examine the

<p>the Criminal Procedural Code has been 
amended ensuring non-refoulement of 
refugees where there are substantial grounds 
to believe that a person would face the 
danger of being subjected to torture or ill-
treatment upon return.   
 
<b><i>Non-governmental source</i></b> : Although the 
adoption of the Law on Refugees is an 
important step, it is not fully consistent with 
international standards, in particular with 
regard to the principle of non-refoulement.  
- Article 12(5) of the law, which provides 
for the denial of refugee status on the basis 
of membership of a terrorist, extremist or 
banned religious organizations or groups, 
does not elaborate whether the organizations 
should be banned or considered extremist or 
terrorist by the country of asylum, country 
of origin or either. Furthermore, in the 
absence of a restrictive definition of 
&#8215;extremist&#8216; organization, this provision may 
</p>
<p>be used by the countries of origin to 
persecute political opponents; whereas 
inclusion of &#8215;banned religious 
organizations&#8216; may effectively exclude one 
</p>
<p>of the core elements of the refugee 
definition, which explicitly includes 
persecution on religious grounds. 
- There is also a lack of clarity in the Law 
with respect to safeguards against 
refoulement in deportation and extradition 
procedures: under Kazakhstani laws, 
deportation is regulated by administrative 
procedures which do not contain same 
guarantees as a criminal procedure. Under 
the current law the decision on deportation 
</p>
<p>or who were members or suspected members of Islamist 
parties or Islamic movements banned in Uzbekistan, and 
who had fled the country, fearing persecution for their 
religious beliefs. The exclusion also affected people of 
Uighur origin from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous 
Region of China who were charged with or suspected of 
belonging to separatist movements or parties.  
The newly-formed State Migration Committee, under the 
Ministry of Labour, began a review of all cases of those 
granted refugee status by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, 
prior to the State Migration Committee&#8216;s inception. It 
revoked the refugee status of many people from Uzbekistan 
and China, most of whom were awaiting resettlement to a 
third country.  
 
It is reported that a growing numbers of these individuals, 
as well as other asylum-seekers from Uzbekistan and 
China, were stopped by police or NSS officers for 
document checks and arbitrarily detained either for short 
periods in pre-charge detention facilities or indefinitely in 
NSS detention facilities pending forcible return to their 
countries of origin. Reportedly, they had no or limited 
access to lawyers, UNHCR or their families.   
 
It is further reported that in June 2010, NSS officers 
detained 30 Uzbekistani refugees and asylum-seekers in the 
city of Almaty with a view to forcibly deporting them to 
Uzbekistan. Detainees&#8216; wives were told that their husbands 
faced extradition to Uzbekistan on charges of membership 
of illegal religious or extremist organizations and charges 
of attempting to overthrow the State.  
On 8 September 2010 one of the men, Nigmatulla Nabiev, 
was granted asylum for one year. However, on 13 
September 2010, the Almaty deputy prosecutor announced 
that the General Prosecutor&#8216;s Office had decided to 
extradite the remaining 29 men. At least two of the 29 were 
said to have been extradited to Uzbekistan in September 
before their appeals against their detentions and the 
decisions to extradite them had been heard. By the end of </p>

There is not enough clarity with regard to 
the provisions on mandatory medical 
examination of asylum seekers and refugees 
and right of entry and stay on the territory of 
the country, which may serve as grounds for 
deportation. The recent reported cases of 
denial of renewal of police registration, 
following a court decision to reject an 
asylum claim, is alarming and may lead to 
risk of deportation, and thus undermine the 
right of stay on the territory until the 
delivery of a final decision on asylum claim. 
- The extradition process in the Law appears 
to be complicated. Although in principle the 
persons are entitled to legal representation 
and appeal, in practice they are not informed 
of this right and rarely have access to 
challenge accusations raised by the country 
of origin.  
- There is a need for a clear and 
comprehensive mechanism for admission of 
asylum seekers at the border, including in 
situations of mass influxes. Currently the 
situations of mass influxes are regulated by 
the Law on States of Emergency, which is 
not refugee protection sensitive and does not 
provide for procedural guarantees and 
</p>
<p>December, the majority of the 29 men&#8216;s appeals had been 
turned down. At least two other Uzbekistani asylum-
seekers were extradited in October and November 2010. 
On 9 June 2011, a year after they were originally detained, 
the Kazakhstani authorities forcibly returned 28 of the 
ethnic Uzbek men to Uzbekistan, thus violating their 
obligations under international law and placing the men at 
real risk of torture. One more ethnic Uzbek man, who was 
also detained on 9 June 2010, remains in detention in 
Kazakhstan. All of the 29 asylum-seekers and refugees had 
lodged appeals against the Prosecutor General&#8216;s decision in 
September 2010, to extradite them. These were rejected by 
a district court in the southern city of Almaty on 15 March 
</p><p>2011. Additionally, in December 2010 the Committee 
against Torture imposed interim measures to stay 
extradition pending a review of the merits of a complaint 
submitted on behalf of the 29 Uzbeks. The government of 
Kazakhstan subsequently challenged the admissibility of 
this complaint. In May 2011, the Committee reaffirmed the 
interim measures, prohibiting Kazakhstan from extraditing 
these individuals, pending the Committee&#8216;s review. 
 
It is alleged that the 28 forcibly returned men were for the 
most part held incommunicado in different detention 
facilities in Uzbekistan. By September 2011, reports 
emerged that at least 12 of the men have gone on trial in 
Uzbekistan on charges of terrorism and membership of 
banned extremist organizations. </p>

- With respect to cessation grounds, the

<p>investigation on the legality of the arrest, 
including arrest without court authorization. 
According to the normative decree, the 
person has to be transferred immediately or 
within 3 hours after the factual arrest to the 
investigative body or interrogative officer to 
decide upon procedural apprehension. The 
exact time of the factual arrest has to be 
precisely reflected in the protocol. Non-
compliance with these normative conditions 
will constitute criminal responsibility.  
- With a view of ensuring judicial 
supervision over the due process, the Office 
of the Prosecutor General adopted 
instructions on the examination of 
complaints on torture and ill-treatment of 
persons in detention and their future 
prevention.  
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Although 
under article 68 of the Criminal Procedure 
Code detainees are entitled to inform their 
relatives &#8213;immediately&#8214; about their 
</p>
<p>detention and location. It is questionable 
whether this rule is an effective protective 
measure against torture. Under the Criminal 
Procedure Code, the police officer who 
arrests the suspect is not obliged to grant the 
suspect access to a phone immediately after 
the arrest.  It is also not clear if the term 
&#8213;immediately&#8214; refers to the situation before 
</p>
<p>the suspect is delivered to the police station 
or after. This means that detainees may not 
be able to inform their relatives before they 
are delivered to the police station. The 
provision regarding the right of the suspect 
to inform his relatives immediately is in 
conflict with the provisions of Article 138, </p>

cases within 72 hours. It is upon police&#8216;s

(maximum 48 hours). 
</p>
<p>Legal limit for police custody is 72 hours,

if a person is transferred back and forth

<p>particular, &#8213;State lawyers&#8214; are widely

Action by the Government of the Republic 
of Kazakhstan for 2009-2012 to implement 
the recommendations made by the CAT). 
The normative decree of the Supreme Court 
of 28 December 2009 provides for non-
admissibility of evidence obtained by 
torture or other forms of ill-treatment. Any 
petition alleging use of torture and ill-
treatment made in the course of the judicial 
examination is subject to registration and 
criminal investigation.

to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the 
confession was not obtained under any kind 
of duress, and consider video and audiotaping 
interrogations.

<p>Burden of proof is with the detained person 
that alleges that he/she has been tortured/ill-
treated.<b>  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Video and audio taping of 
interrogations are foreseen in Article 219 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure. A directive 
on ensuring participation in the verification 
of allegations and criminal investigation of 
torture and other illegal methods of inquiry 
and investigation was approved on 1 
February 2010 by the Prosecutor General, 
according to which a court authorizes an 
arrest and when the main proceedings are 
conducted, the prosecution is required to 
establish whether torture or other forms of 
ill-treatment were used during the

<p>confessions. First, the person may be 
tortured and interrogated off the record 
before his meeting with a lawyer. Second, 
the suspect may be forced to waive his right

lawyer is mandatory. Third, Kazakh 
authorities can use so-called &#8213;pocket&#8214;

Confessions obtained in such circumstances

noted, however, that the recent Regulatory 
Resolution of the Supreme Court of the RK 
No. 7 of 28 December 2009 states that &#8213;if 
</p>
<p>the defendant during court hearings claims 
that he gave his statement under physical or 
psychological violence  of the law 
enforcement agencies, he was not informed 
of his right to invite counsel and not to give 
self-incriminatory statements, and his 
interrogation was conducted without 
participation of counsel, the challenged 
statement should be considered as 
inadmissible evidence.&#8214; This is a positive 
</p>
<p>legal rule that should be adopted in the 
Criminal Procedure Code. Moreover, the 
wording of the Code should be more 
explicit and binding by automatically

pre-trial stages of a criminal case in the 
absence of defence counsel, including

<p><b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government</b>: According to the decision of 
the Coordinating Committee of law 
enforcement bodies, the consideration of 
transferring investigation isolators from the 
National Security Committee to the 
Ministry of Justice is postponed to 
subsequent consideration by the 
Coordinating Committee. The postponement 
was due to the need of financial revision 
related to the transfer, including the revision 
of allocated expenses, the registration and 
inventory of technical conditions of 
isolators, the remuneration of the personnel 
and their qualifications. 
</p>
<p>reportedly been confirmed by members of the Public 
Monitoring Commissions in July 2010 and again in June 
</p><p>2011. Access to NSS pre-trial detention centres and 
temporary detention centres under the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs had in the past been denied to independent 
monitors as a general rule and when given had been 
problematic, as opposed to access to places of detention 
under the Ministry of Justice, which had been much more 
routine. However, access to NSS and Ministry of Internal 
Affairs places of detention have reportedly still needed to 
be negotiated on a case by case basis and have depended on 
relations at a local level between members of the Public 
Commissions and heads of regional and local law 
enforcement offices. 
 
It is reported that in July 2011, the President signed a 
decree authorising the transfer of the prison system back to 
the authority of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, thereby 
defeating years of reform efforts by the Ministry of Justice, 
domestic and international penal reform and human rights 
organizations. This decree was not publicly discussed and 
in fact was only disclosed in August, well over a week after 
its entry into force.

<p>(c) Design the system of execution of 
punishment in a way that truly aims at 
rehabilitating and reintegrating offenders, in 
particular by abolishing restrictive prison 
rules and regimes, including for persons 
sentenced to long prison terms, and 
maximizing contact with the outside world.

<p>The legal framework and penitentiary

<p><b>Government</b>: The concept of the Legal 
Policy of the Republic of Kazakhstan for 
2010-2020, approved by Decree of the 
President in August 2009, aims at 
minimizing citizens' contact with the 
criminal justice system and to use criminal 
sanctions more sparingly. 
- A draft law was prepared on amendments 
and additions to certain legislative 
provisions on probation, including  
establishing a probation service. The draft 
law considers broadening alternatives of the 
execution of punishment by introducing 
fines, community services and restriction of 
freedom of movement; regulating the 
exemption order from the criminal liability 
in cases of reconciliation of parties, when 
public damage is caused and when the pre-
trial custodial measures are established for 
economic-related crimes of small or average 
gravity, as well as in cases when the caused 
damage is voluntarily compensated. 
- In 2010, a request was made to consider 
expanding conditions for the execution of 
non-custodial punishment by adding 1,183 
new posts to the staffing of the Inspectorate

reorganization of the Committee on the 
State institutions of the criminal-
correctional system of the Ministry of 
Justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan&#8214; was

</b></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Ministry of Justice 
established a working group to develop the 
concept and the relevant bill, with the 
participation of non-governmental and 
international organizations. At the end of 
August 2010, the Ministry of Justice 
announced that it will submit a bill on 
torture prevention to the Government in the 
next couple of months. The content of this 
bill is not public.  
- The government is working on two closely 
connected pieces of legislation: on the 
implementation of the National Preventive 
Mechanism (NPM), and on the 
Ombudsman. The Government aims to 
adopt its NPM legislation by the end of 
2010, however, the coordination and 
harmonisation of the two legislations, as 
well as the development of an appropriate 
timetable for their respective adoptions 
remains to be addressed.

<p>Commissioner for human rights, as a 
member of the NPM &#8213;Ombudsman +&#8214;

Republic Commission on human rights 
requesting financial allocations for the 
establishment of the NPM. 
</p>
<p>(f) Ensure that medical staff in places of 
detention are truly independent from the 
organs of justice administration, that is by 
transferring them from the Ministry of Justice 
to the Ministry of Health. 
</p>
<p>Medical personnel employed by the 
Ministry of Interior and the penitentiary 
administration lack the independence to take 
action against colleagues with whom they 
work on a daily basis. An examination by 
these staff members can therefore not be 
considered independent; consequently, it 
needs to be done by an outside medical 
expert.<b>  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The medical examination of 
detainees is carried out by the Ministry of 
Health experts. The Government does not 
see any need for establishing an independent 
service.  
The national legislation provides a 
possibility of inviting accredited 
independent experts in conflicting 
situations. Currently, there are 20 
independent expert organizations registered 
in the National Association of Medics. 
According to the Presidential order No 1039 
of 17 August 2010, all functions and power 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs related to 
the activities of medical sobriety facilities, 
except for the function of handing over 
offenders of public order to the medical 
sobriety facilities, are transferred to the 
Ministry of Health.

<p>violence in full compliance with international 
standards. The law should not focus on 
prosecution, but also foresee preventive 
measures; provide for ex officio 
investigations of alleged acts of domestic 
violence and ensure adequate funding for the 
infrastructure to support victims of domestic 
violence and trafficking; and create a national 
database on violence against women. 
</p>
<p>provide for crimes under which acts of 
violence against women, including domestic 
violence, can be prosecuted. Too few efforts 
have been undertaken to facilitate access to 
justice for victims. A draft law on 
combating domestic violence was scheduled 
for adoption in 2009, which however 
appears to be focused on the prosecution of 
acts of domestic violence and neglects 
prevention and protection of the victims. It 
foresees no infrastructure to temporarily 
house and support victims of domestic 
violence. The draft law requires that any 
prosecution must be based on the complaint 
of an individual, which could lead to 
increased pressure being applied to the 
complainant if the culprit tries to make her 
withdraw the complaint.<b>  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> A law on the prevention of 
domestic violence and a law on amendments 
and additions to certain legislative acts on 
the prevention of domestic violence were 
adopted on 4 December 2009.  
- Respective amendments were made to the 
Criminal Procedural Code and Code of 
Administrative Offences.  
- The law on the prevention of domestic 
violence establishes a legal and institutional 
framework of activities of state bodies, 
entities and citizens to prevent domestic 
violence and provides for the establishment 
of a mechanism to prevent and suppress 
offences in the area of family and domestic 
relations.

received by some 20 non-governmental 
crisis centres, 6165 were related to physical 
violence, 5539 were related to psychological 
violence, and 556 were related to sexual and 
other forms of violence.  
- A comprehensive awareness raising 
campaign on the prevention of domestic 
violence is carried out throughout the 
country.  
Since 1999, special divisions on the issues 
of protection of women from domestic 
violence were established in all regional 
branches of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. 
- As a result of measures undertaken, the 
number of offences related to domestic 
violence has decreased from 954 in 2008 to 
887 in 2009.

obligation to protect children from physical 
and/or mental violence, cruel, rough or 
humiliating treatment, sexual abuse and so 
on. No effective mechanism for combating 
violence against children seems to be in 
place.  
 
<b>Government:</b> The Code of Administrative

Republic of Kazakhstan provide for 
criminal liability for mistreatment of 
children, including for not fulfilling

<p>subjecting them to ill-treatment and torture. 
In 2009, 35 criminal cases were initiated on 
cruel and inhuman treatment against minors. 
- In accordance with the Presidential order 
of 17 August 2010, temporary isolators, 
centres for adaptation and rehabilitation of 
minors are transferred from the Ministry of 
Interior to the Ministry of Education.  
- Government started developing a network 
of services for family support. Due to 
measures undertaken, the number of 
children in foster-care organizations for 
child-orphans and children left without 
parental care has decreased by 892 children 
(from 16008 children in 2008, to 15116 in 
2009), and the number of neglected and 
homeless children to 1141 since 2007.

and establish a juvenile justice system that 
puts the best interests of the child at its core, 
and abolish the use of temporary isolators for 
minors. 
</p>
<p>- Criminal responsibility for serious crimes 
is applicable as of 14 years of age; for other 
crimes, as of 16. 
- A &#8213;juvenile justice system development

</p>
<p>foresees the creation, in the period 2009&#8211;

for supervising non-custodial sentences, 
better coordination mechanisms and the 
integration of socio-psychological services 
into the juvenile justice system.  
- Centres for temporary isolation, adaptation

<b>Government:</b> Jointly with the United 
Nations Children&#8216;s Fund (UNICEF), work is

<p>underway to further develop the juvenile 
justice system. Two specialized courts have 
already been set up in Astana and in 
Almaty, and are operational. The aim is to 
extend the network of specialised juvenile 
courts to the provinces.  
- A draft Bill proposes broadening the basis 
of the use of non-custodial measures 
towards minors by not using deprivation of 
liberty towards first offender minors who 
committed crime of minor gravity. Under 
the Criminal Code, deprivation of liberty 
does not apply to first offender minors who 
committed crime of minor gravity and first 
offender minors aged between 14 and 16 
who committed crime of average gravity.  
- There are no temporary isolators for 
minors in the Republic of Kazakhstan.  
-There are 18 centres for temporary 
isolation, adaption and rehabilitation for 
temporary holding, adaptation and 
rehabilitation of minors aged between 3 and 
18.

juvenile prisoners who show signs of

- The &#8215;Juvenile Justice System Development 
Concept&#8216; establishes the basic framework 
</p>
<p>for the future juvenile justice system. The 
time frame for the creation of this system is 
2009&#8211;2011. 
- The caseload of the recently established 
juvenile courts is low and the courtrooms 
are new or newly refurbished. The fees paid 
to attorneys who represent juveniles from 
poor economic sectors are low, which has 
an adverse impact on the quality of services 
provided. The &#8215;Concept&#8216; calls for the

<p>establishment of specialized legal offices or 
services for children throughout the country, 
but at present only one such office exists 
and there is some uncertainty regarding the 
willingness of the central Government to 
commit the resources necessary to establish 
similar offices nationwide. 
The resources allocated to the existing 
juvenile justice institutions are generally 
sufficient, but the creation of a juvenile 
justice system along the lines set forth in the 
&#8215;Concept&#8216; will require the allocation of 
</p>
<p>additional funds to establish new services, 
to replicate existing ones throughout the

medical expert evaluation is allowed 
pursuant to a court decision or on the basis

vulnerable persons. The number of cases of 
tuberculosis has decreased from 767 in 2008 
to 643.9 in 2009. The number of registered 
cases of death was 475 in 2008, 452 in 2009 
and 333 for the past 8 months in 2010.

<p>(b) Initiate harm-reduction programmes for 
drug users deprived of their liberty, including 
by providing substitution medication to 
persons and allowing needle exchange 
programmes in detention. 
</p>
<p>No needle exchange programme and drug 
substitution therapies are available in places 
of detention.<b>  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> A meeting of the Inter-
ministerial Working Group on the 
implementation of harm reduction 
programmes was planed for the first quarter 
of 2010. 
- Since 2008, pilot projects on realizing 
substitute therapy have been carried out 
among the population of city Pavlodar and 
Temirtau.  
- Introduction of programmes on exchange 
of single-use needles in correctional 
facilities and investigation isolators has not 
been possible.  
- HIV-positive detainees and detainees 
diagnosed with AIDS are provided with 
special therapy. 154 HIV-positive patients 
are receiving specialized treatment in the 
facilities of the Penal Enforcement System. 
Their medical treatment is provided by 
regional AIDS centres; expenses of their 
medical care are covered by the Global

<p><b>Mongolia 
</b></p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of 
</b></p>
<p><b>his visit to Mongolia in June 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.4, para. 55) 
</b></p>
<p>71. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Mongolia requesting information 
and comments on the measures taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets 
that the Government has not provided any information in that regard. He looks forward to receiving information on Mongolia&#8216;s 
efforts to implement the recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-
treatment.  
</p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the definition of torture does not fully comply with the definition in article 1 of the 
Convention against Torture and calls upon the Government to ensure that torture is defined as a crime and is punishable in a manner 
proportionate to the gravity of the crime.45  
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to amend the criminal legislation to ensure that the period for holding 
detainees in police custody does not exceed 48 hours, and that no detainee should be subject to unsupervised contact with the 
investigator. 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received any update in relation to the supervision of investigations of allegations 
of torture and other ill-treatment by the Office of the Prosecutor and the National Human Rights Commission of Mongolia 
(NHRCM). He calls upon the Government to take measures to expedite prompt, impartial and thorough investigations into all 
allegations of human rights violations committed during the State of Emergency of July 2008, launch timely public prosecutions 
and conclude them without delay, where the evidence warrants it. He calls upon the Government to recognize the competence of the 
CAT to receive and consider individual communications. 
</p>
<p>75. While acknowledging the efforts of the NHRCM in conducting visits to places of detention, the Special Rapporteur reiterates 
the need to strengthen the functioning and independence of monitoring mechanisms. In this connection, he welcomes the 
establishment of a Working Group on the ratification of the OPCAT, and urges the Government to ratify the OPCAT and establish a 
National Preventive Mechanism.  
</p>
<p>76. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to receiving information in relation to the treatment of death row prisoners in 
accordance with the Standard Minimum Rules on Treatment of Prisoners. 46 He welcomes the declaration by the President on 14 
January 2010, of a moratorium on the death penalty, since in his experience capital punishment is almost always applied in manners 
to involve cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or event torture. 
</p>
<p>  
 45 Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, approved by the Economic and Social Council by resolutions 663 C (XXIV) of 31 July 
</p>
<p>1957 and 2076 (LXII) of 13 May 1977.

</i></p>
<p>(a) Highest authorities 
declare that impunity must 
end. 
</p>
<p>Impunity existed because 
of a lack of a definition of 
torture as defined in the 
CAT, a lack of awareness 
of international standards, 
and no effective 
mechanism for receiving 
and investigating 
allegations.  
</p>
<p>There had not been any 
effective investigations 
by the procuracy, nor had 
any law enforcement 
officials been convicted 
for torture related 
offences. 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Since 2007, of 744 torture-
related cases, 14 were investigated, of which 10 
cases were acquitted and 1 suspended by the 
Prosecutor&#8216;s office. Of the 3 cases brought to 
court, 2 were acquitted and one convicted.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The culture of 
impunity persists.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(b) Criminalisation of 
torture be in accordance 
with CAT. 
</p>
<p>Legislation did not 
include essential 
elements; torture was not 
defined in accordance 
with article 1 of the 
Convention.  
</p>
<p>The main provision in the 
Criminal Code referring 
to torture, article 100.1, 
carried a relatively lenient 
penalty of up to two 
years' imprisonment. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> All actions and activities 
concerning torture are prohibited in the 
Mongolian constitution and other legislation. 
Article 16.13 of the Constitution and 10.4 of 
the Code of Criminal Procedure include the 
prohibition: &#8213;No person shall be subjected to 
torture or to inhumane, cruel or degrading 
treatment.&#8214; Amendments to the Civil Code in 
February 2008 included the word &#8213;torture&#8214; and 
included a new article whereby a crime 
resulting in the death of a victim shall be 
punishable by a prison term of 10-15 years. 
Amendments to the Criminal Code at the same 
time included more detailed provisions on the 
crime of torture.   
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Article 251 was 
amended in 2008 to include the word 
&#8213;imposing torture&#8214; and the punishment was 
increased. However, the article only applies to 
investigators and inspectors, not all public 
officials or persons acting in an official

<p>capacity, as required by CAT. It also does not 
include provisions on the attempt to commit 
torture or complicity or participation in torture. 
Moreover, the Criminal Procedure Code does 
not ensure that any statement which is 
established to have been made as a result of 
torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any 
proceedings, except against a person accused of 
torture as evidence that the statement was 
made, as required by the CAT. 
</p>
<p>There is concern that the draft Assorted 
Criminal Code of Mongolia currently under 
consideration does not include safeguards 
against impunity for human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>Torture is not expressly defined as a crime in 
the draft Code in accordance with CAT. The 
draft code would also prohibit investigations 
and prosecutions of crimes under international 
law including torture which occurred before the 
enactment of the Code.  
</p>
<p>(c) Detention for up to 48 
hours under the control of 
interrogators or 
investigators; transfer to a 
pre -trial facility under a 
different authority. 
</p>
<p>Authorities responsible 
for detention and 
interrogation are under 
the jurisdiction of the 
same Ministry and 
supervise the same 
facilities. 
</p>
<p>Detention centres often 
accommodate a police 
lock-up, a pre-trial 
facility and a prison. 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: No relevant amendments were 
made to the Criminal Code or Criminal 
Procedure Code. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(d) Custody registers be 
scrupulously maintained. 
</p>
<p> <b>Government:</b> In accordance with the revisions 
of the &#8213;by-law of arrest and detention centre&#8214; 
of April 2007, detained persons shall be 
routinely received at arrest and detention 
centres in the presence of a police officer that 
took them there, and a medical examination

and detention centres shall be carried out only 
with the authorization of a prosecutor.  
</p>
<p>According to Articles 58 and 59 of the Code of 
Criminal Procedure, a person detained with an 
arrest order shall be received at the arrest and 
detention centre in the presence of a police 
officer and released by order of the chief of the 
centre by the end of the arrest term, in the 
absence of a judge&#8216;s order regarding continued 
detention. In 2007, 3,268 suspects were 
received in arrest and detention centres and 
2,075 persons were released. In 2008, 3,487 
suspects were received in arrest and detention 
centres and 1,478 persons were released in 
accordance with the relevant legislation. A 
control prosecutor exercises supervision of 
these activities.   
</p>
<p>(e) Inadmissibility of 
confessions as evidence 
without the presence of a 
lawyer. 
</p>
<p>Art. 79.4 CPC, but not 
implemented in practice. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Government is working on 
providing all detained persons with a right to 
advocacy according to the Code of Criminal 
Procedure. If an investigation is conducted 
without the presence of a lawyer, it will not be 
considered as evidence in court proceedings.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Some detainees 
were tortured and told that if they signed a 
written confession and there was no evidence 
to support it, they would be proven innocent. 
However, these confessions were later used as 
evidence in court to convict them. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(f) Judges and prosecutors 
should ask persons how 
they have were treated and 
order independent medical 
examinations. 
</p>
<p> <b>Government</b>: In case of any doubt over the 
testimony of the suspect, witnesses, etc., the 
prosecutor shall initiate an investigation to 
discover the facts of the case. No cases against 
public officials regarding torture or ill-
treatment were initiated ex officio by judges or 
prosecutors.

</p>
<p>(g) Prompt and thorough 
investigations by 
independent authority. 
</p>
<p>Investigations could not 
be carried out ex officio. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Since 2002, the State General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office has supervised the 
investigation of allegations of torture or cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment by police and 
prosecution authority employees, according to 
Article 27.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. 
Mongolian citizens are entitled to file petitions 
and claims to this authority and to the 
NHRCM. In 2007, seven criminal cases of 
forced testimony using means such as beatings 
and pressure were initiated and tried by the 
Criminal investigation service of the State 
General Prosecutor&#8216;s Office. In 2008, only four 
criminal cases were initiated and tried. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : A number of 
complaints addressed to the National Human 
Rights Commission of Mongolia (NHRCM) 
and the Office of the Prosecution were 
reportedly dismissed for lack of evidence, 
apparently without an investigation being 
carried out. The Special Investigation Unit, 
which investigates cases involving officials 
such as prosecutors, judges and law 
enforcement officers still lacks capacity and 
staff with sufficient experience, and has been 
subject to intimidation by police officers.

<p>Through the revision of the CPC adopted on 9

provision that provides for compensation for 
torture, the Government states that it shall be 
responsible for the &#8213;removal of detriments&#8214; 
caused by illegal treatment by investigators, 
prosecutors and judges during criminal 
procedures, in accordance with the State 
Supreme Court and Articles 388-397 of the 
Code of Criminal Procedure. Payments of 
around 500 million tugrug have been made to 
over 20 citizens and organizations, and 3.4 
billion tugrug has been set aside in the 2009 
budget for this purpose.  
</p>

<p>Article 53 provides for 
the possibility of persons 
originally sentenced to 
death to have their

upon presidential pardon. 
</p>
<p>State Hural has committed to decrease the 
types of cases that can receive the death 
sentence, and to abolish it in future. A working 
group has been created to conduct research on 
the issue. The Government has stated that the 
death penalty is not a permanent measure, but 
rather a temporary response to the criminal 
situation in Mongolia. No statistical data on the 
number of death sentences carried out is 
available, pursuant to Article 1(55) of the law 
on Approving State Secret&#8216;s list.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : The Assorted 
Criminal Code of Mongolia currently under

<p><b>Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of 
</b></p>
<p><b>his visit to Nepal in September 2005 (E/CN.4/2006/6/Add.5, paras. 33-35) 
</b></p>
<p>77. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Nepal requesting information and 
comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations made after his predecessor&#8216;s 
fact-finding mission in 2005. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided a response to his request. He 
looks forward to receiving information on Nepal&#8216;s efforts to follow-up to the recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to 
assist in efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the inclusion of a definition of torture in the draft Penal Code and the corresponding 
Sentencing Bill submitted to the Parliamentary secretariat in late January 2011, and expresses hope that the draft bill will be made 
public. He calls upon the Government to speed up the Parliamentary hearings on the adoption of the draft Penal Code to ensure that 
torture is defined as a criminal offence punishable in a manner proportionate to the gravity of the crime and that the statute of 
limitations for the crime of torture is abolished. The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the Government to ensure that no 
person convicted for the crime of torture will be entitled to benefit from an act of amnesty.  
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur observes that the draft bills for the establishment of the truth and reconciliation commission and the 
disappearances commission have been pending before the Legislative Committee of the Parliament since early 2011. He calls on the 
Government to expedite without delay the establishment of these commissions.  
</p>
<p>80. The Special Rapporteur echoes the concern expressed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights over the 
appointment of a Cabinet Minister alleged to have been involved in a case of disappearance.47 The Special Rapporteur regrets that 
no action has been taken to date on the 2008 recommendation by the National Human Rights Commission calling on the 
Government to investigate the case and prosecute the alleged perpetrators. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his previous 
recommendation to ensure that any public official indicted for abuse or torture, be immediately suspended from duty pending trial, 
and prosecution. He urges the Government to declare unambiguously that the culture of impunity must end and that torture and ill-
treatment by public officials will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted.    
</p>
<p>81. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Supreme Court&#8216;s decision of 22 September 2011, ordering the Government to review 
the laws granting quasi-judicial power to Chief District Officers within six months. He remains concerned that the disciplinary 
sanctions and lenient penalties imposed on public officials for their alleged involvement in torture and ill-treatment contribute to the 
culture of impunity. He regrets that the Nepal Police Human Rights Unit and the Attorney General&#8216;s Department, both set up to 
investigate the allegations of torture, lack independence. The Special Rapporteur observes that the NHRC entrusted with

<p>investigating torture allegations and monitoring places of detention, may have not been in a position to carry out systematic visits 
and give priority to the investigation of torture allegations. He encourages the Government to strengthen the NHRC&#8216;s capacity as 
the agency entrusted with investigating torture allegations and monitoring places of detention. 
</p>
<p>82. The Special Rapporteur received reports regarding holding detainees for prolonged periods and calls upon the police to better 
respect the maximum period of 24 hours, produce arrested individuals before the judicial authority, and to transfer arrested 
individuals to a pre-trial facility under a judicial authority, where no unsupervised contact with the interrogators or investigators 
should be permitted. 
</p>
<p>83. The Special Rapporteur calls on the Government to ensure timely access to independent medical examination at all stages of 
the criminal process, in particular when the suspect is placed in a temporary police detention facility, when taken out for any 
investigative activity, and upon return; and ensure that access to lawyers of the suspect&#8216;s own choosing is granted from the very 
moment of apprehension. 
</p>
<p>84. The Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the appeal to the Government to become Party to the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture (OPCAT) and designate a national preventive mechanism. </p>

<p>a) Highest authorities, 
particularly those responsible 
for law enforcement 
activities, declare 
unambiguously that the 
culture of impunity must end 
and that torture and ill 
treatment by public officials 
will not be tolerated and will 
be prosecuted. 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur was 
repeatedly told by senior 
police and military 
officials that torture was 
acceptable in some 
situations. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> In 2007 the Interim Constitution 
prohibiting torture was adopted. However, torture 
was not criminalized in domestic laws. 
In August 2008, the &#8213;Common Minimum 
</p>
<p>Programme&#8214; (CMP) was agreed. The 50-point 
programme - among other commitments - states that 
the culture of impunity shall end through 
consolidating law and order. To render the 
administration and security organs independent and 
accountable, a Code of Conduct shall be developed 
for the peoples&#8216; realization of security. On several 
</p>
<p>occasions, the Home Minister has made statements 
in which he has promised to address the lack of 
public security and absence of the rule of law, and 
encouraged the police to restore law and order at the 
earliest opportunity. On 7 September 2008, he gave 
15 instructions to the Inspector General of Police to 
do so. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  officials continue to 
make pubic commitments that impunity must end. 
For instance, in his statement to the GA on 26 Sep. 
08, then PM &quot;Prachanda&quot; stated that, as a 
democracy, Nepal is fully committed to protect and 
promote the human rights of its people under all 
circumstances with constitutional and legal 
guarantees and implementation of the international 
human rights instruments to which Nepal is a party. 
However, the climate of impunity remains firmly 
entrenched, evidenced by actions such as the 
withdrawal of criminal charges in 349 cases and the 
lack of progress in police investigations into past 
human rights violations.  
 
<b>Government:</b> The draft bill on Witness Protection 
is almost finalised. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Despite 
the general statements pledging its 
commitment to the rule of law, good 
governance and human rights, during 
the UPR in 2011, it is reported that 
there has been no clear statement 
affirming the Government&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>commitment to prosecute acts of 
torture. Reportedly, torture is still not 
defined as a crime in law and impunity 
remains widespread and systematic.   
 
During the UPR review in January 
2011, the Government promised to 
address impunity.  
 
Reportedly, instead of investigating 
and prosecuting those responsible for 
grave human rights violations, 
consecutive governments have 
withdrawn cases pending in the courts 
and tried to grant blanket amnesties. It 
is reported that the new coalition 
Government of the Maoists and 
regional parties from the southern 
Terai region which came to power in 
late August 2011, formally agreed to 
withdraw criminal cases against 
individuals affiliated with the Maoist 
party, the Madhesi, Janajati, Tharuhat, 
Dalit, and Pichadabarga movements, 
and to declare a general amnesty in 
cases which could include serious 
crimes and human rights abuses.   
 
Reportedly, to date, not a single </p>

</i></p>
<p><i>Information received in the reporting

<p><i>period  
</i></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : The widespread 
impunity is partly due to the fact that under the law, 
Chief District Officers (CDOs) enjoy quasi-judicial 
power.  
- The Armed Police Force and the Forestry 
Department is reportedly involved in illegal arrests, 
detention and torture of detainees. 
- On 6 April 2010, a non-governmental organization 
filed a petition (Writ No W0043) of Public Interest 
Litigation to challenge the quasi-judicial power of 
Chief District Officers (CDOs), arguing that a 
number of laws granting quasi-judicial powers to 
CDOs&#8216; were in breach of article 14 of the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR). The Case is sub judice before the 
Supreme Court.  
- The Police Act provides for disciplinary actions 
and lenient penalties for police officers involved in 
torture. 
- According to the data gathered for the period of 
2006-September 2010, there has been a steady 
decline of around 15 per cent in the alleged cases of 
tortures of detainees, from around 30 per cent in 
2006 to around 15.7 per cent in 2010, though there 
is a worrying increase over the period from April to 
June 2010. 
- In some districts and in relation to some categories 
of detainees, the percentages are much higher. It has 
been observed that detainees belonging to certain 
minority ethnic groups and lower castes face a 
significantly higher risk of torture than detainees 
from high castes. It is further consistently reported 
that juveniles face a higher risk of torture. Custodial 
torture is reported largely in the southern part of 
Nepal where the armed groups are active. 
</p>
<p>person alleged to have committed 
serious human rights violations during 
the conflict has been brought to justice 
in a civilian court. 
 
It is reported that the Government has 
reportedly failed to implement the 
views of the UN Human Rights 
Committee in the two cases in which it 
has been held to have violated its 
obligations in relation to the 
prohibition of torture and victims&#8216; 
</p>
<p>right to a remedy under the Covenant 
on Civil and Political Rights (Sharma 
v Nepal (2008) and Giri v Nepal 
(2011)). 
 
- Reportedly, after 8 postponements of 
the final hearing in Writ No W0043 
challenging the quasi-judicial power 
of Chief District Officers (CDOs), the 
Supreme Court on 22 September 2011 
ordered the Government to review the 
quasi-judicial powers vested in Chief 
District Officers and other 
administrative officers within six 
months.  
 
- Disciplinary actions taken by police 
remain rare and disciplinary 
punishments that are imposed are 
reportedly inadequate. 
 
- It is reported that during the period 
of July-December 2010, there has 
been an apparent reversal in the trend </p>

<p>of gradual decline in reported torture 
in the 57 places of detention in 20 
districts. Reported torture declined 
from around 50% in 2001 &#8211; 2002 to 
around 20% in 2009 &#8211; 2010. 
Reportedly, the percentage of torture 
in detention from January to June 
2010 was 15.8%. This increased to 
22.5% between July and December 
</p><p>2010. A further increase to 25% was 
recorded from January to June 2011. 
 
- It is alleged that people of Terai 
origin continue to be found to be more 
likely to be tortured than hill 
community people.  
 
- Reportedly, juveniles continue to 
face a higher risk of torture. The 
percentage of torture recorded during 
January to June 2011, is 32.8%, an 
increase of 6.1 % compared to July to 
December 2010. 
</p>

defined as a matter of 
priority in accordance with 
article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture, with 
penalties commensurate with 
the gravity of torture. 
</p>
<p>Torture prohibited in 
Article 14(4) of 
Constitution (1990). 
However, torture was not 
criminalized in domestic 
legislation.

<p><b>Government</b>: In 2007 the Inter-ministerial 
consultations on the draft torture bill were 
underway. The Interim Constitution of January 2007 
Art. 26 stipulates: &#8213;(1) No person who is detained

<p>during investigation or for enquiry or for trial or for 
any other reason shall be subjected to physical or 
mental torture, nor any cruel, inhuman or degrading 
treatment. (2) Actions pursuant to clause (1) shall be

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources: 
</i></b></p>
<p>Reportedly, although the Interim 
Constitution of 2007 states that any act 
of torture shall be punishable by law, 
there is not yet any legal provision that 
declares torture to be a crime in Nepal.  
Reportedly, a draft Penal Code, 
Criminal Procedure Code and 
Sentencing Bill were submitted to the 
parliamentary secretariat in late 
January 2011. However they have yet 
to be circulated among the members of 
parliament. The submission to the

torture bill has not been transparent, which has 
caused frustration for national and international 
organizations interested in supporting the 
criminalization process.  
A draft bill which would set the framework for the 
establishment of a truth and reconciliation 
commission defines mental and physical torture as a 
serious human rights violation, and has a provision 
prohibiting amnesty for acts of torture or degrading 
treatment. The bill has been the subject of public 
consultations conducted by the Ministry of Peace 
and Reconstruction (with the support of OHCHR), 
but has yet to be presented before Parliament. 
Despite revisions to the Army Act in 2006, there has 
yet to be a successful criminal prosecution of Nepal 
Army personnel involved in conflict-related torture.  
The Nepal Army continues to maintain that the 
previous Army Act, in effect during the conflict, 
prevents them from cooperating fully with police 
investigations into allegations of torture by its 
personnel during the conflict. 
The only legislation to redress torture survivors is 
the &#8215;Torture Compensation Act 1996&#8216; of Nepal, 
</p>
<p>which deals only with the compensation of torture. 
</p>
<p>consultation process. Partly as a result 
of these consultations, a definition of 
torture was included into the draft 
Penal Code. 
 
Reportedly, no draft bill to criminalize 
torture has been made public.  
 
 
- The draft bills for the establishment 
of the truth and reconciliation 
commission (TRC) and the 
disappearances commission were 
tabled in parliament, but have been 
pending before the Legislative 
Committee since early 2011. The 
Maoist Party's Commitments and 
Proposal to Government, &#8213;Peace 
Process and Constitution&#8214; of 25 
August 2011, promised to establish the 
TRC and Disappearances Commission 
within one month. 
 
- The Torture Compensation Act 1996 
remains in force. Its functioning is 
reportedly highly problematic. 
 
Since no centralised documentation of 
cases filed under the TCA exists, it is 
difficult to make a comprehensive 
assessment of these cases. Reportedly 
an analysis of cases filed since 2003 
reveals considerable information about 
the Act, particularly in terms of 
judicial decisions reached.  
Reportedly, 98 cases were filed on 
behalf of victims under the TCA from 
2003 till June 2011. Of these 98 cases, </p>

<p>It does not allow for criminal prosecution of the

treatment, and contains a limitation clause of 35 
days. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2008</i></b> : Art. 26(1) of the 
Interim Constitution requires the Government to 
criminalize torture, although the provision has not 
been included in the legislation. The Government 
has repeatedly stated that it is drafting a bill, but no 
progress has been reported. Despite repeated 
requests, no details of the draft have been made 
available to the public.  
The CMP provides for the appointment of a high-
level security committee to develop a national 
security policy and, based on the agreement of 23 
Dec. 07 signed with the 7 party alliance (SPA), the 
creation of a National Peace and Rehabilitation 
Commission, a High Level Truth and Reconciliation 
Commission (TRC), a High Level Commission for 
State Restructuring, a Commission on 
Disappearances, and a Land Reforms Commission. 
Beyond the reference to the appointment of a TRC 
and a Commission on Disappearances, the CMP 
remained silent in relation to accountability for past 
human rights abuses. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The practice of 
impunity in relation to torture and ill-treatment has 
exacerbated due to the fact that torture is not defined 
as a crime and no criminal charges can be brought 
against the perpetrators.  
- Although article 20 of the Interim Constitution of 
January 2007 requires criminalization of torture, no 
such actions have been undertaken.  
- Article 164 of the draft Penal Code, recently 
</p>
<p>39 (39.7%) were dismissed at final 
hearing; 27 (27.5%) were granted 
compensation; six (6.1%) were 
withdrawn by the plaintiff; 9 (9.1%) 
were dismissed during earlier stages of 
the case, on the basis of, for instance, 
shortcomings in evidence and 17 
(17.3%) remain pending in the courts. 
Around one fourth of cases filed 
resulted in compensation being 
granted, and in 11 cases (11.22%) the 
courts ordered for departmental action 
against perpetrators.  In two cases, the 
court ordered the department to give 
advice to the perpetrators involved in 
torture, a directive short of 
disciplinary action.  This reportedly 
demonstrates the extent to which the 
TCA can be seen to perpetuate cycles 
of impunity and deny judicial remedy 
to the majority of victims. 
 
Torture has still not been defined as a 
crime. 
 
- The draft Penal Code now provides 
for five years&#8216; imprisonment as the 
maximum penalty for torture. 
- Reportedly, the draft provision 
introduces a limitation period for 
filing claims of 6 months from the day 
of incident or from the release of 
victim from detention. </p>

<p>A large number of persons 
taken involuntarily by 
security forces were being 
held incommunicado at 
unknown locations.

<p><b>Government:</b> Art. 24 (2) of the Interim 
Constitution provides for immediate access to legal 
counsel. Section 24 (3) stipulates that detainees 
ought to be presented before a judge within 24 hours 
of their arrest. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : As per 2009, 
incommunicado detention has reappeared in the 
recent past in connection with detained individuals 
accused of belonging to armed groups. OHCHR has 
documented numerous cases of illegal detention of 
suspected members of armed groups. Police 
regularly deny that suspected armed group members 
are in police custody, and have held individuals 
incommunicado for multiple days before 
acknowledging that they are in detention or without 
granting access to organizations such as OHCHR or 
the National Human Rights Commission. Police 
continue to keep inaccurate records of detention in 
which they falsify the date of arrest. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources 2008</i></b> : Although 
incommunicado detention is less common now than 
during the conflict, unacknowledged detention and 
failure to observe court orders regarding releases, 
particularly by the Armed Police Force (APF), 
continue to occur. There are some cases of 
incommunicado detention for up to 11 days.

According to non-governmental 
sources, complaints have been 
received regarding the use of private 
residents as secret places of detention 
where people are reportedly severely 
tortured in Kathmandu. 
 
According to Nepal National Weekly, 
in a special report published on 19 
December 2010, police have 
reportedly continued to rent private 
houses to interrogate and detain 
suspects - a practice which started 
during the conflict. Several of these 
houses have reportedly been located in 
Sanepa, Lalitpur. 
 
The report further states that in the 
second house, located in Gairidhara, a 
team of plainclothes policemen 
operating under the command of 
Deputy Superintendent of Police 
(DSP) Gagat Man Shrestha have been 
detaining and interrogating suspects, 
information that was later denied by 
police spokesman Biguan Raj Sharma. 
It is alleged that the existence of these 
&#8213;safe houses&#8214; is being kept under 
wraps even among police personnel.

practice by claiming they are used to </p>

<p>information about any unacknowledged 
incommunicado detention. Police produces any 
arrested person before the judicial authority within 
24 hours excluding the time required for the 
transfer. Any person detained for more than 24 
hours can seek legal remedies from the courts.  
Non-governmental sources: Incommunicado 
detention is not illegal and many detainees are 
denied the right to meet their relatives or lawyers 
during the first few days of their arrest.  
 
</p>
<p>avoid leaks and prevent the media 
from &#8213;hampering the investigations&#8214;.  
It is alleged that suspicions of 
extortion by the police have been 
confirmed by individuals detained and 
forced to pay for their release. 
 
Reportedly, the practice of denying 
detainees access to their relatives or 
lawyers during the first few days after 
arrest remains common. Many are 
reportedly allowed visits only after 
they have been remanded into custody 
by the court. 
  
</p>
<p>d) Those legally arrested 
should not be held in 
facilities under the control of 
their interrogators or 
investigators for more than 
the time required by law to 
obtain a judicial warrant of 
pre-trial detention, which 
should not exceed 48 hours. 
After this period 
they should be transferred to 
a pre-trial facility under a 
different authority, where no 
further unsupervised contact 
with the interrogators or 
investigators should be 
permitted. 
</p>
<p>Legislation (2004 Terrorist 
and 
Disruptive Activities 
(Control and Punishment) 
Ordinance (TADO) and 
the 1989 Public Security 
Act (PSA)) effectively 
provided the police and the 
military with sweeping 
powers to detain suspects 
for preventive reasons, in 
some cases for up to 12 
months; 
(Section 15 (2) of the State 
Cases Act requires that 
arrested persons be 
produced before the 
&#8213;appropriate authority&#8214;

Interim Constitution, detainees must be presented 
before a judge within 24 hours of arrest.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Detainees in police 
custody continue to be held beyond the 24 hours 
permitted by law. A lack of accurate record keeping 
in many prisons and police detention facilities 
makes it difficult to hold police personnel 
accountable for these violations. In practice, Art. 24 
(3) is not respected.     
There are some significant gaps in constitutional 
protection, e.g. with regard to the rights of non-
citizens, to liberty and security and provisions 
permitting derogation from rights during a state of 
emergency. 
TADO 2006 &#8211; under which many detainees were 
held without charge under the previous Government 
&#8211; expired at the end of Oct. 06 and has not been 
renewed. Most detainees held under TADO were 
gradually released after April 2006. 
 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is 
reported that the practice of keeping 
detainees in police custody beyond the 
24 hours permitted by law remains 
common. 
 
During 2011, 47.6% of the detainees 
interviewed by non-governmental 
organisation described that they were 
taken before a judge after the 24 hour 
deadline had expired. Only 37.3% 
were taken to court within the required 
24 hours. (Others were released.)  
 
During this initial period, access to 
relatives and lawyers is often also 
restricted. It is during this period that 
most incidents of torture take place. </p>

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  According to the 
Police Act, the police authorities are obliged to 
maintain a standardized register. However, the 
practice of using ad-hoc registers and notebooks 
instead of standardized diaries still remains a 
problem. The police generally do not record the 
actual date of arrest and often adjust the arrest date 
in order to give the impression of compliance with 
the 24 hour limitation. 
OHCHR continues to document instances of APF 
personnel participating in the detention and 
interrogation of suspects.  
 In March 06 the Office of the Prime Minister and 
the Council of Ministers opened the Human Rights 
Central Registry, whose functions included, inter 
alia, maintaining a list of detainees throughout the 
country. National Army, Home Office, APF and NP 
staff were assigned to the office and were starting to 
develop a detention database, but by the end of 
2006, no data had been entered for the over 7,000 
detainees and prisoners officially recognized as 
being held throughout Nepal. The office never 
became fully functional and ceased to function 
shortly after the change of Government in April 06. 
Detention registers are not systematically updated; 
the police use two registers: one lists the name of 
detainees before remand and the other after remand. 
The lawyers and the public do not have access to 
registers. As the police are legally entitled to detain 
a person for 24 hours, they often do not register the

APF does not have clear legal powers to arrest and 
detain. However, it has become increasingly 
involved in arrests related to armed groups, and it 
does not operate or maintain official detention 
facilities or detention registers. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The registers and 
detention records are incomplete and often 
inaccurate, if not deliberately falsified. This shortfall 
allows for holding detainees for several days 
without charges. 
- Lawyers do not have access to police registers. 
Most commonly, the date of arrest is falsified in an 
attempt to circumvent the constitutional requirement 
to bring detainees before a court within 24 hours.  
- In cases where a detainee is released within a 
couple of hours or in the first few days after the 
arrest, records of it are not being kept. 
- In addition, access to relatives and a lawyer is 
normally granted only when detainees are brought 
before the court. 
 
<b>Government:</b> In every District Office throughout 
the country there are police officers assigned as 
&#8213;custody management officers&#8214; who are responsible 
</p>
<p>to manage custody and records of the detainees. A 
&#8213;Custody Record Form&#8214; is used to keep detainee&#8216;s 
records. 
It is mandatory for all responsible police personnel 
to carry out a physical and health check up before 
and after detention or release of any person.

<p>check-ups are conducted remains 
problematic. Interviews conducted 
with detainees by different 
organisations suggest that health 
check-ups are just a formality as 
police routinely take detainees in 
groups to see a doctor; and doctors 
simply ask the detainees whether they 
have any injuries or internal wounds, 
but fail to physically examine them. 
Check-ups at the time of release are 
often not adhered to.

effectively guaranteed the 
ability to challenge the 
lawfulness of their detention, 
e.g. through habeas corpus. 
Such procedures should

</p>
<p>The right of habeas corpus 
was denied by virtue of 
Article 14 (7) of the 
Constitution to any person 
who is arrested or detained 
by any law providing for 
preventive detention;  
Whereas safeguards were 
contained in preventive 
detention legislation and 
the right of the Supreme 
Court to issue habeas 
corpus writs with respect 
to preventive detention; the 
Special Rapporteur 
observed that these 
safeguards were not 
effective. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The June 07 decision 
of the Supreme Court has not been implemented.  
The government has, however, prepared a draft bill 
to criminalize disappearances and to set up a 
Commission of Inquiry into Enforced 
Disappearances. The current draft has been 
criticized, including by OHCHR, for being 
inconsistent with international standards in a 
number of respects.    
 
Misrepresentations by police and other state 
officials, apparently to hide detainees or cover-up 
the fact that their detention is illegal, continue to 
present an obstacle to the effective functioning of 
the habeas corpus remedy. Weak sanctions for 
perjury and contempt of court are contributing 
factors in relation to the way in which the 
authorities respond to habeas corpus petitions. 
Despite obvious and repeated lies and 
misinformation from officials in court (including by 
the Nepal Army during the conflict), no one has 
ever been prosecuted or otherwise disciplined by the

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:  
</i></b></p>
<p>- Enforced disappearances have not 
been criminalized, despite the 2007 
Supreme Court order for the 
Government to do so.   
 
- It is reported that problems relating 
to bringing detainees before a court 
within the 24 hours required by the 
Constitution remain common. (See 
also the comments above in relation to 
recommendation (e) on 
incommunicado detention). 
 
Reportedly, sanctions for perjury and 
contempt remain weak. Lack of 
cooperation with the courts and 
investigating authorities by the Nepal 
Army and CPN-M in particular are of 
grave concern.

In June 07, the Supreme Court issued a 
groundbreaking ruling in relation to disappearances 
resulting from the conflict, based on the work of its 
Task Force set up for a group of petitions of habeas 
corpus. As of Jan. 08, the ruling had yet to be 
implemented. A credible commission of inquiry had 
yet to be set up.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources 2008</i></b> : In 2006 and 
2005, 64 and 640 cases of habeas corpus, 
respectively, were lodged at the Supreme Court. 
While the denial of detainees&#8216; rights to habeas 
</p>
<p>corpus to challenge their detention is not as serious 
as during the conflict, concerns remain as to delays 
in bringing detainees before a court within 24 hours 
as stipulated by the Constitution. 
 
<b>Government:</b> The Nepal Police respects the rights 
of detained persons to challenge the lawfulness of 
their detention. In some instances detained persons 
were released by the court order.

In April 2011, the Administration of 
Justice Act was amended to give the 
powers to hear <i>habeas corpus 
</i>petitions at the district court level. 
Prior to this, only the Supreme Court 
and Appellate Courts were empowered 
to hear such petitions. This is a 
welcome change which will hopefully 
assist in the prevention of arbitrary 
arrest and detention especially in more 
remote areas.

openly admit that they rely heavily on confessions 
for criminal investigations. Reportedly, some 
members of the police have even implied that if they

courts at the time of committal hearings that they

<p>treatment. 
Judges do not generally restrict the admissibility of 
evidence obtained during interrogation outside of 
the presence of a lawyer. Confessions remain the 
central piece of evidence in most cases. Incidents of 
beatings and ill-treatment during interrogation are 
widespread. In addition, it is very common in Nepal 
for detainees to be forced to sign statements without 
being able to read them beforehand.  
Further, although the prosecution carries the burden 
of ultimately proving a defendant&#8216;s guilt, each 
defendant has to &#8213;persuade&#8214; the court of the 
</p>
<p>&#8213;specific fact&#8214; that a statement was not freely given.  
</p>
<p>In practice, this means that forced confessions are 
routinely accepted unless the defendant is able to 
produce some compelling evidence demonstrating 
that coercion or torture took place. In other words, 
Nepali law reverses the burden of proof and expects 
detainees to prove that they were in fact tortured.   
There is no provision made for video and audio-
taping of proceedings in Nepal. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Although under the 
TCA and Evidence Act, forced self-incriminatory 
statements are inadmissible in court proceedings, 
police continues to use torture to coerce confessions. 
Judges rarely ask detainees whether their statements 
were given freely. In addition, according to Section 
28 of the State Cases Act, forced confessions are 
routinely accepted by the court, unless the defendant 
is able to submit evidence demonstrating that the 
statement was produced through torture. Moreover, 
the law is not clear as to the exact procedure used by 
courts to establish whether or not a confession was 
extracted under torture.

In the case of <i>Bahadur  Karki  v  
Government of Nepal, </i>the Supreme 
Court ruled that an uncorroborated 
confession is inadmissible at trial 
(NKP. 2062, Case: Murder, Decision 
No. 7555 Pg 74), however reportedly, 
the current draft Criminal Procedure 
Code does not include a provision 
enshrining this rule in legislation and 
judges continue to allow the 
admissibility of evidence obtained 
during interrogation outside of the 
presence of a lawyer.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reportedly, no video and audio-
recording of interrogations has been

obtained under coercion. From 2006 to 2007, the 
District Courts convicted defendants in 72.67 per 
cent of 4,524 criminal cases, whereas CDOs 
convicted defendants in 98.27 per cent of 2,516 
cases.  
- In this regard, between October 2009 and June 
2010, 13.9% of those charged under the Public 
Offences Act (1970) and 34.5% of those charged 
under the Arms, and Ammunition Act (1963), both 
providing quasi-judicial powers to CDOs, reported 
torture.  
 
<b>Government:</b> According to the Nepalese law, the 
accused person gives statement to the public 
prosecutor in the court. No statement is admissible 
as evidence, unless confirmed by the person before 
the court. 
</p>
<p>It is reported that in the fiscal year of 
2007-2008, the District Courts decided 
3,325 criminal cases and CDOs 
decided 2,723 criminal cases. The 
District Courts convicted the 
defendant in 70.89% of the 3,325 
criminal cases.  The CDOs convicted 
in no less than 97.94% of cases. 
 
In the fiscal year of 2008-2009, the 
District Courts decided 5,119 criminal 
cases and CDOs decided 3,072 
criminal cases.  The District Courts 
convicted the defendant in 72.20% of 
the 6,255 criminal cases.  The CDOs 
convicted in no less than 95.25% of 
cases. 
 
On 22 September 2011, the Supreme 
Court ordered the Government to 
review the quasi-judicial functions of 
CDOs and other administrative bodies 
within six months.

<p>There was a lack of

<p>system and the rule of law 
on the part of victims and

</p>
<p>are concerns regarding the quality of these 
examinations. Quite commonly doctors underreport 
injuries as they are concerned for their own security 
and fear reprisals. Often, junior staff is assigned the 
task of conducting medical check-ups of detainees 
brought to the hospital by police. It is also common 
for the police to insist on staying with the detainee, 
claiming risk of escape. Detainees are very rarely 
taken for examination at the time of transfer to the 
prison or release. 
 
OHCHR has been working with the Nepal Police, 
the National Human Rights Commission and other 
partners to increase the quality of detainee health 
examinations and their documentation.  
Most detainees do not make formal complaints of 
torture and other ill-treatment when taken before a 
judge or prosecutor, mostly for fear of reprisals. 
Although some judges have developed the practice 
of asking male detainees to remove their shirts and 
questioning, such practice has not become uniform 
and in any case is inadequate, particularly with 
regard to methods which do not leave physical 
marks, including psychological torture. Judges do 
not systematically test the voluntary nature of a 
confession and many confessions extracted under 
duress are still admitted as evidence.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Although it is not 
strictly required by the Nepal law, some judges ask 
whether a detainee has been tortured while in 
custody.  
- Throughout October 2009 - June 2010, 9.2 per 
cent of interviewed detainees indicated that judges 
asked them whether they were subjected to torture 
during interrogation. This percentage represents 
</p>
<p>not asked by judges about torture or 
other ill-treatment. This represents an  
improvement from 5.5% in the

<p>almost 5 per cent increase compared to results 
compiled in December 2008-November 2009. 
- Although the percentage of detainees who have a 
medical check-up when taken into custody has 
increased, no medial examination is carried out 
when releasing detainees. Furthermore, check-ups 
are just a formality as police routinely take a group 
of detainees to a doctor, who simply asks whether 
they have any injuries or internal wounds and fails 
to physically examine them.  
- Doctors often fail to provide the court with 
adequate medical descriptions and are threatened by 
the police and the CDO if they provide an adequate 
medical report. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Upon receiving complaint about 
torture, the court may order within three days, 
physical or mental examination of the victim of 
torture or ill-treatment. Under Section 5 (3) of the 
CRT Act, the government provides medical 
treatment upon necessity. The proceedings for these 
type of request are carried out pursuant to Summary 
Proceedings Act 1971 (Section 6 of the CRT Act), 
requiring the court to deliver a judgment within 90 
days.

cases, the police do not take detainees 
for PMCs within the stipulated time, 
arguing there were problems with 
available transport or other obstacles. 
Reportedly, there are several cases 
where doctors have failed to conduct a 
proper examination. The doctors also

Special Rapporteur, the 
NHRC might be entrusted 
with this task. 
 
</p>
<p>No ex-officio 
investigations.  
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> No criminal investigations into 
torture allegations were launched in 2007. However, 
in one case an internal inquiry found four police 
officers responsible of torture and imposed minor 
disciplinary sanctions. Investigations were launched 
in one prominent case of a death in custody. 
The Report of the Rayamajhi Commission set up in 
2006 to investigate human rights violations, was 
made public in August 2007.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  no visible steps have 
been taken to hold accountable any individual 
responsible for serious cases of torture during the 
conflict. 
 The National Human Rights Commission of Nepal 
(NHRC) mandated to investigate alleged violations 
of human rights, rarely sees its recommendations to 
the Government implemented in practice. In its 
annual report 2007-08, the NHRC cited this inaction 
on the part of the Government as one of the major 
challenges in its work.  
The &#8213;investigations&#8214; by the so-called Nepal Police 
Human Rights Cells, consist of sending a letter 
detailing the complaint to the relevant District 
Police Office (DPO), asking it to respond to the 
allegations. No reports of suspensions of police 
officers pending the outcome of the investigations 
were received. The report of the Rayamajhi 
Commission recommended the prosecution of 31 
members of the Nepalese Army, Nepal Police and 
Armed Police Force, largely in connection with 
killings which had occurred in the context of the 
protests, but no action has been taken to initiate 
prosecutions by the authorities. No one has been 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Though 
the NHRC has powers to visit places 
of detention, it is reportedly not 
making any systematic visits. 
Similarly, it has not prioritized the 
investigation of complaints of torture. 
 
 
 
A report entitled &#8213;A 10-year analysis 
of recommendations in cases 
registered with the NHRC&#8214; analysing 
data between 2000 and 2010, shows 
that out of a total of 10,507 cases 
registered during this period, the 
NHRC made recommendations 
relating to 386 cases. Only 34 of the 
286 recommendations (8.8%) were 
fully implemented. Among these 34, 
only one case concerned torture and 
one illegal detention. 36% of the 
recommendations have been partially 
implemented, including 3 torture 
cases. 55% of recommendations have 
not been implemented. 
 
Reportedly, a number of bodies set up 
to investigate reports of human rights 
violations (including torture) lack 
independence and impartiality and are 
largely ineffective. These reportedly 
include the Nepal Police Human 
Rights Unit (NP HR Unit), the 
Attorney General&#8216;s Unit (AG Unit) 
and the Armed Police Force Human 
Rights Unit (APF HR Unit). Even in </p>

There have been no independent investigations into 
the allegations of systematic torture and 
disappearances in 2003/2004 by the Bhairabnath 
Battalion, which were documented in OHCHR&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>May 2006 report. In December 2007, a site was 
identified where the body of one of the disappeared 
may have been cremated. A group of Finnish 
forensic experts visited the country in January 2008 
and assisted local experts in the exhumation of some 
of the remains.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There is no nationwide 
mechanism to monitor places of detention. A 
number of bodies, including the Nepal Police 
Human Rights Unit (NPHRU) and the Attorney 
General&#8216;s Department, that were set up to 
</p>
<p>investigate the allegations of torture, lack 
independence and impartiality.  
- An 11-member team of Nepali and Finnish 
forensic experts led by the NHRC, has started 
exhumations with regard to cases of disappearance 
in Dhanusha district.    
- According to the NHRC&#8216;s annual report, 667 
complaints, including 70 cases of torture by security 
forces were received during the period of 2008-2009 
as compared to 1173 complaints, including 104 
cases of torture by security forces received between 
the period of 2007-2008. Only three out of 70 cases 
have been investigated and granted compensation. 
Actions against the perpetrators were recommended 
only in two cases. The annual report does not 
provide any information on the remaining 67 cases, 
nor does it provide the reasons of why one case 
under investigation was dismissed. Of the 677 cases

<p>those cases where these bodies make 
recommendations for &#8213;further action&#8214;, 
disciplinary action or for

recommendations. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In September 2010, amid a continuing 
lack of action by the police to proceed 
with investigations into the 
disappearance of five students in 
Dhanusha, the NHRC initiated the 
exhumations of the bodies albeit in a 
fairly ad hoc manner that reportedly 
fell below international standards of 
criminal procedure. The procedures in 
particular lacked respect for the rights 
of the families of the victims.  Four 
bodies were recovered in September 
2010, and a fifth one in February </p>

<p>received in 2008-2009, 521 were investigated, four 
were put on hold and 21 dismissed. Compensation 
was recommended in 63 cases, and the punishment 
of perpetrators in 41 cases. By July 2009, the 
government had implemented none of these 
recommendations.  
- In May 2010, in response to concerns raised in 
relation to the lack of responses for the cases of 
torture, the Attorney General stated that its 
department was not entrusted with the investigation 
of ill-treatment in custody as stated under Section 
135 (3) of the Interim Constitution, but rather that it 
had the power to monitor investigation carried out 
by police.   
- The investigations carried out by the Human 
Rights Unit appear to comprise merely addressing 
the letter to the relevant DPO and asking to respond 
to the allegations. Reportedly, there have been no 
cases in which the Human Rights Unit visited the 
victims and interviewed them privately to ascertain 
the veracity of the allegation. There have been 
serious concerns in relation to the lack of criminal 
investigation and lack of adequate disciplinary 
punishment. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Courts have full authority to carry 
out investigation into the allegations of torture.  
The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) 
is empowered to conduct necessary inquiry or 
investigations into the complaint, received from the 
victim or his/her representatives and forward 
recommendations to the concerned authority. The 
NHRC, in performing its functions, may exercise 
the same powers as the court in terms of calling any 
person to appear before the court for recording their 
statement and information or examining them, 
</p>
<p>2011.  There has been no further 
progress since. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As stated above, though the NHRC 
has powers to visit places of detention, 
it is not making any systematic visits. 
Similarly, it has not prioritized the 
investigation of complaints of torture.  
 
</p>
<p>A bill to amend the existing NHRC 
Act only provides the NHRC with 
access to prisons. Reportedly, it is 
essential in the light of the increase of 
torture in police custody as well as the 
documented practice of using 
unofficial places of detention such as 
army camps and private houses (see </p>

</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> In the period from 1996-07, police 
has taken departmental action against 21 police 
personnel in 11 cases for alleged torture, out of 
which 6 cases led to prosecutions.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b> the Nepal Army has 
continued to promote or extend the terms of 
personnel against whom there are credible 
allegations. This includes personnel alleged to have 
been involved directly or by virtue of command 
responsibility in the violations documented in 
OHCHR&#8216;s public reports on disappearances, torture 
</p>
<p>and ill-treatment at the Nepal Army&#8216;s Maharajgunj 
Barracks (report published in May 2006) and in 
Bardiya District (report published in December 
2008). 
In Oct. 08, the CPN-M-led Government 
recommended the withdrawal of 349 criminal cases 
(investigations, charges and convictions) of a so-
called &#8213;political nature&#8214;.  They included cases of 
</p>
<p>gross human rights abuses (murder, attempted 
murder and rape), the majority from the conflict 
period. Most cases were against CPN-M members, 
some of whom were senior members of the 
Government at the time, raising concerns about 
ongoing impunity and the de facto provision of 
amnesties.<b>

Reportedly, there has been a lack of 
cooperation with investigative 
authorities and the courts from both 
the Nepal Army and the UCPN-M. 
Reportedly, rather than handing over 
suspects to the courts, the Nepal 
Army, Nepal Police and UCPN-M 
have each promoted officers suspected 
of serious human rights violations to 
senior positions. For instance, in May 
2011, Agni Sapkota, who is named as 
a suspect in the disappearance of 
Kumar Lama, was appointed Minister 
in the Government of Prime Minister 
Jalanath Khanal. Similarly, in June 
2011, Kuber Singh Rana, one of the 
people whom the NHRC had 
identified as among those responsible 
for the disappearances of the five 
students in Dhanusha District (see 
above, recommendation i) was 
promoted to Assistant Inspector 
General of Police, a very senior Nepal 
Police position.  It is reported that in 
an interim ruling of 13 July 2011, the 
Supreme Court held that a 
recommendation by the NHRC for 
him to be prosecuted is not sufficient 
basis to order the suspension of his 
promotion pending the outcome of the </p>

<p>information as to whether any action has been taken 
against any authorities indicted for abuse or torture.  
The civilian judicial system has failed to deliver 
justice as the state authorities themselves fail to 
observe the court order.   
In December 2009, a military officer suspected in 
the torture and murder of a person in custody, was 
sent on peacekeeping duties and served until he was 
repatriated on 12 December 2009, after the United 
Nations was informed of the fact that murder 
charges were pending against him in the Nepal 
courts. As of September 2010, none of the four 
accused in this case have been questioned let alone 
arrested by the police. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> If the court establishes that torture 
has been inflicted as mentioned in the Act, it may 
order the concerned person to take action against the 
governmental employee. As of 2010, judicial 
actions have been taken against 552 police 
employees on charges of human rights violations, 
including torture. An Assistant Sub-Inspector and a 
Head Constable were immediately suspended from 
their duties and charged with being allegedly 
involved in torture and death of a person in Police 
Custody in Prangbung Police Station. In relation to 
another person who was allegedly subjected to 
torture in the Metropolitan Police Circle, 
Kathmandu and subsequently died on 23 May 2010, 
one Assistant Sub-Inspector and two Police 
Constables were immediately suspended from their 
duties and later charged with having committed

It is reported that the information

<p>(k) Victims of torture and ill-
treatment receive substantial 
compensation proportionate 
to the gravity of the physical 
and mental harm suffered, 
and adequate medical 
treatment and rehabilitation. 
 
</p>
<p>Since the 1996 
Compensation 
Relating to Torture Act 
came into force several 
decisions to award 
compensation had been 
taken. Although, in only 
one case the compensation 
had been paid. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In 2007, compensation 
was awarded in a few cases under the Torture 
Compensation Act, but was always paid to victims 
or their families, and was not usually accompanied 
by a proper investigation to establish causes and 
responsibilities. Compensation packages depend on 
what the Government can afford. The Government 
provided Rupees (Rs.) 1,625,000 in financial aid to 
12 victims who were recommended by the NHRC. 
In 2006, compensation awarded by the courts was 
often not paid out or paid out only after prolonged 
delays. In the 12-year history of the Torture 
Compensation Act (TCA), over 200 victims of 
torture or their relatives have filed compensation 
cases with the courts. However, only 52 cases have 
been decided in favour of the victims, and in only 
seven cases was the money actually paid to the 
victim. 
As part of the peace process, the Government 
announced that reparation would be provided to the 
victims of the conflict, including torture victims. 
Chief District Officers (CDOs) were registering 
names of victims or their relatives. However, the 
criteria for determining who was eligible and how 
the measures would be implemented were not clear 
and concerns had been raised about the need for 
relief to be fairly and impartially distributed, and to 
respect the principle of non-discrimination. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : There are a number of 
statutory frameworks and transitional procedures 
providing &#8213;interim relief&#8214; to &#8213;conflict victims&#8214;.  
- The Torture Compensation Act, 1996 (TCA) 
entitles a compensation amount of maximum NRs 
100, 000 (US $ 1, 420) to those who were proved to 
have been victims of torture. Although the TCA 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  
Reportedly, the TCA 
does not function effectively &#8211; see 
comments above in relation to 
recommendation (b), and note that of 
the 98 cases filed by AF from 2003 to 
June 2011, only (27.5%) were granted 
compensation. 
 
The TRC and Disappearances 
Commission have not been 
established. Legislation is pending in 
parliament.  
 
 
The construction of three additional 
rehabilitation homes still remains 
pending.  
 
Reportedly, the number of cases of 
torture investigated by the NHRC is 
very limited, and compensation has 
only been recommended in one case. 
On 6 May 2003, the NHRC took a 
decision granting compensation of Rs. 
50.000/- (USD 650) to a torture victim 
from Dhading district. On 18 June 
2003, the recommendation letter was 
sent to the Secretariat of the Council 
of Ministers to implement the 
decision. On 5 January 2004, the 
NHRC was informed that the 
compensation had been paid to the 
victim.

within 35 days from the court order, many of these 
victims have not yet received their compensation or 
have received a minimum amount of compensation. 
Reportedly, only one victim has received the 
maximum amount of compensation from the 
Government. 
- There has been considerable delay in putting in 
place the Disappearances Commission and Truth 
and Reconciliation Commission provided for under 
the CPA, bodies which would normally be 
mandated to provide recommendations on equitable 
reparation policies.  
- The Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction has put 
in place the &#8213;interim relief&#8214; measures as part of the 
overall policy set out in the Standards for Economic 
Assistance and Relief for Conflict Victims, 2008. 
Despite numerous reports of rape and other forms of 
sexual violence against women and cases of torture 
of people suffering post-conflict mental trauma, 
none of these categories of victims were addressed 
through the interim relief scheme. There are serious 
concerns about unfair and unequal distribution.  
- The recommendations for compensations issued by 
the NHRC have not been implemented by the 
Government.  
 
<b>Government:</b> Nepal enacted Compensation 
Relating to Torture (CRT) Act, 1996 which provides 
compensation for inflicting physical or mental 
torture upon any person in detention in the course if 
investigation, inquiry or trial. Under Section 5 of the 
CRT Act, a victim or his family members or his/her 
legal counsel may, within 35 days from the date of 
release from his/her detention, file petition of such 
detention in the District Court.  </p>

<p>In addition, the NHRC may order compensation for 
the victims of human rights violations in accordance 
with law. According to Section 9(2) of the Act, 
upon receiving the order for compensation, the 
Chief District Officer is required to execute the 
judgment by providing the amount of compensation 
specified by the court within 35 days. In the court

the NHRC`s mandate and procedures for 
appointment of commissioners.   
</p>
<p>there are no political appointees.

established a Human Rights Directorate mandated to 
raise human rights awareness among the armed 
forces. There is human rights division in each

Key child rights issues, including 
standards for treating juvenile

recommended for United 
Nations peacekeeping 
operations be scrupulously 
vetted for their suitability to 
serve, and that any concerns 
raised by OHCHR in respect 
of individuals or units be 
taken into consideration. 
</p>
<p> <b>Government:</b> According to the Government, since 
15 May 2005, the Army has implemented the policy 
that those who are found guilty of human rights 
violations are disqualified from participating in UN 
peacekeeping missions. However, since impunity 
for perpetrators of human rights violations is quasi-
total, it seems that this type of vetting does not reach 
many alleged perpetrators.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The NA has not 
progressed in identifying or punishing those 
responsible for systematic and serious human rights 
violations during the conflict. The list of army 
personnel excluded from peacekeeping missions on 
the grounds of having violated human rights was 
virtually the same list included in a November 2007 
document provided by the Army to OHCHR.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : In 
December 2009, major Niranjan 
Basnet was returned from 
peacekeeping duties in Chad after the 
UN was made aware that charges 
relating to the murder of a 15-year-
old, who was tortured in army custody 
and whose body was subsequently 
disposed of illegally, were pending 
against him before the Kavre District. 
He was immediately taken under 
control of the Nepal Army upon 
arrival in the country and was not 
handed over to the police, despite 
orders from the then Prime Minister to 
do so. As of September 2011, he 
continues to serve in the army and has 
not been questioned, let alone arrested </p>

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There is a need to 
increase the level of cooperation between the 
OHCHR and the UN Department of Peacekeeping 
Operations in order to ensure that members of the 
Nepalese Army, currently participating in United 
Nations missions, are not implicated in human rights 
violations. Furthermore, it is recommended that 
more stringent vetting of secondees is introduced 
and a policy of refusing secondees from countries 
where torture is being regularly practiced is 
implemented.     
 
<b>Government:</b> A thorough vetting process is under 
implementation in police forces during the 
nomination of their personnel to the United Nations 
(UN) peacekeeping operations. Since 15 May 2005, 
the NA has developed and strictly implemented the 
policy of barring its personnel that was found guilty 
by the court for human rights violations from 
participating in UN peacekeeping operations.

<p>women report being sexually harassed with abusive 
language, stripped naked, beaten and threatened 
with rape. In many cases, male police officers were 
found to have tortured female detainees. Moreover, 
during incommunicado detention, women are often 
sexually abused and then threatened in order not to 
disclose what happened.<b>  
 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government:</b> A national campaign has been 
launched, declaring 2010 as the year to End 
Violence Against Women. A special desk has been 
established in the Prime Minister&#8216;s Office.  
The Nepal Police has established Women and 
Children Service Directorate. A series of training is 
being implemented on women and children related 
issues. Special Security plan 2009 also reflects 
Nepal&#8216;s commitment to protect people from acts of 
</p>
<p>torture.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  According to the data 
collected, despite some improvement in the 
treatment of women during investigation and 
interrogation, women continue to experience torture 
and/or ill-treatment in detention. 
</p>
<p>total of 217 female detainees were 
visited by lawyers. Of them, 32 
(14.7%) claimed that they were 
subjected to torture or ill-treatment. In 
comparison to the period from July to 
December 2010, when only 25 women 
(13.3%) had claimed they were 
tortured; this represents an increase by 
1.7 %. 
 
It is alleged that there remain serious 
problems with the way complaints of 
violence against women are dealt with 
by the State. A 35 day statute of 
limitation applies to the filing of 
complaints to police (so-called First 
Information Reports, FIRs) to ensure 
police investigations in cases of rape. 
In 2008, the Supreme Court of Nepal 
passed a directive order for the 
Government to review the law in order 
to extend the statute of limitation on 
rape.  The draft Criminal Procedure 
Code currently under consideration 
includes a longer limitation period of 
one year, but as currently drafted does 
not allow discretion to extend that 
period. 
Regarding rape and sexual violence in 
the community, police officers have 
shown very little commitment to filing 
reports. It is reported that in some 
cases, instead of taking a case to court, 
the police put pressure on the victim to 
marry the person who raped her, and 
then withdraw the charges against 
him.

<p>against children. practice of arbitrary detention, torture and other ill-
treatment of juveniles in police custody is a major 
concern;25.5% of juveniles held in police custody in 
the period from Oct. 08 to June 09 claimed they 
were tortured or ill-treated &#8211; which is higher than 
for the adult population (18.8%). But this represents 
a reduction of 3.3% as compared to the period from 
Jan-Sep. 08. Moreover, the continued detention of 
juveniles in facilities meant for adults presents grave 
human rights concerns.  Children housed with adult 
offenders are vulnerable to rape and other abuses.   
In May 08, the Supreme Court ordered the 
Government to undertake reforms with regard to the 
prison system, including improving prison 
conditions and the situation of children living with 
prisoners, as well as reforming policies on prison 
management and administration. The Government 
states that reform of the prison system is ongoing 
subject to available resources. 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Juvenile detainees are 
subjected to torture more frequently than adults. 
- In one of its ruling, the Supreme Court decided 
that the detention of minors in prison was illegal and 
that child rehabilitation homes should be provided 
for their stay. These orders have not been 
implemented partly due to a lack of physical 
infrastructure and adequate resources. The 
Government decided to establish three new 
rehabilitation homes due to the increasing number 
of juvenile detainees.    
</p>
<p>torture of juveniles in detention is 
reportedly on the increase. During 
January to July 2011, of 588 juveniles 
visited by lawyers, 42 (7.1%) were 
girls and 546 (92.9%) were boys. Of 
them, 193 (32.8%) claimed that they 
were subjected to torture or other ill-
treatment. In comparison, in the period 
from July to December 2010 the 
percentage was 26.7%, a 6.1% 
increase. Reportedly, the percentage 
of juveniles tortured remains higher 
than the percentage among the overall 
population of detainees. In other 
words, reportedly, police torture 
children more frequently than adults, 
and have consistently done so since 
</p><p>2003. 
 
It is reported that juvenile offenders 
continue to be held in police custody 
beyond the times permitted by law, 
and in most cases, together with 
adults. The only reform centre 
established in the country does not 
have adequate infrastructure, trained 
personnel and support services to 
ensure the safety and well-being of the 
juveniles and promote their 
rehabilitation. In addition, pre-trial 
detention is not limited to exceptional 
circumstances, efforts to apply 
alternative measures are insufficient.  
 
</p>
<p>In 2011, the Government expanded the 
one existing child correction home at 
Sanothimi (Bhaktapur). There are 
plans to open another home in Morang </p>

<p><b>Nigeria 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to Nigeria 
</b></p>
<p><b>from 4 to 10 March 2007 (A/HRC/7/3/Add.4, para. 75). 
</b></p>
<p>85. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Nigeria requesting information 
and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his predecessor&#8216;s recommendations. The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided a response to his request. He looks forward to receiving 
information on Nigeria&#8216;s efforts to implement the recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to assist in efforts to prevent 
and combat torture and ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that, if the absolute prohibition on torture is to be included in 
the Constitution, it should be set forth both in its preamble and as a binding provision. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
statement made by the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice in March 2010, confirming the Government&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>plans to criminalize torture. He urges the Government to ensure that torture is defined and criminalized as a matter of priority, in 
accordance with articles 1 and 4 of the Convention against Torture, with penalties commensurate with the gravity of torture.  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur echoes the concern raised by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights about the loss of life 
during protests over the removal of fuel subsidies,48 and urges the Government to expedite prompt, impartial and thorough 
investigations into the events immediately and conclude them without delay, where the evidence warrants it.  The Special 
Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that security forces are trained and act in accordance with the Code of Conduct for 
Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. 
</p>
<p>88. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the statement by the Police Service Commission in June 2010, that the Police Force 
should stop using torture during interrogations of suspects and encourages the authorities, in particular those responsible for law 
enforcement activities, to declare unambiguously that they will not tolerate torture or similar ill-treatment by public officials and 
that those in command at the time abuses are perpetrated will be held personally responsible for them.  
</p>
<p>89. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the information that under the Evidence Act, confession extracted under duress or 
threat cannot be used in court. He observes however that, in practice, confessions obtained under torture are not expressly excluded 
as evidence in court. He calls upon the Government to guarantee inadmissibility of confessions obtained under torture and ill-
treatment, to shift the burden of proof to prosecution, to prove beyond reasonable doubt that a confession was not obtained under 
any kind of duress; to ensure that all detainees are granted the ability to challenge the lawfulness of the detention before an 
independent court and that the period of holding detainees in police custody does not exceed 48 hours.

<p>90. The Special Rapporteur encourages the State to abolish all forms of corporal punishment, including Sharia-based 
punishments which reportedly remain on the statute books in 12 States. While welcoming the measures taken by some State 
governors to commute death sentences to imprisonment, he regrets that there has not been a general State policy towards abolishing 
the death penalty <i>de jure</i> and releasing those aged over 60 who have been on death row for 10 years or more. He recalls on the 
Government to abolish the death penalty because, under the conditions in which it is imposed and executed in Nigeria, it amounts to 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or, or in some cases, torture. 
</p>
<p>91. The Special Rapporteur notes that in February 2011, the bill on a National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was signed 
into law, securing the independence and funding of the NHRC. He looks forward to receiving information about the steps taken to 
secure the independence of the NHRC. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no steps have been taken to establish effective and 
independence complaints mechanism for torture, similar to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission.  
</p>
<p>92. Finally, the Special Rapporteur encourages the Government to take measures to ensure that the National Committee on 
Torture mandated to visit places of detention and investigate allegations of torture, is fully equipped with the necessary financial 
and human resources. He calls on the Government to take measures to ensure the independent and effective functioning of this 
mechanism in full accordance with the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT). </p>

<p>(a) The absolute prohibition 
of torture should be 
considered for incorporation 
into the Constitution. 
</p>
<p>The prohibition of torture and 
inhuman or degrading treatment 
is provided in section 34 (1) (a) 
of the Constitution. However, 
the 1990 Criminal Code does 
not contain any provision 
explicitly prohibiting torture, or 
any provision for adequate 
sanctions. Acts amounting to 
torture may constitute offences 
such as assault, homicide and 
rape.  
Corporal punishment, such as 
caning, and Sharia penal code 
punishments of the northern 
states (i.e. amputation, flogging 
and stoning to death), remain 
lawful in Nigeria. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In April 
2009, the Attorney General and Minister 
of Justice of the Federation stated that the 
Government is planning to prohibit torture. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The 
Constitution prohibits torture and inhuman 
and degrading treatment. However, torture 
has not been included in the criminal and 
penal codes. 
- The National Action Plan for the 
Promotion and Protection of Human 
Rights in Nigeria 2008-2013 affirms the 
existing constitutional provisions and 
includes specific initiatives to promote and 
protect the rights of all Nigerians. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Article 34 of 
the 1999 Constitution (as amended) 
prohibits torture49, however, no provisions 
are made for the investigation or 
prosecution of acts of torture; in addition, 
the Constitution allows for the death 
penalty.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(b) The highest authorities, 
particularly those responsible 
for law enforcement 
activities, should declare 
unambiguously that the 
culture of impunity must end 
and that torture and ill-
treatment by public officials 
will not be tolerated and will 
be prosecuted.  
The message should be

<p>There was no unequivocal 
condemnation of torture or its 
qualification as a serious crime. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There have 
been some statements on torture by 
Government officials. The Presidential 
Committee on Reform of the Nigeria 
Police Force concluded in April 2008 that 
there were frequent public complaints 
about abuses of human rights by the 
police, including torture. 
In February 2009, the Assistant Inspector-
General of Police in charge of Zone 5, 
stated on behalf of the Inspector General 
of Police that police officers should not 
torture suspects and respect the 
presumption of innocence. In April 2009,

on the Prevention of Torture to 
recommend to the Government how to 
address torture by State actors. Reportedly, 
no report was published.

<p>In June 2010, the Police Service 
Commission has reportedly stated that the

been some statements Government 
officials, including by the former Minister 
of Justice, who indicated that torture 
would be soon criminalised in the 
legislation to demonstrate Nigerian 
Government&#8216;s commitment to eradicate 
torture. He also indicated the need to 
perform a comprehensive review of the 
criminal justice system. 
- The former Minister of Foreign Affairs 
indicated that there was an urgent need to 
re-orient the Nigerian security agents with 
proper equipment and skills.  
- There are consistent reports from persons 
in detention, former detainees, judges, 
magistrates, lawyers, human rights 
defenders and the National Human Rights 
Commission alleging torture by the police, 
including juvenile victims. These include 
beatings with guns, sticks, whips and other

<p>There was no provision

- The National Committee on Torture is 
currently drafting an anti-torture 
legislation, using the experiences from

investigations should be 
established, similar to the

<p>Perpetrators were in general not 
held accountable due to the non-
functioning complaint

Victims accepted that impunity 
was the natural order of things. 
Attempts to register complaints 
were often met with 
intimidation, and investigations 
lacked independence as they 
could be conducted by the 
police themselves. 
Upon request by the 
Government, on 5 
April 2007, the UN Special 
Rapporteur forwarded a draft 
law on the establishment of a 
torture investigation 
commission. 
</p>
<p> <b>Government:</b> A draft bill on the 
establishment of an anti-torture 
commission was pending in the Senate.  
Non-governmental sources: In 2009, 
although the National Human Rights

complaints about torture and abuse, no 
cases had been prosecuted.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : There is a

misconduct to the Police Complaints

the right to legal counsel had been rarely

</p>
<p>(f) The power to order or 
approve arrest and 
supervision of the police and 
detention facilities should be 
vested solely with 
independent courts. 
</p>
<p>Police functions to arrest, detain 
and investigate suspects for 
offences were vested in a 
myriad of law enforcement 
agencies. Time limits and 
safeguards regarding 
imprisonment were frequently 
not complied with, as the 
Special Rapporteur found that 
people were sometimes detained 
for months under police arrest. 
</p>

<p>(g) All detainees should be 
effectively guaranteed the 
ability to challenge the 
lawfulness of the detention 
before an independent court, 
e.g. through habeas corpus 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p>De facto, the vast majority of 
detainees did not have the 
ability to challenge the 
lawfulness of their detention due 
to the lack of financial means, 
the overload of the entire 
judicial system as well as a 
climate of fear. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  A detainee&#8216;s 
power to challenge their detention has 
been dependent on their financial capacity, 
and poverty has been restricting the ability 
of detainees to obtain adequate legal 
representation.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In practice, 
the ability of a detainee to challenge the 
lawfulness of a detention is dependent on 
their financial capacity. In addition, habeas 
corpus proceedings can take years and 
enforced disappearances are frequent. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Although 
guaranteed in law, in practice, the ability 
of a detainee to challenge the lawfulness of 
their detention is dependant on their 
financial capacity. It is reported that 
poverty restricts the ability of detainees to 
obtain adequate legal representation. 
</p>
<p>(h) Judges and prosecutors 
should routinely ask persons 
brought from police custody 
how they have been treated 
and, even in the absence of a 
formal complaint from the 
defendant, order an 
independent medical 
examination in accordance 
</p>
<p>While in principle empowered 
to do so, judges and prosecutors 
did not ex-officio enquire about 
potential torture and ill-
treatment in police custody. 
Forensic medical examinations 
which could sustain complaints 
were non-existent, even in cases 
of death in police custody.

<p><i>Information received in the reporting

<p>with the Istanbul Protocol. 
(i) Those legally arrested 
should not be held in 
facilities under the control of 
their interrogators or 
investigators for more than 
the time required by law to 
obtain a judicial warrant of 
pre-trial detention, which 
should not exceed 48 hours. 
After this period they should 
be transferred to a pre-trial 
facility under a different 
authority, where no further 
unsupervised contact with 
the interrogators or 
investigators should be 
permitted. 
</p>
<p>While legal provisions foresaw 
that persons arrested or detained 
be brought before a judge within 
one or two days, the majority of 
suspects were deprived of their 
liberty for longer periods 
without the required judicial 
oversight. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  As of 2009, 
following an amendment to the Magistrate 
Court Law by Lagos State, magistrate 
courts have been open on Saturdays to 
ensure suspects can be brought before a 
court within 24 hours. Despite this, many 
detainees still had to spend weeks in police 
detention after their arrest without being 
seen by a judge.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Detainees are 
held for extended periods of time due to 
poor record-keeping and secrecy on the 
part of the police. Reports are regularly 
received of persons detained for weeks or 
months before being presented before a 
court, despite the constitutional guarantee 
to be presented before a judge within 48 
hours. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is alleged 
that extended detention at police stations is 
common. Reportedly, numerous people 
awaiting trial spent weeks and in some 
cases months after their arrest in the police 
station, without seeing a judge, despite the 
constitutional guarantee to be brought 
before a judge within 48 hours.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(j) The maintenance of 
custody registers should be 
scrupulously ensured, 
including recording of the 
time and place of arrest, the 
identity of the personnel, the 
actual place of detention, the 
state of health upon arrival of 
the person at the detention 
centre, the time at which the 
family and a lawyer were 
contacted and visited the 
detainee, and information on 
compulsory medical 
examinations upon being 
brought to a detention centre 
and upon transfer. 
</p>
<p>The Criminal Code requires the 
proper maintenance of records 
of any person in confinement 
and punishes neglect or 
deliberate false entries. 
However, in practice these 
records were frequently 
incomplete or inaccurate. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Lagos State has 
implemented a new computerized case 
tracking system, following cases from 
arraignment through their conclusion. 
However, the tracking commences only 
when a detainee is produced before a 
court, not at the point of arrest.  
<b> </b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In 2009 
reports have been received that in some 
police stations the police registered 
detainees on a piece of paper for bribery 
purposes. Once the detainees had paid the 
so called &#8213;police bail&#8214;, they were released.

will track cases starting when a detainee is

<p>(k) Confessions made by 
persons in custody without

<p>In spite of legal provisions that 
provide that a confession made 
by an accused person cannot be 
used to secure a conviction, 
Nigeria&#8216;s criminal justice 
system relies heavily on 
confessions. The Special

which the courts did not take 
into account allegations of 
torture when issuing their 
verdicts.

<p> <b>Government:</b> The new criminal

according to information received, the jury 
generally decide in favour of the police 
officer.

either directly involved in 
torture or ill-treatment, as 
well as implicated in 
colluding in torture or 
ignoring evidence, should be 
immediately suspended from 
duty, and prosecuted. The 
Special Rapporteur urges the 
Government to thoroughly 
investigate all allegations 
contained in appendix I to 
the present report with a 
view to bringing the 
perpetrators to justice.

(p) The release of non-
violent offenders from 
confinement in pre-trial 
detention facilities should be 
expedited, beginning 
especially with the most 
vulnerable groups, such as 
children and the elderly, and 
those requiring medical 
treatment subject to non-
custodial measures (i.e. 
guarantees to appear for trial, 
at any other stage of the 
judicial proceeding and, 
should occasion arise, for 
execution of the judgement). 
</p>
<p>The vast majority of detainees 
are held pending their trial or 
without charge for as long as 10 
years. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Federal Ministry of 
Justice has embarked on a prison 
&#8213;decongestion&#8214; scheme. However, no 
tangible results in terms of numbers of 
people held in pre-trial detention have 
been achieved so far. There is a policy in 
place focusing especially on the release of 
members of vulnerable groups. 
Several states have commuted sentences or 
released detainees under amnesties. 
However this is not done in a routine or 
coordinated manner across the federation. 
It is dependent on the mercy committees of 
individual states and the benevolence of 
the state governor. 
Non-governmental sources: As of 2009, 
the impact of the prison decongestant 
scheme was yet to be observed. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  According to 
the Minister of the Interior, the total prison 
population is 46.000, of which 30,000 are 
awaiting trial.  
- The prison decongestion scheme, 
established by the Ministry of Justice in 
2008 had no visible impact and prisons 
remain overcrowded. 
- There is no information regarding a 
federal policy focusing on the release of 
detainees belonging to vulnerable groups. 
- In July 2009, the Lagos State Governor 
signed the Magistrates&#8216; Court Bill into 
law, which establishes that suspects must 
be brought to court within 24 hours, and

decide who to release.

pre-trial and convicted 
prisoners.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  As of 2009, 
in most prisons visited by NGOs there was 
still no strict separation of pre-trial and

should be separated from 
adult ones. 
</p>
<p>Section 419 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code requires that 
imprisoned minors shall not be, 
so far as it is deemed practical, 
allowed to associate with adult 
prisoners. However, there was 
no strict separation of juveniles 
and adults. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Young 
children are often detained in the same cell 
as adult males, partly due to overcrowding. 
Detainees under 18 are not routinely 
separated from adults. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Detainees 
under 18 are not routinely separated, and 
there are many reports of children as 
young as 12 held with adults in police and 
prison detention. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is reported 
that detainees under 18 are not routinely 
separated from adults. Moreover, it is 
alleged that in some police stations police 
officers falsely record the age of detainees 
under the age of 18 as being over the age 
of 18 in order to bring them to the 
magistrate court instead of a juvenile court.

<p>Males and females were 
separated in most cases.

detainees. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   Female 
detainees are overwhelmingly separated 
from male detainees, but concern has been 
expressed about a prison riot in June 2009 
in Enugu prison, where male inmates 
broke into the female wing and allegedly 
raped most of the female inmates and 
some of the female wardens.

were lawful in Nigeria.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Sharia based 
punishments remain on the statute books 
in twelve states, including corporal

By letter dated 14 September 
2007, the 
Government stated that it had, 
as part of the 
decongestion process, released 
all prisoners 
over the age of 60, as well as all 
prisoners who had served more 
than 10 years on death row. 
</p>
<p>June 2009, President Umaru Yaradua 
appealed to all Governors of Nigeria to 
review the issues of the large number of 
condemned people on death row across the 
country. A number of states have 
commuted some or all of their death 
sentences, and the Federal Government 
commuted 45 death sentences to life 
imprisonment in 2008. However, other 
state governments have extended the scope 
of the death penalty to make kidnapping a 
capital offence, and there have been 
allegations that a number of inmates have 
been executed secretly while in detention, 
with at least seven executions by hanging 
in the past two years. In June 2009, several 
states were considering recommencing 
executions, particularly in the south-south 
and south-east regions of Nigeria. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No action has 
been taken to abolish the death penalty, 
and there are 824 persons on death row. 
- The Federal Government has indicated 
its political will to respect the de facto 
moratorium, but a formal abolition 
requires constitutional review. However, a 
National Death Penalty Moratorium bill is 
reportedly being drafted. 
- An execution reportedly took place in 
early 2010, in spite of the de facto 
moratorium.  
- State governors agreed to review all 
cases of death row and to sign execution 
warrants as a means of decongesting 
prisons, which was opposed to by the 
Federal Government. 
</p>
<p>a meeting of the National Economic 
Council (NEC) in June 2010, it was 
announced that the Council had asked the 
Nigerian State governors to review all 
cases of death row inmates and to sign 
execution warrants as a means of 
decongesting the country&#8216;s prisons. In 
April 2010, a similar decision was taken in 
a meeting of the Council of States, a 
meeting of the 36 state governors, chaired 
by the President of Nigeria.

<p><b> Seguimiento a las recomendaciones del Relator Especial (Manfred Nowak) en su informe relativo a su visita a Paraguay del 
</b></p>
<p><b>22 al 29 de noviembre de 2006 (A/HRC/7/3/Add.3) 
</b></p>
<p>93. El 22 de noviembre de 2011, el Relator Especial envi&#243; la tabla que se encuentra a continuaci&#243;n al Gobierno de Paraguay 
solicitando informaci&#243;n y comentarios sobre las medidas adoptadas con respecto a la aplicaci&#243;n de sus recomendaciones. El 
Gobierno proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n el 26 de diciembre de 2011. El Relator Especial quisiera agradecer al Gobierno la informaci&#243;n 
proporcionada, invitarle a enviar informaci&#243;n sobre todas las recomendaciones emitidas, e informar de su disposici&#243;n a ayudar al 
Estado en los esfuerzos para prevenir y combatir la tortura y los malos tratos. 
</p>
<p>94. El Relator Especial considera positivo que se encuentre ante el Parlamento Nacional el Proyecto de Ley que prev&#233; algunas 
modificaciones en el C&#243;digo Penal a fin de tipificar el delito de Tortura seg&#250;n la Convenci&#243;n contra la tortura y Otros Tratos o 
Penas Crueles, Inhumanos o Degradantes (CAT). El Relator Especial toma nota de que el Proyecto de Ley ha sido aprobado con 
modificaciones por la Honorable C&#225;mara de Senadores, en Sesi&#243;n Ordinaria de fecha 27 de octubre de 2011. Sin embargo 
manifiesta su preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que si bien el proyecto de ley mejora significativamente la definici&#243;n de tortura, el tipo 
penal no concuerda totalmente con el art&#237;culo 1 de la CAT. El Relator Especial valora los esfuerzos realizados para incluir en el 
C&#243;digo Penal Militar el delito de tortura. Al respecto, valora que por Resoluci&#243;n del Ministerio de Defensa Nacional del 24 de junio 
de 2011 se constituy&#243; una comisi&#243;n integrada por representantes del Ministerio de Defensa Nacional, Suprema Corte de Justicia 
Militar, Comando de las Fuerzas Militares, Comando del Ej&#233;rcito, Comando de la Armada, Comando de la Fuerza A&#233;rea y 
Comando Log&#237;stico. Este grupo de profesionales tiene a su cargo el estudio y an&#225;lisis de las leyes militares vigentes a los fines de su 
modificaci&#243;n por otra que adecue la legislaci&#243;n militar a principios jur&#237;dicos modernos. Al respecto, insta respetuosamente al 
&#243;rgano legislativo a que concluya exitosamente tal proceso. 
</p>
<p>95. El Relator Especial aplaude que el Estado paraguayo por Ley N&#176; 4.288/11 del 20 de abril de 2011, haya aprobado el 
denominado Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n contra la Tortura y otros Tratos o Penas Crueles, Inhumanos o Degradantes. Como 
instituci&#243;n nueva, el &#8213;Mecanismo Nacional&#8214;, es un ente aut&#225;rquico con personer&#237;a jur&#237;dica de derecho p&#250;blico, creado por esta ley 
para reforzar y colaborar con la protecci&#243;n de las personas privadas de su libertad contra todo tipo de trato o penas prohibidas.  
</p>
<p>96. El Relator Especial reconoce que con de fecha 13 de enero de 2011, se cre&#243; un nuevo departamento en el Ministerio P&#250;blico, 
a cargo de casos de violaci&#243;n de derechos humanos por parte de funcionarios oficiales. Esta Unidad Especializada de Derechos 
Humanos Es responsable de investigar de manera aut&#243;noma casos de tortura y violaciones de derechos humanos. El Relator 
Especial nota su preocupaci&#243;n por el hecho de que las investigaciones de esta Unidad no se podr&#225;n llevar a cabo 
independientemente de la Polic&#237;a Nacional e insta al gobierno a dar seguimiento a este tema. El Relator Especial reconoce que el 
Ministerio, a trav&#233;s de su Unidad Especializada de Derechos Humanos dispone de una estructura organizada que permite dar 
respuestas espec&#237;ficas, con acciones concretas, dirigidas a perseguir los hechos de tortura.  
</p>
<p>97. El Relator Especial aplaude el trabajo de la Direcci&#243;n General de Verdad, Justicia y Reparaci&#243;n, enfatizando los &#250;ltimos 
hallazgos obtenidos, y exhorta al Estado a continuar con el apoyo pol&#237;tico y financiero necesario a ese &#243;rgano.  </p>

<p>98. El Relator Especial reconoce que la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo, desde su Direcci&#243;n General de Verdad, Justicia y Reparaci&#243;n, ha 
formado una Mesa de Trabajo con la Unidad Especializada de Derechos Humanos del Ministerio Publico, con la que de manera 
coordinada atiende las denuncias formuladas, de modo de identificar todos los legajos y la informaci&#243;n proporcionada que permita 
iniciar las investigaciones en forma eficiente. El Relator Especial nota que la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo tendr&#237;a la posibilidad de ser m&#225;s 
activa, de visitar m&#225;s a menudo los lugares de detenci&#243;n y mantener una base de datos de denuncias. El Relator Especial espera que 
mediante reformas estructurales adecuadas, desarrollo de capacidades del personal y campa&#241;as de concientizaci&#243;n, pueda llegar a 
hacerlo en el futuro. 
</p>
<p>99. El Relator manifiesta su preocupaci&#243;n por la falta de respeto a las garant&#237;as procesales de las personas privadas de su 
libertad, ya que en su mayor&#237;a las personas detenidas en comisar&#237;as superan el plazo m&#225;ximo legal establecido por la carencia de 
infraestructura y medios para alojar a detenidos en condiciones plenas de respeto a su dignidad humana.  
</p>
<p>100. El Relator Especial nota su preocupaci&#243;n debido a que del total de la poblaci&#243;n penitenciaria, solo un 28% se encuentra 
privado de su libertad con base en condena firme y ejecutoriada, mientras que el 72% restante lo est&#225; bajo la figura de la prisi&#243;n 
preventiva. Invita al Estado a garantizar la separaci&#243;n de presos en prisi&#243;n preventiva de los convictos, y a los menores de los 
adultos.  
</p>
<p>101. El Relator Especial considera que ser&#237;a recomendable contar con informaci&#243;n pr&#225;ctica por parte del Estado relativa a la 
eficacia jur&#237;dica de la prohibici&#243;n de admitir confesiones realizadas por personas arrestadas sin presencia de un abogado.

mantiene la definici&#243;n de tortura, se 
debe aplicar la definici&#243;n contenida en la

del derecho positivo nacional desde el

Gobierno: En lo que respecta a este 
punto, el Gobierno inform&#243; que 
actualmente se encuentra en el 
Parlamento Nacional el  Proyecto de Ley 
&quot;Que Modifica los Art&#237;culos 236 y 309 
del C&#243;digo Penal&quot;, que prev&#233; su debida 
tipificaci&#243;n acorde a la Convenci&#243;n 
contra la Tortura y Otros Tratos o Penas 
Crueles, Inhumanos o Degradantes, la 
Convenci&#243;n Interamericana para

adem&#225;s de otros instrumentos de

los derechos de las personas, 
sancionando y erradicando estas 
pr&#225;cticas violatorias de derechos 
humanos.  Dicho proyecto, fue 
presentado a finales del mes de mayo de 
2009 y fue girado para su estudio a las 
siguientes Comisiones de la Honorable 
C&#225;mara de Senadores: Derechos

Defensa Nacional y Fuerza P&#250;blica; 
Legislaci&#243;n, Codificaci&#243;n, Justicia y

</p>
<p>2011: El Gobierno inform&#243; que, en lo atinente 
la enmienda de los art&#237;culos 236 y 309 del 
C&#243;digo Penal, de manera a que contemple una 
tipificaci&#243;n adecuada del delito de tortura y 
desaparici&#243;n forzada, en t&#233;rminos compatibles  
con el art&#237;culo I de la Convenci&#243;n, el Proyecto 
de Ley &quot;QUE MODIFICA LOS ARITCULOS 
236 Y 309 DEL CODIGO PENAL&quot;, cuenta 
con media sanci&#243;n en el Congreso Nacional, 
habi&#233;ndose aprobado con modificaciones por la 
Honorable C&#225;mara de Senadores,  en Sesi&#243;n  
ordinaria de fecha 27 de octubre de 20II. A su 
vez, la Constituci&#243;n Nacional paraguaya otorga 
una condici&#243;n de imprescriptibilidad a este tipo 
de delitos. La Corte Suprema de Justicia se ha 
pronunciado sobre este particular, decidiendo 
que la imprescriptibilidad opera tanto con 
relaci&#243;n a la acci&#243;n penal  como en la sanci&#243;n 
penal. Esto es as&#237;, que los Tribunales del pa&#237;s 
han venido aplicando dicho concepto en sus 
sentencias judiciales. 
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: El art&#237;culo 
5 de la Constituci&#243;n proh&#237;be la tortura, los 
tratos o penas crueles, inhumanos o 
degradantes. La tortura est&#225; a su vez definida 
en el art&#237;culo 309 del C&#243;digo Penal. Sin 
embargo, esta tipificaci&#243;n tan limitada excluye 
f&#225;cilmente muchos hechos que ser&#237;an 
calificados como tortura de acuerdo con la 
CAT. De este modo, los defensores de v&#237;ctimas 
de hechos que encuadran en la definici&#243;n 
internacional de tortura observan que el 
Ministerio P&#250;blico procesa hechos de tortura 
como otros delitos penales, principalmente 
como &#8213;lesi&#243;n corporal en el ejercicio de las 
funciones p&#250;blicas&#8214;, o recurre a procedimientos 
administrativos que no constituyen un recurso </p>

imponen penas leves y la v&#237;ctima no puede 
beneficiarse de la imprescriptibilidad que 
establece el C&#243;digo Penal para el delito de 
tortura.  Esto tambi&#233;n explica la falta de 
condenas por delito de tortura en el Paraguay.  
 
En mayo de 2009, se present&#243; un proyecto de 
ley para modificar el art&#237;culo 236 sobre 
desapariciones forzadas y el art&#237;culo 309 del 
C&#243;digo Penal, que aunque recibi&#243; Dictamen de

discriminaci&#243;n, cuando dichos dolores o

funcionario p&#250;blico u otra persona en el 
ejercicio de funciones p&#250;blicas, a 
instigaci&#243;n suya, o con su 
consentimiento o aquiescencia. No se 
considerar&#225;n torturas los dolores o 
sufrimientos que sean consecuencia 
&#250;nicamente de sanciones leg&#237;timas, o 
que sean inherentes o incidentales a 
&#233;stas);  y que establezca penas acordes 
con la gravedad de este delito; al efecto 
cuando se realic&#233; el estudio respectivo, 
se podr&#225; informar sobre la tipificaci&#243;n 
penal de cr&#237;menes vinculados con la 
tortura, como la desaparici&#243;n forzada de 
personas y la ejecuci&#243;n extrajudicial. 
</p>
<p>DD.HH. La enmienda del Art. 309  del C.P. 
tipificando el delito de tortura es un imperativo 
que la comisi&#243;n  tiene presente. Respecto al 
&quot;delito de tortura&quot;, la comisi&#243;n 
interdisciplinaria tiene previsto la tipificaci&#243;n 
de la misma, aclarando que el CP en si no lo 
hace, pero si estar&#225; previsto en el nuevo CPM.  
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: El C&#243;digo 
Penal Militar aun no contiene el delito de 
tortura. El Gobierno mencion&#243; en su respuesta 
al SPT en junio 2010 que se estableci&#243; una 
comisi&#243;n para estudiar el C&#243;digo Penal Militar 
y que actualmente est&#225; siendo considerado un 
proyecto de enmienda que incorpora la 
definici&#243;n de tortura de la CAT al C&#243;digo 
Penal 
Militar.

Fuentes no gubernamentales: El &#243;rgano 
encargado es el Ministerio P&#250;blico, 
donde actualmente existen unidades 
especializadas en derechos humanos. 
 
Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que la 
Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo nace con la 
Constituci&#243;n Nacional de la Rep&#250;blica 
de 1992 (art&#237;culo 276), define al 
Defensor del Pueblo como un 
comisionado parlamentario cuyas 
funciones son: &#8213;la defensa de los 
derechos humanos, la canalizaci&#243;n de 
los reclamos populares y la protecci&#243;n 
de los intereses comunitarios&#8230;&#8214;.  Fue 
incorporada al ordenamiento jur&#237;dico por 
la Constituci&#243;n Nacional, entre sus 
funciones y atribuciones se menciona: 
&#8213;Denunciar ante el Ministerio P&#250;blico 
las violaciones de derechos humanos 
cometidas por personas que act&#250;en en 
ejercicio de funciones oficiales, as&#237; 
como las de personas particulares; 
interponer Habeas Corpus y solicitar 
Amparo, sin perjuicio del Derecho que 
le asiste a los particulares; actuar de 
oficio o a petici&#243;n de parte para la 
defensa de los derechos humanos&#8214;, a su 
vez, en el art.10, inc. 1) &#8213;Recibir e 
investigar denuncias, quejas y reclamos 
por violaciones de derechos humanos 
reconocidos en la Constituci&#243;n, en los 
tratados internacionales y en las leyes, 
a&#250;n cuando tales violaciones sean 
cometidas por personas que act&#250;en en 
ejercicio de funciones oficiales&#8214; 
 
</p>
<p>delitos dentro del C&#243;digo Penal. Dentro de ese 
&#211;rgano, se ha conformado la Unidad 
Especializada de Derechos Humanos y ha 
asignado funciones exclusivas a Agentes 
Fiscales, mediante la Resoluci&#243;n F.G.E. N&#176; 52, 
de fecha 13 de enero de 2011.  
Es necesario que el Ministerio Publico, en su 
car&#225;cter de titular de la acci&#243;n pernal publica, 
disponga de una estructura organizada a fin de 
dar respuestas espec&#237;ficas, con acciones 
concretas, dirigidas a perseguir los il&#237;citos de 
este tipo y de todos aquellos que guarden 
relaci&#243;n, en procura de la sanci&#243;n que 
corresponda a aquellos infractores de las 
normas legales vigentes en la materia&#8214;. 
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: 
Actualmente, hay varios mecanismos 
investigando este tipo de casos. Las denuncias 
de tortura y malos tratos por parte de oficiales 
de polic&#237;a se investigan a nivel interno, dentro 
de la Polic&#237;a Nacional y por los fiscales en el 
Ministerio P&#250;blico. Hay dos departamentos 
dentro de la Polic&#237;a Nacional a cargo de 
investigar y sancionar malas conductas 
policiales que resultan en sanciones 
administrativas. Los dos mecanismos internos 
de la Polic&#237;a Nacional han sido muy criticados 
en el pasado 
por la falta de efectividad en sus 
investigaciones y por no transferir casos a las 
autoridades responsables para su investigaci&#243;n 
penal. A pesar de haber varios registros de 
casos relacionados a tortura, durante las &#250;ltimas 
d&#233;cadas se aplicaron muy pocas sanciones 
administrativas. Las dos principales razones de

<p>Dentro de sus atribuciones 
Constitucionales y legales, el Ministerio 
P&#250;blico es el encargado de la 
persecuci&#243;n p&#250;blica y social, el 
ambiente, otros intereses difusos, as&#237;

hechos catalogados como delitos dentro

</p>
<p>investigaci&#243;n de la Polic&#237;a Nacional son la falta 
de independencia de los oficiales policiales que 
llevan a cabo las investigaciones de mala 
conducta, y su falta de capacitaci&#243;n y 
educaci&#243;n. 
 
En marzo 2011 se cre&#243; un nuevo departamento 
en el Ministerio P&#250;blico, a cargo de casos de 
violaci&#243;n de derechos humanos por parte de 
funcionarios oficiales. La Unidad de Derechos 
Humanos del Ministerio P&#250;blico se compone 
de cuatro fiscales y un equipo. Es responsable 
de investigar de manera aut&#243;noma casos de 
tortura y violaciones de derechos humanos, 
especificados en su resoluci&#243;n de creaci&#243;n. 
Pero 
en la pr&#225;ctica debe desarrollar sus tareas con 
cuadros ordinarios de la polic&#237;a para llevar a 
cabo las investigaciones y arrestos de los 
supuestos culpables. Por lo tanto, las 
investigaciones de esta Unidad no se podr&#225;n 
llevar a cabo independientemente de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional.

Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que en 
el a&#241;o 2009 se han realizado nueve 
denuncias de torturas en el sistema 
penitenciario, las cuales fueron 
debidamente investigadas, puede citarse 
como &#250;nico caso comprobado el del

<p>2011: El Gobierno inform&#243; que en lo que

cabe se&#241;alar que a partir del a&#241;o 2009 la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional se encuentra en un proceso de 
fortalecimiento de sus sistemas de control, a 
trav&#233;s de una cooperaci&#243;n internacional 
gestionada por el Ministerio del Interior ante el 
Departamento de Estados Unidos. Las

2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Se han 
observado mejoras en 2010. En un esfuerzo por 
erradicar la impunidad y aumentar la eficiencia 
de las investigaciones policiales, el Ministerio 
del Interior ha intentado encontrar soluciones 
para esta situaci&#243;n; las autoridades emitieron 
muchas sanciones disciplinarias y despidieron 
m&#225;s de 70 oficiales de polic&#237;a por faltas graves 
asociadas a conductas penales, aunque los 
despidos son m&#225;s bien por hechos de 
corrupci&#243;n, antes que por violaci&#243;n de derechos 
humanos. Sin embargo, parecen ser necesarios

significativas a largo plazo, en particular en lo

en ocasiones, seg&#250;n las circunstancias

Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que la 
ley org&#225;nica de la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo 
establece que el Defensor del Pueblo es 
el encargado de velar por la vigencia de 
los Derechos Humanos, no obstante la 
detecci&#243;n de hechos que vulneren tales 
derechos deben de ser canalizados al 
fuero penal a cargo del Ministerio 
P&#250;blico y los Juzgados Penales. 
En este marco la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo 
realiza constantemente recomendaciones 
en  el marco de las visitas realizadas en 
los centros de detenci&#243;n policiales y 
penitenciarios, as&#237; tambi&#233;n, hemos 
tomado conocimiento de denuncias de 
tortura en el marco de las visitas 
realizadas, las cuales han sido 
canalizadas al Ministerio P&#250;blico para su 
investigaci&#243;n, tanto en Asunci&#243;n como 
en el interior del pa&#237;s. 
</p>
<p>Muchas organizaciones no gubernamentales no 
consideran a la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo una 
instituci&#243;n seria que promueva ni proteja los 
derechos humanos. Se le critica su falta de 
iniciativa y la inefectividad de su 
funcionamiento. La Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo no 
cumple con el rol de mecanismo de monitoreo 
preventivo debido a la falta de capacidades 
requeridas y a un uso ineficiente de recursos. 
Adem&#225;s, no goza de la reputaci&#243;n de actor 
independiente y proactivo para la protecci&#243;n de 
los derechos humanos que se precisa para 
llevar a cabo dicha funci&#243;n. Sin embargo, como 
organismo independiente, de acuerdo con las 
recomendaciones del SPT, la Defensor&#237;a del 
Pueblo tendr&#237;a la posibilidad de ser m&#225;s activa, 
de visitar m&#225;s a menudo los lugares de 
detenci&#243;n y mantener una base de datos de 
denuncias. No se descarta que, mediante 
reformas estructurales adecuadas, desarrollo de 
capacidades del personal y campa&#241;as de 
concientizaci&#243;n, pueda llegar a hacerlo en el 
futuro.

</p>
<p>2009: El Gobierno inform&#243; que se 
hab&#237;an creado nuevas defensor&#237;as en el 
&#225;rea penal, aunque a&#250;n no exist&#237;a un 
n&#250;mero apropiado. El papel del defensor 
p&#250;blico es fundamental a la hora de 
defender los derechos de las personas 
con escasos recursos. El Poder Judicial 
intenta progresivamente crear nuevas 
defensor&#237;as para garantizar la asistencia 
letrada desde el momento del arresto, 
aunque debido a un problema 
presupuestario ha sido menos r&#225;pido de 
lo deseado.

que es una instituci&#243;n judicial compuesta por 
un equipo de profesionales abogados/as 
pagados por el Estado paraguayo para la 
defensa de las personas de escasos recursos 
econ&#243;micos, ausentes, incapaces y menores de

Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que la 
garant&#237;a de una asistencia id&#243;nea se halla 
consignada en los siguientes 
instrumentos: 
a.  Constituci&#243;n Nacional en su Art&#237;culos 
12 &#8213;De la detenci&#243;n y del arresto&#8214;, 17 
&#8213;de los derechos procesales&#8214;  
b. Ley N&#186; 1286/98  C&#243;digo de 
Procedimientos Penales, Articulo 6 
&#171; Inviolabilidad de la Defe nsa &#187;.  
De esta manera, el derecho a la 
asistencia letrada desde el momento del 
arresto, est&#225; garantizado, y su 
incumplimiento puede ser sancionado, 
con la nulidad de dichos actos. 
 
El Ministerio de la Defensor&#237;a P&#250;blica,  
inform&#243; que conforme al Hist&#243;rico de 
juicios atendidos en todo el pa&#237;s, las 
Defensor&#237;as P&#250;blicas del Fuero Penal 
han tramitado durante el 2007,  25.615. 
En el 2008 fueron tramitados 26556 
casos. Durante el a&#241;o 2009 hasta la 
fecha de presentar el informe  (20/11/09) 
fueron atendidos 27.654 casos.  En 
cuanto a Defensores asignados en lo 
Penal 51 Defensores, entre confirmados 
y nombrados.  
En el a&#241;o 2008 se contaba con otros 18 
Defensores en lo Penal, entre 
confirmados y nombrados. 
En el 2009 2 Defensores fueron 
nombrados. En cuanto a la totalidad de 
Defensores P&#250;blicos existe un total de 
192 Defensores P&#250;blicos nombrados en 
</p>
<p>Igualmente, se informa que el presente a&#241;o han 
sido nombrados 56 nuevos defensores p&#250;blicos, 
que permitir&#225;n dar respuestas m&#225;s efectivas y 
garantizar el derecho a la defensa a aquellas 
personas m&#225;s vulnerables. 
 
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: El derecho 
a recibir asesoramiento legal desde el momento 
del arresto, reconocido en la Constituci&#243;n y en 
el C&#243;digo de Proceso Penal, no se aplica a la 
pr&#225;ctica. La raz&#243;n principal de la debilidad del 
Ministerio de la Defensa P&#250;blica es la falta de 
recursos econ&#243;micos y humanos necesarios 
para llevar a cabo esta funci&#243;n de forma 
efectiva.  
 
El SPT inform&#243; en 2010 que la Suprema Corte 
solamente realiza visitas anuales a 
establecimientos penales que son 
&#8213;esencialmente de naturaleza formal y 
anunciadas con anticipaci&#243;n&#8214;. Adem&#225;s, 
inform&#243; que los funcionarios no hablan 
directamente con los detenidos y que no 
verifican personalmente las condiciones de las 
c&#225;rceles. La Unidad de Supervisi&#243;n 
Penitenciaria no lleva a cabo la totalidad de sus 
funciones por falta de recursos humanos y 
econ&#243;micos. La direcci&#243;n de la Unidad de 
Supervisi&#243;n Penitenciaria confirm&#243; la escasez 
de recursos pero inform&#243; que logran visitar 
aproximadamente 20 detenidos por semana. 
Mantienen entrevistas privadas con los 
detenidos, donde se examina cada caso 
individual y sus necesidades, en particular en lo 
que respecta a la asistencia legal. La

(Informe presentado por la Defensor&#237;a 
General en fecha 20 de noviembre del 
2009 a la DDH de la CSJ) 
 
El Ministerio de la Defensor&#237;a P&#250;blica 
ha presentado un Anteproyecto de Ley 
ante el Congreso. El Anteproyecto 
cuenta con 99 art&#237;culos. Estableciendo  
la naturaleza, ubicaci&#243;n y misi&#243;n del 
Ministerio de la Defensa P&#250;blica, la 
autonom&#237;a, autarqu&#237;a y alcance de la 
misma. Tambi&#233;n  establece  los 
Principios Espec&#237;ficos que redir&#237;an a la 
Defensa P&#250;blica tales como, el inter&#233;s 
prioritario, unidad de actuaci&#243;n, inter&#233;s 
predominante del asistido, 
confidencialidad, intervenci&#243;n 
supletoria, competencia residual y la 
gratuidad. El Anteproyecto fue 
presentado ante la C&#225;mara de Senadores 
hace tres a&#241;os y luego fue retirado para 
ser presentado a la C&#225;mara de Diputados 
y ya cuenta con los dict&#225;menes de la 
Comisi&#243;n de Legislaci&#243;n, Derechos 
Humanos, Constitucional y Justicia y 
Trabajo. 
</p>
<p>cooperaci&#243;n del Ministerio de la Defensa 
P&#250;blica con colegios de abogados y otras 
asociaciones de sociedad civil. Deber&#237;a 
considerarse el apoyo a detenidos por redes 
paralegales, como se da en otros pa&#237;ses, 
especialmente hasta la aprobaci&#243;n de la ley de 
reforma. Parece tambi&#233;n importante asegurar 
que el Ministerio de la Defensa P&#250;blica reciba 
un presupuesto apropiado. 
 
El proyecto de ley que establece la reforma de 
dicho Ministerio fue sancionado en ley en el 
Congreso de la Naci&#243;n el jueves 25 de agosto. 
En la misma se prev&#233; la total independencia del 
Ministerio de la Defensa P&#250;blica, el 
establecimiento de la carrera de defensor 
p&#250;blico, con diferentes categor&#237;as y salarios 
que se equiparen a los de jueces y fiscales.

P&#250;blico posee un Centro de 
Entrenamiento que tienen como objetivo 
capacitar para la funci&#243;n, incluyendo la 
capacitaci&#243;n en derechos humanos. Por 
su parte, en las Fuerzas Armadas de la 
Naci&#243;n existe en Comandante de 
Institutos de Ense&#241;anza del Ej&#233;rcito, 
quien ha implementado un programa de 
derechos humanos y derechos 
internacional humanitario, dictado a los 
diferentes niveles de formaci&#243;n del 
personal de las Fuerzas Armadas. Se han 
creado tambi&#233;n: el Manual de Normas 
Humanitarias &#8211; Derechos Humanos y 
Derechos Internacional Humanitario en 
las Fuerzas Armadas, para su 
distribuci&#243;n al Personal de las Fuerzas 
Armadas; el Programa Patr&#243;n de

referencia a c&#243;mo proceder en caso de

instituciones encargadas de recibir 
denuncias, sus direcciones y tel&#233;fonos. 
 
Fuentes no gubernamentales: No se 
garantiza en su totalidad  la capacitaci&#243;n 
en derechos humanos del personal 
encargado de hacer cumplir la ley. 
 
Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que el 
Viceministerio de Justicia y Derecho 
Humanos ha llevado adelante varias 
actividades de transferencias de buenas 
pr&#225;cticas Argentina-Paraguay, con 
cooperaci&#243;n T&#233;cnica de la Conferencia

<p>humanos. A continuaci&#243;n el Gobierno da una 
descripci&#243;n general de las materias y las 
programas y su respectiva duraci&#243;n en horas. 
Asimismo, el Ministerio de Justicia y Trabajo 
ha realizado capacitaciones puntuales al 
personal. Los se&#241;ores Directores han asistido a 
charlas mensuales sobre la gesti&#243;n 
penitenciaria y Derechos Humanos. 
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Otra 
dificultad identificada repetidamente como 
fuente de impunidad en el pa&#237;s es la falta de 
calificaci&#243;n para llevar a cabo investigaciones 
efectivas y la falta de conciencia de derechos 
humanos. Es importante que los oficiales de 
polic&#237;a sepan el alcance de la prohibici&#243;n de 
la tortura y malos tratos y sepan c&#243;mo proceder 
frente al abuso policial. Los oficiales que 
investigan abusos de derechos humanos por 
parte de la polic&#237;a deben recibir capacitaci&#243;n 
espec&#237;fica para el cumplimiento de su compleja 
tarea. El Ministerio del Interior dej&#243; claro que 
una de sus prioridades es fortalecer las 
capacidades de los oficiales de polic&#237;a. De 
acuerdo con una resoluci&#243;n de setiembre de 
2009, la Polic&#237;a Nacional cre&#243; un 
Departamento de Derechos Humanos, que 
adem&#225;s de inspeccionar y evaluar la 
infraestructura de las celdas de comisar&#237;as y 
llevar a cabo investigaciones en casos de 
desalojos ordenados por la justicia, incluye 
entre sus funciones la de capacitar en derechos 
humanos. El a&#241;o pasado, 
el CICR y la Academia de Polic&#237;a capacitaron 
m&#225;s de 117 instructores en derechos humanos. 
Sin embargo, los talleres son b&#225;sicos y cortos.

dichos talleres fueron realizados tanto en 
Argentina como en Paraguay, y como 
metodolog&#237;a de trabajo se utiliz&#243; la 
capacitaci&#243;n de capacitadores, utilizando 
una penitenciar&#237;a que seg&#250;n el 
cronograma de trabajo y por los 
resultados obtenidos, ser&#237;a recurrida 
como modelo a replicar de forma 
progresiva en las dem&#225;s penitenciar&#237;as a 
partir del 2011. 
Otro trabajo a destacar es el realizado 
con la ONG DNI Paraguay en el mismo 
sentido, al igual que los cursos dictados 
por el Servicio Nacional de Promoci&#243;n 
Profesional (SNPP) en las &#225;reas: 
formaci&#243;n humana, relaciones p&#250;blicas y 
seguridad penitenciaria m&#237;nima. 
 
El Ministerio de Defensa Nacional y las 
Fuerzas Armadas, informan que las 
labores de capacitaci&#243;n ejecutadas para 
prevenir y sancionar actos de tortura a 
los SSOO de las FFAANN, se resumen 
en actividades de Promoci&#243;n, Difusi&#243;n y 
Educaci&#243;n, con la espec&#237;fica tarea de 
elaborar y desarrollar programas de 
prevenci&#243;n y difusi&#243;n en materia de 
derechos humanos en los &#225;mbitos 
educativos y de entrenamiento dentro de 
las Fuerzas Armadas (Centros de 
Ense&#241;anza, Centros de Entrenamiento, 
</p>
<p>Humanos del Ministerio P&#250;blico, con tres 
fiscales apoyados por un equipo, son 
actualmente muy limitadas. Adem&#225;s, 
aparentemente 
no hay un procedimiento interno espec&#237;fico a 
ser aplicado en investigaciones de tortura. La 
Unidad se enfoca en fortalecer las capacidades 
de los fiscales mediante capacitaciones 
continuas en temas de derechos humanos. El 
alcance de las actividades de esta Unidad a&#250;n 
no ha sido determinado con exactitud, y podr&#237;a 
ser expandido dependiendo de las necesidades. 
El Ministerio P&#250;blico tambi&#233;n cre&#243; un centro 
de capacitaci&#243;n donde cada a&#241;o 
aproximadamente 3.000 funcionarios son 
capacitados, inclusive en temas de derechos 
humanos. Desde la creaci&#243;n de la Unidad de 
Derechos Humanos del Ministerio P&#250;blico, se 
trabaj&#243; conjuntamente con el centro de 
capacitaci&#243;n para desarrollar la capacitaci&#243;n en 
derechos humanos. Se mostraron muy 
dispuestos a aumentar esfuerzos por desarrollar 
capacidades para fortalecer la prevenci&#243;n de la 
tortura. 
 
En conclusi&#243;n, como tambi&#233;n lo se&#241;al&#243; la 
Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo y lo confirmaron las 
autoridades de Gobierno, los oficiales 
policiales y los fiscales todav&#237;a precisan 
desarrollar 
sus capacidades individuales mediante una 
extensa y profunda capacitaci&#243;n en derechos 
humanos y la prevenci&#243;n de la tortura. 
Asimismo, la mayor&#237;a de los jueces no tiene 
capacitaci&#243;n adecuada en derechos humanos y 
hay poca conciencia de lo que significa la 
tortura y de c&#243;mo combatirla.

implementado campa&#241;as de Promoci&#243;n

Derecho Internacional Humanitario.  El 
resultado que han tenido estos

se ha podido constatar cuando el

entrevistas mantenidas con los Jueces 
Penales de Garant&#237;as, no registran casos 
en los cuales el procesado haya 
declarado sin la presencia de su 
abogado. Se&#241;alan que las actuaciones 
que llegan hasta ellos siempre han sido 
escritas y en las mismas no existe 
constancia de tales hechos por lo que, 
sin pruebas  concretas de que tales 
violaciones se han realizado no pueden 
emitir  resoluciones contrarias a las 
mismas.   
</p>
<p>situaci&#243;n no ha mostrado cambios 
significativos desde las visitas de los &#243;rganos

sostienen que la situaci&#243;n ha empeorado. La 
mayor&#237;a de los detenidos no se re&#250;nen con sus 
defensores hasta una etapa avanzada del 
proceso, luego de la detenci&#243;n inicial de la 
polic&#237;a, que es cuando se da la mayor&#237;a de los 
casos de tortura. 
 
En consecuencia, los defensores p&#250;blicos no 
llevan a cabo una funci&#243;n de monitoreo, y 
muchos casos de tortura no se detectan ni se 
informan. Por otra parte, los defensores no 
tienen capacidades para visitar regularmente a 
sus clientes, para verificar qu&#233; tipo de trato 
est&#225;n recibiendo y para realizar un seguimiento 
de sus casos. Se declar&#243; que muchos detenidos 
directamente no reciben la visita de sus 
defensores cuando est&#225;n detenidos, sino que 
solamente entran en contacto con ellos durante 
el proceso judicial. Esto tiene como 
consecuencia detenciones prolongadas y 
arbitrarias y que los detenidos queden 
&#8213;perdidos en la prisi&#243;n preventiva&#8214;.

por un m&#233;dico forense que dictamina 
dentro del proceso penal.

que tengan relaci&#243;n a la vida y la integridad de

respecto, la cual ser&#225; fortalecida en el marco 
del plan de capacitaci&#243;n 2012 del Centro de

2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales:  
Los m&#233;dicos y otros funcionarios de la salud no 
solamente juegan un papel importante en 
brindarle atenci&#243;n m&#233;dica a los detenidos, sino 
tambi&#233;n en la detecci&#243;n y documentaci&#243;n de 
casos de tortura, presentando la informaci&#243;n 
correspondiente ante las autoridades 
responsables. 
Sin embargo, a menudo no se realizan 
ex&#225;menes m&#233;dicos en las comisar&#237;as y hay una 
cantidad insuficiente de expertos forenses en el 
pa&#237;s.  
 
La falta de expertos forenses tiene como 
consecuencia una falta de controles para 
detectar abusos por parte de funcionarios 
oficiales, y finalmente tiene como resultado 
una falta de evidencia en casos de tortura 
presentados por las v&#237;ctimas. Por lo tanto, para 
poder prevenir la tortura, es necesario aumentar 
significativamente la cantidad de expertos 
forenses que lleven a cabo ex&#225;menes en 
denuncias de tortura y el personal de la salud 
debe recibir capacitaci&#243;n sobre c&#243;mo detectar 
se&#241;ales de tortura de acuerdo con el Protocolo 
de Estambul, y sobre su obligaci&#243;n de 
intervenir en casos donde un detenido muestra

<p>pocas sanciones administrativas. Las dos 
principales razones de esta inefectividad de los 
mecanismos de investigaci&#243;n de la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional son la falta de independencia de los 
oficiales policiales que llevan a cabo las 
investigaciones de mala conducta, y su falta de 
capacitaci&#243;n y educaci&#243;n.

<p> 2009: El Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que el 
Proyecto de Ley del Mecanismo 
Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n (MNP) contra la 
tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes se encontraba 
en estudio en el Congreso Nacional. 
 
Fuentes no gubernamentales: Sigue en el 
Congreso el proyecto para la creaci&#243;n 
del Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n 
de la Tortura. 
 
Gobierno: El Proyecto de Ley aprobado 
por la Honorable C&#225;mara de Senadores 
en sesi&#243;n extraordinaria de fecha 21 de 
septiembre de 2010 y remitido con 
mensaje N&#186; 792 de fecha 27 de 
septiembre de 2010, el Proyecto de Ley 
&#171; del Mecanismo Nacional de 
Prevenci&#243;n contra la tortura y otros 
tratos o penas crueles inhumanos o 
degradantes &#187;. Actualmente es analizado 
en la Honorable C&#225;mara de Diputados, 
por  las Comisiones de Derechos 
Humanos, Asuntos Constitucionales, 
Legislaci&#243;n y Codificaci&#243;n y la de 
Justicia, Trabajo y Previsi&#243;n Social, para 
su correspondiente dictamen. 
</p>
<p>2011: El Gobierno: El Estado paraguayo, por 
Ley N&#176; 4.288/11 del 20 de abril de 2011, 
aprob&#243; el denominado mecanismo nacional de 
prevenci&#243;n contra la tortura y otros tratos o 
penas crueles e inhumanos o degradantes. 
Como instituci&#243;n nueva, el &#8213;Mecanismo 
</p>
<p>Nacional&#8214;, es un ente aut&#225;rquico con personer&#237;a 
</p>
<p>jur&#237;dica de derecho p&#250;blico, creado por esta 
Ley para reforzar y colaborar con la protecci&#243;n 
de las personas privadas de su libertad contra 
todo tipo de trato o penas prohibidas por 
nuestra legislaci&#243;n vigente y las normas 
internacionales que rigen la materia, as&#237; como 
para prevenir y procurar la erradicaci&#243;n de la 
tortura y otros tratos o penas crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes. Considerando su 
reciente creaci&#243;n, se ha constituido una 
Comisi&#243;n Ad Hoc abocada a la planificaci&#243;n de 
las necesidades presupuestarias para su 
implementaci&#243;n. 
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Si bien 
Paraguay ratific&#243; el OPCAT en diciembre de 
2005, la ley reci&#233;n fue aprobada por el poder 
legislativo el 8 de marzo de 2011 y promulgada 
el 20 de abril del mismo a&#241;o. La ley prev&#233; el 
establecimiento de un nuevo organismo 
aut&#225;rquico llamado &#8213;Comisi&#243;n Nacional para la 
Prevenci&#243;n de la Tortura&#8214; (Comisi&#243;n Nacional)

<p>Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n (MNP).  
 
La relaci&#243;n entre la Comisi&#243;n, 
los escabinos, las organizaciones de sociedad 
civil y los oficiales del Estado no est&#225; 
completamente clara. En particular, la ley no 
determina en detalles c&#243;mo funciona la 
cooperaci&#243;n con organizaciones de sociedad 
civil, lo cual puede crear conflictos dentro del 
MNP y entre organizaciones de sociedad civil, 
como sucedi&#243; en otros pa&#237;ses. Particularmente, 
no se establece c&#243;mo se elegir&#225;n las 
organizaciones de sociedad civil del Comit&#233; de 
Selecci&#243;n ni aquellas que cooperar&#225;n con el 
MNP. Adem&#225;s la ley no especifica el rol de los 
oficiales del Estado, y eso podr&#237;a representar un 
riesgo por la independencia del MNP. La ley 
no establece la experiencia o antecedentes 
profesionales espec&#237;ficos que deben tener los 
miembros del MNP, sino que simplemente 
requiere &#8213;experiencia en aquellas &#225;reas 
necesarias para cumplir con el Protocolo&#8214;. 
Adem&#225;s, no se especifican en detalle los 
m&#233;todos de trabajo del MNP, por ejemplo: 
metodolog&#237;a de visitas, composici&#243;n de 
delegaciones a cargo de las visitas y el papel de 
las organizaciones de sociedad civil, 
distribuci&#243;n de trabajo dentro del MNP, 
derechos y responsabilidades de los miembros 
del MNP y expertos de la sociedad civil en la 
redacci&#243;n de informes y recomendaciones y el 
proceso de destituci&#243;n de miembros del MNP. 
Por lo tanto, debe considerarse la utilidad de 
regular algunos puntos de la ley en reglamentos 
internos de procedimiento y desarrollar un 
manual de monitoreo que explique en detalle la 
metodolog&#237;a de trabajo.

<p>Por &#250;ltimo, no queda claro cu&#225;ndo entrar&#225; en 
funcionamiento el MNP. No se le asign&#243; 
presupuesto en el 2011 y por ende deber&#225; 
esperar a la aprobaci&#243;n general de presupuesto 
para el 2012. Es importante calcular los costos 
m&#237;nimos del futuro MNP y defender la 
asignaci&#243;n de un presupuesto adecuado que 
garantice un funcionamiento efectivo. Mientras 
que no se apruebe el presupuesto, se pueden ir 
adelantando los pasos preparatorios como ser 
selecci&#243;n de miembros, contrataci&#243;n de 
personal y elaboraci&#243;n de procedimientos 
internos, para que el MNP entre en 
funcionamiento cuanto antes. En este sentido, 
el MNP debe tomar en cuenta las funciones, 
experiencia y conocimientos adquiridos por las 
comisiones interinstitucionales y otros 
mecanismos de monitoreo existentes. 
 
En conclusi&#243;n, el MNP como lo regula la ley 
cumple con los requisitos m&#237;nimos del OPCAT 
y en lo que respecta a la cooperaci&#243;n integral 
con la sociedad civil podr&#237;a ser considerado un 
modelo a seguir. Sin embargo, algunos puntos, 
como la composici&#243;n/configuraci&#243;n 
institucional y los derechos y responsabilidades 
de los diferentes actores, el proceso de 
selecci&#243;n de miembros, la garant&#237;a de 
calificaciones y pluralismo, todav&#237;a est&#225;n 
abiertos y precisan ser tratados y posiblemente 
requieran reglamentaci&#243;n para 
prevenir futuros conflictos. Adem&#225;s, el modelo 
ambicioso elegido en Paraguay debe estar 
acompa&#241;ado de un presupuesto adecuado. Es 
necesario realizar una evaluaci&#243;n de las 
necesidades del futuro MNP para poder 
defender una financiaci&#243;n adecuada. Por 
&#250;ltimo, deber&#237;an evaluarse las necesidades de </p>

<p> 2009: El Gobierno indic&#243; que, a ra&#237;z de 
las observaciones y recomendaciones 
preliminares formuladas por el 
Subcomit&#233; para la Prevenci&#243;n de la 
Tortura (SPT), en su visita realizada en 
marzo de 2009, se conform&#243; la comisi&#243;n 
especial encargada del monitoreo y 
ejecuci&#243;n de las mencionadas 
observaciones y recomendaciones, que 
verific&#243; las observaciones formuladas en 
el terreno. Su informe fue presentado al 
Ministro de Justicia y Trabajo. 
 
El 9 de julio de 2009, por medio de la 
Resoluci&#243;n DGRRHH No. 157/2009, 
&#8213;Por la cual se establecen disposiciones 
relativas a la prestaci&#243;n de servicios de 
los profesionales m&#233;dicos, otros 
especialistas y enfermeros/as, en 
distintas especialidades asignados a las 
Unidades Penitenciarias, Correccionales 
de Mujeres, Centros Educativos para 
Adolescentes Infractores y Hogares de 
Ni&#241;os/as dependientes del MJT&#8214;, se 
resolvi&#243; aumentar la carga horaria hasta 
un m&#225;ximo de 40 horas semanales y 
elevar informes en forma mensual 
relacionados a la asistencia m&#233;dica.  
 
59 internos fueron capacitados mediante 
el Curso &#8213;Desarrollo Personal&#8214;, que 
abarca primeros auxilios b&#225;sicos y 
psicolog&#237;a b&#225;sica.

</p>
<p>2011: El Gobierno: La poblaci&#243;n de internos en 
penitenciarias asciende de 7247 internos, 
representando un d&#233;ficit actual en cuanto a 
capacidad de 1912 internos. Inconveniente que 
surg&#237;a anteriormente era que los penales del 
interior solo albergaban a internos de la 
jurisdicci&#243;n en la cual se encontraban; debido 
al hacinamiento reinante en Tacumbu, se 
decidi&#243; trasladar a varios internos a varias 
penitenciarias del interior, seg&#250;n capacidad de 
las mismas, con lo cual rugi&#243; un nuevo 
inconveniente, el cual es el arraigo familiar de 
los internos. En muchos casos esto fue 
recurrido ante los jueces. En lo siguiente el 
Gobierno nombra algunas mejoras y 
aplicaciones de Plazas en las penitenciar&#237;as, as&#237; 
como la ejecuci&#243;n un plan de mejoramiento de 
la infraestructura de las mismas. 
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: El 
Gobierno estableci&#243; una comisi&#243;n interagencial 
para monitorear las condiciones de detenci&#243;n 
en comisar&#237;as con miembros del Departamento 
de Derechos Humanos, la Defensor&#237;a del 
Pueblo, el Ministerio del Interior y la Secretar&#237;a 
para la Mujer. El Gobierno tambi&#233;n se&#241;ala que 
dentro de la Polic&#237;a Nacional, el Departamento 
de Asuntos Internos y la 
Direcci&#243;n de Justicia Policial tienen la funci&#243;n 
de ejercer un control de la polic&#237;a, investigando 
denuncias de violaci&#243;n de derechos humanos 
por parte de oficiales de polic&#237;a. 
Mientras que el Departamento de Derechos 
Humanos y la comisi&#243;n interagencial no tienen 
un enfoque espec&#237;fico de prevenci&#243;n de tortura, </p>

Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que el 
Viceministerio de Justicia y Derechos 
Humanos, las medidas que han sido 
adoptadas para mejorar las condiciones 
carcelarias en materia sanitaria y de 
higiene suponen principalmente fuertes 
inversiones del Estado en construcci&#243;n y 
reacondicionamiento de la 
infraestructura edilicia correspondiente a 
las unidades penitenciarias. 
 
La Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo, en 
cumplimiento de sus funciones proteger 
y promover los derechos humanos ha 
realizado visitas a las Comisar&#237;as y 
Penitenciarias del pa&#237;s, as&#237; como, ha 
recibido invitaciones para integrar 
comisiones interinstitucionales de 
monitoreo a centros de privaci&#243;n de 
libertad, con el objetivo de realizar las 
recomendaciones que considere 
pertinentes para el respeto de los 
derechos humanos de los privados de 
libertad.  
 
En este sentido la Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo 
ha realizado recomendaciones en torno 
al cumplimiento de las normas m&#237;nimas 
de las Naciones Unidas  para los 
privados de libertad a las autoridades 
pertinentes en el marco del 
cumplimiento de sus funciones de 
monitoreo.   
 
Entre las comisiones interinstitucionales 
se encuentran:  
</p>
<p>el Departamento de Asuntos Internos y la 
Direcci&#243;n de Justicia Policial no act&#250;an 
preventivamente sino reactivamente, ante la 
recepci&#243;n de una denuncia. Todos los 
mecanismos mencionados son internos de la 
polic&#237;a y por ende no son independientes. 
Adem&#225;s, los mecanismos parecen tener un bajo 
nivel de visibilidad y poca cooperaci&#243;n y 
contacto con organizaciones de sociedad civil. 
El Departamento de Derechos Humanos de la 
Polic&#237;a Nacional ha declarado encontrarse en 
una situaci&#243;n dif&#237;cil, criticado tanto 
internamente como por la sociedad civil, y ha 
expresado su necesidad y voluntad de cooperar 
con la sociedad civil para fortalecer su rol. 
 
Paraguay tiene tres comisiones 
interinstitucionales dedicadas a visitar y 
monitorear c&#225;rceles, centros de detenci&#243;n de 
menores y barracas militares. No hay, sin 
embargo, comisiones establecidas para la visita 
de comisar&#237;as, donde se dan m&#225;s com&#250;nmente 
casos de tortura, ni para instituciones 
psiqui&#225;tricas.  Las comisiones est&#225;n 
configuradas como instituciones ad hoc. No 
tienen bases legales s&#243;lidas ni financiaci&#243;n 
independiente, lo cual afecta su 
funcionamiento.  
 
De acuerdo con fuentes no gubernamentales, la 
comisi&#243;n interinstitucional para c&#225;rceles est&#225; 
actualmente inactiva. Durante el tiempo en que 
estuvo activa, se la describi&#243; como muy 
burocr&#225;tica e inflexible, llevando a cabo 
solamente visitas anunciadas durante horarios 
de trabajo normales.

<p>La Comisi&#243;n Interinstitucional de 
Visitas a Centros Penitenciarios: La 
Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo forma parte de la 
Comisi&#243;n de Visitas a Centros 
Penitenciarios conformada por la 
Comisi&#243;n de Derechos Humanos de la 
Honorable C&#225;mara de Senadores, desde 
el a&#241;o 2004. Dicha Comisi&#243;n, se halla 
conformada por representantes de las 
siguientes Instituciones: Corte Suprema 
de Justicia, Ministerio de Justicia y 
Trabajo, Ministerio P&#250;blico, Ministerio 
de la Defensa P&#250;blica, Defensor&#237;a del 
Pueblo, Organizaciones no 
Gubernamentales tales como: Ra&#237;ces, 
Coordinadora de Derechos Humanos del 
Paraguay (CODEHUPY), Instituto de 
Estudios Comparados en Ciencias 
Penales y Sociales (INECIP) as&#237; como 
representantes del Sindicato de 
Funcionarios de la Penitenciar&#237;a 
Nacional.  Con respecto a ello, cada a&#241;o 
se realizan las visitas desde su creaci&#243;n a 
fin de realizar las recomendaciones 
pertinentes para el mejoramiento del 
sistema penitenciario del pa&#237;s.  
La Comisi&#243;n Interinstitucional de Visita 
a Centros de Reclusi&#243;n de Adolescentes  
se encuentra integrada por las siguientes 
instituciones: Defensor&#237;a del Pueblo, 
Ministerio del Interior, UNICEF, la 
Direcci&#243;n de Derechos Humanos de la 
Corte, la Direcci&#243;n de Derechos 
Humanos del Ministerio Publico, 
Representantes de la Defensor&#237;a P&#250;blica, 
Ministerio de Justicia y Trabajo, 
Secretaria de la Ni&#241;ez y Adolescencia y 
la O.N.G, RONDAS. En virtud de las 
</p>
<p>detenci&#243;n de menores se cre&#243; como reacci&#243;n al 
caso &#8213;Panchito L&#243;pez&#8214; presentado ante la Corte 
Interamericana de Derechos Humanos. Seg&#250;n 
se informa, la comisi&#243;n 
lleva a cabo dos visitas por a&#241;o en diferentes 
regiones del pa&#237;s, durante las cuales hablan en 
privado con los detenidos. Si bien se dijo que 
sus informes son espec&#237;ficos, con fotos y 
acusaciones directas, no son p&#250;blicos y s&#243;lo 
pueden recibirse mediante solicitud. La 
Comisi&#243;n no es independiente 
institucionalmente, ya que es coordinada por el 
Departamento de Derechos Humanos del 
Ministerio de Justicia. Adem&#225;s, los miembros 
de entidades estatales no son ni funcionalmente 
ni personalmente independientes. De acuerdo 
con las declaraciones, la cooperaci&#243;n entre 
sociedad civil y representantes del estado 
funcion&#243; bien y sirvi&#243; para que la Comisi&#243;n 
tuviese acceso a los centros de detenci&#243;n. Sin 
embargo, la posibilidad de realizar visitas 
anunciadas podr&#237;a verse comprometida por 
preocupaciones con respecto a potenciales 
conflictos de inter&#233;s. Debido a la falta de 
fondos, la Comisi&#243;n no es muy activa y no 
permite la participaci&#243;n de expertos de la 
sociedad civil. Se habl&#243; tambi&#233;n de que debido 
a que no tiene sitio web y no publica sus 
informes y recomendaciones tiene muy poca 
visibilidad social.  
 
La comisi&#243;n interinstitucional para barracas 
militares no est&#225; activa actualmente. Seg&#250;n 
fuentes no gubernamentales, el Ministerio de 
Defensa se ha negado a cooperar con la 
sociedad civil desde el cambio de gobierno en 
</p><p>2008.

principal preocupaci&#243;n que no se 
respetan las garant&#237;as procesales de las 
personas privadas de libertad lo cual se 
pudo constar a ra&#237;z de las visitas a 
centros de detenci&#243;n que se realiza con 
periodicidad, as&#237; tambi&#233;n, en conjunto 
con la Comisi&#243;n Interinstitucional de 
visita de monitoreo a centros de 
reclusi&#243;n.  
Funcionarios de &#233;sta Defensor&#237;a han 
podido constatar que la mayor&#237;a de las 
personas que se encuentran detenidas en 
las comisar&#237;as superan el plazo m&#225;ximo 
legal establecido, vulner&#225;ndose de esta 
manera sus derechos procesales y 
humanos teniendo en cuenta que las 
mismas no cuentan con infraestructura y 
menos con medios ni recursos b&#225;sicos 
para alojar a detenidos en condiciones 
que respeten sus derechos y  dignidad 
humana. Para dicho efecto la Defensor&#237;a 
del Pueblo hab&#237;a presentado un Habeas 
Corpus Reparador lo cual no pudo 
prosperar ya que el mismo fue rechazado 
sin fundamento l&#243;gico  por parte del 
Juez (Informaci&#243;n referida por el 
Departamento de Privados de Libertad 
de la Defensor&#237;a.  
El procedimiento utilizado cuando

<p>Las comisiones interinstitucionales en 
Paraguay pueden llevar a cabo una funci&#243;n 
importante en el monitoreo de lugares de 
detenci&#243;n, integrando representantes del Estado 
y 
la sociedad civil. Sin embargo, por la forma en 
que est&#225;n organizadas actualmente, no les es 
posible llevar a cabo un monitoreo efectivo de 
los lugares de detenci&#243;n, con el fin de prevenir 
la tortura y los malos tratos, de acuerdo a lo 
establecido en el OPCAT. Las comisiones no 
tienen un mandato legal que especifique su 
derecho a acceder a lugares de detenci&#243;n. Sin 
una base legal e institucional s&#243;lida, no es 
posible garantizar su funcionamiento, que 
depende de la voluntad del Gobierno y la 
disponibilidad de los representantes de la 
sociedad civil y la comunidad internacional. 
Adem&#225;s, no reciben financiaci&#243;n adecuada. 
Como consecuencia, dos de las tres comisiones 
est&#225;n inactivas, y la &#250;nica que funciona, no 
puede realizar visitas sistem&#225;ticas y regulares.

Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que la 
aplicaci&#243;n y limitaci&#243;n del recurso de la 
prisi&#243;n preventiva compete 
exclusivamente al Poder Judicial. Sin 
embargo, es relevante destacar que del 
total de la poblaci&#243;n penitenciaria 
recluida en los diferentes 
establecimientos del pa&#237;s, un  70% de la 
misma se encuentra privada de libertad 
bajo la figura de la prisi&#243;n preventiva, y 
s&#243;lo el 30 % restante posee condena 
firme y ejecutoriada. 
</p>
<p>2011: El Gobierno inform&#243; que la Corte 
Suprema de Justicia, ha aprobado en el mes de 
octubre su Plan Estrat&#233;gico 2011-2015, donde 
se establecen l&#237;neas de acci&#243;n y estrategias

Gobierno : El Gobierno inform&#243; que se 
ha fortalecido el sistema de atenci&#243;n a la 
salud, de los detenidos en las 
penitenciar&#237;as. Se ha perfeccionado el 
m&#233;todo de gesti&#243;n de fichas m&#233;dicas de 
todos los privados de libertad; as&#237; 
mismo, se han implementado medidas 
preventivas contra la gripe AH1N1 y el

Se ha llevado adelante un barrido 
sanitario para la detecci&#243;n de 
enfermedades m&#225;s frecuentes (VIH,

de vacunaciones y cursos a internos para 
promotores de salud. 
El primer censo penitenciario permiti&#243; 
contar con un perfil m&#225;s acabado de las

<p>que se encuentra el sistema penitenciario 
creado en 1970 con relaci&#243;n a los nuevos 
paradigmas de tratamiento de las 
personas privadas de libertad, el Poder 
Ejecutivo tom&#243; la decisi&#243;n de iniciar un 
proceso de reforma integral y cre&#243; una 
Comisi&#243;n Nacional para el efecto, 
mediante Decreto N&#186; 4674 de julio de 
</p><p>2010. Dicha comisi&#243;n se encargar&#225; de 
delinear las acciones m&#225;s efectivas para 
lograr el mejoramiento del sistema 
penitenciario, siendo uno de sus ejes la 
lucha contra la corrupci&#243;n en dicho 
estamento.  
 
Con relaci&#243;n a la Corte Suprema de 
Justicia, la misma cuenta con una ley 
que sanciona los casos de corrupci&#243;n,  la 
Ley N&#186; 2.523/2004. Que previene, 
tipifica y sanciona el enriquecimiento 
il&#237;cito en la funci&#243;n p&#250;blica y el tr&#225;fico 
de influencia. La referida ley establece 
sanciones como prohibiciones 
posteriores al ejercicio del cargo, multas 
que van desde los cien a trescientos d&#237;as 
de  multas e inhabilitaci&#243;n especial, 
pudiendo ser inhabilitado de uno a diez 
a&#241;os. 
 
A trav&#233;s de la Superintendencia General 
de Justicia, la Corte Suprema de Justicia 
ha ejercido acciones de control y 
supervisi&#243;n para el mejoramiento de la 
administraci&#243;n de Justicia.  En el 2008 a 
trav&#233;s de la Oficina de Disciplina recibi&#243; 
857 denuncias y remiti&#243; 733 informes 
con recomendaciones al Consejo de 
Superintendencia y 337 para Instrucci&#243;n 
</p>
<p>Tacumbu, con el objeto de consolidar un 
sistema efectivo que pueda ser replicado 
posteriormente con &#233;xito en los dem&#225;s 
establecimientos penitenciarios. As&#237;, a fin de 
hacer frente a esta problem&#225;tica, se ha hecho 
una fuerte inversi&#243;n en HARDWARE para la 
instalaci&#243;n de nuevos sistemas de seguridad en 
los penales, especialmente en el Penal de 
Tacumu, as&#237; como revisiones m&#225;s exhaustivas 
de las visitas; asimismo se insta a los familiares 
de los internos a que se acerquen a denunciar 
los casos de corrupci&#243;n, en varias 
oportunidades mediante la colaboraci&#243;n de los 
mismos se ha adoptado una estrategia 
espec&#237;fica para lograr descubrir el hecho y 
aplicar una sanci&#243;n que corresponda a los 
responsables, siempre salvaguardando la 
identidad de los denunciantes. Como medida 
indirecta, se ha firmado un nuevo contrato 
colectivo de condiciones de trabajo con los 
sindicatos de funcionarios mejorando 
substancialmente las remuneraciones y 
prestaciones a los guardias c&#225;rceles. 
 
2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales: La 
corrupci&#243;n es un problema muy serio, tanto en 
la polic&#237;a, la fiscal&#237;a y en el sistema judicial. 
Seg&#250;n se inform&#243;, la corrupci&#243;n en el sistema 
judicial sigue siendo un gran problema, en 
especial en &#225;reas rurales. Sin embargo, 
actualmente hay varias iniciativas 
anticorrupci&#243;n en el pa&#237;s y se cre&#243; un C&#243;digo

La Corte Suprema de Justicia, asumi&#243; el 
compromiso de combatir la corrupci&#243;n  
dentro del marco del Programa Umbral 
del Milenio.  Es as&#237; que desde enero de 
2006 se ha conformado la  Oficina de 
&#201;tica Judicial, tras la aprobaci&#243;n en 
Octubre de 2005 del C&#243;digo de &#201;tica 
Judicial. Esta Oficina sirve de soporte 
t&#233;cnico, procesal y administrativo a todo 
el sistema de &#233;tica judicial, sirviendo 
asimismo de apoyo a los principales 
&#243;rganos: el Tribunal de &#201;tica Judicial y 
el Consejo Consultivo, con el &#225;rea de 
denuncias y de consultas. El Sistema de 
&#201;tica Judicial tiene por objeto promover 
los niveles de calidad y probidad en la 
funci&#243;n jurisdiccional. En este contexto 
conforme a lo dispuesto en el  Art. 10 
numeral 3 del C&#243;digo de &#201;tica Judicial, 
durante el 2007, se culmin&#243; el proceso 
de suspensi&#243;n temporal de afiliaciones 
partidarias de los magistrados, a fin de 
garantizar la independencia de los 
integrantes del  Poder Judicial (Informe 
de Gesti&#243;n/2007, p&#225;g 24).  El Tribunal 
de &#201;tica y Consejo Consultivo ha 
tramitado en el 2006 un total de 26 
casos, en el 2007  fueron  26 casos, en el

Es importante se&#241;alar que la Oficina de 
&#201;tica Judicial desde sus inicios se ha 
dedicado, adem&#225;s de tramitar los casos 
consultados y denunciados a  difundir y 
capacitar  sobre temas relacionados a la

referente al &#225;rea judicial

En el informe elaborado por la 
CODEHUPY  en el informe de 2007,  se 
comenta sobre su labor y  que pesar de la 
desconfianza hacia este tribunal a inicios 
de su funcionamiento, sus decisiones 
contribuyeron a fortalecer la imagen de 
independencia del Poder Judicial y 
&#8213;viene demostrando su capacidad de 
independencia y controversia con la 
misma.&#8214; (Derechos Humanos en 
Paraguay 2007, pag 129).  En el  2008, 
se destaca la labor llevada a cabo por La 
Oficina de &#201;tica del Poder Judicial que  
inici&#243; en mayo del 2.008 una campa&#241;a 
contra la coima con el objeto de 
&#8213;erradicar y suprimir&#8214; conductas 
consideradas da&#241;inas para el Poder 
Judicial, a trav&#233;s de programas y  
compa&#241;as. &#8213;La Oficina de &#201;tica Recibi&#243; 
el reconocimiento de la sociedad por sus 
iniciativas y trabajo en el fortalecimiento 
del Sistema de Justicia&#8214;  (Derechos

determinados establecimientos por las

En cuanto a la separaci&#243;n de menores y

todas las penitenciar&#237;as.  
 
Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que si

recursos humanos asignados a los 
centros penitenciarios, el Ministerio de 
Justicia y Trabajo ha incluido dentro de

r&#233;gimen de utilizaci&#243;n de la celda de

instruye el correspondiente sumario

establecido por el jefe de seguridad del penal y 
ratificado por el Director. El Director adem&#225;s 
debe recibir un reporte del incidente que

ilegalmente detenida, dispone de garant&#237;as 
establecidas en dicho cuerpo legal para 
subsanar esta situaci&#243;n (Articulo 11 y 12 de la

<p> 2009: El Gobierno se&#241;al&#243; que, si bien 
existe asistencia en algunos campos, no 
podr&#237;a considerarse suficiente para 
conseguir un mejoramiento de la 
situaci&#243;n. Por tanto, se exhorta a los 
posibles cooperantes a colaborar de 
manera a ir progresivamente elaborando 
trabajos tendientes a garantizar los 
derechos de los ciudadanos. 
 
Fuentes no gubernamentales: Se cuenta 
con la asistencia de agencias y 
organismos de desarrollo para su 
aplicaci&#243;n.  
 
Gobierno: El Gobierno inform&#243; que 
dado el Decreto Presidencial 4674 de 
julio de 2010 por el cual se crea la 
Comisi&#243;n de Reforma Penitenciaria, el 
Gobierno se encuentra aunando 
esfuerzos a trav&#233;s de cooperaci&#243;n a fin 
de paliar la situaci&#243;n existente y aplicar 
de la forma m&#225;s inmediata posible las 
recomendaciones recibidas en la materia. 
</p>
<p>2011: El Gobierno: El Ministerio del Interior, 
conjuntamente con la Polic&#237;a Nacional y 
Comit&#233; Internacional de la Cruz Roja, desde el 
2007, renueva el Convenio de Cooperaci&#243;n 
Interinstitucional, esta &#250;ltima con una duraci&#243;n

actualizar, desarrollar y promover la 
integraci&#243;n de las normas internacionales de 
Derechos Humanos y los Principios 
Humanitarios en las actividades pr&#225;cticas de la

2011: Fuentes no gubernamentales:  
La situaci&#243;n no ha mostrado cambios 
significativos desde las visitas de los &#243;rganos 
internacionales de monitoreo, y hay quienes 
sostienen que la situaci&#243;n ha empeorado. 
Aparentemente, la mayor&#237;a de las 
recomendaciones del Relator Especial contra la 
Tortura y del Subcomit&#233; para la Prevenci&#243;n de 
la Tortura todav&#237;a no han sido efectivamente 
implementadas; la tipificaci&#243;n de tortura a&#250;n no 
se adecua a las disposiciones de la Convenci&#243;n 
Contra la Tortura de la Naciones Unidas (CAT) </p>

<p>y de la Convenci&#243;n Interamericana contra la

de tortura, y no existe un monitoreo sistem&#225;tico 
e independiente de los lugares de detenci&#243;n.  
 
Sin embargo, se debe reconocer que el 
Gobierno es muy consciente de los problemas 
de derechos humanos, especialmente en lo que 
respecta a la tortura y los tratos crueles. 
Muchos funcionarios de gobierno tienen un 
historial de activismo por los derechos 
humanos y parecen tener un inter&#233;s genuino y 
gran disposici&#243;n para mejorar la situaci&#243;n de 
derechos humanos en el Paraguay. Se 
establecieron departamentos de derechos 
humanos en muchos &#243;rganos ejecutivos, 
incluyendo el Ministerio del Interior, la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional, el Ministerio de Justicia y 
recientemente el Ministerio P&#250;blico. Adem&#225;s, 
se cre&#243; una Red de Derechos Humanos del 
Poder Ejecutivo, con el fin de coordinar los 
esfuerzos de los diferentes departamentos de 
derechos humanos. Dicha Red, coordinada por 
el Ministerio de Justicia, ha iniciado un Plan 
Nacional de Acci&#243;n de Derechos Humanos

<p>fin principal de la visita de evaluaci&#243;n era 
identificar los factores sist&#233;micos que 
contribuyen a la tortura y a los tratos crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes en el Paraguay y 
discutir sobre las principales necesidades para 
lidiar con estos factores, en t&#233;rminos legales, de 
procedimientos e institucionales, as&#237; como 
tambi&#233;n de capacidades del personal en las 
instituciones relevantes. Por otro lado, el 
equipo recolect&#243; informaci&#243;n sobre proyectos 
que se est&#225;n llevando a cabo en el &#225;rea de 
prevenci&#243;n de la tortura y sobre las capacidades 
de las organizaciones de sociedad civil para 
poder seleccionar una organizaci&#243;n que act&#250;e 
como punto de referencia local (&#8215;punto focal&#8216;) 
</p>
<p>para la implementaci&#243;n del proyecto general. 
Se valora mucho la apertura y franqueza del 
Gobierno durante las reuniones de consulta. Se 
reconoce abiertamente el problema de la tortura 
y los malos tratos como un asunto crucial de 
derechos humanos. El Gobierno est&#225; tomando 
medidas para mejorar la prevenci&#243;n de la 
tortura y se mostr&#243; dispuesto a fortalecer sus 
esfuerzos en cooperaci&#243;n con el proyecto AT. 
Siendo a la vez una destacada ONG 
especializada en prevenci&#243;n de la tortura y una 
red establecida, CODEHUPY fue elegida como 
punto focal para el proyecto AT.

<p><b>Papua New Guinea  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in the report of his visit to Papua New Guinea from 14 
</b></p>
<p><b>to 25 May 2010 (A/HRC/16/52/Add.5) 
</b></p>
<p> 
</p><p>102. On 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Papua New Guinea requesting 
information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The 
Special Rapporteur regrets that the Government has not provided a response to his request. He looks forward to receiving 
information on Papua New Guinea&#8216;s efforts to implement to the recommendations and affirms that he stands ready to assist in 
efforts to prevent and combat torture and ill-treatment. 
</p>
<p>103. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received information about the steps taken to ratify the Convention against 
Torture and the Optional Protocol thereto, and urges the Government to ratify these instruments and create a national preventive 
mechanisms providing for regular visits to all places of detention. The Special Rapporteur urges the Government to make a 
declaration with respect to article 22 of the Convention recognizing the competence of the CAT and ratify the First Optional 
Protocol to the international Covenant on civil and political Rights, providing for the right to lodge individual complaints to the 
Human Rights Committee.  
</p>
<p>104. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to ensure that torture is defined as a serious crime as a matter of priority, 
sanctioned with penalties commensurate with the gravity of torture and ensure that any statement which is established to have been 
made as a result of torture is explicitly excluded and is not invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused 
of torture as evidence that the statement was made.  
</p>
<p>105. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the completion of the nationwide consultations on the review of the Sorcery Act and 
sorcery-related killings, but notes that the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary lacks the capacity to prevent and investigate 
crimes related to domestic violence and accusations of sorcery. He notes with regret that the incidents of sorcery-related killings 
continued to be reported throughout the country. He urges the Government to ensure a comprehensive structural reform of the 
Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary in accordance with the September 2004 recommendations of the Administrative Review 
Committee to the Minister for Internal Security.  
</p>
<p>106. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the establishment of an independent investigation team to look into the alleged 
involvement of four police officers in East New Britain following the death in custody of a student in June 2011, and encourages the 
Government to ensure prompt and thorough investigations of all allegations of ill-treatment or excessive use of force by an 
independent authority and ensure that those in command at the time of the abuses are brought to justice.  
</p>
<p>107. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government&#8216;s efforts to address the poor conditions of detention and of the fact 
that these efforts are often hampered by capacity and resource constraints. He believes that while many of the problems observed 
are caused by a lack of resources, some important steps could be taken that are not resource-dependent, such as establishing 
stronger legal and procedural safeguards, amending the Correctional Service Act to include provisions on confidential and private 
meetings with detainees, and regulating visits to police lock-ups and pre-trial detention facilities. He encourages the Government to </p>

<p>ensure that detention conditions comply with international minimum sanitary and hygiene standards, that detainees are provided 
with basic necessities, including adequate floor space, bedding, food, water and health care, and that conditions are created for 
inmates to get involved in work opportunities and recreational activities. 
</p>
<p>108. The Special Rapporteur notes with regret that gender-based violence remains prevalent throughout the country, with 
widespread domestic violence and no effective State mechanism to address it. He calls upon the Government to establish a 
comprehensive legal framework to address all forms of violence against women and ensure its implementation in line with the 
concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>109. Finally, the Special Rapporteur notes with regret that in 2011, five men were reportedly sentenced to death by hanging by the 
Kokopo National Court despite the assurances of the Government that Papua New Guinea has never enforced the law on death 
penalty since its enactment. The Special Rapporteur believes that, under the conditions of its imposition and execution in Papua 
New Guinea, capital punishment inevitably results in cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or even torture.  He strongly urges the 
Government to take steps to abolish the death penalty and to ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, aiming at abolition. </p>

<p><b>1. Impunity  </b>  
(a)  Have the highest authorities, in 
particular those responsible for law 
enforcement activities, declare 
unambiguously that they will not 
tolerate torture or similar ill-
treatment by public officials and that 
those in command at the time abuses 
are perpetrated will be held 
personally responsible for them; 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Reportedly, in July 2011, a 
member for Moresby North East, welcomed the decision by 
Police Commissioner Wagambie to clamp down on rogue 
police officers saying it was long overdue and made reference 
to the Special Rapporteur on torture&#8216;s report on the mission to 
</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea. He was quoted saying that it was time for 
the Police Commissioner to take these findings seriously and 
&#8213;make a concerted effort to clean up the force&#8214;. 
 
Reportedly, in August 2011, some action was taken to bring 
perpetrators to justice along with reiteration that 2011 is the 
year of discipline and all allegations will be investigated and 
perpetrators held accountable. In August, following an 
allegation of sexual assault by a policeman while in custody 
in Boroko police station, Port Moresby, the police announced 
that an investigation would be launched. The police leadership 
has also spoken against domestic violence by police officers 
stating that cases would be investigated and appropriate action 
taken against police concerned.   
</p>
<p>(b) Ratify the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
and the Optional Protocol thereto, 
providing for regular visits to all 
places of detention by an independent 
domestic monitoring body. A 
declaration should be made with 
respect to article 22 of the 
Convention, recognizing the 
competence of the CAT to receive 
and consider communication from 
individuals who claim to be victims 
of a violation of the provisions of the 
Convention;

right to lodge individual complaints 
to the Human Rights Committee; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>(d) Amend domestic legislation to 
include the crime of torture with 
adequate penalties. The definition of 
this crime should be in full 
accordance with article 1 of the CAT; 
</p>
<p>The term &#8213;torture&#8214; appears only once in the 
</p>
<p>Criminal Code Act as an aggravating 
circumstance in the case of sexual assault 
(sect. 349 (A)). Instead, the code outlaws 
several offences, including some but not all, 
of the elements of the crime of torture as 
understood in the CAT. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(e) Ensure prompt and thorough ex 
office investigations for all 
allegations and suspicions of ill-
treatment or excessive use of force by 
an authority that is independent from 
the investigation and prosecution. 
Any officer known to be abusive 
should be removed from custodial 
duties. Heads of police stations and 
detention facilities should be made 
aware of their supervisory 
responsibility; 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is reported that an independent 
investigation team was set up to look into the involvement of 
four police officers in East New Britain following the death in 
custody of a student at Kokopo police cells on 24 June 2011. 
The four police task force members have been suspended 
following the complaint. Local NGOs in the province reported 
that the latest killing was just one of many cases of police 
brutality. 
 
It was reported that a Senior Inspector was dismissed after 
being found guilty of 13 disciplinary charges. In one incident 
in 2007, he was found guilty of criminal conduct for the 
murder of A.P. at  Gabaka Street, Gordons, Port Moresby.  
 
Cases of police violence were also reported in the media in 
July 2011.  
 
Sorcery related killings were reported to continue throughout 
the country, with a number of incidents reported from 
Madang and Lae. The police are said to be investigating and 
have promised to bring the perpetrators to justice. The 
Constitutional and Law Reform Commission (CLRC) have 
completed the nationwide consultations on the review of the 
Sorcery Act and Sorcery related-killings and are finalizing the 
report. </p>

<p><i>Information received in the reporting period

<p>(f) Ensure a comprehensive and 
structural reform of the Royal Papua 
New Guinea Constabulary in 
accordance with the September 2004 
recommendations of the 
Administrative Review Committee to 
the Minister for Internal Security. 
</p>
<p>The Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary 
lacks the capacity to prevent and investigate 
crimes relating to domestic violence, tribal 
fighting and accusations of sorcery. The 
police are not always in a position to enforce 
the rule of law, owing to insufficient human 
and financial resources, widespread 
corruption and low standards of 
professionalism, difficulties in access to 
remote areas and a lack of political will.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : It is reported that on 21 August 
2011, a tribal clash at 9-mile settlement outside Port Moresby 
left one man dead and several others injured. Reportedly, 
tension remains high and the Taris have deserted the area in 
fear of further attacks. The Governor of NCD appealed to 
relatives of the deceased to refrain from paying back killings. 
Police are reported to be investigating the killing. 
</p>
<p><b>2. Safeguards and prevention  </b>  
(a) Reduce, as a matter of urgent 
priority, the period of police custody 
to a time limit in line with 
international standards (maximum 48 
hours); 
</p>
<p>Detainees were held in remand at police 
lock-ups often for several months, and 
sometimes for more than a year.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(b) Establish accessible and effective 
complaints mechanisms in all places 
of detention. Complaint by detainees 
should be followed up by 
independent and thorough 
investigations, and complainants 
must be protected from reprisals. 
</p>
<p>Despite the existence of visiting magistrates, 
there is no provision in the law that provides 
for an independent, external and efficient 
complaint mechanism.  
The Correctional Service Act does not state 
whether meetings with detainees are private 
and confidential, nor does it have provisions 
regulating visits to police lock-ups and 
pretrial detention facilities.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p><b>3. Conditions of detention</b>    
(a)  Ensure that persons deprived of 
their liberty are confined in facilities 
where conditions comply with 
international minimum sanitary and 
hygiene standards and that detainees 
are provided with basic necessities, 
such as adequate floor space, 
bedding, food, water and health care. 
Prisoners should be provided with 
opportunities for work, education, 
recreation and rehabilitation; 
</p>
<p>Detainees were locked up in overcrowded 
and filthy cells, without proper ventilation or 
natural light. In all police lock-ups (with an 
exception of some detainees at the Bihute 
police station), detainees were forced to sleep 
on a concrete floor, sometimes on only a 
piece of cardboard. The cells were often 
infested with mice, cockroaches and other 
insects. Access to food was greatly limited, 
the food provided by families, in the few 
instances where they were allowed

In principle, correctional institutions in 
Papua New Guinea provide prisoners with 
opportunities for work. At the Baisu 
correctional institution, however, detainees 
had no opportunities for work, education or 
other forms of recreation, and were locked in 
their cells for up to 18 hours a day. The best 
practice example was the Bihute correctional 
institution, where the opportunities available 
for detainees allowed for a real possibility of 
rehabilitation.

Discrimination against Women.  
</p>
<p>Gender-based violence is prevalent 
throughout the country, with widespread 
domestic violence and no effective State 
mechanism to address it. In detention, 
women are extremely vulnerable to sexual 
abuse from police officers or other detainees. 
 
There is no existing legislation that 
criminalizes domestic violence. As such, 
cases of domestic violence fall under the 
provisions of common and aggravated 
assault found in the Criminal Code. The

<p>Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary has 
the Standing Order on Domestic Violence, 
issued in 1987, instructing police to treat 
cases of domestic violence with the same 
seriousness as any other assault. In 2002, the 
Criminal Code Act was amended through the 
Sexual Offences and Crimes against Children 
Act to make spousal rape and sexual 
harassment criminal acts. However, in 
village court system, chiefs may negotiate 
compensation or traditional apologies as a 
form of resolution for offences committed 
against women, including rape and domestic 
violence.  
</p>
<p><b>5. Death penalty  </b>  
85. Abolish the death penalty and 
ratify the Second Optional Protocol 
to the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, aiming at the 
abolition of the death penalty. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  It is reported that in July 2011, 
five men were sentenced to death by hanging by the Kokopo 
National Court for the murder of eight people on 25 
September 2007.   
</p>
<p>86. The Special Rapporteur 
recommends that OHCHR, with the 
agreement of the Government of 
Papua New Guinea, establish a 
country presence with a mandate for 
monitoring the human rights situation 
in the country, including the right of 
unimpeded access to all places of 
detention, and for providing technical 
assistance particularly in the field of 
judicial, police and prison reform. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p>87. The Special Rapporteur also 
recommends that relevant United 
Nations bodies, donor Governments 
and development agencies consider 
the protection of human rights in the 
criminal justice system, and in

<p><b>Republic of Moldova 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Republic of Moldova from 4 to 11 July 2008 (A/HRC/10/44/Add.3 para. 90) 
</b></p>
<p>110. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of the Republic of 
Moldova, requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of the 
recommendations. He expresses his gratitude to the Government for providing detailed information on steps taken during the 
reporting period. 
</p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the report of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or 
Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT), on its visit carried out from 1 to 10 June 2010. 
</p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur notes the information on the number of cases investigated by the newly established body within the 
General Prosecutor&#8216;s Office and encourages the authorities to effectively ensure prompt, independent and impartial investigation of 
all allegations of torture and ill-treatment committed in the context of the April 2009 events. He urges the authorities to launch 
timely prosecutions and conclude them without delay, where the evidence warrants it. Unless the allegation is manifestly 
unfounded, those involved should be suspended from their duties during the investigation and proceedings. 
</p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur further calls upon the Government to strengthen its efforts to provide victims of torture and ill-
treatment with as full rehabilitation as possible, to incorporate the right to reparation for victims into domestic law together with 
clearly set-out enforcement mechanisms.   
</p>
<p>114. The Special Rapporteur commends the Government for its efforts to combat torture and ill-treatment, for the steps taken to 
combat trafficking in human beings and the progress made in relation to national response to gender-based violence. He welcomes 
the ongoing reforms of the criminal justice system, in particular the adoption by the Government of the Strategy for Justice Sector 
Reform for 2011-2016 aimed at reforming the Prosecutor&#8216;s office, and the police and penitentiary systems; the adoption by the 
Parliament of the National Action Plan on Human Rights for the period of 2011-2014, envisaging legal assistance to victims of 
torture and other ill-treatment. He looks forward to receiving information on implementation efforts on these important initiatives.   
</p>
<p>115. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Order issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on making the referral to forensic 
examination mandatory in cases of allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and of measures taken to strengthen the institutional and 
operational capacity of the Centre of Forensic Medicine. He calls upon the authorities to increase the number of qualified health 
personnel in detention facilities and ensure that medical staff in places of detention are independent and are provided with training 
in the medical investigation of torture and other forms of ill-treatment. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to ensure that 
reports of independent forensics are attributed the same evidentiary weight as reports prepared by State-appointed forensic experts. 
</p>
<p>116. The Special Rapporteur regrets not having received information on legislative initiatives to remove the statute of limitations 
for the crime of torture and for reducing the period in custody that are reportedly in progress and recalls his appeal to the 
Government to ensure that the period of holding detainees in police custody does not exceed 48 hours, and that no detainee should 
be subject to unsupervised contact with an investigator.  </p>

<p>117. The Special Rapporteur reiterates his concern with respect to legislative and logistical constraints impeding the effective 
functioning of the national preventive mechanism 50 and welcomes the establishment of a working group on amending the 
Ombudsman Law. He welcomes the acknowledgment by the Government of the need to improve the efficiency of the national 
preventive mechanism (NPM), and encourages the authorities to work closely with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to bring the NPM into full conformity with the Paris Principles.51  
</p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to strengthen its efforts to provide victims of torture and ill-treatment 
with as full rehabilitation as possible, to incorporate the right to reparation for victims into domestic law together with clearly set-
out enforcement mechanisms and ensure annual budgetary allocations for providing adequate compensation and rehabilitation of 
victims of torture and ill-treatment.   
</p>
<p>119. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about reported incidents of prisoner-on-prisoner violence and the practice of 
intimidation in places of detention. The Special Rapporteur recalls that inter-prisoner violence can amount to torture or ill treatment 
if the State fails to act with due diligence to prevent it. 
</p>
<p>120. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the steps undertaken to improve the conditions in detention facilities, 
including the action plan drafted to combat overcrowding and improve material conditions in prisons, however, he remains 
concerned at the reports of inadequate access to health care and lack of mandatory medical examination of detainees upon their 
arrival and departure from temporary detention facilities.  
</p>
<p>121. With respect to the Transnistrian region, the Special Rapporteur regrets that none of the previous recommendations have 
been implemented, including criminalizing torture, abolishing the death penalty and stopping immediately the practice of solitary 
confinement. He is concerned that no independent monitoring mechanism for places of detention has been established and urges the 
relevant authorities to take measures to implement the above recommendations and establish important safeguards in criminal 
procedure to prevent torture and ill-treatment.

<p>(a) Impunity 
i) Abolish the statute of 
limitations for crimes of 
torture; 
ii) Establish effective and 
accessible complaints 
mechanisms; and protect 
complainants 
against reprisals; 
iii) An independent authority 
with no connection to the 
body investigating or 
prosecuting the case against 
the alleged victim should 
investigate promptly and 
thoroughly all allegations of 
torture and ill-treatment ex-
officio; an independent 
forensic expert should carry 
out an examination in respect 
of all allegations of torture 
and ill-treatment; 
iv) The Forensic institute 
should be equipped 
accordingly. 
</p>
<p>A statute of limitation of 
five years was applicable to 
the crime of torture; 
The law provided for several 
complaints avenues, but the 
large majority of complaints 
were rejected quasi-
automatically;  
Ex-officio investigations did 
not function in practice;  
The system of internal 
remedies was dysfunctional 
due to: 
a)The routine use of threats 
and reprisals by the police in 
order to deter detainees from 
filing complaints;  
b)the non-action of the staff 
of penitentiary institutions in 
cases of allegations of 
torture;  
c) the wide discretion and 
inaction of the prosecutor&#8216;s 
office when he receives 
complaints; d) the lack of 
independent medical 
examination; e) the lack of 
independence of judges who 
in many cases continue to 
follow the arguments of the 
prosecutor; 
The State Forensic Institute 
was underequipped. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:  
</b></p>
<p>i) The statute of limitations is not an impediment 
to investigations, since crimes of torture are 
investigated vigilantly and in a timely manner. 
ii) Since 1996 prosecutors are obliged to make 
daily spot checks at the places of temporary 
detention. This includes personal and direct 
control of the legality of detention, discussions 
with detainees, as well as reporting the results of 
these actions, including where necessary, issuing 
orders to release the persons detained illegally 
on remand. Thus, there is a mechanism to 
record, control and monitor the practice of 
coercive procedural measures and the conditions 
of detention. 
iii) In 2007, 1,258 complaints were submitted, 
50 criminal proceedings being initiated. In the 
same year, 87 criminal proceedings were 
initiated for excess of power, 55 cases of which 
were sent to the court, 63 persons being 
convicted, including 14 persons imprisoned. In 
2008, 1,128 complaints were submitted, 51 
criminal proceedings being initiated. In the same 
year, 73 criminal proceedings were initiated for 
excess of power, 46 of which were sent to court, 
as a result of which 36 persons were convicted 
and 5 persons were imprisoned. In 2009, 554 
complaints have been submitted, 33 criminal 
proceedings were initiated. The same year, 31 
criminal proceedings have been initiated for 
excess of power, 20 of which were sent to court, 
16 persons convicted and 1 person was 
imprisoned. Most cases investigated concerned 
the use of force during interrogation for the 
purpose of securing a confession to improve 
prosecution statistics. 
The Interior Ministry has internally examined 
135 criminal cases, including 39 cases regarding 
excess of power, 17 cases regarding torture and 
</p>

ii) The Order No. 11/991 of 15 March 
2011 on the procedure of addressing 
and reporting abuses, have been placed 
on the Ministry of Internal affairs 
(MIA) website.

<p> 
iv) In December 2011, the Centre of 
Forensic Medicine with the support and 
contribution of UNDP Moldova, 
launched the project &#8213;Strengthening the 
forensic examination of cases of torture 
and other forms of ill-treatment, as a 
key strategic element in comprehensive, 
integrated, holistic efforts to end torture 
and related forms of ill-treatment in 
Moldova&#8214; which aimed: to strengthen 
the institutional and operational 
capacity of the Centre of Forensic 
Medicine in the examination of cases on 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment 
cases at the national level; to increase 
the quality of forensic documentation 
brought before courts; to increase 
partnership and awareness between 
governmental and nongovernmental 
organisations.  
 
Various activities have been undertaken 
in the framework of the above 
mentioned project, including purchasing 
transport units and IT equipment.

<p>4 cases for coerced declarations, 19 of which 
had resulted in the dismissal of staff. 
It should be noted that during 2008, no new 
cases of torture or inhuman or degrading 
treatment were registered in the penitentiary 
system. An exception is the case of an employee 
of Prison No. 1, who was sentenced, in 
accordance with article 328 paragraph 2 (c) of 
the Criminal Code on 9 Dec. 08, to a fine and 
the deprivation of the right to hold public 
functions for a period of 3 years, for committing 
actions that humiliated the dignity of a prisoner 
on 29 Dec. 07. In 2009 no cases of torture were 
registered in the penitentiary system. During this 
year the Penitentiary Institutions Department of 
the Ministry of Justice initiated 2 internal 
investigations regarding the alleged ill-treatment 
of two detainees, from which one of the cases 
was sent to the Prosecutor Office. The facts 
alleged in the second case have not been 
confirmed.  
Of 473 petitions examined in 2008 by the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), 38 
concerned cases of ill-treatment and illegal 
detention of citizens. In 18 cases false facts were 
reported; in 15 cases the facts have been 
confirmed (employees have been sanctioned 
disciplinarily); in 19 cases the files were 
submitted to the prosecution bodies (for criminal 
procedure), and in 6 cases the petitions were 
sent to judicial courts (for examination of 
criminal cases filed by the petitioners). During 
the first 10 months of 2009 the MIA examined 
334 petitions, of which 33 cases concerned 
mistreatment of persons by police employees. In 
11 cases the alleged mistreatment was not 
confirmed; in 4 cases the court applied an 
administrative fine to both sides of the conflict; 
in 2 cases the investigation was suspended until 
</p>
<p>demonstrators. It is reported that out of 
the total of 108 complaints, 58 criminal 
cases were initiated (28 on torture, 20 
on abuse of power and excess of duties, 
10 on other categories of crime); 27 
involving 44 policemen have been 
finalized and sent to court and on the 
majority of them the investigations 
continue until now. In the rest of cases, 
prosecution has been cancelled due to 
lack of constituent elements of the 
crimes or was suspended on the grounds 
that it was impossible to determine the 
alleged perpetrators. Reportedly, there 
are widespread credible reports about 
persons being pressured to withdraw 
complaints related to abuses during the 
April 2009 events.  
 
Courts initially convicted two police 
officers who were later acquitted. Eight 
other police officers have also been 
separately acquitted, and in case of one 
police officer, the criminal procedure 
was stopped with conditional 
sentencing.  
 
In relation to one high-profile case 
concerning the April events involving 
the death of a protester who was seen 
by eyewitnesses being beaten to death., 
11 police officers had reportedly been 
dismissed as of June 2010, and put 
under criminal investigation.

<p>the decision on the criminal case was issued; in 
16 cases the files were sent to the prosecutor, of 
which no criminal procedure was commenced in 
2 cases (the employees were only warned about 
the due treatment of citizens).  
Thus, 204 criminal cases were initiated in 2009, 
compared with 215 during the same period of 
the previous year. 60 of these concerned cases of 
excess of power (59 in 2008), 34 cases of torture 
(13 in 2008), and 5 cases of coercion to make 
statements (12 in 2008). 
20 police employees were dismissed following a 
court decision.  
The examination of such cases reveal that police 
officers commit actions that clearly exceed the 
limits of rights and powers granted to them by 
law; they apply force and violence, and torture 
people for the following reasons:   
</p>
<p>- To obtain evidence by illegal means; 
- To pursue personal and material 
</p>
<p>interests; 
- To demonstrate the superiority over the 
</p>
<p>victims and to neglect the general rules 
of conduct;  
</p>
<p>- Because of lack of knowledge of the 
law and work duties; and  
</p>
<p>- Other reasons.  
Most of the circumstances described in the 
complaints of citizens are not sufficient to start a 
criminal prosecution. 
Taking into account the necessity to ensure the 
impartiality of prosecutors in the investigation 
process of cases of torture and abuse of power, 
by General Prosecutor&#8216;s Order of 19 Nov. 07 
regarding the investigation of cases of torture, 
degrading and inhuman treatment, the territorial 
and specialized prosecutors were required to 
designate a prosecutor responsible for 
documenting and examining allegations of 
</p>
<p>April 2009 events, has been postponed 
16 times as of 7 April 2011.  
Although the cases of several high-
ranking police officers accused of 
crimes related to April 2009 events, 
were submitted to the court during 
2010, there is insignificant progress in 
determining the cases.  
 
In addition, two prosecutors from 
Buiucani district have been 
reprimanded. One judge alleged to have 
conducted spot trials in the police 
commissariats, was stripped of his 
judicial mandate as a result of 
disciplinary proceedings. The mandate 
of two other judges, alleged to have 
conducted spot trials in police 
commissariats, was not prolonged.   
In the period from April 2009 to March 
2011, the Rehabilitation Centre for 
Torture Victims &#8213;Memoria&#8214; has 
registered 7 persons who complained 
about being subjected to torture while in 
police custody. It is reported that 
conditions of detention in some 
Moldovan prisons and pre-trial 
detention facilities remain harsh, 
dangerously overcrowded, and in some 
instances life-threatening, in particular 
as a result of regular exposure to 
tuberculosis in penitentiaries.  
 
Reportedly, investigations of cases of 
torture (before and after the events of 
April 2009), largely do not meet 
minimum requirements, lasting 
excessively long and are completed by 
an inappropriate decision. It is reported </p>

<p>torture and ensuring the security of victims. This 
person is not involved in other activities, in 
order to exclude partiality in investigations of 
allegations of torture. Following the decision of 
the General Prosecutor or his or her deputies, the 
military prosecutor offices of Chisinau, Balti 
and Cahul investigate cases of torture, inhuman 
and degrading treatment, respectively, in the 
centre, North and South of the country, while the 
Department on Criminal Investigation of 
Exceptional Cases of the General Prosecutor's 
Office investigates the most severe cases of 
torture, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
In accordance with the above-mentioned acts, 
prosecutors are required, whenever a reasonable 
suspicion exists that the crime of torture has 
been committed, to immediately start criminal 
investigations. Following the initiation of 
criminal proceedings, prosecutors of Chisinau 
municipality and Gagauzia may withdraw the 
criminal cases from the prosecutors in these 
territorial units, appointing a special prosecutor 
to carry out further investigations. 
A directive of the Prosecutor&#8216;s Office has been 
issued to improve forensic documentation; 
however, further measures are still needed to 
provide for effective forensic examination. 
iv) To date, the Legal Medical Centre presented 
a demand related to the necessary equipment for 
its laboratories. Thus, the Centre has been 
included in the list of bodies of the Health 
System, which will benefit from humanitarian 
aid. During 2009, the Legal Medical Centre has 
developed some proposals for several external 
assistance projects, with the purpose of 
strengthening the existing laboratory capacities 
and establishing a genetic laboratory within the 
Centre &#8211; these proposals were submitted for 
consideration to UNDP, the Government of 
</p>
<p>that in many cases, even where there are 
credible allegations related to torture 
and ill-treatment, the prosecutors were 
reluctant to initiate investigation. In 
some cases, prosecutors appear to have 
been present at the police station during 
or immediately after police ill-treatment 
of detained persons, but evidence which 
might have been used to identify 
perpetrators was not collected. There 
appears to be systemic bias against 
detained suspects of crimes and in 
favour of police investigators, even 
where indications of trauma and abuse 
are present. Some prosecutors have also 
reportedly tried to influence and 
intimidate victims of torture into 
withdrawing complaints.  
 
It is reported that paramedics 
(&#8213;Feldshers&#8214;) employed by the police, 
are present in places of detention only 
during working days. In practice 
medical doctors in places of detention 
are dependent on and accountable to 
penitentiary management: by habit and 
practice, the National Forensic Centre 
undertakes conservative forensic 
documentation. Reportedly, the fact that 
the internal regulation of the National 
Forensic Centre is signed by, among 
others, the General Prosecutor, is 
indicative of a lack of independence. 
 
Forensic documentation practices 
carried out by official forensic doctors 
do not currently meet the requirements 
of the Istanbul Protocol. Although the 
law requires a doctor and/or penal </p>

<p>Japan, etc. At the same time, due to financial 
constraints, it has been impossible to increase 
the financing of the Legal Medical Centre.   
The Legal Medical Centre has undertaken inter 
alia a training course for medical-legal experts 
on the investigation of torture cases and other 
ill-treatment. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Out of 554 
complaints only one perpetrator was sentenced 
to imprisonment for torture in 2009; thus, the 
investigation cannot be regarded to be efficient, 
operative and impartial. Forensic doctors try to 
cover up torture, rather than document it.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Investigative 
bodies fail to carry out prompt, thorough and 
independent investigations into allegations of 
torture.   Police officers have not been 
suspended from their official duties during the 
investigation of complaints lodged against them, 
contrary to European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR) jurisprudence (ECtHR, Valeriu and 
Nicolae Rosca vs. Moldova). This has 
contributed to impunity.  
- An investigation into a case of alleged torture 
that took place in 2005 was only launched in 
July 2009, after the ruling of the ECHR against 
Moldova in the case of Gorgurov v. Moldova. 
Despite the ruling, the Government has failed to 
comply with the remedy requirements. Officers 
responsible for acts of torture remain 
unpunished. 
- Article 60 of the Criminal Code, according to 
which prosecutions for serious crimes can take 
place up to 15 years after the crime has 
occurred, has not yet been amended. 
- The Criminal Procedural Code allows for 
defence lawyers to request the suspension of a 
</p>
<p>institution to inform the chief 
prosecutor if it finds that the prisoner 
was subjected to torture, in some cases 
no action is taken. Similarly, forensic 
examinations to assess the allegations of 
torture are rather an exception than the 
rule, and are often made too late, 
because usually victims are not 
accepted without the special reference 
from prosecutors. They also tend only 
to record the visible signs, without 
indicating and describing the context of 
trauma as well as without adequate 
additional and needed diagnostic 
investigations. Evidence of 
psychological trauma or other 
indications of torture are generally not 
undertaken. This particularly leads to 
under-documentation, since 
methodologies of torture and other 
forms of ill-treatment applied have 
become more nuanced and less likely to 
leave physical marks in recent years.  
The forensic doctors remain in need of 
special training on medical 
investigation of torture, according to 
adopted standards and Istanbul 
Protocol.  
 
In addition, the forensic medicine 
services are still a State monopoly. 
There are however some initiatives to 
open these services to private 
alternatives. This issue is addressed in 
the context of a larger process of 
revision of procedural legislation, which 
is at the drafting stage.  At present, 
domestic courts tend to defer to official 
forensic sources, preferring these over </p>

- Although a special group of military 
prosecutors was established within the General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office to investigate the allegations 
of torture occurred during the April 2009 event, 
there have been concerns as to its impartiality. 
After a year, most of the trials are still pending 
and are subject to constant delays.  
- On 20 October 2009, the Investigation 
Commission on the Elucidation of the Causes 
and Consequences of the Events, an ad-hoc 
commission made up of 9 members of 
parliament, was established to investigate the 
&#8213;causes and consequences of the April 2009 
events&#8214;.  
- On 7 May 2010, the Commission presented to 
the Parliament a well-documented report with 
reference to arbitrary arrests, wide use of 
disproportionate and abusive force in custody 
and violent measures undertaken in the 
aftermath of the April 2009 events.  
- As of June 2010, 108 complaints of torture by 
police officers had been received by the Office 
of Prosecutor General and 54 criminal 
investigations had been initiated in connection 
with the April 2009 events. Approximately 24 
dossiers concerning 39 police officers were 
taken to the Courts for further investigation. As 
of September 2010, there were no convictions 
related to torture or other ill-treatment by police 
officers in connection with the events of April 
</p><p>2009. Most of the charges against the police 
officers are under article 327 (abuse of power) 
or article 328 (misuse of power), although some 
have also been brought under article 309/1 
(torture) of the Penal Code, particularly in 
connection with several high-profile cases. 
- Police and security personnel have reportedly 
intimidated human rights defenders and victims 
</p>
<p>independent medical sources supplied 
by victims or their representatives.

- In practice, most investigations do not meet the 
minimum requirements and are mostly delayed. 
In many cases, even where there are credible 
allegations of torture, prosecutors are apparently 
reluctant to initiate investigations. There appears 
to be systemic bias against detained suspects of 
crimes in favor of police investigators, even 
when there is enough evidence of torture and ill-
treatment. Some prosecutors have also 
reportedly tried to influence and intimidate 
victims of torture into withdrawing complaints. 
- Some progress has been made into the 
investigation of abuses of juveniles by the police 
or public servants after a campaign against 
torture started two years ago. Complaints against 
police officers are being investigated by 
prosecutors from a different district in order to 
safeguard against tolerance or complicity. The 
number of police officers prosecuted has 
increased, and some have been given prison 
sentences. - Although the complaints against 
police officers for juvenile suspects&#8216; abuse are 
reportedly less common, the blanket denial and 
the absence of complaints about police 
misconduct against children lacks credibility and 
reinforces the impression that there is little 
political will to eradicate abuse. 
- Although the Centre for Human Rights plays 
valuable role in monitoring the treatment of 
juvenile suspects and prisoners and in bringing 
cases to the attention of the responsible 
authorities, criminal and administrative 
investigations are not pursued promptly and 
efficiently, and accountability remains weak. 
The Government did not take any steps to equip 
the Forensic institute. In 2011, UNDP jointly 
with the European Union, will launch a project 
to equip the national forensic agency and to </p>

<b>Government:</b> In 2010, the centre of Forensic 
Medicine at the Ministry of Health, in 
partnership with OSCE Mission in Moldova has 
launched the project &#8213;Strengthening capacities 
and cooperation between forensic specialists 
from both banks of the Nistru River aimed at 
enhancing investigation of torture cases&#8214;. In this 
context, a study visit of four forensic experts 
was organized in Turkey from 10 to 13 
November 2010. On 23 November 2010, a 
conference on &#8213;Actual Issues on the 
Organization and Realization of Forensic 
Expertise&#8214; was carried out in Tiraspol and was 
attended by forensic experts from both banks of 
the Nistru River. 
- The Centre of Forensic Medicine with 
immediate support and contribution of UNDP 
Moldova launched the project &#8213;Strengthening 
the forensic examination of torture and other 
forms of ill-treatment, as a key strategic element 
in comprehensive, integrated, holistic efforts to 
end torture and related forms of ill-treatment in 
Moldova&#8214;. It provides forensic expert training 
on identification and documentation of cases of 
torture. It also provides the Centre with technical 
equipment for its regional and laboratory 
departments.

torture and ill-treatment as a whole in order: 
- to identify and establish all factors, causes and 
conditions that permit the existence of those 
phenomena and to propose concrete and 
adequate solutions and measures for their 
liquidation; 
- to analyze the investigation of cases of torture, 
elucidating the problems which appear within 
the investigation and prosecution process of the 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment; 
- to take all legal measures to compensate the 
victims for the harm and to reinstate them; 
- to prosecute the cases of torture with an 
increased social importance, etc. 
In accordance with the Order of the General 
Prosecutor of November 2010, the Section for 
combating torture shall be informed within 24 
hours about each case or allegation of torture 
that happened on the entire territory of the 
Republic of Moldova. 
One prosecutor (in some cases more than one) 
was nominated in each prosecutorial territorial 
office to carry out the examination of the 
allegations and prosecution of criminal cases on 
Coercion to Testify (art. 309 Criminal Code), 
Torture (art. 309/1 Criminal Code), Excess of 
Power or Excess of Official Authority (art. 328

and Acts of Violence against a Serviceperson 
(art. 368 Criminal Code). To assure their 
independence, prosecutors in charge of the 
investigation of cases on torture, inhuman and 
ill-treatment, nominated by the order of the chief 
prosecutor, shall not be implicated nor have any

i) Reduce the period of police 
custody to a time limit in line 
with international standards 
(maximum 48 hours), after 
which transfer the detainees 
to a pre-trial facility, where 
no further unsupervised 
contact with the interrogator 
or investigator should be 
permitted; 
ii) Ensure that no confessions 
made by persons in custody 
without the presence of a 
lawyer that are not confirmed 
before a judge are admissible 
as evidence against the 
persons who made the 
confession; Shift the burden 
of proof to the prosecution to 
prove beyond reasonable 
doubt that the confession was 
not obtained under any kind 
of duress; 
iii) Judges, prosecutors and 
medical personnel should 
routinely ask persons arriving 
from police custody how they 
have been treated;  
iv) Consider video and audio 
taping interrogations; 
v) Regularly and following 
each transfer of a detainee 
undertake medical 
examinations; 
vi) Bring the legal safeguards 
for administrative detainees 
in line with international 
standards (limit to 48 hours, 
</p>
<p>The law provided for a limit 
of 72 hours of custody, after 
which the person is to be 
brought before a judge, 
which could be prolonged by 
6 to 12 months depending on 
the crime;  
 
Police detention of minors 
could be prolonged by 30 
days up to 4 months; 
 
Prolongation of police 
detention was decided by the 
investigating judge upon 
request of the prosecutor;  
 
De-facto, most detainees 
were kept in police custody 
for several weeks/months 
and regularly returned there 
for &#8213;further investigation&#8214; or 
for their trial or appeal, 
which made them vulnerable 
to reprisals; 
 
Many allegations that 
confessions obtained under 
torture were not excluded as 
evidence during court 
proceedings, in 
contravention of the national 
legislation; numerous reports 
that judges, prosecutors and 
other actors in the criminal 
law cycle routinely ignored 
allegations of torture;

<p><b>Government:</b>  In order to develop collaboration 
between the representatives of the healthcare 
and internal affairs authorities, the Order of the 
Ministry of Health and MIA no. 372/388 of 3 
November 2009 was issued. According to its 
provisions, the healthcare facility managers shall 
inform immediately the police authorities 
regarding the healthcare assistance granted to 
persons with injuries acquired as a result of an 
offence, traffic accident or sudden death. In 
cases when injuries derive from illegal actions 
of law enforcement authorities, the health care 
facility managers shall inform immediately the 
territorial or specialized prosecutor office. 
Concerning the medical certification of 
detainees who claim physical injuries, all the 
cases referring to the incidents from the 
penitentiary institutions, including cases of 
detecting physical injuries, are compulsorily to 
be sent to the Prosecutor&#8216;s Office and to the 
Ombudsmen.  
The Medical Service examines the detainees on 
their arrival to the penitentiary in view of 
proving the presence of any physical injuries or 
other signs of violence, in accordance with 
article 251 (3) of the Enforcement Code and 
article 25 of the Statute on the Execution of 
Sentences by Convicts. The administration of 
the institution is obliged to inform, in writing 
and in the shortest time possible, the 
Penitentiary Institutions Department, the 
territorial Prosecutor&#8216;s Office and the Human 
Rights Centre about the physical injuries of 
detainees arriving in the penitentiary. 
The notes received by the Penitentiary 
Institutions Department and delivered to the 
Medical Division are included in a special 
database. From the beginning of 2009, 13 cases 
of physical injuries have been registered, of

No. 367 of 10 November 2010, 
prosecution officer allows confidential 
meetings with the client whenever 
required and without limiting the 
number and duration of the meeting. 
Access to detained or arrested persons 
without written permission from 
prosecution officer is strictly prohibited 
except for the doctor and the counsel. In 
the context of reducing the period of 
staying in the police custody of persons 
detained up to 48 hours, a study has 
been initiated to look into the legislation 
and practices of other States in order to 
determine the opportunities of reduction 
of the detention term.  
 
ii) According to the Disposal No. 
11/3966 of 26 October 2011, 
concerning the way of explanation of 
the rights of persons detained or 
subjected to other forms of deprivation 
of liberty by enforcement officers of the 
MIA, the police officer is obliged to 
explain the essence of suspicion, the 
reason, the rights of the deprived 
person. It regulates that in the case of 
the application of physical force during 
arrest or the existence of reasonable 
suspicion, the detained person will be 
obligatorily examined by a doctor, and 
if necessary by the medical personnel..

judges, prosecutors and medical 
personnel on the issue of treatment of 
detainees.  </p>

of medical records. These activities and 
organizational practices confirm where the 
person was detained, and that the detained 
person was not tortured or mistreated. The 
paramedics employed are cumulatively paid by 
the police stations, at a rate of 0.5% of their 
salary. 
 
The NPM has carried out approximately 90 
visits to places of detention in 2009. They met 
10 persons who stated that they had been ill-
treated and 27 persons with visible marks. Some 
members of the Consultative Council have been 
restricted access to places of detention or have 
been confronted with considerable delays. 
Regarding the legal basis of the NPM, on 26 
July 07, the Parliament adopted Law no. 200, 
amending and supplementing the Law on the 
Parliamentary Ombudsmen, thus assigning the 
mandate of the NPM to the Parliamentary 
Ombudsmen. In view of achieving the 
involvement of civil society, a Consultative 
Council was established, with the purpose of 
providing advice and assistance in exercising the 
Parliamentary Ombudsmen&#8216;s liabilities as NPM. 
Given the need to supplement the Consultative 
Council with 5 members, the Centre for Human 
Rights announced a call in this respect, but 
because the number of applications was 
insufficient, it was decided to extend the 
deadline for submission until 13 November 
</p><p>2009. 
 
During the first 9 months of the 2009, 117

iv) According to article 93 of the PPC, 
video and audio recordings are 
recognised as evidence in criminal 
proceedings and are taken into account. 
There are video and audio surveillance 
systems installed in prisons for 
monitoring purposes.  
 
vi) Changes and additions were made to 
Art. 175 of the Execution Code which 
states that &#8213;Arrest with procedural 
measures of constraint of up to 72 hours 
will provide a provision with respect to 
rights and fundamental freedoms and 
appropriate conditions of detention&#8214;.  
With the support of the Council of 
Europe and within the  framework of 
the implementation of the Joint 
Programme of the EU/CoE &#8213;Supporting 
Democracy in the Republic of 
Moldova&#8214;, the remand center of 
Chisinau General Police Commissariat 
has been renovated in accordance with 
the recommendations of the CPT. 
Commissioning of the refurbished IDP 
is expected in 22 December 2011. 
 
vii) In June 2011, new members of the 
NPM Consultative Council were 
elected. During January-September 
2011, the members of the Ombudsman 
institution and NPM Consultative 
Council conducted 157 visits, received 
28 acts, made 8 requests and initiated 3 
criminal cases.

<p>preventive visits were carried out. Out of these, 
31 were carried out by the members of the 
Consultative Council and 11 by the 
Parliamentary Ombudsmen and officials from 
the Centre for Human Rights. 
 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur during 
his visit in September 2009: The NPM still faces 
a number of challenges: firstly, the legal basis 
for this mechanism is rather ambiguous, which 
has led to different interpretations regarding 
which entity constitutes the NPM. From the side 
of the Ministry of Justice, it is argued that the 
Parliamentary Ombudsperson is the NPM. 
However, even the Ombudsman in charge, as 
well as other relevant actors, including 
international bodies such as the Council of 
Europe&#8216;s Commissioner on Human Rights, have 
clearly stated that the NPM is comprised of the 
Consultative Council, under the chair of the 
Parliamentary Ombudsperson. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that only the latter 
interpretation is in line with OPCAT and the 
Paris Principles. Another problem is that 
although the NPM is meant to be comprised of 
11 members, currently only six members serve 
on this mandate (including the Ombudsman). 
The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize 
that although international organisations have 
indicated their willingness to support the NPM, 
including adequate pay for its members, the 
State has the primary obligation to provide 
sufficient resources. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Although the law 
requires that persons be transferred within 72

<p>clients. The legal assistance provided to torture 
victims does not comply with international 
standards. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  On 14 March 2008, 
Parliament amended the Criminal Procedural 
Code by adding article 3-1, which stipulates that 
the burden of proof in cases of torture lies with 
the institution in which the detainee was held. 
This would appear to be a positive development, 
but the practice shows that, despite the law 
reform, the burden of proof still lies with the 
victim.  
No legislative initiatives in reducing the period 
of police custody (up to 72 hours), are 
reportedly in progress. Persons arrested under a 
warrant issued by a judge and persons convicted 
to administrative (&#8213;contraventional&#8214;) arrest 
should be detained in detention facilities of 
Ministry of Justice.  
- Although efforts were undertaken by the 
Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs in 2010 to ensure the custody of person 
initially arrested, there are still cases where 
detainees are held in police stations for several 
weeks. Persons have also been reportedly 
returned to police custody, including for &#8213;further 
investigation&#8214;, which makes them vulnerable to 
reprisals in the event of filing a complaint about 
ill-treatment.   
- Juveniles suspected of an offence may not be 
kept in police custody for more than 24 hours, 
and the detention of juveniles during the 
investigation may not exceed four months.  
- A publicly-funded legal assistance programme 
was established. 
- There is no time limit on trials or appeals or on 
detention during trial and appeal. Some cases of 
detention for a year or more are still reported. </p>

<p>Conditions in the pre-trial detention facility 
where most juveniles are detained are inhuman, 
and disciplinary sanctions violate international 
standards. 
- There have been no reported cases of refugees 
or asylum-seekers being placed in police 
custody or detention.  
- Testimonies obtained through torture are not 
excluded from criminal proceedings. Often, the 
first hearing of detained persons takes place 
without the presence of a lawyer.  
- Complaints related to the confidentiality of 
meetings with lawyers are often not considered. 
State-appointed lawyers act superficially and 
tend to cooperate greatly with the police.  
- Judges, prosecutors and medical personnel do 
not generally ask about details of the treatment 
while in custody.  
- In practice, interrogations are not recorded on 
audio or on video.  
- The National Forensic Centre only documents 
the results of forensic examination superficially, 
often failing to meet international standards. It is 
not independent.  
- Although the law requires a doctor and/or 
penal institution to inform the chief prosecutor 
about evidences of torture or other ill-treatment, 
in some cases no action is taken to this effect. 
Evidence of psychological trauma or other 
indications of torture are generally not 
undertaken, which leads to under-
documentation. Domestic courts favour the 
official over independent medical sources 
provided by victims or their representatives. 
- The preventive medical examination of 
detainees in prisons does not allow for the 
proper documentation of torture.  
- Although access by the NPM to places of 
detention has reportedly improved, it remains de </p>

<p>facto dysfunctional. Efforts to improve 
functionality of the NPM have been seriously 
hindered by an internal conflict between the 
Ombudsman (chairman of NPM) and three 
members of the Consultative Council.  
- In November 2009, the Committee Against 
Torture issued a detailed recommendation 
(CAT/C/MDA/CO/2) regarding the 
improvement of the NPM&#8216;s functionality 
through strengthening its independence and 
capacity. 
- The NPM is not well-known to the public at 
large. It does not have a separate budget line or 
other resources that might be managed for the 
specialized purposes. 
- An Action Plan on the Protection of Children&#8216;s 
Rights and Prevention and Combating of 
Juvenile Delinquency covering 2008&#8211;2010 was 
adopted, but implementation has been minimal. 
Efforts undertaken by the juvenile inspectors 
and the Commissions on Minors in the area of 
prevention were not effective.  
- No prevention programmes directed 
specifically at children at high risk of offending 
(secondary prevention) exist.  
- The law and procedures concerning young 
children involved in criminal conduct are poorly 
defined. In particular, compliance with the &#8215;last 
resort&#8216; principle is not required and the right to 
legal assistance in such proceedings is not 
recognized. 
- During the last five years, the number of 
juvenile prisoners serving sentences has 
fluctuated between a high of 138 in 2006 and a 
low of 32 in May-June 2009. The number of 
juveniles confined in the &#8215;special school&#8216; for 
children has fallen by almost 90 per cent during 
the period 2001&#8211;2008.

<p>i) Continue and accelerate 
reforms of the prosecutor&#8216;s 
office, the police and the 
penitentiary system with a 
view to transforming them 
into truly client-oriented 
bodies that operate 
transparently, including 
through modernized and 
demilitarized training; 
ii) Strengthen the 
independence of the 
judiciary; make judges aware 
of their responsibilities 
with regard to torture 
prevention; 
iii) Conceive the system of 
execution of punishments and 
its legal framework in a way 
that truly aims at 
rehabilitation and 
reintegration of offenders, in 
particular through 
abolishing restrictive 
detention rules and 
maximizing contact with the 
outside world;  
iv) Take further steps to 
improve food and access to 
health care;  
v) Strengthen further non-
custodial measures before and 
after trial. 
</p>
<p>judges who in many cases 
continued to follow the 
arguments of the prosecutor 
without intervening in cases 
of alleged torture;  
 
The legal framework and 
penitentiary policies in 
Moldova were punitive, 
directed at locking people 
up, rather than aimed at 
reintegrating prisoners, in 
particular extremely 
restrictive visiting policies 
and numerous constraints on 
contacts with the outside 
world;  
 
Common problems at all 
pre- and post-trial prisons 
were poor hygienic 
conditions, restricted access 
to health care and lack of 
medication as well as risk of 
contamination with 
tuberculosis and other 
diseases; 
 
The periods of pre-trial 
detention were extensive; 
several of his interviewees 
had spent up to three or four 
years in detention without a 
final judgment. 
</p>
<p>seminars are taking place, there is still need for 
administrative and institutional measures 
including further trainings in the MIA and 
involvement of all actors in torture prevention.  
The MIA is in the process of implementing the 
Institutional Development Plan for 2009-10, 
which was developed in the context of reforms 
of the entire central public administration. In this 
view, the Ministry aligns to European standards 
and adjusts the existing legal framework to the 
EU acquis of decentralization, demilitarization 
and de-politicization of its activities, improving 
the management of service to society. 
In addition, the Ministry has organized and 
conducted instructive methodological seminars 
for leadership and personnel of subdivisions of 
the criminal prosecution. The seminars 
concerned different topics, the main emphasis 
being on the observance of the law by police 
officers in the criminal investigation work. The 
Ministry set up a committee on fundamental 
rights and freedoms of citizens. In the same 
context, it issued an ordinance on procedural 
time limits, according to which prosecution 
officers must provide a report to the Ministry 
with a view to control and coordinate the 
extension of periods of arrest. Furthermore, 
billboards on rights and obligations of persons 
suspected, detained, arrested and prosecuted 
were set up. Similarly, all sections of the 
prosecution authorities were provided with 
models of procedural documents, such as 
minutes/process-verbaux of apprehension and 
explanations of the rights and obligations of the 
detained persons, compiled by the General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office. 
The preliminary report regarding the respect of 
rights of detained persons, elaborated by the 
Institute for Penal Reform within the project 
</p>
<p>Sector Reform for 2011-2016, adopted 
recently by the Government, creates the 
institutional framework necessary to 
coordinate reform actions with the 
assistance provided by the development 
partners to the justice sector. Practical 
implementation of the Strategy and 
application of its specific components 
will help develop a justice sector which 
is fair, of high quality, with zero 
tolerance to corruption, contributing to 
the sustainable development of the 
country. The overall objective of the 
Strategy is to build an accessible, 
efficient, independent, transparent, 
professional justice sector, with high 
public accountability and consistent 
with European standards, to ensure the 
rule of law and protection of human 
rights.  
 
In accordance with the concept of the 
MIA reform and the Action Plan, the 
reform process is divided into three 
stages: 
</p>
<p>- Development of the legal 
framework (2011); 
</p>
<p>- Creating the institutional and 
functional framework in order 
to regulate the activity of the 
subdivisions (2011-2012);  
</p>
<p>- Capacity building of 
subdivisions regarding the 
implementation of the newly 
approved MIAframework.  
</p>
<p>40 draft laws, normative and 
departmental acts have been adopted.  
 
The MIA has initiated an assessment </p>

<p>&#8213;Strengthening Criminal Justice System Reform 
in Moldova&#8214;, was sent to the heads of criminal 
prosecution bodies of territorial subdivisions, in 
order to undertake measures to eliminate any 
violations in the future. The MIA participated in 
the working group set up by the General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office, where the draft of the 
&#8215;Instructions on how to grant visits and 
telephone conversations to persons detained in 
preventive arrest&#8216; was elaborated. 
A law was drafted to amend some legislative 
acts for the re-examination of the applicable 
disciplinary regime for judges, which represents 
a balance between the guarantee of the judges&#8216; 
independence and the necessity of sanctioning a 
judge in case his or her behaviour necessitates 
such action.  
 
In order to ensure the impartiality of judges, an 
amendment to the law is proposed, introducing 
an obligation of the judge to inform the 
president of the court and the Superior Council 
of Magistrates about any attempt to influence 
the process of decision making.  
Regarding conflicts of interest, a draft law is 
proposed to complete article 15 of the Law on 
the Status of Judges, which would stipulate the 
obligation of the judge to present a declaration 
regarding his or her personal interests. 
A reform of the judicial organizational system is 
proposed, which includes the abolition of 
specialized law courts (Chisinau Economical 
District Court, Military Court, Economical 
Appeals Court). The specialized courts&#8216; duties 
shall be taken over by the courts of common 
jurisdiction.  
 
In March 2009, a decision of the Supreme Court 
was issued, clarifying many aspects of case law 
</p>
<p>and reforms of the police activity. 
 
Public- private partnerships and projects 
have been launched for:  
</p>
<p>- Installation of video 
surveillance systems in all 
police commissariats in the 
country; 
</p>
<p>- Contracting and installing 
automatic surveillance systems 
on the national routes; 
</p>
<p>- Implementation of modern 
methods in investigating 
crimes by applying modern 
technology in order to 
eradicate ill-treatment.  
</p>
<p>iv) During 2011, 9431 cases of illness 
in penitentiary institutions were 
documented. Medical services have 
been implemented in the context of the 
National Programmes for HIV/AIDS, 
ITS and TB control, and extended to the 
external consultations on various health 
problems (193 cases), inclusively to 
private medical consultations (12 
cases).

<p>concerning Art. 3 ECHR. There have been 24 
ECtHR judgments against Moldova under Art. 
</p><p>3. Aspects of the Plenum decision include the 
requirement that detainees are registered; the 
registration of officials present; that the person 
not be interrogated in the absence of an &#8213;escort&#8214;; 
and an unbiased investigation into allegations of 
ill-treatment. The Superior Council has held 
seminars on Article 3 and the case law against 
Moldova. 
 
One of the objectives of the continuous training 
of judges is their conscious involvement in the 
eradication of torture. In this context, thematic 
seminars on preventive arrest were organized, 
especially for instruction judges, judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers. 
From the beginning of 2008 the Ministry of 
Justice has undertaken numerous activities in the 
field of promotion of human rights. Within the 
Training on Human Rights the following topics 
were included: &#8213;The minimum standards of 
maintenance of convicted persons&#8214;, &#8213;The 
European Convention for the Prevention of 
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment&#8214;, &#8213;The Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights&#8214; and &#8213;The national, regional and 
international mechanisms of human rights 
protection&#8214;.   
 
The regimes in the penitentiaries have been 
established according to the Execution Code and 
are characteristic to each type of penitentiary, 
which represents different stages of the 
punishment of deprivation of liberty. Thus, the 
practice envisages different stages within the 
respective process. The first one (the initial 
regime), a reduced period compared to the total 
term of the sentence, represents the stage of </p>

according to rules nos. 16, 51, and 52 of the 
Recommendations of the Committee of 
Ministries of the CoE no. R2006 (2). 
Generally speaking, the appreciation that the 
penitentiary policy is still punitive does not 
correspond to reality. Thus, the provisions 
regarding the regimes of detention (art. 269 to 
273 Execution Code) constitute a progressive 
evolution of rights of detainees in relation to 
their behaviour. The enforcement depends on 
the punishment and the behaviour of the 
detainees, the danger they represent, based on an 
evaluation of the personality and behaviour, as 
well as on their individual plan of serving the 
sentence.  
 
Regarding visits, the law stipulates the right of 
the detainee to at least one visit a month. 
Nevertheless, depending on the behaviour of the 
convicted person, the penitentiary administration 
can grant additional visits. Consequently, 
depending on his/her behaviour and his/her 
attitude towards labour (remunerated or not), the 
convicted person may benefit from 22 long- and 
short-term visits during a year. The penitentiary 
program includes also educational training, 
labour and sport activities etc., which, along 
with social assistance granted by the 
administration, contribute to the reintegration of 
the convicted persons into society. 
According to art. 227, 228 and 229 of the 
Execution Code, detainees have access to 
information, files, correspondence and telephone 
calls and can address correspondence to law 
enforcement bodies, central public authorities 
and international intergovernmental 
organizations. Post boxes were installed in all </p>

A number of deficiencies of conditions of 
detention have been asserted in 21 temporary 
detention facilities (isolators) of the territorial 
police commissariats. As a result, relevant letters 
have been addressed to commissariats in Balti, 
Basarabeasca, Cimislia, Soldanesti, Rezina, 
Vulcanesti, Comrat, Leova, Orhei, Cahul, 
Causeni, Anenii-Noi, Gagauzia and Floresti with 
deadlines for proper actions to be undertaken to 
redress the situation. 
Despite the undertaken measures to create 
decent conditions of detention, in some 
temporary detention isolators the situation 
remains complicated: 
- lack of natural illumination and ventilation in 
cells (Balti, Bender, Anenii-Noi, Basarabeasca, 
Cahul, Causeni, Cimislia, Drochia, Floresti, 
Hincesti, Leova, Riscani, Singerei, Soldanesti, 
Soroca, Telenesti, Comrat, Vulcanesti and the 
Operative Service Department of the MIA); 
- lack of  mattresses, blankets and pillows (Balti, 
Bender, Anenii-Noi, Basarabeasca, Causeni, 
Floresti, Hincesti, Leova, Rezina, Riscani, 
Soldanesti, Telenesti, Vulcanesti); 
- lack of adequate sanitary facilities in cells 
(Bender, Anenii-Noi, Basarabeasca, Cahul, 
Causeni, Cimislia, Floresti, Hincesti, Leova, 
Nisporeni, Ocnita, Rezina, Riscani, Singerei, 
Soldanesti, Telenesti, Comrat, Vulcanesti and 
the Operative Service Department of the MIA). 
The quality of the food has been improved and 
detainees are now given something to eat three 
times per day. 
In 2008, 2,878 persons were detained, out of 
which 2,037 were under preventive detention. In 
2009, 2,644 persons were detained, out of which </p>

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The criminal 
investigation bodies continue to have a punitive 
attitude. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  As of 2010, the 
prosecutor&#8216;s offices, the police and the 
penitentiary system still operate on the basis of 
the soviet structure, and are fully militarized. In 
2010, several efforts to demilitarize the 
prosecutor&#8216;s office failed.  
- Moldovan legislation and practice are 
incompatible with international standards as far 
as the use of isolation or solitary confinement as 
a disciplinary measure for juveniles is 
concerned. 
- Although the establishment in 2010 of two 
separate units for the investigation of torture and 
juvenile justice within the General Prosecutor&#8216;s 
Office and in each regional prosecutor&#8216;s office is 
a positive development, there are some concerns 
as to the effectiveness and independence of the 
new anti-torture prosecutors.  
- Despite some positive developments, the 
Government has not done much to promote the 
independence of the judiciary. The Ministry of 
Justice has repeatedly been involved in 
removing judges, including Supreme Court 
judges, including for highly questionable 
reasons such as &#8213;losing cases in Strasbourg&#8214; and 
for intentionally delaying the prosecution of 
eminent cases linked to the April 2009 events.  
- On 30 October 2009, the Supreme Court of 
Justice issued a guidance decision on the 
application of article 3 of the European 
Convention of Human Rights in domestic 
courts. This non-binding guidance, while not 
perfect, provides important guidance for the </p>

- Although the Enforcement Code has various 
provisions with respect to the rights of inmates 
to hold private correspondence and telephone 
conversations and receive food parcels, these 
rights are not envisaged adequately due to, for 
example, lack of public telephones in most 
institutions and a lack of clear regulations for 
appointments. 
- The criminal subculture and prisoner&#8216;s 
hierarchy is partially supported by the prisons&#8216; 
administrations as a mechanism of non-formal 
control over the detainees.  
- The problem of food shortage in penitentiary 
institutions remains. In 2007, the amount 
allocated from the state budget for feeding 
prisoners constituted 53.2% of the minimum 
necessary, in 2008 - 49.8%, and from January to 
August 2009 it was 64.4%, average being 
allocated about 3.6 lei per day for a prisoner. 
Average daily dietary amount of value remains 
two times smaller than required by law. 
- During the period of 2008-2009, the 
Government undertook renovation in the 
medical centre of women&#8216;s penitentiary in 
Rusca. The Centre includes a gynaecology 
office, a dentist, an internal therapy-medicine 
office and a clinical laboratory. UNFPA 
complemented these efforts by providing 
medical equipment and furniture. 
- In September 2010, probation services were 
transferred to the Department of Penitentiary 
Services. It is unclear, however, whether this 
reform will have positive impact due to widely 
practiced disciplinary attitude among probation 
staff. The pre-trial probation reports are used 
only in a limited number of cases. 
- There is only limited implementation of the 
2008 Law on Mediation due to the lack of and </p>

- The current arrangements have been described 
by experts as being very weak in the area of 
rehabilitation and social integration of victims.  
- The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
noted with regret that some of its concerns and 
recommendations regarding juvenile justice had 
not been adequately addressed, and reiterated its 
previous recommendation that a separate system 
of juvenile justice fully in line with the 
Convention be established. 
(CRC/C/MDA/CO/3, paras. 7 and 73). 
- No document containing a global strategy for 
juvenile justice reform exists. A strategy can be 
inferred from the programme document of the 
2003-2005 and 2008-2011 juvenile justice 
projects.  
The programme document of the 2008-2011 had 
the following three &#8215;priority areas&#8216; and three 
&#8215;secondary areas&#8216;: continued legal reform; 
development of a probation service; revision of 
effective legal assistance; provision of services 
to children in detention; prevention of juvenile 
delinquency; and training of juvenile justice 
professionals. 
Although the stated objectives are broad, the 
project is more holistic, in particular in 
addressing the need for more coherent 
prevention policies and programmes. There are 
still some gaps, however. Emphasis on diversion 
and alternative sentences seems to come at the 
expense of attention to the programmes applied 
in correctional facilities and services for 
juveniles leaving correctional facilities and 
returning to the community. Accountability is </p>

<p>not addressed directly by the project.  
- NGOs played a small role in the 
implementation of the 2008&#8211;2011 project.  
- There is a lack of ownership by the national 
authorities as regards the implementation of the 
project and of the process of developing a 
juvenile justice system.  
- Although there has been some improvement in 
the treatment of juveniles after the designation 
of prosecutors in each trial court, the impact is 
still limited, in part because the designated 
judges have insufficient training and because 
many of them handle a rather small number of 
cases involving juveniles. In 2008, only two 
courts outside the capital handled more than one 
juvenile case per week and 17 district courts 
handled on average less than one case per 
month. 
- A training manual for judges, prosecutors and 
police has been developed and incorporated into 
the curricula of the National Institute of Justice, 
which trains judges and prosecutors, and the 
Police Academy. The first class of 20 
prosecutors and 9 judges graduated in 2009.  
130 judges and prosecutors were trained in child 
rights in six seminars (CRC/C/MDA/3, para. 
374).   
Opinions on the impact of training vary. 
- Changes to the Criminal Code made in 2009 
reduce sentences for certain crimes. Although 
the measures can be considered as steps towards 
compliance with the &#8215;last resort&#8216; and &#8215;shortest 
appropriate period of time&#8216; principles, set forth 
in article 37(b) of the CRC, they do not comply 
fully with these principles.

juveniles given custodial sentences has fallen 
sharply, from 194 in 2004 to 100 in 2008. The

<p>custodial sentences rose sharply during the same 
period, because the number of convictions fell 
dramatically, from 1,774 in 2004 to 445 in 2008. 
The decline in the number of juveniles given 
custodial sentences is due in part to a 2008 
amnesty. 
- The main alternative sentence used is 
&#8215;conditional suspension of the sentence&#8216;, 
equivalent of probation. In 2008, fines were 
imposed on approximately 10 per cent of 
convicted juveniles, and community service on 
nearly 25 per cent. Some convicted juveniles 
reject sentences of community service because it 
is considered demeaning, and there is some 
hostility towards offenders.  
- The number of persons below age 18 being 
supervised by the Probation Service at the end of 
2008 was approximately 1,000, and 170 new 
cases were added to the caseload during the first 
four months of 2009.  
- A Probation Service and a publicly funded 
Legal Aid Service have been established and are 
in the process of developing specialized staff or 
programmes for juveniles. Measures intended to 
prevent abuse of juvenile suspects have been 
introduced and the recently established 
ombudspersons play a valuable role in 
investigating the situation of juvenile suspects, 
detainees and prisoners. 
- A Law on Mediation has come into force and 
mediators have been trained and certified. 
Referral of cases involving juveniles to 
mediation has begun and results are positive.

that both civilians and police officers who 
suffered physical or psychological trauma would 
be provided with the rehabilitation and 
compensation.  
- The identification of the victims was delegated 
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry 
of Health, with the help of non-governmental 
organizations. Non-identified victims can still 
submit applications accompanied with other 
documents. As of 1 June 2010, there had been 
no monetary compensation paid to the victims, 
although a draft decision on the first payments to 
19 victims has reportedly been forwarded to the 
Government for approval. 
- In practice, the primary victim rehabilitation 
centre remains severely under-resourced. 
</p>
<p>A new commission, established by the 
Prime Minister, was constituted on 14 
April 2011, and began activity on 29 
April 2011, with the task to identify 
civilian persons and Ministry of Interior 
officials who were victims of the April 
2009 events. The new commission is 
reportedly constituted for an unlimited 
term, and is charged with identifying 
persons for compensation and 
rehabilitation measures. 
</p>
<p>There is no consistent official number 
of persons subjected to abuse during the 
April 2009 events, but NGOs estimate 
the figure to be circa 700 persons. 
According to the data presented by the 
Deputy Minister of Justice in the 
Parliamentary hearing of April 14, 
2011, the victims of the April 2009 
events are 467 civilians and 271 
employees of the Ministry of Interior. 
 
There is no annual budget reserved for 
providing adequate compensation 
and/or medical assistance. 
 
Following the April 2009 events, only 
15 civilians and 5 policemen received 
compensations, a total of 20 victims.  
 
On 12 May 2011, the Parliament of the 
Republic of Moldova adopted the 
National Action Plan on Human Rights 
for the period 2011-2014, which 
includes Chapter IV which refers to 
granting legal assistance to victims of 
torture and other ill-treatment.

<p>According to the Decision 299 of the 
Ministry of Healthcare of the Republic 
of Moldova,  the Republican Clinical 
Hospital has been chosen to provide 
medical assistance to April 2009 
victims.  However, this does not include 
other victims of torture and ill-
treatment. Also this decision appears to 
have no clear mechanism of 
implementation and funding. 
 
The primary entity conducting 
rehabilitation for torture victims is an 
NGO, RCTV &#8213;Memoria&#8214;.

i) Ensure adequate funding 
for the existing infrastructure 
to support victims of 
domestic violence and 
trafficking and extend the 
network of centres providing 
psycho-social, legal and 
residential services to all parts 
of the country taking into 
account the increased 
vulnerability of women and 
girls in rural areas;

female law enforcement 
units;

mechanisms to implement the 
new Law on preventing and 
combating family violence in 
practice, including through a 
Plan of Action for its 
implementation and 
monitoring, including through 
allocation of adequate 
</p>
<p>The scale of trafficking was 
relatively unknown because 
most victims were not 
identified due to the absence 
of systematic identification 
processes and the inability or 
unwillingness of some 
victims to report their 
trafficking experiences; 
The infrastructure to support 
survivors of domestic 
violence was lacking in most 
parts of the country (only 
one shelter existed in July 
2008, which was privately 
run and situated in the 
capital). 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Through the three Health Centres 
for Women, women subjected to any form of 
violence or trafficking are provided with 
psychological counselling, followed by a 
medical examination and placement in a 
rehabilitation centre, if necessary. The 12 Youth 
Friendly Health Centres provide a psychologist, 
consultancy and educational discussions, 
healthcare services for detecting diseases, as 
well as supervision and medical and 
psychological rehabilitation of victims of 
trafficking. 
 
During 2009, the Maternal Centre of Placement 
and Rehabilitation for young children from 
Chisinau municipality accepted a victim of 
trafficking and other five persons facing the risk 
of being trafficked. They have been provided 
with psychological counselling, medical 
examinations and rehabilitation assistance. 
A priority in the field of combating and 
preventing domestic violence is the creation and 
consolidation of the services that are currently 
underdeveloped and are provided mainly by 
NGOs. Three centres are highlighted:  
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>i) The MIA with the 
support of the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA) has 
developed a curriculum for the heads of 
operative sector officers, concerning the 
implementation of the legislation on 
preventing and combating domestic 
violence and methods of intervention 
and duties of each member of the team 
in case of domestic violence.  
 
A manual has been developed by the 
UNFPA for the students of the 
Academy &#8213;Stefan cel Mare&#8214; of the MIA 
</p>
<p>concerning the implementation of the 
legislation on preventing and combating 
domestic violence.  
Four training sessions have been carried 
out within the National Institute of 
Justice with the participation of 
prosecutors, employees of the MIA and 
the MLSPF, lawyers and judges of the 
administrative-territorial units, the

provides temporary placement and counselling 
services (psychological, social, legal) to mothers 
and children as victims of domestic violence; 
- the Family Crisis Centre &#8213;SOTIS&#8214; (Balti) 
provides counselling to victims of domestic

human trafficking. 
In the framework of  the Project &#8222;Better 
Opportunities for Youth and Women&#8214;, 
financially supported by the International 
Agency for Development of the USA (USAID), 
ten multifunctional centres for social 
reintegration (with placement) were set up, 
which provide services for victims of human 
trafficking and victims of domestic violence. 
According to a Disposition by the Ministry of 
Health (no. 373-d of 15 June 2009), the 
Directors of Family Doctors Centres of Anenii 
Noi, &#350;old&#259;ne&#351;ti, Rezina and Vulc&#259;ne&#351;ti districts 
shall ensure that deputy directors, responsible

five pilot rayons by establishing the so-
called Multidisciplinary Teams (MDT) 
composed of all relevant specialists 
responsible for identifying and referring 
victims and providing protection and 
assistance to beneficiaries together with 
the NGOs. Since 2009, the NRS was 
expanded at the community level in 4 
NRS rayons, and the MDT approach 
was introduced in two rayons and one 
town from Transnistrian region. </p>

<p>Violence in the Family entered into force on 18 
September 2008. It includes important 
provisions on domestic violence, establishes an 
institutional framework with detailed 
responsibilities of the relevant authorities, 
provides for the creation of centres/services for 
the rehabilitation of victims and aggressors, and 
for complaints mechanisms, protection orders 
and punishment of aggressors. In order to 
implement this law, a draft law regarding the 
amendment and modification of a number of 
legal acts shall be enacted. The objective of this 
draft law is to amend the following normative 
acts:  
Criminal Code:  
- Introducing  an article on the definition of the 
family member; 
- Introducing a new offence: violence in the 
family; 
- Introducing  a new offence: sexual harassment; 
- Introducing an article related to rape in order to 
include matrimonial rape; 
- Introducing a new offence related to the 
violation of a protection order.  
Criminal Procedure Code:  
- Introducing  a new article on the protection of 
the victim of domestic violence; 
- Stipulating the obligation of the prosecutor and 
court to verify if the victim of domestic violence 
expressed freely his or her consent for 
reconciliation. 
Civil Procedure Code: 
- Introducing a new chapter on special 
procedures for the application of protection 
actions in cases of domestic violence.  
The Ministry of Labour, Family and Social 
Protection has developed a draft of a 
Government Decision on approval of the 
Regulations regarding the organization and 
</p>
<p>Currently, the NRS is expanded to 
provide protection and assistance in all 
rayons throughout the Republic of 
Moldova.   
 
Another mechanism is the monthly 
Technical Coordination Meetings 
(TCM) on anti-trafficking and gender 
hosted by the OSCE Mission in 
Moldova, aimed at further coordination 
among anti-trafficking actors and  
encouraging an ongoing exchange of 
information. The meetings are co-
chaired by the Ministry of Labour, 
Social Protection and Family which 
reports on the activities carried out by 
the Government.  
The National Institute of Justice is 
expanding its module on THB and 
domestic violence that targets primarily 
judges, prosecutors and police officers.  
Currently a monitoring system covering 
all the trafficking cases is being 
established to cover the activity of law 
enforcement and judiciary, from 
discovery of the case to pronouncing of 
irrevocable sentences in the court. The 
system will allow increased 
transparency of prosecution and will be 
enforced through direct Parliamentary 
control. 
 
iii) The Ministry of Labour, Social 
Protection and Family has initiated the 
harmonization of the development of 
the draft framework Regulation for the 
organization and operation of centres 
for rehabilitation of victims of domestic </p>

process of finalization. 
In the context of the development of a joint 
methodology for collecting statistical data 
regarding domestic violence, the project 
&#8213;Development of an integrated information 
system for management of data on violence 
within the family in the Republic of Moldova&#8214; 
was launched on 1 July 2008. It is funded by the 
Agency for International Assistance of the 
Romanian Government for Moldova and 
implemented by UNFPA in cooperation with the 
Ministry of Social Protection, Family and 
Children and civil society.  In the framework of 
this Project, the concept of the informational 
system &#8213;State Register of Cases of Violence 
within the Family&#8214; was approved by 
Government Decision no. 544 on 9 September 
2009. This system will significantly contribute 
to the continuous monitoring of domestic 
violence and statistical analyses will provide a 
consistent basis for developing effective policies 
to prevent and combat domestic violence and 
will facilitate the cooperation between the 
appropriate institutions. In order to initiate the 
process of statistical data collection, statistical 
cards were developed for recording cases of 
violence within the family for experts from three 
branches (health, social protection and police). 
This process was launched in two pilot districts: 
Drochia and Cahul. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Moldova is a 
source and, to a lesser extent, a transit and 
destination country for trafficking in women, 
men and children for purposes of forced 
prostitution, begging and forced labour. The 
small breakaway region of Transnistria in 
</p>
<p>violence and on the Minimum Quality 
Standards for social services provided 
to victims of domestic violence 
approved by the <i>Decision of the 
Government</i> <i>No. 1200 from 23.12.2010. 
</i>In 2011, law enforcement bodies sent 
153 requests for protection orders to 
courts and supervised the 
implementation of 178 protection 
orders. Law enforcement bodies have 
intervened and assisted in solving 77 
cases of domestic violence.  
In 2011, the MIA jointly with the 
International Center &quot;La Strada&quot; has 
organized a national seminar and two 
international seminars on &quot;Combating 
Sexual Exploitation of Children - 
exchange of good practices,&quot; &quot;Audience 
of the minor victims / witnesses of 
sexual abuse &quot;. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The 
reported number of child victims of 
violence has steadily increased over the 
past few years and is known to be 
underreported. Corporal punishment, 
while officially banned, is still widely 
used. Studies indicate that 25% of 
children state that they are beaten by 
their own parents, 13% report being 
corporally punished in schools by their 
school teachers.  
According to the most recent 2010 
survey results by National Bureau of 
Statistics, the total prevalence rate of 
spousal/partner violence against women 
over lifetime since the age of 15 is 
63.4%. The prevalence rate of violence </p>

<p>eastern Moldova is outside the central 
Government&#8216;s control and remained a source of 
trafficking. 
- The new Government demonstrated a high-
level commitment to combating trafficking by 
establishing a cabinet-level national committee 
on trafficking led by the foreign minister and, 
fully funded and staffed Permanent Secretariat 
of the National Committee for Preventing 
Trafficking in Persons. The Government 
continued funding the trafficking assistance 
centre run jointly by the government and the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM). 
- Since 2006, the Government has been 
implementing the National Referral System for 
Assistance and Protection of Victims and 
Potential Victims of Trafficking (NRS) - a 
comprehensive system of cooperation between 
governmental and non-governmental agencies 
involved in combating human trafficking. On 5 
December 2008, the NRS Strategy 2009 - 2016 
and Action Plan 2009 - 2011 were approved by 
the Parliament. 
- As of 2010, the Assistance and Protection 
Centre for Victims and Potential Victims of 
Trafficking in Human Beings (CAPC) has been 
established within the NRS which was 
subordinated to the Ministry of Labor, Social 
Protection and Family, and is jointly coordinated 
by the IOM. The CAPC provides temporary 
residence, psychological, social and legal 
support to victims. In 2008, the Government 
institutionalized the CAPC.  
- The NRS is being implemented in the regions 
through the creation and training of 
multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) composed of a 
wide range of specialists. Since 2006, MDTs 
have been created and trainings have been 
carried out in 26 territorial units of Moldova. 
</p>
<p>over lifetime among rural women 
(68.2%) is slightly higher than among 
urban ones (57.4%). The highest 
percentage of women who have ever 
experienced spousal/partner violence is 
among those in the age group of 45-54 
(70.3%), followed by women in the age 
group of 55-59 (69.1%). However, even 
women in the age group of 15-34 report 
high percentages of such experiences 
(53.7% of the age group of 15-24 and 
55.7% of the age group 25-34). 
Progress was made during the period 
September 2009 &#8211; present, in improving 
system-responses to domestic violence, 
with the first circa 40 protection orders 
issued by certain courts to victims under 
the 2008 Law on domestic violence.  In 
addition, in September 2010, 
amendments were made to a number of 
laws to heighten the efficacy of the 
legal framework for combating 
domestic violence and other forms of 
violence against women, including 
amendments to strengthen the civil 
procedure code and criminal procedure 
codes. The new legislation also 
criminalizes sexual harassment and 
domestic violence. 
Nevertheless, reportedly effective 
protection to victims remains 
unavailable, particularly (but not only) 
in rural areas.  In early 2011, the 
European Court of Human Rights 
communicated the first cases brought 
against Moldova concerning women 
and children for whom courts had 
ordered protection, but police had </p>

</i></p>
<p>The Government is working on creating MDTs 
in all rayons by 2012.  
- The Government has not yet established 
specialized female law enforcement units. 
- With the Law on Preventing and Combating 
Domestic Violence (Law No. 45) in force since 
September 2008 and with the support of IOM, 
UNFPA and other partners, the NRS started 
extending the same assistance to victims and 
potential victims of domestic violence. Several 
capacity-building events were conducted for 
district and community level specialists in five 
districts. 
- The 2008 law authorizes courts to issue 
protection orders within 24 hours of receiving a 
request for such an order. Since September 
2009, about 28 protection orders have been 
issued. There are concerns about the low level of 
knowledge about the provisions of the law on 
domestic violence, general awareness and 
tolerance of the public towards the phenomenon. 
Protection orders have only been issued in a 
limited number of jurisdictions, namely Anenii 
Noi, Soldanesti, Vulcanesti, Causeni, Falesti, 
Rezina and, from June 2010, Chisinau. 
- The Law 167/2010 also requires the district 
police and social assistance offices to appoint 
persons responsible for the prevention and 
combating of domestic violence. At the 
community level, mayors will be responsible for 
the supervision and coordination of such 
measures.   
- Negotiations over creating the first 
rehabilitation centre for victims of domestic 
violence in Drochia district are under way. The 
Ministry of Labour, Social Protection and 
</p>
<p>allegedly declined or otherwise failed to 
protect the persons concerned.52 A 
number of issues remain outstanding as 
concerns strengthening the system of 
protections for victims of domestic 
violence. Above all, serious and urgent 
attention should be paid to ensuring that 
police act promptly and effectively to 
ensure protection to victims. The 
Government might also be urged to 
support more vigorously the 
implementation of awareness raising 
campaigns on domestic violence 
including by ensuring effective 
placement of social advertisement in 
media.  
Civil society organizations also report 
problems with respect to impunity for 
family violence against the elderly.  
Due to the stigma associated with abuse 
at the community level and family, 
particularly in rural areas, many older 
people remain silent about the fact of 
violence in the family. A series of focus 
group discussions conducted by the 
civil society organisation HelpAge 
indicates that just over 40% of older 
people in such groups said they had 
experienced violence at home and 80% 
said they knew of a close older friend or 
relative experiencing violence at home. 
Older women stated they experienced 
violence at home from their husbands or 
grown up children.

<p>Family has committed to cover partially the 
costs of the centre in 2011. 
- The above efforts have been complemented by 
nationwide awareness-raising events, aimed at 
raising a non-tolerant attitude towards domestic 
violence and promoting a trust-line for victims 
of domestic violence.  
- One further step towards the prevention of 
domestic violence is the recent approval of the 
National Program on Gender Equality 2010-
2015 and the National Action Plan on Gender 
Equality 2010-2012 (Government Decision no. 
933 of 31 December 2009). A working group is 
currently working on adjusting the domestic 
legislation on gender equality with international 
standards.  
 
<b>Government:</b> Significant progress was achieved 
in relation to national response to gender-based 
violence. On 3 September 2010, the Law No. 
167 on amending the current legislation to 
provide an implementing mechanism for the law 
on family violence was approved by the 
Parliament.  
-The Model Regulations for the Rehabilitation 
Centre for Victims of Family Violence 
(Government Decision No.129 of 22 February 
2010) was approved. 
-The draft Quality Standards in Delivering 
Assistance for Victims of Family Violence is 
still under revision and is expected to be 
approved by the end of 2010.  
-Based on the above legislation, the Government 
with the support of UNFPA, has developed the 
draft of profession specific guidelines for the 
implementation of legislation in the area of 
domestic violence for police officers, medical 
staff and social assistants.  
-The guidelines is currently being reviewed by 
</p>
<p>It is reported that currently the National 
Referral System (NRS) operates in 35 
administrative units of Moldova, 
including 32 rayons, 2 municipalities 
and one town thorough its 
multidisciplinary teams - local/regional 
operational units of the NRS formed of 
specialists such as social assistants, 
police, doctors, professors, etc. By 
2011, the NRS is slated to be expanded 
to provide protection and assistance in 
all rayons throughout the Republic of 
Moldova.  
The NRS aims at social and economic 
empowerment of the disadvantaged 
groups vulnerable to trafficking in 
human beings and domestic violence 
(potential victims/at-risk cases), which 
includes a specific component for this 
purpose &#8211; pro-active prevention by 
providing social assistance to potential 
victims of trafficking in persons and 
domestic violence. In order to avoid the 
risk of trafficking in the case of 
disadvantaged persons, 
multidisciplinary teams supervised by 
the NRS Coordination Unit, in co-
operation with International 
Organization for Migration and local 
NGOs identify and provide individual 
assistance to potential victims of 
trafficking in human beings. Other 
types of support includes &#8211; medical and 
psychological assistance, material 
support facilitating procedure for 
obtaining social benefits, legal 
assistance, assistance in obtaining IDs.

- The issues of violence against women and 
domestic violence are specifically targeted in the 
National Programme on Gender Equality for 
2010-2015.   
- During the period of 2009-2010, the 
representatives of the Ministry of Labour, Social 
Protection and Family and civil society have 
participated in the drafting process of the 
Council of Europe Convention to prevent and 
combat domestic violence and violence against 
women. Upon the realization and approval of the 
treaty, the Republic of Moldova will 
automatically become signatory state.  
- UNFPA supported the development of a 
number of methodological tools for different 
target groups, including analytical programmes 
for legal, social and psychological assistance in 
cases of domestic violence for Master course 
students; rehabilitation programme  for victims 
of domestic violence and perpetrators; guide for 
interventions in cases of domestic violence for 
multidisciplinary teams; analytical programme 
for police officers; a Guide on implementation 
of the Law No. 45 on preventing and combating 
domestic violence, including the Protection 
Order for judges.  
Services for victims of domestic violence 
include: shelters and support centres providing 
assistance and rehabilitation to female victims of 
domestic violence; counselling services for child 
victims of domestic violence; centres for 
assistance and protection of victims and 
potential victims of trafficking in human beings 
(THB); family crisis centres; centre for 
information and counselling for victims of 
domestic violence; maternal centre providing 
emergency placement services as well as 
</p>
<p>Protection Centre for Victims and 
Potential Victims of Trafficking in 
Human Beings (CAPC).  
The key element of the NRS is the 
Assistance and Protection Centre for 
Victims and Potential Victims of 
Trafficking in Human Beings (CAPC), 
subordinated to the Ministry of Labour, 
Social Protection and Family, jointly 
managed with the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM). The 
CAPC is classified as a service provider 
of high specialization &#8211; providing crisis 
intervention services to victims of 
domestic violence and victims and 
potential victims of human trafficking 
(temporary residence, psychological 
counselling, social support, medical 
assistance, legal support, recreational 
activities).  
Alongside with the CAPC, four regional 
assistance centers are operational on the 
territory of the Republic of Moldova 
Centres (Cahul, Balti, Causeni, 
Drochia) offering accommodation, 
food, legal, social, psychological and 
urgent medical assistance, security and 
protection as well as assistance to 
contact relatives to victims of domestic 
violence. 
Within the National Referral System 
(NRS) for Assistance and Protection of 
(Potential) Victims of trafficking in 
human beings, 910 potential victims of 
trafficking/persons at risk have been 
assisted during the period 2006-2010,

<p>temporary placement and  counselling services 
to mother and child-victims of family violence; 
centre for temporary placement of children at 
risk; law centre providing network of legal 
services to victims of domestic violence in four 
districts: Anenii-Noi, Rezina, Soldanesti, 
Vulcanesti.  
-The protection and assistance of victims and 
potential victims of THB is carried out within 
the National Referral System for Protection and 
Assistance of Victims and Potential Victims of 
Trafficking in Human Beings (NRS).  
-The social and economic empowerment of the 
disadvantaged groups is carried out on a 
permanent basis within the NRS. 
Multidisciplinary teams, in co-operation with 
International Organisation for Migration in 
Moldova and local NGOs, identify and provide 
individual assistance to potential victims of 
THB. Other services include vocational training, 
employment mediation, business development 
training and assistance, medical, psychological 
and legal assistance. Special assistance is 
provided to victims identified abroad who are 
referred to community services for their social 
reintegration.  
-The Law on prevention and combating 
trafficking in human beings provides 
rehabilitation and recovery of victims of human 
trafficking, including medical and legal 
assistance, psychological, material, professional 
rehabilitation and accommodation. The Chisinau 
Centre for Protection and Assistance which was 
institutionalized in 2009 by the Ministry of 
Labour, Social Protection and Family, offers 
accommodation for up to 30 days subject to 
extension for pregnant women. 
-The repatriation procedure for victims of 
human trafficking is set out by the Regulation on 
</p>
<p>assisted during 2010, where 
approximately 50 % were victims of 
domestic violence.  
Many &#8211; although not all &#8211; of these 
measures remain dependent upon 
external and/or international donor 
assistance. 
Finally, the development of shelters for 
victims of domestic violence is 
reportedly hampered by the lack of a 
regulatory framework through which 
NGOs might be supported by the state 
budget.  In the recent period, the 
Ministry of Labour, Social Protection 
and Family has reportedly budgeted for 
several shelters for victims of domestic 
violence, but is unable to disburse the 
funding because of an absence of 
modalities through which the state 
might support the activities of non-
governmental organisations.  The 
lacuna of a regulatory framework for 
state support for non-governmental 
organisations providing services in the 
public interest should be swiftly 
rectified. 
Vulnerable women and girls remain at 
risk of trafficking for sexual 
exploitation, while men are exposed to 
trafficking for labour exploitation, 
particularly in the agricultural and 
construction sectors.  Children are also 
trafficked, for forced labour and 
begging in neighbouring countries.  
Some victims are trafficked from the 
breakaway region of Transnistria, in 
eastern Moldova, an area beyond the 
control of the central government.   </p>

<p>The Government approved the Decision 
No. 835 of 13 September 2010, of the 
National Plan for Preventing and 
Combating Human Trafficking for the 
years 2010-2011. The National 
Committee to Combat Trafficking in 
Human Beings (NCCTHB) is an inter-
institutional which has the 
responsibility to collect and analyze 
data on trafficking phenomenon as well 
as on actions against trafficking in 
human beings and their impact. 
However, although 4 National Action 
Plans have been adopted up to this date, 
no national reports have ever been 
published.53 The Secretariat of the 
NCCTHB is not activating on the 
permanent basis, and its members 
perform duties on their main workplace.  
 
In 2010, the prosecution bodies 
reportedly initiated criminal 
proceedings on 140 cases of trafficking 
in human beings, in 2008  &#8211;  215 cases 
and in 2009 &#8211; 185 cases. The same 
tendency is noticed in relation to cases 
of trafficking in children: in 2010 &#8211; 21 
cases initiated on trafficking in children, 
in 2009 &#8211; 21, in 2008 &#8211; 31 cases. Many 
criminal cases initiated on human 
trafficking are re-qualified at a later 
stage of the criminal proceedings into 
other related crimes (pimping, 
organization of illegal migration, illegal 
taking of children out of the country,

<p>forced labor). There is still poor 
capacity of law enforcement agencies in 
identifying victims of trafficking and in 
investigating cases of trafficking in 
persons and related cases. Previous 
efforts on monitoring activities of the 
judiciary identified the lack of 
transparency as a problem.54 Only in a 
very limited number of cases are 
victims of trafficking are offered a just 
satisfaction (compensation) for the non-
pecuniary damage caused to them.  
 
Further identification of systemic 
problems in the criminal investigation 
of cases of trafficking in persons is 
required and follow up activities are 
required to strengthen the capacities of 
the law enforcement agencies and 
courts in examining cases of human 
trafficking and protection of victims of 
human trafficking within the criminal 
proceedings.  
 
In order to provide protection and 
assistance to the victims and potential 
victims of human trafficking, the 
National Referral System for Assistance 
and Protection of Victims and Potential 
Victims of Trafficking (NRS) was 
established in 2006. The NRS involves 
social assistants, police, doctors, 
professors, etc.&#8211; and currently covers 32 
administrative units of Moldova, 
including 29 rayons, 2 municipalities

NRS since its creation is the &#8213;pro-active 
prevention&#8214; focusing on vulnerable 
persons who, because of their difficult 
situation, are at risk of being trafficked.  
 
The Center for Assistance and 
Protection of victims of trafficking and 
at risk cases in Chisinau (CAP) remains 
the main pillar of the NRS highly 
specialized in providing crisis 
intervention services to its beneficiaries, 
including victims of domestic violence. 
After its institutionalization by the 
Government in 2008, the CAP is 
operated currently by the Ministry of 
Labor, Social Protection and Family 
(MLSPF).55 However, due to lack of 
sufficient funds in the state budget, the 
IOM continues to support the 
Government with funding for staff and 
assistance services costs. There are also 
regional assistance centers providing 
assistance to this categories of persons 
(Cahul, Balti, Drochia, Causeni) 
financed by the Government. 
 
The government has invited the Special 
Rapporteur on Trafficking to visit

Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and 
ensure respect for the 
safeguards available to 
patients, in particular their 
right to free and informed 
consent in compliance with 
international standards (see 
also report A/63/175);

those serving court 
sentences were held in 
apathy, subject to excessive 
use of tranquilizers;  
Lack of clarity of whether 
the use of tranquilizers ways 
based on free and informed 
consent by the patients;  
The medication given to the 
partly very young children, 
especially in terms of 
tranquilizers, was clearly not 
suitable;  
The Ministry of Health 
recognized that the 
treatment, which consisted 
almost exclusively of the use 
of strong neuroleptics was 
inadequate and indicated 
that psychiatric care would 
be individualized, new 
treatments developed, and 
modern drugs purchased 
once the necessary funds 
were made available; 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b>  Currently the Ministry of 
Labour, Family and Social Protection undertakes 
a number of actions in order to prepare the 
ratification of the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, including drafting a 
strategy on social inclusion of persons with 
disabilities and adjusting national legislation to 
international standards in this respect. 
Within the psychiatric medical institutions, 
patients are treated with minimum therapeutic 
doses of psychotropic substances and are 
involved in the rehabilitation process that 
includes ergo-therapy through attending the 
reading room and the gym. The reforms adopted 
by the administration of the psychiatric medical 
institutions led to creating and extending the 
recreational space. The patient is informed of the 
methods of treatment and the prescribed 
medicine and is asked to sign the &#8213;Consent on 
hospitalization, investigation and therapeutic 
procedures provided within the psychiatric 
hospital&#8214;. If the patient is unable to sign the 
form, it will be signed by his or her close 
relative or legal representative.  
Within the health facilities, children are treated 
with the last generation of psychotropic 
substances calculated in line with international 
standards by bodyweight. The therapeutic 
indications are prescribed in accordance with 
treatment standards and are coordinated with 
professors of the department of psychiatry, 
narcology and psychology. Currently, the focus

December 2011. The law is ensuring the 
development and approval of 
methodology for the identification of 
disabilities degree in accordance with 
the WHO standards; adjustment of 
national legislative-normative 
framework to the European and 
international standards on the protection

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  On July 9 2010, 
Parliament approved the ratification of the 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and on 21 September 2010, it 
deposited the instrument of ratification. 
- Reforms directed to the implementation of the 
Convention are in initial stages and are expected 
to take at least 18 months. Early areas identified 
for reform in this regard include clarification of 
the monitoring mechanisms; adoption of a 
comprehensive anti-discrimination law; 
reforming civil code provisions on guardianship 
and trusteeship; ending practices of abusive 
detention of persons with mental disabilities; 
reorienting social inclusion systems for the 
treatment of persons with disabilities; reforming 
the Education Code to facilitate genuine 
inclusion of persons with disabilities in 
schooling and vocational training. 
In March 2010, the Ministry of Health 
established the Human Rights and Health 
Working Group which elaborated a plan of 
actions intended to address issues of concern 
raised in the CPT report (CPT/Inf (2008) 39). It 
generally recognized that the large mental health 
institutions need to be significantly reorganized 
and reformed to efficiently redress the situation. 
In August 2010, the Ministry initiated the 
revision of about 20 regulations.  It is likely that 
another reform will be needed, as the August 
2010 was carried out without extensive 
consultation.

intervention, after having exhausted all 
alternative treatment modalities 
(psychotherapy, rehabilitation in 
Community Mental Health Centres). 
Hospitalization in section for children is 
carried out only with the consent of 
legal representative and with the 
consent of the child according to the 
capacity of comprehension. 
Psychiatric hospital treatment is 
performed in accordance with medical 
standards of treatment approved by the 
Ministry of Health and the National 
Clinical Protocols of basic diseases. 
A valuable support in the recovery 
process was received with the opening 
of the National Center for Mental 
Health established by the Ministry of 
Health`s Order no. 482 from 
13.07.2010. 
Provision with drugs in psychiatric 
hospitals is currently at a rate of 60% / 
40% (classical psychotropic medicines/ 
new generation psychotropic 
medicines). 
The implementation of measures of 
referred recommendations are 
constantly monitored and improved. </p>

<p>Health Services&#8214; along with 24 regulations of 
service organisation was adopted. National 
Clinical and Institutional Protocols, containing 
treatment guidelines have been developed 
according to the international standards. The 
funds for centralized purchase of drugs 
providing free drugs to patients who suffer from 
chronic mental disabilities, and patients with 
disabilities of I-II degree, have been increased 
from 5 mln lei (2008) to 12 mln lei (2009). The 
in-patients are provided with recent 
psychoactive medications. Specific measures 
have been undertaken with the purpose of 
improving accommodation conditions. Such 
measures include increasing nutrition from 11 
lei (2009) to 16 lei (2010) per patient per day, 
performing reparation in clinical units. Other 
measures undertaken include:  
- improved conditions for forced treatment, 
installed video equipments ensuring safety and 
protection; improved informed consent upon the 
admission to the hospital; therapy; and 
formulation of invasive investigations.  
- established institutional rehabilitation service 
for patients with mental disabilities and 
behaviour disorders.  
The following documents were drafted: 
Informative notes/brochures on patients&#8216; rights 
and responsibilities within the psychiatric 
institutions; Legislation and Norms for the 
medical and non-medical staff in mental health 
services. 
- By the Law No.166 &#8211;XVIII of 9 July 2010, the 
Republic of Moldova ratified the UN 
Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities. A strategy for social inclusion of 
persons with disabilities (2010-2013) was 
developed defining the state policy in the field 
of social protection of persons with disabilities </p>

introduction and 
implementation of legal 
safeguards, such as inter alia 
the reduction of the length of 
police custody to a maximum 
of 48 hours and the medical

Tiraspol were in violation of 
minimum international 
standards (overcrowded cells 
with few sleeping facilities, 
almost no daylight and

difficulties to the implementation of 
commitments resulting from relevant 
international conventions on human rights

which Moldova is party throughout the country. 
Moldovan authorities do not have access and are 
unable to effectively exercise constitutional 
prerogatives in the region, because of parallel 
structures that have usurped local power in this 
part of the country. The state of affairs 
concerning torture or cruel, inhuman or

</p>
<p>&#8213;Criminal Code&#8214; did not 
contain the definition of 
torture required by the 
Convention against Torture, 
it criminalized &#8213;istyazanie&#8214; 
(torment), to be punished 
with up to 3 years 
imprisonment and stated that 
it can be combined with 
&#8213;torture&#8214;, to be punished 
with up to 7 years 
imprisonment; 
Although abolitionist in 
practice, the death penalty 
was still provided for by the 
&#8213;legislation&#8214; of the 
Transnistrian region of the 
Republic of Moldova; 
Legislation in force required 
solitary confinement for 
persons sentenced to capital 
punishment and to life 
imprisonment and prescribed 
draconic restrictions on 
contacts with the outside 
world. 
</p>
<p>international standards in this matter. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  An independent 
monitoring mechanism for places of detention 
has not been established. Transnistrian 
authorities refused to cooperate with 
international organizations wanting to monitor 
places of detention. On 21 July 2010, a 
delegation of the Committee against Torture had 
to interrupt its visit to Transnistria because of 
the lack of guarantees by the official 
representatives to interview detainees 
confidentially. The Transnistrian Ombudsman 
has not been responsive to the United Nations 
country office&#8216;s approaches of initiating joint 
visits to places of detention.  
- In practice, cases of arbitrary detention have 
been regularly reported in Transnistria and the 
Special Rapporteur on Torture has taken them 
up. 
- The death penalty has not yet been abolished 
as per article 43 of the Transnistrian Criminal 
Code. Torture has not been introduced as a 
crime in the Criminal Code. 
- The practice of solitary confinement for 
persons sentenced to death and to life 
imprisonment has not changed.

<p>i) Abolish the statute of 
limitations for crimes of 
torture; 
ii) Establish effective and 
accessible complaints 
mechanisms; and protect 
complainants 
against reprisals; 
iii) An independent authority 
with no connection to the 
body investigating or 
prosecuting the case against 
the alleged victim should 
investigate promptly and 
thoroughly all allegations of 
torture and ill-treatment ex-
officio; an independent 
forensic expert should carry 
out an examination in respect 
of all allegations of torture 
and ill-treatment; 
iv) The Forensic institute 
should be equipped 
accordingly. 
</p>
<p>five years was applicable to 
the crime of torture; 
The law provided for several 
complaints avenues, but the 
large majority of complaints 
were rejected quasi-
automatically;  
Ex-officio investigations did 
not function in practice;  
The system of internal 
remedies was dysfunctional 
due to: 
a)The routine use of threats 
and reprisals by the police in 
order to deter detainees from 
filing complaints;  
b)the non-action of the staff 
of penitentiary institutions in 
cases of allegations of 
torture;  
c) the wide discretion and 
inaction of the prosecutor&#8216;s 
</p>
<p>office when he receives 
complaints; d) the lack of 
independent medical 
examination; e) the lack of 
independence of judges who 
in many cases continue to 
follow the arguments of the 
prosecutor; 
The State Forensic Institute 
was underequipped. 
</p>
<p>i) The statute of limitations is not an impediment 
to investigations, since crimes of torture are 
investigated vigilantly and in a timely manner. 
ii) Since 1996 prosecutors are obliged to make 
daily spot checks at the places of temporary 
detention. This includes personal and direct 
control of the legality of detention, discussions 
with detainees, as well as reporting the results of 
these actions, including where necessary, 
issuing orders to release the persons detained 
illegally on remand. Thus, there is a mechanism 
to record, control and monitor the practice of 
coercive procedural measures and the conditions 
of detention. 
iii) In 2007, 1,258 complaints were submitted, 
50 criminal proceedings being initiated. In the 
same year, 87 criminal proceedings were 
initiated for excess of power, 55 cases of which 
were sent to the court, 63 persons being 
convicted, including 14 persons imprisoned. In 
2008, 1,128 complaints were submitted, 51 
criminal proceedings being initiated. In the same 
year, 73 criminal proceedings were initiated for 
excess of power, 46 of which were sent to court, 
as a result of which 36 persons were convicted 
and 5 persons were imprisoned. In 2009, 554 
complaints have been submitted, 33 criminal 
proceedings were initiated. The same year, 31 
criminal proceedings have been initiated for 
excess of power, 20 of which were sent to court, 
16 persons convicted and 1 person was 
imprisoned. Most cases investigated concerned 
the use of force during interrogation for the 
purpose of securing a confession to improve 
prosecution statistics. 
The Interior Ministry has internally examined 
135 criminal cases, including 39 cases regarding 
excess of power, 17 cases regarding torture and </p>

<p>4 cases for coerced declarations, 19 of which 
had resulted in the dismissal of staff. 
It should be noted that during 2008, no new 
cases of torture or inhuman or degrading 
treatment were registered in the penitentiary 
system. An exception is the case of an employee 
of Prison No. 1, who was sentenced, in 
accordance with article 328 paragraph 2 (c) of 
the Criminal Code on 9 Dec. 08, to a fine and 
the deprivation of the right to hold public 
functions for a period of 3 years, for committing 
actions that humiliated the dignity of a prisoner 
on 29 Dec. 07. In 2009 no cases of torture were 
registered in the penitentiary system. During this 
year the Penitentiary Institutions Department of 
the Ministry of Justice initiated 2 internal 
investigations regarding the alleged ill-treatment 
of two detainees, from which one of the cases 
was sent to the Prosecutor Office. The facts 
alleged in the second case have not been 
confirmed.  
Of 473 petitions examined in 2008 by the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA), 38 
concerned cases of ill-treatment and illegal 
detention of citizens. In 18 cases false facts were 
reported; in 15 cases the facts have been 
confirmed (employees have been sanctioned 
disciplinarily); in 19 cases the files were 
submitted to the prosecution bodies (for criminal 
procedure), and in 6 cases the petitions were 
sent to judicial courts (for examination of 
criminal cases filed by the petitioners). During 
the first 10 months of 2009 the MIA examined 
334 petitions, of which 33 cases concerned 
mistreatment of persons by police employees. In 
11 cases the alleged mistreatment was not 
confirmed; in 4 cases the court applied an 
administrative fine to both sides of the conflict; </p>

<p>in 2 cases the investigation was suspended until 
the decision on the criminal case was issued; in 
16 cases the files were sent to the prosecutor, of 
which no criminal procedure was commenced in 
2 cases (the employees were only warned about 
the due treatment of citizens).  
Thus, 204 criminal cases were initiated in 2009, 
compared with 215 during the same period of 
the previous year. 60 of these concerned cases 
of excess of power (59 in 2008), 34 cases of 
torture (13 in 2008), and 5 cases of coercion to 
make statements (12 in 2008). 
20 police employees were dismissed following a 
court decision.  
The examination of such cases reveal that police 
officers commit actions that clearly exceed the 
limits of rights and powers granted to them by 
law; they apply force and violence, and torture 
people for the following reasons:   
</p>
<p>- To obtain evidence by illegal means; 
- To pursue personal and material 
</p>
<p>interests; 
- To demonstrate the superiority over the 
</p>
<p>victims and to neglect the general rules 
of conduct;  
</p>
<p>- Because of lack of knowledge of the 
law and work duties; and  
</p>
<p>- Other reasons.  
Most of the circumstances described in the 
complaints of citizens are not sufficient to start a 
criminal prosecution. 
Taking into account the necessity to ensure the 
impartiality of prosecutors in the investigation 
process of cases of torture and abuse of power, 
by General Prosecutor&#8216;s Order of 19 Nov. 07

<p>designate a prosecutor responsible for 
documenting and examining allegations of 
torture and ensuring the security of victims. This 
person is not involved in other activities, in 
order to exclude partiality in investigations of 
allegations of torture. Following the decision of 
the General Prosecutor or his or her deputies, 
the military prosecutor offices of Chisinau, Balti 
and Cahul investigate cases of torture, inhuman 
and degrading treatment, respectively, in the 
centre, North and South of the country, while 
the Department on Criminal Investigation of 
Exceptional Cases of the General Prosecutor's 
Office investigates the most severe cases of 
torture, inhuman and degrading treatment. 
In accordance with the above-mentioned acts, 
prosecutors are required, whenever a reasonable 
suspicion exists that the crime of torture has 
been committed, to immediately start criminal 
investigations. Following the initiation of 
criminal proceedings, prosecutors of Chisinau 
municipality and Gagauzia may withdraw the 
criminal cases from the prosecutors in these 
territorial units, appointing a special prosecutor 
to carry out further investigations. 
A directive of the Prosecutor&#8216;s Office has been 
</p>
<p>issued to improve forensic documentation; 
however, further measures are still needed to 
provide for effective forensic examination. 
iv) To date, the Legal Medical Centre presented 
a demand related to the necessary equipment for 
its laboratories. Thus, the Centre has been 
included in the list of bodies of the Health 
System, which will benefit from humanitarian 
aid. During 2009, the Legal Medical Centre has

Centre &#8211; these proposals were submitted for 
consideration to UNDP, the Government of 
Japan, etc. At the same time, due to financial 
constraints, it has been impossible to increase 
the financing of the Legal Medical Centre.   
The Legal Medical Centre has undertaken inter 
alia a training course for medical-legal experts 
on the investigation of torture cases and other 
ill-treatment. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Out of 554 
complaints only one perpetrator was sentenced 
to imprisonment for torture in 2009; thus, the 
investigation cannot be regarded to be efficient, 
operative and impartial. Forensic doctors try to 
cover up torture, rather than document it.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Investigative 
bodies fail to carry out prompt, thorough and 
independent investigations into allegations of 
torture.   Police officers have not been 
suspended from their official duties during the 
investigation of complaints lodged against them, 
contrary to European Court of Human Rights 
(ECHR) jurisprudence (ECtHR, Valeriu and 
Nicolae Rosca vs. Moldova). This has 
contributed to impunity.  
- An investigation into a case of alleged torture 
that took place in 2005 was only launched in 
July 2009, after the ruling of the ECHR against 
Moldova in the case of Gorgurov v. Moldova. 
Despite the ruling, the Government has failed to 
comply with the remedy requirements. Officers 
responsible for acts of torture remain 
unpunished.

<p>place up to 15 years after the crime has 
occurred, has not yet been amended. 
- The Criminal Procedural Code allows for 
defence lawyers to request the suspension of a 
suspect without pay.  
- Although a special group of military 
prosecutors was established within the General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office to investigate the allegations 
</p>
<p>of torture occurred during the April 2009 event, 
there have been concerns as to its impartiality. 
After a year, most of the trials are still pending 
and are subject to constant delays.  
- On 20 October 2009, the Investigation 
Commission on the Elucidation of the Causes 
and Consequences of the Events, an ad-hoc 
commission made up of 9 members of 
parliament, was established to investigate the 
&#8213;causes and consequences of the April 2009 
</p>
<p>events&#8214;.  
- On 7 May 2010, the Commission presented to 
the Parliament a well-documented report with 
reference to arbitrary arrests, wide use of 
disproportionate and abusive force in custody 
and violent measures undertaken in the 
aftermath of the April 2009 events.  
- As of June 2010, 108 complaints of torture by 
police officers had been received by the Office 
of Prosecutor General and 54 criminal 
investigations had been initiated in connection 
with the April 2009 events. Approximately 24 
dossiers concerning 39 police officers were 
taken to the Courts for further investigation. As 
of September 2010, there were no convictions 
related to torture or other ill-treatment by police 
officers in connection with the events of April 
</p><p>2009. Most of the charges against the police 
officers are under article 327 (abuse of power) 
or article 328 (misuse of power), although some </p>

<p>have also been brought under article 309/1 
(torture) of the Penal Code, particularly in 
connection with several high-profile cases. 
- Police and security personnel have reportedly 
intimidated human rights defenders and victims 
of the April 2009 events.  
- In practice, most investigations do not meet the 
minimum requirements and are mostly delayed. 
In many cases, even where there are credible 
allegations of torture, prosecutors are apparently 
reluctant to initiate investigations. There appears 
to be systemic bias against detained suspects of 
crimes in favor of police investigators, even 
when there is enough evidence of torture and ill-
treatment. Some prosecutors have also 
reportedly tried to influence and intimidate 
victims of torture into withdrawing complaints. 
- Some progress has been made into the 
investigation of abuses of juveniles by the police 
or public servants after a campaign against 
torture started two years ago. Complaints 
against police officers are being investigated by 
prosecutors from a different district in order to 
safeguard against tolerance or complicity. The 
number of police officers prosecuted has 
increased, and some have been given prison 
sentences. - Although the complaints against 
police officers for juvenile suspects&#8216; abuse are 
</p>
<p>reportedly less common, the blanket denial and 
the absence of complaints about police 
misconduct against children lacks credibility 
and reinforces the impression that there is little 
political will to eradicate abuse. 
- Although the Centre for Human Rights plays 
valuable role in monitoring the treatment of 
juvenile suspects and prisoners and in bringing 
cases to the attention of the responsible 
authorities, criminal and administrative </p>

<p>investigations are not pursued promptly and

The Government did not take any steps to equip 
the Forensic institute. In 2011, UNDP jointly 
with the European Union, will launch a project 
to equip the national forensic agency and to 
establish legitimate forensic sources. 
- No legislative initiatives in abolishing the 
statute of limitations for crimes of torture are 
reportedly in progress.  
 
<b>Government:</b> In 2010, the centre of Forensic 
Medicine at the Ministry of Health, in 
partnership with OSCE Mission in Moldova has 
launched the project &#8213;Strengthening capacities 
</p>
<p>and cooperation between forensic specialists 
from both banks of the Nistru River aimed at 
enhancing investigation of torture cases&#8214;. In this 
</p>
<p>context, a study visit of four forensic experts 
was organized in Turkey from 10 to 13 
November 2010. On 23 November 2010, a 
conference on &#8213;Actual Issues on the 
Organization and Realization of Forensic 
Expertise&#8214; was carried out in Tiraspol and was

<p>attended by forensic experts from both banks of 
the Nistru River. 
- The Centre of Forensic Medicine with 
immediate support and contribution of UNDP 
Moldova launched the project &#8213;Strengthening 
the forensic examination of torture and other 
forms of ill-treatment, as a key strategic element 
in comprehensive, integrated, holistic efforts to 
end torture and related forms of ill-treatment in 
Moldova&#8214;. It provides forensic expert training 
on identification and documentation of cases of 
torture. It also provides the Centre with 
technical equipment for its regional and 
laboratory departments. </p>

<p>- In accordance with the Decision of the 
Parliament of the Republic of Moldova on the 
approval of the structure of the General 
Prosecutor Office No 77 of 04 April 2010, and 
the General Prosecutor Order No 365-p of 24 
April 2010, a new Section on combating torture 
was established as a subdivision of the General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office, to study the phenomena of 
torture and ill-treatment as a whole in order: 
- to identify and establish all factors, causes and 
conditions that permit the existence of those 
phenomena and to propose concrete and 
adequate solutions and measures for their 
liquidation; 
- to analyze the investigation of cases of torture, 
elucidating the problems which appear within 
the investigation and prosecution process of the 
allegations of torture and ill-treatment; 
- to take all legal measures to compensate the 
victims for the harm and to reinstate them; 
- to prosecute the cases of torture with an 
increased social importance, etc. 
In accordance with the Order of the General 
Prosecutor of November 2010, the Section for 
combating torture shall be informed within 24 
hours about each case or allegation of torture 
that happened on the entire territory of the 
Republic of Moldova. 
One prosecutor (in some cases more than one) 
was nominated in each prosecutorial territorial 
office to carry out the examination of the 
allegations and prosecution of criminal cases on 
Coercion to Testify (art. 309 Criminal Code), 
Torture (art. 309/1 Criminal Code), Excess of 
Power or Excess of Official Authority (art. 328

subdivisions of the MIA or Centre for 
Combating Economic Crimes and Corruption 
(CCECC). 
</p>
<p>(b) Safeguards and prevention 
i) Reduce the period of police 
custody to a time limit in line 
with international standards 
(maximum 48 hours), after 
which transfer the detainees 
to a pre-trial facility, where 
no further unsupervised 
contact with the interrogator 
or investigator should be 
permitted; 
ii) Ensure that no confessions 
made by persons in custody 
without the presence of a 
lawyer that are not confirmed 
before a judge are admissible 
as evidence against the 
persons who made the 
confession; Shift the burden 
of proof to the prosecution to 
prove beyond reasonable 
doubt that the confession was 
not obtained under any kind 
of duress; 
iii) Judges, prosecutors and 
medical personnel should 
routinely ask persons arriving 
from police custody how they 
have been treated;  
iv) Consider video and audio 
</p>
<p>The law provided for a limit 
of 72 hours of custody, after 
which the person is to be 
brought before a judge, 
which could be prolonged by 
6 to 12 months depending on 
the crime;  
 
Police detention of minors 
could be prolonged by 30 
days up to 4 months; 
 
Prolongation of police 
detention was decided by the 
investigating judge upon 
request of the prosecutor;  
 
De-facto, most detainees 
were kept in police custody 
for several weeks/months 
and regularly returned there 
for &#8213;further investigation&#8214; or 
</p>
<p>for their trial or appeal, 
which made them vulnerable 
to reprisals; 
 
Many allegations that 
confessions obtained under 
torture were not excluded as 
evidence during court 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>:  In order to develop collaboration 
between the representatives of the healthcare 
and internal affairs authorities, the Order of the 
Ministry of Health and MIA no. 372/388 of 3 
November 2009 was issued. According to its 
provisions, the healthcare facility managers shall 
inform immediately the police authorities 
regarding the healthcare assistance granted to 
persons with injuries acquired as a result of an 
offence, traffic accident or sudden death. In 
cases when injuries derive from illegal actions 
of law enforcement authorities, the health care 
facility managers shall inform immediately the 
territorial or specialized prosecutor office. 
Concerning the medical certification of 
detainees who claim physical injuries, all the 
cases referring to the incidents from the 
penitentiary institutions, including cases of 
detecting physical injuries, are compulsorily to 
be sent to the Prosecutor&#8216;s Office and to the 
</p>
<p>Ombudsmen.  
The Medical Service examines the detainees on 
their arrival to the penitentiary in view of 
proving the presence of any physical injuries or 
other signs of violence, in accordance with 
article 251 (3) of the Enforcement Code and 
article 25 of the Statute on the Execution of 
Sentences by Convicts. The administration of 
the institution is obliged to inform, in writing 
and in the shortest time possible, the

</p>
<p>proceedings, in 
contravention of the national 
legislation; numerous reports 
that judges, prosecutors and 
other actors in the criminal 
law cycle routinely ignored 
allegations of torture;  
 
The burden of proof was on 
the victim; 
No tape or video recording 
during interrogations; 
 
Paramedics were present in 
detention facilities of the 
police and the penitentiary 
system during working 
hours on weekdays, but the 
rules did not spell out when 
medical examinations should 
take place;  
 
Amendments to the Law on 
Parliamentary Advocates 
adopted had led to the 
establishment of an 
independent &#8213;Consultative 
</p>
<p>Council&#8214;, which has been 
</p>
<p>designated as National 
Preventive Mechanism 
(NPM); complaints about 
insufficient resources. 
</p>
<p>Penitentiary Institutions Department, the 
territorial Prosecutor&#8216;s Office and the Human 
</p>
<p>Rights Centre about the physical injuries of 
detainees arriving in the penitentiary. 
The notes received by the Penitentiary 
Institutions Department and delivered to the 
Medical Division are included in a special 
database. From the beginning of 2009, 13 cases 
of physical injuries have been registered, of 
which 2 cases were reported by the MIA. 
Police officers are obliged to supervise the work 
of the paramedics during the medical 
examination of the detainees of the temporary 
detention facilities (isolators), issuing two 
copies of medical records. These activities and 
organizational practices confirm where the 
person was detained, and that the detained 
person was not tortured or mistreated. The 
paramedics employed are cumulatively paid by 
the police stations, at a rate of 0.5% of their 
salary. 
The NPM has carried out approximately 90 
visits to places of detention in 2009. They met 
10 persons who stated that they had been ill-
treated and 27 persons with visible marks. Some 
members of the Consultative Council have been 
restricted access to places of detention or have 
been confronted with considerable delays. 
Regarding the legal basis of the NPM, on 26 
July 07, the Parliament adopted Law no. 200, 
amending and supplementing the Law on the 
Parliamentary Ombudsmen, thus assigning the 
mandate of the NPM to the Parliamentary 
Ombudsmen. In view of achieving the 
involvement of civil society, a Consultative 
Council was established, with the purpose of 
providing advice and assistance in exercising the 
Parliamentary Ombudsmen&#8216;s liabilities as NPM. </p>

<p>Given the need to supplement the Consultative 
Council with 5 members, the Centre for Human 
Rights announced a call in this respect, but 
because the number of applications was 
insufficient, it was decided to extend the 
deadline for submission until 13 November 
</p><p>2009. 
During the first 9 months of the 2009, 117 
preventive visits were carried out. Out of these, 
31 were carried out by the members of the 
Consultative Council and 11 by the 
Parliamentary Ombudsmen and officials from 
the Centre for Human Rights. 
 
Observations of the Special Rapporteur during 
his visit in September 2009: The NPM still faces 
a number of challenges: firstly, the legal basis 
for this mechanism is rather ambiguous, which 
has led to different interpretations regarding 
which entity constitutes the NPM. From the side 
of the Ministry of Justice, it is argued that the 
Parliamentary Ombudsperson is the NPM. 
However, even the Ombudsman in charge, as 
well as other relevant actors, including 
international bodies such as the Council of 
Europe&#8216;s Commissioner on Human Rights, have 
</p>
<p>clearly stated that the NPM is comprised of the 
Consultative Council, under the chair of the 
Parliamentary Ombudsperson. The Special 
Rapporteur reiterates that only the latter 
interpretation is in line with OPCAT and the 
Paris Principles. Another problem is that 
although the NPM is meant to be comprised of 
11 members, currently only six members serve 
on this mandate (including the Ombudsman). 
The Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize 
that although international organisations have 
indicated their willingness to support the NPM, </p>

<p>including adequate pay for its members, the 
State has the primary obligation to provide 
sufficient resources. 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Although the law 
requires that persons be transferred within 72 
hours, in practice, persons are held in police 
custody for up to one year. 
Lawyers often do not have access to their 
clients. The legal assistance provided to torture 
victims does not comply with international 
standards. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  On 14 March 2008, 
Parliament amended the Criminal Procedural 
Code by adding article 3-1, which stipulates that 
the burden of proof in cases of torture lies with 
the institution in which the detainee was held. 
This would appear to be a positive development, 
but the practice shows that, despite the law 
reform, the burden of proof still lies with the 
victim.  
No legislative initiatives in reducing the period 
of police custody (up to 72 hours), are 
reportedly in progress. Persons arrested under a 
warrant issued by a judge and persons convicted 
to administrative (&#8213;contraventional&#8214;) arrest 
</p>
<p>should be detained in detention facilities of 
Ministry of Justice.  
- Although efforts were undertaken by the 
Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs in 2010 to ensure the custody of person 
initially arrested, there are still cases where 
detainees are held in police stations for several 
weeks. Persons have also been reportedly 
returned to police custody, including for &#8213;further 
</p>
<p>investigation&#8214;, which makes them vulnerable to 
</p>
<p>reprisals in the event of filing a complaint about 
ill-treatment.   </p>

<p>- Juveniles suspected of an offence may not be 
kept in police custody for more than 24 hours, 
and the detention of juveniles during the 
investigation may not exceed four months.  
- A publicly-funded legal assistance programme 
was established. 
- There is no time limit on trials or appeals or on 
detention during trial and appeal. Some cases of 
detention for a year or more are still reported. 
Conditions in the pre-trial detention facility 
where most juveniles are detained are inhuman, 
and disciplinary sanctions violate international 
standards. 
- There have been no reported cases of refugees 
or asylum-seekers being placed in police 
custody or detention.  
- Testimonies obtained through torture are not 
excluded from criminal proceedings. Often, the 
first hearing of detained persons takes place 
without the presence of a lawyer.  
- Complaints related to the confidentiality of 
meetings with lawyers are often not considered. 
State-appointed lawyers act superficially and 
tend to cooperate greatly with the police.  
- Judges, prosecutors and medical personnel do 
not generally ask about details of the treatment 
while in custody.  
- In practice, interrogations are not recorded on 
audio or on video.  
- The National Forensic Centre only documents 
the results of forensic examination superficially, 
often failing to meet international standards. It is 
not independent.  
- Although the law requires a doctor and/or 
penal institution to inform the chief prosecutor 
about evidences of torture or other ill-treatment, 
in some cases no action is taken to this effect.

<p>indications of torture are generally not 
undertaken, which leads to under-
documentation. Domestic courts favour the 
official over independent medical sources 
provided by victims or their representatives. 
- The preventive medical examination of 
detainees in prisons does not allow for the 
proper documentation of torture.  
- Although access by the NPM to places of 
detention has reportedly improved, it remains de 
facto dysfunctional. Efforts to improve 
functionality of the NPM have been seriously 
hindered by an internal conflict between the 
Ombudsman (chairman of NPM) and three 
members of the Consultative Council.  
- In November 2009, the Committee Against 
Torture issued a detailed recommendation 
(CAT/C/MDA/CO/2) regarding the 
improvement of the NPM&#8216;s functionality 
through strengthening its independence and 
capacity. 
- The NPM is not well-known to the public at 
large. It does not have a separate budget line or 
other resources that might be managed for the 
specialized purposes. 
- An Action Plan on the Protection of Children&#8216;s 
Rights and Prevention and Combating of 
Juvenile Delinquency covering 2008&#8211;2010 was 
adopted, but implementation has been minimal. 
Efforts undertaken by the juvenile inspectors 
and the Commissions on Minors in the area of 
prevention were not effective.  
- No prevention programmes directed 
specifically at children at high risk of offending 
(secondary prevention) exist.  
- The law and procedures concerning young 
children involved in criminal conduct are poorly 
defined. In particular, compliance with the &#8215;last </p>

- During the last five years, the number of 
juvenile prisoners serving sentences has 
fluctuated between a high of 138 in 2006 and a 
low of 32 in May-June 2009. The number of 
juveniles confined in the &#8215;special school&#8216; for

reforms of the prosecutor&#8216;s

<p>office, the police and the 
penitentiary system with a 
view to transforming them 
into truly client-oriented 
bodies that operate 
transparently, including 
through modernized and 
demilitarized training; 
ii) Strengthen the 
independence of the 
judiciary; make judges aware 
of their responsibilities 
with regard to torture 
prevention; 
iii) Conceive the system of 
execution of punishments and 
its legal framework in a way 
that truly aims at 
rehabilitation and 
reintegration of offenders, in 
particular through 
abolishing restrictive 
detention rules and 
maximizing contact with the 
outside world;  
</p>
<p>Lack of independence of 
judges who in many cases 
continued to follow the 
arguments of the prosecutor 
without intervening in cases 
of alleged torture;  
 
The legal framework and 
penitentiary policies in 
Moldova were punitive, 
directed at locking people 
up, rather than aimed at 
reintegrating prisoners, in 
particular extremely 
restrictive visiting policies 
and numerous constraints on 
contacts with the outside 
world;  
 
Common problems at all 
pre- and post-trial prisons 
were poor hygienic 
conditions, restricted access 
to health care and lack of 
medication as well as risk of 
contamination with 
tuberculosis and other 
diseases; 
</p>
<p><b>Government</b>: Although relevant trainings and 
seminars are taking place, there is still need for 
administrative and institutional measures 
including further trainings in the MIA and 
involvement of all actors in torture prevention.  
The MIA is in the process of implementing the 
Institutional Development Plan for 2009-10, 
which was developed in the context of reforms 
of the entire central public administration. In 
this view, the Ministry aligns to European 
standards and adjusts the existing legal 
framework to the EU acquis of decentralization, 
demilitarization and de-politicization of its 
activities, improving the management of service 
to society. 
In addition, the Ministry has organized and 
conducted instructive methodological seminars 
for leadership and personnel of subdivisions of 
the criminal prosecution. The seminars 
concerned different topics, the main emphasis 
being on the observance of the law by police 
officers in the criminal investigation work. The 
Ministry set up a committee on fundamental 
rights and freedoms of citizens. In the same 
context, it issued an ordinance on procedural 
time limits, according to which prosecution 
officers must provide a report to the Ministry 
with a view to control and coordinate the

The periods of pre-trial 
detention were extensive; 
several of his interviewees 
had spent up to three or four 
years in detention without a 
final judgment. 
</p>
<p>extension of periods of arrest. Furthermore, 
billboards on rights and obligations of persons 
suspected, detained, arrested and prosecuted 
were set up. Similarly, all sections of the 
prosecution authorities were provided with 
models of procedural documents, such as 
minutes/process-verbaux of apprehension and 
explanations of the rights and obligations of the 
detained persons, compiled by the General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office. 
The preliminary report regarding the respect of 
rights of detained persons, elaborated by the 
Institute for Penal Reform within the project 
&#8213;Strengthening Criminal Justice System Reform 
in Moldova&#8214;, was sent to the heads of criminal 
</p>
<p>prosecution bodies of territorial subdivisions, in 
order to undertake measures to eliminate any 
violations in the future. The MIA participated in 
the working group set up by the General 
Prosecutor&#8216;s Office, where the draft of the 
&#8215;Instructions on how to grant visits and 
</p>
<p>telephone conversations to persons detained in 
preventive arrest&#8216; was elaborated. 
A law was drafted to amend some legislative 
acts for the re-examination of the applicable 
disciplinary regime for judges, which represents 
a balance between the guarantee of the judges&#8216; 
</p>
<p>independence and the necessity of sanctioning a 
judge in case his or her behaviour necessitates 
such action.  
In order to ensure the impartiality of judges, an 
amendment to the law is proposed, introducing 
an obligation of the judge to inform the 
president of the court and the Superior Council 
of Magistrates about any attempt to influence 
the process of decision making.  
Regarding conflicts of interest, a draft law is 
proposed to complete article 15 of the Law on </p>

<p>the Status of Judges, which would stipulate the 
obligation of the judge to present a declaration 
regarding his or her personal interests. 
A reform of the judicial organizational system is 
proposed, which includes the abolition of 
specialized law courts (Chisinau Economical 
District Court, Military Court, Economical 
Appeals Court). The specialized courts&#8216; duties 
shall be taken over by the courts of common 
jurisdiction.  
In March 09, a decision of the Supreme Court 
was issued, clarifying many aspects of case law 
concerning Art. 3 ECHR. There have been 24 
ECtHR judgments against Moldova under Art. 
</p><p>3. Aspects of the Plenum decision include the 
requirement that detainees are registered; the 
registration of officials present; that the person 
not be interrogated in the absence of an &#8213;escort&#8214;; 
</p>
<p>and an unbiased investigation into allegations of 
ill-treatment. The Superior Council has held 
seminars on Article 3 and the case law against 
Moldova. 
One of the objectives of the continuous training 
of judges is their conscious involvement in the 
eradication of torture. In this context, thematic 
seminars on preventive arrest were organized, 
especially for instruction judges, judges, 
prosecutors and lawyers. 
From the beginning of 2008 the Ministry of 
Justice has undertaken numerous activities in the 
field of promotion of human rights. Within the 
Training on Human Rights the following topics 
were included: &#8213;The minimum standards of 
</p>
<p>maintenance of convicted persons&#8214;, &#8213;The 
</p>
<p>European Convention for the Prevention of 
Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment&#8214;, &#8213;The Universal Declaration of 
</p>
<p>Human Rights&#8214; and &#8213;The national, regional and </p>

<p>international mechanisms of human rights 
protection&#8214;.   
The regimes in the penitentiaries have been 
established according to the Execution Code and 
are characteristic to each type of penitentiary, 
which represents different stages of the 
punishment of deprivation of liberty. Thus, the 
practice envisages different stages within the 
respective process. The first one (the initial 
regime), a reduced period compared to the total 
term of the sentence, represents the stage of 
ensuring the adaptation of the person to the 
penitentiary environment and an evaluation 
according to rules nos. 16, 51, and 52 of the 
Recommendations of the Committee of 
Ministries of the CoE no. R2006 (2). 
Generally speaking, the appreciation that the 
penitentiary policy is still punitive does not 
correspond to reality. Thus, the provisions 
regarding the regimes of detention (art. 269 to 
273 Execution Code) constitute a progressive 
evolution of rights of detainees in relation to 
their behaviour. The enforcement depends on 
the punishment and the behaviour of the 
detainees, the danger they represent, based on an 
evaluation of the personality and behaviour, as 
well as on their individual plan of serving the 
sentence.  
Regarding visits, the law stipulates the right of 
the detainee to at least one visit a month. 
Nevertheless, depending on the behaviour of the 
convicted person, the penitentiary 
administration can grant additional visits. 
Consequently, depending on his/her behaviour 
and his/her attitude towards labour (remunerated 
or not), the convicted person may benefit from 
22 long- and short-term visits during a year. The 
penitentiary program includes also educational </p>

<p>training, labour and sport activities etc., which, 
along with social assistance granted by the 
administration, contribute to the reintegration of 
the convicted persons into society. 
According to art. 227, 228 and 229 of the 
Execution Code, detainees have access to 
information, files, correspondence and telephone 
calls and can address correspondence to law 
enforcement bodies, central public authorities 
and international intergovernmental 
organizations. Post boxes were installed in all 
prisons and letters are collected by employees of 
the Moldova Post. 
A number of deficiencies of conditions of 
detention have been asserted in 21 temporary 
detention facilities (isolators) of the territorial 
police commissariats. As a result, relevant 
letters have been addressed to commissariats in 
Balti, Basarabeasca, Cimislia, Soldanesti, 
Rezina, Vulcanesti, Comrat, Leova, Orhei, 
Cahul, Causeni, Anenii-Noi, Gagauzia and 
Floresti with deadlines for proper actions to be 
undertaken to redress the situation. 
Despite the undertaken measures to create 
decent conditions of detention, in some 
temporary detention isolators the situation 
remains complicated: 
- lack of natural illumination and ventilation in 
cells (Balti, Bender, Anenii-Noi, Basarabeasca, 
Cahul, Causeni, Cimislia, Drochia, Floresti, 
Hincesti, Leova, Riscani, Singerei, Soldanesti, 
Soroca, Telenesti, Comrat, Vulcanesti and the 
Operative Service Department of the MIA); 
- lack of  mattresses, blankets and pillows (Balti, 
Bender, Anenii-Noi, Basarabeasca, Causeni, 
Floresti, Hincesti, Leova, Rezina, Riscani, 
Soldanesti, Telenesti, Vulcanesti); 
- lack of adequate sanitary facilities in cells </p>

The quality of the food has been improved and 
detainees are now given something to eat three 
times per day. 
In 2008, 2,878 persons were detained, out of 
which 2,037 were under preventive detention. In 
2009, 2,644 persons were detained, out of which 
1.784 persons were under preventive detention.

prosecutor&#8216;s offices, the police and the

2010, several efforts to demilitarize the

- Moldovan legislation and practice are 
incompatible with international standards as far 
as the use of isolation or solitary confinement as

concerned.

<p>independence of the judiciary. The Ministry of 
Justice has repeatedly been involved in 
removing judges, including Supreme Court 
judges, including for highly questionable 
reasons such as &#8213;losing cases in Strasbourg&#8214; and 
for intentionally delaying the prosecution of 
eminent cases linked to the April 2009 events.  
- On 30 October 2009, the Supreme Court of 
Justice issued a guidance decision on the 
application of article 3 of the European 
Convention of Human Rights in domestic 
courts. This non-binding guidance, while not 
perfect, provides important guidance for the 
judiciary. 
- Although the Enforcement Code has various 
provisions with respect to the rights of inmates 
to hold private correspondence and telephone 
conversations and receive food parcels, these 
rights are not envisaged adequately due to, for 
example, lack of public telephones in most 
institutions and a lack of clear regulations for 
appointments. 
- The criminal subculture and prisoner&#8216;s 
hierarchy is partially supported by the prisons&#8216; 
</p>
<p>administrations as a mechanism of non-formal 
control over the detainees.  
- The problem of food shortage in penitentiary 
institutions remains. In 2007, the amount 
allocated from the state budget for feeding 
prisoners constituted 53.2% of the minimum 
necessary, in 2008 - 49.8%, and from January to 
August 2009 it was 64.4%, average being 
allocated about 3.6 lei per day for a prisoner. 
Average daily dietary amount of value remains 
two times smaller than required by law. 
- During the period of 2008-2009, the 
Government undertook renovation in the 
medical centre of women&#8216;s penitentiary in </p>

office, a dentist, an internal therapy-medicine 
office and a clinical laboratory. UNFPA 
complemented these efforts by providing 
medical equipment and furniture. 
- In September 2010, probation services were 
transferred to the Department of Penitentiary 
Services. It is unclear, however, whether this 
reform will have positive impact due to widely 
practiced disciplinary attitude among probation 
staff. The pre-trial probation reports are used 
only in a limited number of cases. 
- There is only limited implementation of the 
2008 Law on Mediation due to the lack of and 
undeveloped capacity of mediators and to the 
actual performance indicators stimulating the 
investigation bodies not to interrupt the 
investigation where relevant, but to send it to the 
courts. 
- The current arrangements have been described 
by experts as being very weak in the area of 
rehabilitation and social integration of victims.  
- The Committee on the Rights of the Child 
noted with regret that some of its concerns and 
recommendations regarding juvenile justice had 
not been adequately addressed, and reiterated its 
previous recommendation that a separate system 
of juvenile justice fully in line with the 
Convention be established. 
(CRC/C/MDA/CO/3, paras. 7 and 73). 
- No document containing a global strategy for 
juvenile justice reform exists. A strategy can be 
inferred from the programme document of the 
2003-2005 and 2008-2011 juvenile justice 
projects.  
The programme document of the 2008-2011 had

<p>development of a probation service; revision of 
effective legal assistance; provision of services 
to children in detention; prevention of juvenile 
delinquency; and training of juvenile justice 
professionals. 
Although the stated objectives are broad, the 
project is more holistic, in particular in 
addressing the need for more coherent 
prevention policies and programmes. There are 
still some gaps, however. Emphasis on diversion 
and alternative sentences seems to come at the 
expense of attention to the programmes applied 
in correctional facilities and services for 
juveniles leaving correctional facilities and 
returning to the community. Accountability is 
not addressed directly by the project.  
- NGOs played a small role in the 
implementation of the 2008&#8211;2011 project.  
- There is a lack of ownership by the national 
authorities as regards the implementation of the 
project and of the process of developing a 
juvenile justice system.  
- Although there has been some improvement in 
the treatment of juveniles after the designation 
of prosecutors in each trial court, the impact is 
still limited, in part because the designated 
judges have insufficient training and because 
many of them handle a rather small number of 
cases involving juveniles. In 2008, only two 
courts outside the capital handled more than one 
juvenile case per week and 17 district courts 
handled on average less than one case per 
month. 
- A training manual for judges, prosecutors and 
police has been developed and incorporated into 
the curricula of the National Institute of Justice, 
which trains judges and prosecutors, and the 
Police Academy. The first class of 20 </p>

<p>prosecutors and 9 judges graduated in 2009.  
130 judges and prosecutors were trained in child 
rights in six seminars (CRC/C/MDA/3, para. 
374).   
Opinions on the impact of training vary. 
- Changes to the Criminal Code made in 2009 
reduce sentences for certain crimes. Although 
the measures can be considered as steps towards 
compliance with the &#8215;last resort&#8216; and &#8215;shortest 
</p>
<p>appropriate period of time&#8216; principles, set forth 
</p>
<p>in article 37(b) of the CRC, they do not comply 
fully with these principles.  
- During the last five years, the number of 
juveniles given custodial sentences has fallen 
sharply, from 194 in 2004 to 100 in 2008. The 
percentage of convicted juveniles given 
custodial sentences rose sharply during the same 
period, because the number of convictions fell 
dramatically, from 1,774 in 2004 to 445 in 2008. 
The decline in the number of juveniles given 
custodial sentences is due in part to a 2008 
amnesty. 
- The main alternative sentence used is 
&#8215;conditional suspension of the sentence&#8216;, 
</p>
<p>equivalent of probation. In 2008, fines were 
imposed on approximately 10 per cent of 
convicted juveniles, and community service on 
nearly 25 per cent. Some convicted juveniles 
reject sentences of community service because it 
is considered demeaning, and there is some 
hostility towards offenders.  
- The number of persons below age 18 being 
supervised by the Probation Service at the end 
of 2008 was approximately 1,000, and 170 new 
cases were added to the caseload during the first 
four months of 2009.  
- A Probation Service and a publicly funded 
Legal Aid Service have been established and are </p>

<p>in the process of developing specialized staff or 
programmes for juveniles. Measures intended to 
prevent abuse of juvenile suspects have been 
introduced and the recently established 
ombudspersons play a valuable role in 
investigating the situation of juvenile suspects, 
detainees and prisoners. 
- A Law on Mediation has come into force and 
mediators have been trained and certified. 
Referral of cases involving juveniles to 
mediation has begun and results are positive.  
 
<b>Government:</b> The Government invested 39 
million MDL for the improvement of conditions 
in detention facilities, including for reparation 
and procurement of medicines. The most 
important achievements in this field were:  
-launching the reconstruction of the Penitentiary 
No. 1 in Taraclia;  
-the reparation of the cells for minors detention 
in Penitentiary No. 13 in Chisinau; 
-organization of tenders for the reconstruction of 
the Penitentiary No. 4 in Cricova; 
-creation of a modern aqua treatment centre in 
Rusca Penitentiary No. 7; 
-improved dentistry services in the penitentiary 
hospital. 
The Department of Penitentiary Institutions 
promotes a program for the distribution of goods 
and items of personal hygiene. 
In 2010, there were 6270 detainees in detention 
facilities as opposed to 10 000 detainees in 
2005.  
During the first 9 months of 2010, the number of 
morbidities amounted to 9537, as compared to 
10 056 during the same period of 2009, out of 
which the number of persons with body injuries 
was 1527 in 2010, and 842 in 2009. </p>

<p>- In early 2010, the process of establishing a 
representative and self-administrative organ of 
the prosecutors was finalised, in accordance 
with the provision of the Law on prosecutor&#8216;s 
Office. In 2010, the Superior Council of 
Prosecutors (SCP), as guarantor and 
representative of the prosecutor&#8216;s body assured 
</p>
<p>the work of the Disciplinary Board, 
Qualification Board, the improvement of the 
policy on human resources, reorganization and 
optimization of the prosecutor&#8216;s activities, 
</p>
<p>strengthening the role of the SCP in the 
activities of the prosecutors. 
 
During 2010, the SCP managed the following 
activities:  
-Improving the activities of the prosecutorial 
organs, raising the level of prosecutors&#8216; 
responsibility, consolidating transparency, 
changing the image of prosecutors&#8216; image in the 
</p>
<p>society. 
-Developing cooperation and partnership with 
other state authorities&#8216; organs. 
- Protecting the prosecutors&#8216; statute. 
- Developing partnership relations with mass-
media through the elaboration of a 
communication strategy.  
In order to perform its duties prescribed in the 
art. 82 of the Law on Prosecutors&#8216; office and the 
</p>
<p>Regulations regarding its activities, Superior 
Council of Prosecutors (SCP) had 18 
meetings/sessions and adopted 318 decisions. 
The Qualification Board and the Disciplinary 
Board have had a number of meetings, adopted 
several decisions and considered 64 disciplinary 
proceedings.  
So far, the Appeal Court did not repeal any 
decisions adopted by the SCP. </p>

<p>(d) Compensation and 
rehabilitation 
i) Incorporate the right to 
reparation for victims of 
torture and ill-treatment into 
the domestic law together 
with clearly set-out 
enforcement mechanisms; 
lend full support to non-
governmental institutions 
working on the rehabilitation 
of torture victims and protect 
the staff working for those 
institutions. 
</p>
<p>Article 616 of the Civil 
Code dealt with 
compensation, but no cases 
of compensation in practice; 
Services were provided by 
the non-governmental 
Medical Rehabilitation 
Centre for Torture Victims 
&#8213;Memoria&#8214;, which depended 
</p>
<p>on foreign funding and was 
unable to cover the entire 
country;  
Rehabilitation therefore 
suffers from a lack of 
financial resources for the 
establishment of adequate 
facilities as well as for 
training of health personnel; 
Allegations of threats 
against staff of &#8213;Memoria&#8214;. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b>  There was no increase in funding 
for the rehabilitation of victims of torture since 
2008. Humanitarian aid was provided in the 
framework of projects for rehabilitation of 
victims of torture. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Severe problems in 
securing funding to assist with the rehabilitation 
of torture victims exist. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In principle, 
although criminal and civil remedies exist under 
domestic law for victims of torture, in practice, 
there continue to be severe obstacles to access 
such legal remedies. 
- In 2009, at the initiative of the Prime Minister, 
a commission comprised of representatives of 
several ministries and a civil society 
organisation has been established for identifying 
the victims of the April 2009 events entitled to 
financial compensation, remedies and other 
rehabilitation measures. 
- On 22 April 2010, the Commission decided 
that both civilians and police officers who 
suffered physical or psychological trauma would 
be provided with the rehabilitation and 
compensation.  
- The identification of the victims was delegated 
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry 
of Health, with the help of non-governmental 
organizations. Non-identified victims can still 
submit applications accompanied with other 
documents. As of 1 June 2010, there had been 
no monetary compensation paid to the victims, 
although a draft decision on the first payments 
to 19 victims has reportedly been forwarded to 
the Government for approval. 
- In practice, the primary victim rehabilitation

(e) Women 
i) Ensure adequate funding 
for the existing infrastructure 
to support victims of 
domestic violence and 
trafficking and extend the 
network of centres providing 
psycho-social, legal and 
residential services to all parts 
of the country taking into 
account the increased 
vulnerability of women and 
girls in rural areas; 
ii)Establish specialized 
female law enforcement 
units; 
iii) Devise concrete 
mechanisms to implement the 
new Law on preventing and 
combating family violence in 
practice, including through a 
Plan of Action for its 
implementation and 
monitoring, including through 
allocation of adequate 
budgetary and human 
resources to relevant State 
bodies. 
</p>
<p>The scale of trafficking was 
relatively unknown because 
most victims were not 
identified due to the absence 
of systematic identification 
processes and the inability or 
unwillingness of some 
victims to report their 
trafficking experiences; 
The infrastructure to support 
survivors of domestic 
violence was lacking in most 
parts of the country (only 
one shelter existed in July 
2008, which was privately 
run and situated in the 
capital). 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> Through the three Health Centres 
for Women, women subjected to any form of 
violence or trafficking are provided with 
psychological counselling, followed by a 
medical examination and placement in a 
rehabilitation centre, if necessary. The 12 Youth 
Friendly Health Centres provide a psychologist, 
consultancy and educational discussions, 
healthcare services for detecting diseases, as 
well as supervision and medical and 
psychological rehabilitation of victims of 
trafficking. 
During 2009, the Maternal Centre of Placement 
and Rehabilitation for young children from 
Chisinau municipality accepted a victim of 
trafficking and other five persons facing the risk 
of being trafficked. They have been provided 
with psychological counselling, medical 
examinations and rehabilitation assistance. 
A priority in the field of combating and 
preventing domestic violence is the creation and 
consolidation of the services that are currently 
underdeveloped and are provided mainly by 
NGOs. Three centres are highlighted:  
- the Maternal Centre &#8213;Pro Femina&#8214; (Hincesti) 
provides temporary placement and counselling 
services (psychological, social, legal) to mothers 
and children as victims of domestic violence; 
- the Family Crisis Centre &#8213;SOTIS&#8214; (Balti) 
provides counselling to victims of domestic 
violence (psychological, social, legal, medical); 
- the Centre for temporary placement of children 
at risk &#8213;The Way Home&#8214; (Balti) provides 
</p>
<p>rehabilitation services to mothers and children 
as victims of domestic violence or victims of 
human trafficking.

ten multifunctional centres for social 
reintegration (with placement) were set up, 
which provide services for victims of human 
trafficking and victims of domestic violence. 
According to a Disposition by the Ministry of 
Health (no. 373-d of 15 June 2009), the 
Directors of Family Doctors Centres of Anenii

The Law on Prevention and Elimination of 
Violence in the Family entered into force on 18 
September 2008. It includes important 
provisions on domestic violence, establishes an 
institutional framework with detailed 
responsibilities of the relevant authorities, 
provides for the creation of centres/services for 
the rehabilitation of victims and aggressors, and 
for complaints mechanisms, protection orders 
and punishment of aggressors. In order to 
implement this law, a draft law regarding the 
amendment and modification of a number of

<p>Romanian Government for Moldova and 
implemented by UNFPA in cooperation with the 
Ministry of Social Protection, Family and 
Children and civil society.  In the framework of 
this Project, the concept of the informational 
system &#8213;State Register of Cases of Violence 
</p>
<p>within the Family&#8214; was approved by 
</p>
<p>Government Decision no. 544 on 9 September 
2009. This system will significantly contribute 
to the continuous monitoring of domestic 
violence and statistical analyses will provide a 
consistent basis for developing effective policies 
to prevent and combat domestic violence and 
will facilitate the cooperation between the 
appropriate institutions. In order to initiate the 
process of statistical data collection, statistical 
cards were developed for recording cases of 
violence within the family for experts from three 
branches (health, social protection and police). 
This process was launched in two pilot districts: 
Drochia and Cahul. 
 
<b>Non-governmental sources:</b> Moldova is a 
source and, to a lesser extent, a transit and 
destination country for trafficking in women, 
men and children for purposes of forced 
prostitution, begging and forced labour. The 
small breakaway region of Transnistria in 
eastern Moldova is outside the central 
Government&#8216;s control and remained a source of 
</p>
<p>trafficking. 
- The new Government demonstrated a high-
level commitment to combating trafficking by 
establishing a cabinet-level national committee 
on trafficking led by the foreign minister and, 
fully funded and staffed Permanent Secretariat 
of the National Committee for Preventing 
Trafficking in Persons. The Government </p>

<p>continued funding the trafficking assistance 
centre run jointly by the government and the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM). 
- Since 2006, the Government has been 
implementing the National Referral System for 
Assistance and Protection of Victims and 
Potential Victims of Trafficking (NRS) - a 
comprehensive system of cooperation between 
governmental and non-governmental agencies 
involved in combating human trafficking. On 5 
December 2008, the NRS Strategy 2009 - 2016 
and Action Plan 2009 - 2011 were approved by 
the Parliament. 
- As of 2010, the Assistance and Protection 
Centre for Victims and Potential Victims of 
Trafficking in Human Beings (CAPC) has been 
established within the NRS which was 
subordinated to the Ministry of Labor, Social 
Protection and Family, and is jointly 
coordinated by the IOM. The CAPC provides 
temporary residence, psychological, social and 
legal support to victims. In 2008, the 
Government institutionalized the CAPC.  
- The NRS is being implemented in the regions 
through the creation and training of 
multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) composed of a 
wide range of specialists. Since 2006, MDTs 
have been created and trainings have been 
carried out in 26 territorial units of Moldova. 
The Government is working on creating MDTs 
in all rayons by 2012.  
- The Government has not yet established 
specialized female law enforcement units. 
- With the Law on Preventing and Combating 
Domestic Violence (Law No. 45) in force since 
September 2008 and with the support of IOM, 
UNFPA and other partners, the NRS started 
extending the same assistance to victims and </p>

<p>potential victims of domestic violence. Several 
capacity-building events were conducted for 
district and community level specialists in five 
districts. 
- The 2008 law authorizes courts to issue 
protection orders within 24 hours of receiving a 
request for such an order. Since September 
2009, about 28 protection orders have been 
issued. There are concerns about the low level 
of knowledge about the provisions of the law on 
domestic violence, general awareness and 
tolerance of the public towards the phenomenon. 
Protection orders have only been issued in a 
limited number of jurisdictions, namely Anenii 
Noi, Soldanesti, Vulcanesti, Causeni, Falesti, 
Rezina and, from June 2010, Chisinau. 
- The Law 167/2010 also requires the district 
police and social assistance offices to appoint 
persons responsible for the prevention and 
combating of domestic violence. At the 
community level, mayors will be responsible for 
the supervision and coordination of such 
measures.   
- Negotiations over creating the first 
rehabilitation centre for victims of domestic 
violence in Drochia district are under way. The 
Ministry of Labour, Social Protection and 
Family has committed to cover partially the 
costs of the centre in 2011. 
- The above efforts have been complemented by 
nationwide awareness-raising events, aimed at 
raising a non-tolerant attitude towards domestic 
violence and promoting a trust-line for victims 
of domestic violence.  
- One further step towards the prevention of 
domestic violence is the recent approval of the 
National Program on Gender Equality 2010-
2015 and the National Action Plan on Gender </p>

933 of 31 December 2009). A working group is 
currently working on adjusting the domestic 
legislation on gender equality with international 
standards.  
 
<b>Government:</b> Significant progress was 
achieved in relation to national response to 
gender-based violence. On 3 September 2010,

mechanism for the law on family violence was 
approved by the Parliament.  
-The Model Regulations for the Rehabilitation 
Centre for Victims of Family Violence 
(Government Decision No.129 of 22 February 
2010) was approved. 
-The draft Quality Standards in Delivering 
Assistance for Victims of Family Violence is 
still under revision and is expected to be 
approved by the end of 2010.  
-Based on the above legislation, the Government 
with the support of UNFPA, has developed the 
draft of profession specific guidelines for the 
implementation of legislation in the area of 
domestic violence for police officers, medical 
staff and social assistants.  
-The guidelines is currently being reviewed by 
relevant ministries and will be tentatively 
approved by the end of 2010.  
- The issues of violence against women and 
domestic violence are specifically targeted in the 
National Programme on Gender Equality for 
2010-2015.

i) Consider ratifying the 
Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities and 
ensure respect for the 
safeguards available to 
patients, in particular their 
right to free and informed 
consent in compliance with 
international standards (see 
also report A/63/175); 
ii) Allocate funds necessary 
to reform the system of

Rapporteur, in particular 
those serving court 
sentences were held in 
apathy, subject to excessive 
use of tranquilizers;  
Lack of clarity of whether 
the use of tranquilizers ways 
based on free and informed 
consent by the patients;  
The medication given to the 
partly very young children, 
especially in terms of 
tranquilizers, was clearly not 
suitable;  
The Ministry of Health 
recognized that the 
treatment, which consisted 
almost exclusively of the use 
of strong neuroleptics was 
inadequate and indicated 
that psychiatric care would 
be individualized, new 
treatments developed, and 
modern drugs purchased 
once the necessary funds 
were made available; 
</p>
<p>Labour, Family and Social Protection 
undertakes a number of actions in order to 
prepare the ratification of the Convention on the 
Rights of Persons with Disabilities, including 
drafting a strategy on social inclusion of persons 
with disabilities and adjusting national 
legislation to international standards in this 
respect. 
Within the psychiatric medical institutions, 
patients are treated with minimum therapeutic 
doses of psychotropic substances and are 
involved in the rehabilitation process that 
includes ergo-therapy through attending the 
reading room and the gym. The reforms adopted 
by the administration of the psychiatric medical 
institutions led to creating and extending the 
recreational space. The patient is informed of 
the methods of treatment and the prescribed 
medicine and is asked to sign the &#8213;Consent on 
hospitalization, investigation and therapeutic 
procedures provided within the psychiatric 
hospital&#8214;. If the patient is unable to sign the 
</p>
<p>form, it will be signed by his or her close 
relative or legal representative.  
Within the health facilities, children are treated 
with the last generation of psychotropic 
substances calculated in line with international 
standards by bodyweight. The therapeutic 
indications are prescribed in accordance with 
treatment standards and are coordinated with 
professors of the department of psychiatry, 
narcology and psychology. Currently, the focus 
in pedo-psychiatry is based on the use of 
psychotherapy, occupational therapy, 
physiotherapy and physical exercises.

<p>Convention on the Rights of Persons with 
Disabilities and on 21 September 2010, it 
deposited the instrument of ratification. 
- Reforms directed to the implementation of the 
Convention are in initial stages and are expected 
to take at least 18 months. Early areas identified 
for reform in this regard include clarification of 
the monitoring mechanisms; adoption of a 
comprehensive anti-discrimination law; 
reforming civil code provisions on guardianship 
and trusteeship; ending practices of abusive 
detention of persons with mental disabilities; 
reorienting social inclusion systems for the 
treatment of persons with disabilities; reforming 
the Education Code to facilitate genuine 
inclusion of persons with disabilities in 
schooling and vocational training. 
In March 2010, the Ministry of Health 
established the Human Rights and Health 
Working Group which elaborated a plan of 
actions intended to address issues of concern 
raised in the CPT report (CPT/Inf (2008) 39). It 
generally recognized that the large mental health 
institutions need to be significantly reorganized 
and reformed to efficiently redress the situation. 
In August 2010, the Ministry initiated the 
revision of about 20 regulations.  It is likely that 
another reform will be needed, as the August 
2010 was carried out without extensive 
consultation.

<p>according to the international standards. The 
funds for centralized purchase of drugs 
providing free drugs to patients who suffer from 
chronic mental disabilities, and patients with 
disabilities of I-II degree, have been increased 
from 5 mln lei (2008) to 12 mln lei (2009). The 
in-patients are provided with recent 
psychoactive medications. Specific measures 
have been undertaken with the purpose of 
improving accommodation conditions. Such 
measures include increasing nutrition from 11 
lei (2009) to 16 lei (2010) per patient per day, 
performing reparation in clinical units. Other 
measures undertaken include:  
- improved conditions for forced treatment, 
installed video equipment ensuring safety and 
protection; improved informed consent upon the 
admission to the hospital; therapy; and 
formulation of invasive investigations.  
- established institutional rehabilitation service 
for patients with mental disabilities and

<p><b>Government:</b>  The existence of a secessionist 
regime in the Eastern part created serious 
difficulties to the implementation of 
commitments resulting from relevant 
international conventions on human rights 
protection and other international treaties to 
which Moldova is party throughout the country. 
Moldovan authorities do not have access and are 
unable to effectively exercise constitutional 
prerogatives in the region, because of parallel 
structures that have usurped local power in this 
part of the country. The state of affairs 
concerning torture or cruel, inhuman or 
degrading treatment and punishment applied to 
individuals remains unknown. The Government 
periodically raises awareness of international 
organizations on cases of violations of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms by the 
separatist regime in Tiraspol, aiming at 
determining it to comply with the rigors of 
international standards in this matter.

<p>contain the definition of 
torture required by the 
Convention against Torture, 
it criminalized &#8213;istyazanie&#8214; 
</p>
<p>(torment), to be punished 
with up to 3 years 
imprisonment and stated that 
it can be combined with 
&#8213;torture&#8214;, to be punished 
</p>
<p>with up to 7 years 
imprisonment; 
Although abolitionist in 
practice, the death penalty 
was still provided for by the 
&#8213;legislation&#8214; of the 
</p>
<p>Transnistrian region of the 
Republic of Moldova; 
Legislation in force required 
solitary confinement for 
persons sentenced to capital 
punishment and to life 
imprisonment and prescribed 
draconic restrictions on 
contacts with the outside 
world. 
</p>
<p> 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b> An independent 
monitoring mechanism for places of detention 
has not been established. Transnistrian 
authorities refused to cooperate with 
international organizations wanting to monitor 
places of detention. On 21 July 2010, a 
delegation of the Committee against Torture had 
to interrupt its visit to Transnistria because of 
the lack of guarantees by the official 
representatives to interview detainees 
confidentially. The Transnistrian Ombudsman 
has not been responsive to the United Nations 
country office&#8216;s approaches of initiating joint 
</p>
<p>visits to places of detention.  
- In practice, cases of arbitrary detention have 
been regularly reported in Transnistria and the 
Special Rapporteur on Torture has taken them 
up. 
- The death penalty has not yet been abolished 
as per article 43 of the Transnistrian Criminal 
Code. Torture has not been introduced as a 
crime in the Criminal Code. 
- The practice of solitary confinement for 
persons sentenced to death and to life 
imprisonment has not changed.

<p><b>  Seguimiento de las recomendaciones del Relator Especial (Theo van Boven) en su informe relativo a su visita a Espa&#241;a del 5 
</b></p>
<p><b>al 10 de octubre de 2003 (E/CN.4/2004/56/Add.2) 
</b></p>
<p>122. El 22 de noviembre de 2011, el Relator Especial envi&#243; la tabla que se encuentra a continuaci&#243;n al Gobierno de Espa&#241;a 
solicitando informaci&#243;n y comentarios sobre las medidas adoptadas con respecto a la aplicaci&#243;n de sus recomendaciones. El Relator 
Especial lamenta que el Gobierno no haya proporcionado una respuesta a su solicitud. &#201;l espera recibir informaci&#243;n en cuanto a sus 
esfuerzos para aplicar las recomendaciones, e informa de su disposici&#243;n a ayudarle en los esfuerzos para prevenir y combatir la 
tortura y los malos tratos.  
</p>
<p>123. Con respecto a las garant&#237;as de las personas detenidas, el Relator Especial pide al Gobierno a que proporcione informaci&#243;n 
acerca del proceso de seguimiento, evaluaci&#243;n y reformulaci&#243;n del Plan Nacional de Derechos Humanos. En particular, el Relator 
agradecer&#237;a contar con informaci&#243;n en cuanto a la reforma del art&#237;culo 520.4 de la Ley de Enjuiciamiento Criminal a fin de reducir 
el actual plazo m&#225;ximo de ocho horas dentro del cual debe hacerse efectivo el derecho a la asistencia letrada. En relaci&#243;n a las 
relaciones sociales entre los presos y sus familias, el Relator Especial quisiera agradecer al Gobierno de Espa&#241;a por la explicaci&#243;n 
detallada de la pol&#237;tica de separaci&#243;n de los presos. Sin embargo, tomando en cuenta la importancia de la familia, el Relator 
Especial exhorta al Gobierno a reconsiderar esta pol&#237;tica.  
</p>
<p>124. Con relaci&#243;n a la limitaci&#243;n de las garant&#237;as para los detenidos incomunicados, el Relator Especial solicita al gobierno que 
proporcione informaci&#243;n acerca de las reformas legales previstas por el Plan Nacional de Derechos Humanos que garantizar&#237;an el 
examen m&#233;dico de las personas en situaciones de incomunicaci&#243;n por un segundo m&#233;dico adscrito al sistema p&#250;blico de salud, 
designado por el mecanismo nacional de prevenci&#243;n de tortura. Adem&#225;s, tomando en cuenta el hecho de que ha sido adoptado en la 
pr&#225;ctica por la mitad de los juzgados encargados de la instrucci&#243;n de los delitos de banda armada, el Relator reitera su 
recomendaci&#243;n de aplicar el protocolo que permite a los detenidos ser examinados por m&#233;dicos de su elecci&#243;n en todo juzgado 
encargado de la instrucci&#243;n de los delitos de banda armada. 
</p>
<p>125. Con respecto a los casos de delitos de terrorismo, el Relator Especial toma en cuenta que tres de los seis juzgados encargados 
de la instrucci&#243;n de los delitos terroristas vienen aplicando un protocolo por el cual comunican a las familias de los detenidos el 
lugar de la detenci&#243;n y los traslados que se lleven a cabo. A la luz de ello, considerar&#237;a recomendable que este protocolo se aplicara 
en todo juzgado encargado de la instrucci&#243;n de los delitos de terrorismo.  
</p>
<p>126. En relaci&#243;n al r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, el Relator Especial toma nota de la informaci&#243;n proporcionada por el Gobierno 
de Espa&#241;a sobre este tema. Sin embargo, a la luz de la informaci&#243;n recibida por el Relator Especial en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os acerca de un 
presunto alto porcentaje de alegaciones de actos de maltrato o tortura relacionados con situaciones de detenci&#243;n e incomunicaci&#243;n, 
llama al Gobierno a considerar seriamente la supresi&#243;n del r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, o en todo caso regularlo m&#225;s estrictamente 
para que no sea la circunstancia propicia para la aplicaci&#243;n de tormentos.

<p>Las m&#225;s altas autoridades 
deber&#237;an reafirmar y declarar 
oficial y p&#250;blicamente la 
prohibici&#243;n de la tortura y los 
tratos o penas crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes en 
toda circunstancia e 
investigar con las denuncias 
de la pr&#225;ctica de la tortura en 
todas sus formas. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>2010: Fuentes no gubernamentales:</i></b>  La 
promoci&#243;n y defensa de los derechos 
humanos constituye una de las prioridades 
de la pol&#237;tica exterior del gobierno as&#237; como 
de su pol&#237;tica de cooperaci&#243;n internacional. 
As&#237; se recoge en los Planes reci&#233;n aprobados 
en Consejo de Ministros el pasado 12 de 
diciembre de 2008 como en el nuevo Plan 
Director de Cooperaci&#243;n Espa&#241;ola 2009-
2012. 
</p>
<p>- En los pocos casos en que la tortura se ha 
demostrado fehacientemente, las autoridades 
han minimizado su importancia, 
consider&#225;ndolos en todo caso hechos 
aislados sin mucha importancia.  
</p>
<p>Este talante de ocultaci&#243;n colisiona con la 
posici&#243;n de la sociedad civil, de sectores 
profesionales y acad&#233;micos que han 
denunciado la existencia de la tortura y 
exigido la implementaci&#243;n de medidas 
concretas para su prevenci&#243;n y por medio de 
ella, su erradicaci&#243;n.   
</p>
<p>- En cuanto a las actuaciones 
gubernamentales, cabe destacar la 
aprobaci&#243;n de la Ley Org&#225;nica 4/2010, de 
20 de mayo, del R&#233;gimen disciplinario del 
Cuerpo Nacional de Polic&#237;a, en la que se 
tipifican como faltas muy graves &quot;la pr&#225;ctica 
de tratos inhumanos, degradantes, 
discriminatorios o vejatorios a los 
ciudadanos que se encuentren bajo custodia 
policial&quot;.

<p>- El Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n, en

pr&#225;cticas en este sentido. 
</p>
<p><b>Gobierno:</b> El Gobierno inform&#243; que la 
Constituci&#243;n espa&#241;ola establece en su 
art&#237;culo 15 el derecho a la vida y la 
integridad f&#237;sica y moral de las personas sin 
que en ning&#250;n caso puedan ser sometidas a 
tortura ni a penas o tratos inhumanos o 
degradantes. 
</p>
<p>Los malos tratos y las torturas constituyen 
en Espa&#241;a un delito perseguible de oficio, 
siempre que hay indicios de su comisi&#243;n, 
contemplando el ordenamiento jur&#237;dico 
varias v&#237;as para la investigaci&#243;n de dichos 
supuestos y la garant&#237;a del derecho 
fundamental. En particular, la Constituci&#243;n 
espa&#241;ola establece en su articulo 24 que 
todas las personas tienen derecho a obtener 
la tutela efectiva de los jueces y tribunales 
en el ejercicio de sus derechos e intereses 
leg&#237;timos, sin que en ning&#250;n caso pueda 
producirse indefensi&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>Por tanto la investigaci&#243;n se realiza a trav&#233;s 
de los &#243;rganos judiciales que son, por su 
propia naturaleza, independientes. El 
sistema espa&#241;ol vigente en materia de 
investigaciones sobre denuncias de malos 
tratos ya esta por tanto adecuado a las 
normas internacionales y a los principios 
generales que exigen que dichas 
investigaciones sean prontas, 
independientes, imparciales y exhaustivas. 
En efecto, dicha investigaci&#243;n corresponde a

de conformidad con dichos principios por lo 
que no caben mas mecanismos que los

considera que los &#243;rganos judiciales, cuya 
independencia es inherente a sus funciones, 
son la instituci&#243;n id&#243;nea para llevar a cabo 
dichas investigaciones, estando en total 
conformidad con los principios relativos a la

la tortura y otros tratos o penas, crueles, 
inhumanos o degradantes, adoptados por la 
Asamblea General en su resoluci&#243;n 55 /89 
anexo, de 4 de diciembre de 2000. 
</p>
<p>En el mismo sentido el articulo 53 establece 
que cualquier ciudadano podr&#225; recabar la

reconocidos en el articulo 14 y la secci&#243;n 
primera del capitulo 2&#186;- entre los que se 
encuentra la interdicci&#243;n de la tortura o los 
malos tratos- ante los tribunales ordinarios 
por un procedimiento basado en los 
principios de preferencia y sumariedad, e, 
incluso, a trav&#233;s del recurso de amparo ante 
el Tribunal Constitucional. 
</p>
<p>Asimismo, el Tribunal Constitucional (&#8213;alta

otorgan a los recurrentes el amparo 
necesitado y ordenan a las autoridades 
judiciales competentes que realicen una 
investigaci&#243;n m&#225;s exhaustiva de los hechos 
denunciados.  
</p>
<p>Esta &#250;ltima sentencia se&#241;ala que en relaci&#243;n 
con la investigaci&#243;n de este tipo de 
denuncias deben tomarse en consideraci&#243;n 
las circunstancias concretas de cada caso 
siendo preciso atender a la probable escasez 
de pruebas existentes en este tipo de delitos 
lo que debe alentar la diligencia del 
instructor para la pr&#225;ctica efectiva de las 
medidas posibles de investigaci&#243;n. La 
sentencia a&#241;ade que la cualificaci&#243;n oficial 
de los denunciados debe compensarse con la 
firmeza judicial frente a la posible 
resistencia o demora en la aportaci&#243;n de 
medios de prueba, con especial atenci&#243;n a 
las diligencias de prueba cuyo origen se 
sit&#250;e al margen de las instituciones afectadas 
por la denuncia, y con la presunci&#243;n a 
efectos indagatorios de que las lesiones que 
eventualmente presente el detenido tras su 
detenci&#243;n, y que eran inexistentes antes de la 
misma, son atribuibles a las personas 
encargadas de su custodia. En concreto 
respecto a la valoraci&#243;n del testimonio 
judicial del denunciante advierte que el 
efecto de la violencia ejercida sobre la 
libertad y las posibilidades de 
autodeterminaci&#243;n del individuo no deja de 
producirse en el momento en que 
f&#237;sicamente cesa aquella y se le pone a 
disposici&#243;n judicial, sino que su virtualidad 
coactiva puede pervivir y normalmente lo 
har&#225; mas all&#225; de su pr&#225;ctica.El Plan </p>

<p>Nacional de Derechos Humanos, aprobado 
por el Gobierno de Espa&#241;a en diciembre de 
2008, constituye por s&#237; solo la m&#225;s amplia 
declaraci&#243;n oficial posible a favor del 
respeto de los derechos humanos y la 
interdicci&#243;n de la tortura y los malos tratos. 
El Gobierno concibe el plan de derechos 
humanos como un mecanismo m&#225;s para la 
garant&#237;a de tales derechos, estableciendo una 
lista de compromisos concretos destinados 
precisamente a fomentar, realizar y proteger 
el ejercicio de los derechos humanos. Unos 
compromisos cuya ejecuci&#243;n efectiva puede 
ser seguida y evaluada. Las obligaciones 
internacionales, la elaboraci&#243;n de 
determinadas leyes, la creaci&#243;n de 
organismos espec&#237;ficos para su defensa, las 
decisiones dirigidas a mejorar la calidad de 
la justicia, los mecanismos de control a los 
poderes p&#250;blicos en su relaci&#243;n con los 
ciudadanos, los medidas en relaci&#243;n con la 
igualdad, con los derechos sociales, con el 
medio ambiente, la transparencia en la 
gesti&#243;n p&#250;blica, todos habr&#225;n de ser 
instrumentos con que perfeccionar la 
garant&#237;a de los derechos humanos en 
Espa&#241;a. 
</p>
<p>Cada medida del plan es una garant&#237;a en s&#237; 
misma. Lo es porque compromete al 
Gobierno a realizar acciones en beneficio de 
un derecho determinado, y lo es porque lleva 
aparejada la informaci&#243;n necesaria para que 
su ejecuci&#243;n pueda ser fiscalizada por las 
instituciones y organizaciones de la sociedad 
civil interesadas.

<p>Fuentes no gubernamentales 2008: No se 
observaron avances significativos durante el 
2007 en relaci&#243;n con la implementaci&#243;n de 
esta recomendaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>2007: El Gobierno espa&#241;ol reitera que el 
Ministerio del Interior ha venido aplicando 
siempre y sin excepci&#243;n el principio de 
tolerancia cero ante la posible vulneraci&#243;n 
de los derechos constitucionales, 
favoreciendo la investigaci&#243;n, la 
transparencia y la cooperaci&#243;n con el resto 
de los poderes del Estado cuando haya 
sospecha de que se haya producido uno de 
estos actos.  
</p>
<p>Fuentes no gubernamentales 2007: A nivel 
nacional se han producido algunas 
declaraciones institucionales en los &#250;ltimos 
dos a&#241;os. Sin embargo, siguen 
produci&#233;ndose declaraciones p&#250;blicas de 
altos responsables pol&#237;ticos y policiales que 
niegan que en Espa&#241;a se torture o que 
minimizan la gravedad de la situaci&#243;n. Son 
habituales las declaraciones p&#250;blicas de 
apoyo a funcionarios denunciados o 
inculpados por tortura y/o malos tratos.  
</p>
<p>2006: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Las 
autoridades no cuestionan el r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n y tachan de falsa todas las 
denuncias por tortura presentadas en los 
Juzgados.

</p>
<p>El Estado espa&#241;ol no tiene competencias

<p>- En 2009, de 88 personas detenidas en 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, 45 de ellas 
indicaron que fueron torturadas por la 
Ertzaintza (1), por  la Polic&#237;a Nacional (40) 
y por la Guardia Civil (15). Los m&#233;todos 
incluyen: asfixia por aplicaci&#243;n de bolsa, 
golpes, ejercicios f&#237;sicos y agresi&#243;n sexual a 
las mujeres. 
</p>
<p>- Hasta el 16 de Septiembre, 43 personas 
han sido detenidas bajo el r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n y 33 las personas que han 
denunciado malos tratos y tortura a manos 
de la Polic&#237;a Nacional (4), Ertzaintza (14) y 
Guardia Civil (12).  
</p>
<p>- El Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n 
tiene presente el r&#233;gimen de restricci&#243;n de 
derechos que supone la detenci&#243;n 
incomunicada, y por ello presta una especial 
atenci&#243;n al cumplimiento de todas las 
garant&#237;as de los detenidos. 
</p>
<p><b>Gobierno:</b> El Gobierno inform&#243; que la 
detenci&#243;n incomunicada se lleva a efecto en 
Espa&#241;a con todas las garant&#237;as procesales. 
Su r&#233;gimen legal es sumamente restrictivo, 
pues exige en todo caso autorizaci&#243;n judicial 
mediante resoluci&#243;n motivada y razonada 
que ha de dictarse en las primeras 24 horas 
de la detenci&#243;n, y un control permanente y 
directo de la situaci&#243;n personal del detenido 
por parte del juez que ha acordado la 
incomunicaci&#243;n o del juez de instrucci&#243;n del 
partido judicial en que el detenido se halle 
privado de libertad. </p>

<p>La necesidad de su mantenimiento deriva de 
que, en el caso bandas armadas, 
organizaciones terroristas o rebeldes, el 
esclarecimiento de los hechos delictivos 
requiere una investigaci&#243;n policial y judicial 
de mayor complejidad y con posibles 
implicaciones internacionales. 
</p>
<p>Tanto los tribunales ordinarios, como el 
Tribunal Constitucional, m&#225;ximo &#243;rgano

fundamentales en nuestro pa&#237;s, se han 
pronunciado sobre la adecuaci&#243;n de nuestro

las exigencias de los convenios 
internacionales suscritos por Espa&#241;a, 
precisamente por las rigurosas garant&#237;as que

<p>En consecuencia, hay que se&#241;alar que: 
</p>
<p>&#61485; El sistema de detenci&#243;n

comprometido, mediante el Plan de 
Derechos Humanos aprobado en diciembre 
de 2008, a adoptar las siguientes medidas 
que vengan a reforzar las garant&#237;as con las 
que ya cuentan las personas detenidas en

</p>
<p>a. prohibici&#243;n de la aplicaci&#243;n del

<p>b. designaci&#243;n, por el mecanismo

incomunicado.

<p>c. grabaci&#243;n en v&#237;deo de todo el tiempo

<p>Constitucional, declarando expresamente 
que es causa razonable de limitaci&#243;n del 
derecho a la asistencia por el letrado de 
confianza. El r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n es 
sumamente garantista. El r&#233;gimen es de 
aplicaci&#243;n absolutamente excepcional. En 
2008, solo se aplic&#243; al 0.049% del total de 
detenidos.  
</p>
<p>La Medida 97 del Plan se&#241;ala algunas 
medidas para mejorar las garant&#237;as de los 
detenidos sometidos al r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Fuentes no gubernamentales: El Plan 
Nacional de Derechos Humanos proh&#237;be la 
detenci&#243;n incomunicada de menores e 
incluye el derecho a un segundo examen 
m&#233;dico por un m&#233;dico designado por el 
titular del futuro MNP. 
</p>
<p>El porcentaje de detenidos incomunicados 
entre 2004 y 2008 en las que hubo 
alegaciones de maltrato o tortura var&#237;a entre 
76 y 84 por ciento. Los m&#233;todos de tortura 
incluyen tortura f&#237;sica, m&#233;todos de 
privaci&#243;n, tortura sexual, amenazas, t&#233;cnicas 
coercitivas y de comunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>Aunque la polic&#237;a aut&#243;noma vasca no aplic&#243; 
el r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n a ninguna 
persona detenido en 2007 y 2008, se ha 
sometido por los menos una persona a dicho 
r&#233;gimen desde marzo de 2009. 
</p>
<p>En 2009 la Ertzaintza solicit&#243; la 
incomunicaci&#243;n de un detenido, por primera 
vez desde 2006. El Parlamento Vasco 
rechaz&#243; una propuesta de ley que solicitaba 
la derogaci&#243;n de dicho r&#233;gimen. </p>

<p>Pese a que en la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola se han 
establecido ciertas salvaguardias jur&#237;dicas al 
respecto, como la asistencia de un abogado 
designado de oficio, el Relator Especial 
opina que el mantenimiento de ese r&#233;gimen 
resulta altamente problem&#225;tico y abre la 
posibilidad de que se inflija un trato 
prohibido al detenido y, al mismo tiempo, 
expone a Espa&#241;a a tener que responder a 
denuncias de malos tratos a detenidos 
(A/HRC/10/3/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>2008: El Parlamento espa&#241;ol rechaz&#243; varias 
iniciativas parlamentarias para modificar el 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>La incomunicaci&#243;n no se decide de modo 
autom&#225;tico, sino conforme al procedimiento 
establecido en la ley. S&#243;lo se aplic&#243; la 
detenci&#243;n incomunicada al 37.5 % de los 
detenidos, y al 29.7% cuando se refiere a los 
casos relacionados con ETA.  
</p>
<p>El detenido en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n 
se ve privado de algunos derechos.  
</p>
<p>Existe una pr&#225;ctica sistem&#225;tica en el entorno 
de la banda terrorista ETA de denunciar 
torturas, con el objetivo de provocar el 
continuo descr&#233;dito de las Fuerzas y 
Cuerpos de Seguridad.  
</p>
<p>2008: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Las 
personas detenidas en relaci&#243;n con el 
terrorismo son incomunicadas de manera 
sistem&#225;tica, a petici&#243;n de las fuerzas 
policiales que los detienen. Al menos una 
tercera parte denunci&#243; tortura y malos tratos 
durante su custodia policial.

incomunicada vigente en Espa&#241;a est&#225; 
rodeado de las m&#225;ximas cautelas legales que 
aseguran su adecuaci&#243;n a los est&#225;ndares 
internacionales de derechos humanos, e 
impiden la tortura o malos tratos.  
</p>
<p>La detenci&#243;n policial en r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n no produce que al detenido 
se vea privado de ninguno de sus derechos 
fundamentales, ni la falta de supervisi&#243;n 
judicial que favorezca la posible tortura o 
malos tratos.

<p>La incomunicaci&#243;n tiene por objeto evitar

<p>preste de acuerdo con lo previsto en el 
ordenamiento jur&#237;dico, utilizando los medios 
disponibles para hacer efectiva la presencia 
del abogado a la mayor brevedad posible. 
 
Para ello, la solicitud de asistencia letrada se 
cursar&#225; de forma inmediata al abogado 
designado por el detenido o, en su defecto, 
al colegio de abogados, reiterando la misma, 
si transcurridas tres horas de la primera 
comunicaci&#243;n, no se hubiera personado el 
letrado. 
</p>
<p>En el libro de telefonemas se anotar&#225; 
siempre la llamada o llamadas al letrado o 
colegio de abogados y todas las incidencias 
que pudieran producirse (imposibilidad de 
establecer comunicaci&#243;n, falta de respuesta 
etc.).&#8214; 
</p>
<p>Para mejorar las garant&#237;as de las personas 
detenidas y dar cumplimiento a las 
recomendaciones de los organismos 
internacionales en materia de defensa de los 
derechos humanos, el Plan Nacional de 
Derechos Humanos contempla abordar la 
reforma del art&#237;culo 520.4 de la ley de 
enjuiciamiento criminal a fin de reducir el 
actual plazo m&#225;ximo de ocho horas, dentro 
del que debe hacerse efectivo el derecho a la 
asistencia letrada.

<p>Por lo que se refiere al derecho a 
entrevistarse en privado con un abogado, 
hay que se&#241;alar que todas las personas 
detenidas en Espa&#241;a, con excepci&#243;n de los 
sometidos a r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, 
tienen derecho a entrevistarse en privado

<p>La privaci&#243;n, en el caso de detenidos 
sometidos al r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, 
del derecho a entrevistarse en privado con 
un abogado responde, cuando nos 
enfrentamos a bandas armadas, terroristas o 
criminales altamente organizadas, a la 
necesidad de proteger la integridad del 
abogado y evitar el riesgo de que  pueda ser 
objeto de coacci&#243;n para la consecuci&#243;n de 
fines tales como la difusi&#243;n de alertas que 
puedan facilitar la fuga del resto de 
integrantes de la banda terrorista, la 
destrucci&#243;n de las pruebas del delito etc. 
</p>
<p>No se considera que la celebraci&#243;n de una 
entrevista privada del detenido con su 
abogado constituya una garant&#237;a esencial 
contra eventuales malos tratos policiales. S&#237; 
lo es, como recoge nuestro ordenamiento 
jur&#237;dico, el control continuo y permanente 
de la autoridad judicial, o en su caso del 
fiscal, que desde el primer momento debe 
tener constancia de la detenci&#243;n, del lugar de 
custodia, y de los funcionarios actuantes, 
para lo que cuenta con los medios necesarios 
para llevar a cabo dicho control, auxiliado 
por los correspondientes m&#233;dicos forenses, y 
capacitado para tomar las medidas 
necesarias en cada  momento, como por 
ejemplo denegar la incomunicaci&#243;n u 
ordenar que el detenido pase 
inmediatamente a su disposici&#243;n.

<p>b)  El sistema legal espa&#241;ol atribuye 
espec&#237;ficamente a los m&#233;dicos forenses la 
asistencia de todos los detenidos y no s&#243;lo 
de aquellos que se encuentran en r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n, constituyendo su labor la 
m&#225;s eficaz forma de garant&#237;a contra 
eventuales malos tratos por las siguientes 
razones: 
</p>
<p>&#61485; Se trata de profesionales de la 
medicina con a&#241;os de especializaci&#243;n en la 
investigaci&#243;n de las causas de la muerte o de 
las lesiones sufridas por una persona, por lo 
que tienen la mejor formaci&#243;n para detectar 
cualquier mal trato que pudiera sufrir el 
detenido.  
</p>
<p>&#61485; Prestan servicio a la administraci&#243;n 
de justicia tras ser seleccionados mediante 
oposici&#243;n p&#250;blica, conforme a los principios 
de m&#233;rito y capacidad, y en funci&#243;n de sus 
conocimientos t&#233;cnicos y legales. Ni el juez, 
ni las autoridades gubernamentales pueden 
elegir qu&#233; m&#233;dico forense atiende a un 
detenido concreto, tarea que corresponde a 
quien est&#233; previamente destinado en dicho 
juzgado. 
</p>
<p>&#61485; En su actuaci&#243;n profesional, los 
m&#233;dicos forenses est&#225;n plenamente 
sometidos a las normas deontol&#243;gicas de la 
profesi&#243;n m&#233;dica, sin que puedan recibir 
instrucciones ni del juez ni de las 
autoridades gubernativas. 
</p>
<p>Pese a que la presencia del m&#233;dico forense 
constituye por s&#237; misma la principal garant&#237;a 
de los derechos del detenido, nuestra 
legislaci&#243;n permite que los detenidos no </p>

<p>incomunicados puedan ser visitados por un 
m&#233;dico de su elecci&#243;n. Adicionalmente, la 
instrucci&#243;n 12/2007 del Secretario de Estado 
de Seguridad contempla que en el caso de 
que el detenido presente cualquier lesi&#243;n 
imputable o no a la detenci&#243;n deber&#225; ser 
trasladado de forma inmediata a un centro 
sanitario para su evaluaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Si bien, en el caso de detenidos 
incomunicados, la legislaci&#243;n espa&#241;ola 
permite limitar su derecho a acceder a un 
m&#233;dico de su elecci&#243;n, la mitad de los 
juzgados encargados de la instrucci&#243;n de los 
delitos de banda armada, vienen en la 
pr&#225;ctica aplicando, desde diciembre de 
2006, un protocolo por el que se permite que 
los detenidos puedan ser examinados por 
m&#233;dicos de su elecci&#243;n, si as&#237; lo solicitan, en 
uni&#243;n del m&#233;dico forense adscrito al 
juzgado. 
</p>
<p>Adem&#225;s, y para generalizar estas garant&#237;as 
adicionales, el Plan de Derechos Humanos 
aprobado por el Gobierno de Espa&#241;a prev&#233; 
que se lleven a cabo las reformas legales 
oportunas para garantizar que el detenido en 
situaci&#243;n de incomunicaci&#243;n sea reconocido, 
adem&#225;s de por el forense, por otro m&#233;dico 
adscrito al sistema p&#250;blico de salud 
libremente designado por el mecanismo 
nacional de prevenci&#243;n de la tortura. 
</p>
<p>c) La ley espa&#241;ola permite, en el caso de 
delitos de terrorismo, limitar temporalmente 
la comunicaci&#243;n del hecho de la detenci&#243;n a 
los familiares del detenido. Es una 
limitaci&#243;n temporal que tiene el mismo

<p>entorno pueda frustrar las investigaciones 
judiciales. 
</p>
<p>En cualquier caso, conviene tener en cuenta 
que tres de los seis juzgados encargados de 
la instrucci&#243;n de los delitos terroristas, 
vienen aplicando, desde diciembre de 2006, 
un protocolo por el cual s&#237; comunican a las 
familias de los detenidos el lugar de la 
detenci&#243;n y de los traslados que se lleven a 
cabo. 
</p>
<p>2009: La detenci&#243;n incomunicada solo 
puede durar el tiempo estrictamente 
necesario para la realizaci&#243;n de las 
averiguaciones tendentes al esclarecimiento 
de los hechos y, como m&#225;ximo 120 horas. 
Transcurrido este plazo, el detenido deber&#225; 
ser puesto a disposici&#243;n judicial. El Juez 
puede acordar la prisi&#243;n incomunicada por 
otro plazo no superior a 5 d&#237;as. Si hay merito 
para ello, el Juez puede acordar una nueva 
incomunicaci&#243;n de 3 d&#237;as. No existen casos 
en los que  la incomunicaci&#243;n dure m&#225;s de 5 
d&#237;as, y ninguno en 2009. 
</p>
<p>En cuanto a las presuntas amenazas a 
abogados por polic&#237;as, los abogados tendr&#237;an 
el inmediato amparo de sus corporaciones 
profesionales, del ministerio fiscal y de los 
juzgados y tribunales, adem&#225;s de poder 
presentar las denuncias correspondientes. 
</p>
<p>Los m&#233;dicos forenses prestan servicio a la 
Administraci&#243;n de Justicia tras ser 
seleccionados mediante concurso p&#250;blico. 
Ni el Juez ni las autoridades pueden elegir 
qu&#233; m&#233;dico atiende a un detenido concreto. 
Pese a que el Protocolo de Estambul no es 
de obligado cumplimiento, los m&#233;dicos </p>

recomendaciones en &#233;l contenidas. El 
detenido es tambi&#233;n examinado en el 
juzgado de guardia donde se le realiza un 
nuevo examen m&#233;dico. 
</p>
<p>La instrucci&#243;n 12/2007 se&#241;ala que en el caso 
de que el detenido presente cualquier lesi&#243;n, 
imputable o no a la detenci&#243;n, o manifieste 
presentarla, deber&#225; ser trasladado de forma 
inmediata a un centro sanitario. 
</p>
<p>En la pr&#225;ctica, los Jueces Centrales de 
Instrucci&#243;n acuerdan sistem&#225;ticamente la 
comunicaci&#243;n a las familias de los detenidos 
del lugar de la detenci&#243;n y de los traslados 
que se llevan a cabo. 
</p>
<p>Fuentes no gubernamentales: Al final del 
interrogatorio policial, el abogado de la 
persona detenida est&#225; autorizado a hacerle 
preguntas y a registrarlas como parte de la 
declaraci&#243;n formal. Sin embargo, en 
ocasiones los agentes del ordenan a los 
abogados a que se abstengan de intervenir. 
Los abogados que intentan hablar o que 
piden el n&#250;mero de identificaci&#243;n a los 
agentes presentes reciben un trato agresivo e 
intimidatorio. 
</p>
<p>Es frecuente que haya polic&#237;as presentes 
durante el examen m&#233;dico del detenido, por 
lo que puede sentirse intimidado y guardar 
silencio sobre los malos tratos sufridos. Por 
ello, los informes m&#233;dicos no siempre 
reflejan de manera exacta y completa el 
estado f&#237;sico y mental del detenido.

asistencia m&#233;dica y letrada al detenido. 
</p>
<p>2008: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Se 
observa un avance, si bien d&#233;bil y 
contradictorio. El Juez de la Audiencia 
Nacional, Baltasar Garz&#243;n, habr&#237;a permitido 
en ocasiones concretas que personas 
detenidas bajo r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n, 
tengan derecho a ser visitados por m&#233;dicos 
de su elecci&#243;n y que se informara a las

embargo, estas medidas s&#243;lo han sido 
aplicadas por un juez, no de oficio y en 
pocos casos. Las autoridades son renuentes a 
aplicar estas medidas de forma sistem&#225;tica y

</p>
<p>Ha aumentado el n&#250;mero de abogados que 
han sufrido agresiones o amenazas cuando

sobre su derecho a guardar silencio y a ver a

no tiene la oportunidad de hablar 
con el detenido. Aparentemente 
se informa a los detenidos que 
hay un abogado presente y se les 
facilita el n&#250;mero de 
identificaci&#243;n, pero no lo pueden 
ver. El abogado permanece en 
silencio mientras se hace la 
declaraci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>Se recibieron informes de que 
los detenidos eran encapuchados 
durante los traslados y durante 
el r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>abril de 2009, se hab&#237;an instalado 2.500 
c&#225;maras en Catalu&#241;a. 
</p>
<p>- El Plan de Derechos Humanos incluye el 
compromiso de instalar el material necesario 
para la grabaci&#243;n de las personas detenidas 
en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n. Sin 
embargo, no se incluye una medida similar 
para personas que no permanecen 
incomunicados.  
</p>
<p>- En el a&#241;o 2009 se orden&#243; la grabaci&#243;n de 
todo el per&#237;odo de incomunicaci&#243;n en tan 
s&#243;lo 14 ocasiones. En el caso de los cinco 
detenidos por parte de la Ertzaintza la orden 
ven&#237;a recogida en el Protocolo para el 
tratamiento de detenidos incomunicados, y 
en los restantes casos tuvo que ser una 
petici&#243;n expresa de la defensa. 
</p>
<p>- En el a&#241;o 2010, se ha autorizado la 
grabaci&#243;n en 16 ocasiones, 14 por actuaci&#243;n 
de la Ertzaintza. 
</p>
<p>- Pese a que varios juzgados en la 
instrucci&#243;n de denuncias de torturas han 
solicitado la visualizaci&#243;n y copia de estas 
grabaciones, a&#250;n no se han aportado en 
ninguna causa. 
</p>
<p>- Por medio de la Instrucci&#243;n 12/2009, del 
Secretario de Estado de Seguridad, se cre&#243; el 
&#171;Libro de Registro y Custodia de 
Detenidos&#187; como &#250;nico registro. Salvo los 
casos excepcionales previstos, s&#243;lo se 
anotar&#225;n los datos de personas detenidas 
mayores de 18 a&#241;os. Se pretende que la 
nueva ficha recoja cualquier incidencia que 
se haya podido producir en la detenci&#243;n y 
durante el traslado del detenido y que 
facilite la informaci&#243;n completa de su </p>

<p>seguridad del Estado est&#225;n dando puntual 
cumplimiento a todas las resoluciones 
judiciales (normalmente de la audiencia 
nacional) por las que se acuerda la grabaci&#243;n 
en v&#237;deo de los detenidos sometidos a 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n. Para ello, se les 
ha dotado de los medios t&#233;cnicos necesarios, 
tales como un avanzado sistema de 
grabaci&#243;n de las zonas comunes y salas para 
pr&#225;ctica de diligencias (declaraciones, 
reconocimientos, desprecinto de efectos 
intervenidos) de la comisar&#237;a general de 
informaci&#243;n en Madrid, as&#237; como unidades 
port&#225;tiles de grabaci&#243;n para su utilizaci&#243;n 
por la guardia civil. 
</p>
<p> En cuanto a la instalaci&#243;n de videoc&#225;maras 
en todos los centros de detenci&#243;n de las 
FCSE, se est&#225;n instalando c&#225;maras en las 
zonas comunes de los centros de detenci&#243;n 
tanto del CNP como de la GC, estando ya 
cubierto un porcentaje superior al 50% de 
los mismos. 
</p>
<p>Las polic&#237;a aut&#243;nomas vasca y catalana 
tambi&#233;n disponen de videoc&#225;maras en sus

<p>Se&#241;alar que las c&#225;maras son instaladas en las

detenidos y los funcionarios que los 
custodian para la pr&#225;ctica de las diligencias 
oportunas (visitas de los forenses, abogado 
para tomas de declaraci&#243;n o ruedas de

<p>que la diligencia de la toma de declaraci&#243;n 
est&#225; validada jur&#237;dicamente por el letrado 
que asiste a la pr&#225;ctica de la diligencia. 
</p>
<p>En cuanto a la utilizaci&#243;n de vendas o 
capuchas durante los interrogatorios, no s&#243;lo 
est&#225; expresamente prohibida, sino que tal 
actuaci&#243;n constituye  un delito sancionado 
por el c&#243;digo penal. 
</p>
<p>El ordenamiento jur&#237;dico establece que la 
toma de declaraci&#243;n siempre se realizar&#225; en 
presencia de abogado, as&#237; como la absoluta 
interdicci&#243;n del uso de cualquier medida 
coactiva y con estricta aplicaci&#243;n de los 
criterios rectores de la ley org&#225;nica 2/1986, 
de 13 de marzo, de fuerzas y cuerpos de 
seguridad, que establece, como principio 
b&#225;sico de actuaci&#243;n de las fuerzas y cuerpos 
de seguridad el absoluto respeto a la 
Constituci&#243;n y al resto del ordenamiento 
jur&#237;dico. Todas estas normas de actuaci&#243;n, 
se ven respaldadas por la estricta tipificaci&#243;n 
de los delitos de tortura y malos tratos 
contenida principalmente en los art&#237;culos 
173, 174 y 607 bis del C&#243;digo Penal.

<p>En base a todas estas normas, la instrucci&#243;n 
12/2007, sobre los comportamientos 
exigidos a los miembros de las fuerzas y 
cuerpos de seguridad del Estado para 
garantizar los derechos de las personas 
detenidas o bajo custodia policial establece: 
</p>
<p>&#8213;se garantizar&#225; la espontaneidad de la toma 
de declaraci&#243;n, de manera que no se 
menoscabe la capacidad de decisi&#243;n o juicio 
del detenido, no formul&#225;ndole 
reconvenciones o apercibimientos. Se le 
permitir&#225; manifestar lo que estime </p>

en el acta. Si, a consecuencia de la duraci&#243;n 
del interrogatorio, el detenido diera muestras 
de fatiga, se deber&#225; suspender el mismo 
hasta que se recupere. 
</p>
<p> Nuestro ordenamiento jur&#237;dico proh&#237;be 
terminantemente el uso de cualquier exceso 
f&#237;sico o ps&#237;quico para obtener una 
declaraci&#243;n del detenido, de manera que el 
empleo de tales medios constituye 
infracci&#243;n penal o disciplinaria, y como tal 
ser&#225; perseguida.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>2009: Las FCSE dan cumplimiento a las 
resoluciones judiciales por las que se 
acuerda la grabaci&#243;n en video de los 
detenidos en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n. A 
la fecha se han instalado en un 50% de los 
centros de detenci&#243;n de las FCSE. En las 
salas de toma de declaraci&#243;n, se utilizan 
siempre que lo ordene el Juez que instruye el 
procedimiento. 
</p>
<p>Todas las personas que participan en la toma 
de declaraci&#243;n quedan debidamente 
identificadas en las diligencias policiales 
que se instruyen. El uso de capuchas u otros 
elementos susceptibles de ser utilizados para 
maltratar, coaccionar, desorientar o 
presionar al detenido est&#225;n absolutamente 
prohibidos por el ordenamiento jur&#237;dico. 
</p>
<p>Fuentes no gubernamentales: Aunque el 
Plan Nacional de Derechos Humanos 
incluye la propuesta de instalar c&#225;maras de 
video-vigilancia durante el periodo de 
incomunicaci&#243;n, no prev&#233; la grabaci&#243;n en 
las salas de interrogatorio. Asimismo, la

<p>La incomunicaci&#243;n permite proceder a 
interrogatorios de los que no se extiende 
diligencia sin la presencia de un abogado, 
realizados por funcionarios que no siempre 
llevan uniforme, con el fin de obtener 
informaci&#243;n que permita avanzar en las 
investigaciones o para preparar una 
declaraci&#243;n de la que quedar&#225; constancia. En 
la mayor&#237;a de los casos, se dice que la 
tortura y los malos tratos, infligidos por 
medios tanto f&#237;sicos como psicol&#243;gicos, 
tienden a producirse durante los 
interrogatorios, mientras que en algunas 
denuncias se mencionan malos tratos 
infligidos durante el traslado de los 
sospechosos de terrorismo a Madrid 
(A/HRC/10/3/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>2008: Actualmente existe un estudio con 
relaci&#243;n a la viabilidad de extender la video-
vigilancia a determinadas dependencias 
policiales.  
</p>
<p>Con respecto a los derechos del detenido en 
la toma de declaraci&#243;n, el Gobierno inform&#243;

<p>Las Fuerzas de Seguridad no disponen de 
capacidad t&#233;cnica para grabar de manera 
permanente a todas las personas que se 
hallen en situaci&#243;n de detenci&#243;n 
incomunicadas.  
</p>
<p>2008: Fuentes no gubernamentales: 
Confirmaron la vigencia de las alegaciones 
presentadas en el anterior informe y agregan 
que el Juez Garz&#243;n habr&#237;a pedido a la polic&#237;a 
que se grabe de manera permanente a todas 
las personas en detenci&#243;n incomunicada. La 
Polic&#237;a no cuenta con la capacidad t&#233;cnica 
para su implementaci&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>2007: El Gobierno reitera que las garant&#237;as 
de los detenidos son establecidas por la Ley 
de Enjuiciamiento Criminal, la cual estipula 
que durante los interrogatorios los detenidos 
ser&#225;n asistidos por un abogado. 
</p>
<p>Cuando se presume que el detenido particip&#243; 
en alguno de los delitos a que se refiere el 
art&#237;culo 384 bis se le nombrar&#225; un abogado

<p>La grabaci&#243;n de los interrogatorios no a&#241;ade

habido modificaci&#243;n en este punto y las 
propuestas que se han efectuadas han sido 
rechazadas por algunos sindicatos policiales. 
Diversas causas contra funcionarios p&#250;blicos

<p>grabado las agresiones denunciadas.  
</p>
<p>Nunca se utilizan vendas o capuchas durante 
los interrogatorios efectuados en sede 
policial y con presencia del abogado. 
Durante interrogatorios no &#8213;formales&#8214; en los 
que no est&#225; presente un abogado ni se realiza 
un acta, se les ha obligado a mantener la 
cabeza baja, en posiciones dolorosas, 
mientras son amenazados con ser golpeados 
si miran al agente que los interroga. 
</p>
<p>2006: Fuentes no gubernamentales: No se 
graban ni los ni se recoge acta de los 
interrogatorios. En el interrogatorio que se 
efect&#250;a en sede policial, el instructor y el 
secretario se identifican por sus n&#250;meros de 
agente, y el abogado le ense&#241;a su carn&#233; 
profesional al detenido.  
</p>
<p>2005: El Gobierno inform&#243; que la cautela de 
identificar a los intervinientes se aplica no 
s&#243;lo respecto al interrogatorio policial de un 
detenido, sino a cualquier diligencia 
practicada en dependencias policiales. La 
grabaci&#243;n del desarrollo del interrogatorio 
contravendr&#237;a disposiciones sobre el derecho 
a la intimidad. 
</p>
<p>2005: Fuentes no gubernamentales: No se 
habr&#237;a observado ninguna variaci&#243;n en 
referencia a esta recomendaci&#243;n en las 
diligencias efectuadas por la Polic&#237;a 
Nacional o por la Guardia Civil.

</p>
<p>resulta con frecuencia ineficaz. 
La negaci&#243;n de la pr&#225;ctica de la 
tortura o malos tratos, el temor 
de que las denuncias de tortura 
sean respondidas con querellas 
por difamaci&#243;n, y la 
imparcialidad e independencia 
discutibles de los mecanismos 
internos de exigencia de 
responsabilidades a los 
miembros de las fuerzas y 
cuerpos de seguridad son 
algunos de los factores que 
contribuyen a la ausencia de una 
pol&#237;tica y una pr&#225;ctica de 
investigaciones prontas e 
imparciales. 
</p>
<p>momento de ser detenidos o durante la 
privaci&#243;n de libertad. La mayor parte de las 
denuncias tuvieron lugar en Catalunya, 
Eskal Herria y Madrid. Los denunciantes 
son en su mayor&#237;a personas que participan 
en movilizaciones sociales (302), migrantes 
(103), personas privadas de libertad (69) y 
personas en r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n 
(45). Los principales presuntos 
perpetradores son los Mossos d&#8216;Esquadra y 
el Cuerpo Nacional de Polic&#237;a. 
</p>
<p>- Tras la instalaci&#243;n de circuitos cerrados de 
televisi&#243;n en comisar&#237;as catalanas durante el 
ultimo a&#241;o, el n&#250;mero de acusaciones por 
agresiones de los Mossos d&#8216;Esquadra ha 
disminuido en un 40%. 
</p>
<p>- El informe anual de la Fiscal&#237;a General del 
Estado revel&#243; que durante el a&#241;o se hab&#237;an 
presentado m&#225;s de 230 denuncias de tortura 
y otros malos tratos a manos de funcionarios 
encargados de hacer cumplir la ley.  
</p>
<p>- No se han tomado medidas para crear una 
comisi&#243;n independiente de quejas contra la 
polic&#237;a. 
</p>
<p>- Hubo un aumento de la tendencia a no 
denunciar las agresiones sufridas por temor 
a verse envueltos en contradenuncias y por 
desconfianza hacia los &#243;rganos encargados 
de investigar las agresiones. 
</p>
<p>- La Fiscal&#237;a General del Estado dedic&#243; por 
primera vez en 2008 un cap&#237;tulo de su 
Memoria anual a los delitos de torturas y 
contra la integridad moral cometidos por 
funcionarios. En 2007 se investigaron o 
juzgaron 75 casos de presuntas torturas u

<p>concluyeron con una declaraci&#243;n de 
culpabilidad y siete con una absoluci&#243;n. 21 
casos fueron sobrese&#237;dos por el fiscal o el 
juez de instrucci&#243;n antes de llegar a la fase 
de juicio. 
</p>
<p>- Muchas de las denuncias interpuestas son 
inmediatamente archivadas, en la mayor&#237;a 
de los casos sin que se hubiera practicado 
ning&#250;n tipo de prueba. Son pocos los casos 
en que se desarrollan diligencias probatorias 
tales como  la toma de declaraci&#243;n del 
denunciante o la comparecencia de M&#233;dicos 
Forenses. Asimismo, existe una negativa por 
parte de las autoridades penitenciarias para 
facilitar pruebas y una insuficiencia de 
impulso procesal de oficio. 
</p>
<p>- El Mecanismo Nacional de Prevenci&#243;n ha 
recibido, desde el inicio de su 
funcionamiento, varias quejas por las 
sospechas de malos tratos hacia personas 
detenidas por la presunta comisi&#243;n de delitos 
de terrorismo. Dichas quejas han sido 
adecuadamente estudiadas, requiriendo al 
juez de la Audiencia Nacional responsable 
del caso, la documentaci&#243;n pertinente y 
entrevist&#225;ndose, en alg&#250;n caso que se ha 
estimado necesario, con las personas 
privadas de libertad. En ning&#250;n caso se 
desprendi&#243; la existencia de malos tratos, si 
bien si se formularon las correspondientes 
recomendaciones, con el fin del

malos tratos y las torturas constituyen en 
Espa&#241;a un delito perseguible de oficio, 
siempre que hay indicios de su comisi&#243;n. El 
ordenamiento contempla varias v&#237;as para 
investigaci&#243;n de estos supuestos y la

particular, la Constituci&#243;n espa&#241;ola

<p>polic&#237;a judicial, los funcionarios policiales 
responden &#250;nicamente de las &#243;rdenes e 
instrucciones del juez, sin tener que dar 
cuenta de ellas a sus superiores. Para mayor 
garant&#237;a, el procedimiento habitual incluye 
la prevenci&#243;n de que el juez encargue la 
investigaci&#243;n a los expertos de polic&#237;a 
judicial de un cuerpo policial distinto del 
investigado. 
</p>
<p>En el caso de que la investigaci&#243;n no derive 
de un procedimiento judicial sino que se est&#233; 
realizando de modo interno en el &#225;mbito 
administrativo, los cuerpos policiales 
disponen de sus propias unidades 
especializadas en la investigaci&#243;n de asuntos 
internos y derivaci&#243;n de responsabilidades 
disciplinarias. 
</p>
<p>Para mayor garant&#237;a, junto con estas 
unidades policiales especializadas, existe un 
&#243;rgano administrativo, la inspecci&#243;n de 
personal y servicios de seguridad, con 
dependencia directa de la Secretar&#237;a de 
Estado de Seguridad y por lo tanto 
plenamente independiente de los cuerpos 
policiales que tiene amplias competencias y 
los medios necesarios para la investigaci&#243;n 
de los casos de presunta actuaci&#243;n irregular 
de los que tenga conocimiento (incluso a 
trav&#233;s de noticias aparecidas en los medios

planteados por particulares o por las ONGs). 
</p>
<p>En todo caso, la suspensi&#243;n de funciones de 
los funcionarios policiales denunciados por 
torturas o malos tratos ya est&#225; contemplada

<p>cautelar y teniendo en cuenta, en todo caso, 
el derecho a la presunci&#243;n de inocencia 
reconocido en la Constituci&#243;n espa&#241;ola. 
</p>
<p>2009: La regulaci&#243;n actual contempla la 
apertura de un expediente disciplinario 
contra los presuntos responsables de tortura 
o malos tratos, as&#237; como la medida cautelar 
de suspensi&#243;n de funciones en espera del 
resultado de la acci&#243;n penal. Los 
funcionarios policiales responden solamente 
a las &#243;rdenes e instrucciones del Juez, sin 
tener que dar cuenta a sus superiores. 
</p>
<p>En 2008, el Tribunal Constitucional ampli&#243; 
y precis&#243; su doctrina respecto a la 
investigaci&#243;n de supuestos malos tratos 
mediante seis sentencias. 
</p>
<p>En cuanto a la aplicaci&#243;n de los tipos 
penales de torturas, el Tribunal Supremo ha 
visto, entre 2002 y 2009, 34 casos relativos a 
la aplicaci&#243;n de estos. El numero de 
condenas a agentes de polic&#237;a y funcionarios 
de prisiones, en esos mismos a&#241;os y en los 
diferentes tribunales supera los 250.  
</p>
<p>La ca&#237;da del n&#250;mero de denuncias en 2006 
es compatible con una retirada temporal de 
la instrucci&#243;n por parte del grupo terrorista 
ETA durante ese periodo.  
</p>
<p>Fuentes no gubernamentales: Entre 2000 y 
2008, 634 de las 957 personas detenidas en 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n alegaron malos 
tratos. De estas, el 70 por ciento 
interpusieron una denuncia judicial. 
</p>
<p>En 2008, 95 personas fueron detenidas en 
r&#233;gimen de incomunicaci&#243;n. El 68 por 
ciento alegaron malos tratos. En 2009, 37 </p>

<p>personas han sido puestas en r&#233;gimen de 
incomunicaci&#243;n. El 39 por ciento han 
alegado malos tratos. Existe tambi&#233;n de una 
relaci&#243;n directamente proporcional entre la 
frecuencia de alegaciones de tortura y la 
duraci&#243;n de la incomunicaci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>La mayor&#237;a de las denuncias de malos tratos 
f&#237;sicos y psicol&#243;gicos presentadas ante el 
juez de instrucci&#243;n tras el per&#237;odo de 
detenci&#243;n policial en la investigaci&#243;n de los 
ataques terroristas perpetrados el 11 de 
marzo de 2004 e incluso reiteradas ante el 
tribunal durante el juicio, fueron ignoradas. 
</p>
<p>Ninguna denuncia ha finalizado en una 
condena judicial. Las denuncias son 
investigadas por la fiscal&#237;a, jueces, 
inspecci&#243;n interna y el Defensor del Pueblo. 
</p>
<p>Ha habido acusaciones de injurias a los 
cuerpos y fuerzas de seguridad del estado, 
en contra de abogados y personas que 
denuncian torturas, a&#250;n cuando sus propias 
denuncias son archivadas sin haberse 
efectuado las debidas diligencias para 
investigar los hechos. 
</p>
<p>Existen sentencias recientes del Tribunal 
Constitucional en las que se recoge la 
doctrina de que la gravedad del delito de 
torturas y la especial dificultad probatoria en 
esos casos obligan a actuar con especial 
diligencia en las investigaciones judiciales 
(A/HRC/10/3/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>2008: El Gobierno inform&#243; sobre la 
Instrucci&#243;n 12/2007. Los retrasos durante la

tratos responden a problemas estructurales </p>

<p>2008: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Esta 
recomendaci&#243;n contin&#250;a sin cumplirse. 
Algunos de los problemas m&#225;s habituales en 
las investigaciones judiciales son la falta de 
investigaci&#243;n por parte del Juzgado, retrasos 
en la investigaci&#243;n y la no separaci&#243;n de los 
funcionarios implicados.  
</p>
<p>A partir de 2004 no existen denuncias 
judiciales por malos tratos o tortura entre los 
detenidos por la Ertzaintza, aunque si existe 
una alta frecuencia de alegaciones en los 
detenidos por la Guardia Nacional. En 2008, 
el 68% de los detenidos incomunicados en el 
Pa&#237;s Vasco indicaron haber sido v&#237;ctimas de 
malos tratos o tortura. Ninguna denuncia 
judicial ha finalizado en condena. 
</p>
<p>2007: El Gobierno reitera que en la 
actualidad los malos tratos y torturas son un 
delito perseguible de oficio cuando hay 
indicios de su comisi&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>2007: Fuentes no gubernamentales: No se 
aprecia ning&#250;n avance en este sentido. Es 
habitual que transcurran varios meses o m&#225;s 
de un a&#241;o entre el momento en que se 
formula una denuncia por torturas y el 
momento en que el juzgado comienza la 
investigaci&#243;n, toma declaraci&#243;n al 
denunciante y ordena su reconocimiento por 
un m&#233;dico forense.  
</p>
<p>La aplicaci&#243;n de medidas cautelares contra 
los funcionarios imputados por tortura y/o 
malos tratos no es habitual. Las 
organizaciones no gubernamentales han 
criticada la falta de seriedad y 
profesionalismo de algunos jueces frente a </p>

<p>denuncias de tortura y/o malos tratos. 
</p>
<p>2006: Fuentes no gubernamentales: No se ha 
observado ninguna variaci&#243;n. El 
departamento encargado de investigar las 
denuncias de tortura no es independiente.  
</p>
<p>2005: El Gobierno recalca que el marco 
legal permite la pronta investigaci&#243;n de toda 
denuncia de torturas. El empleo de la tortura 
y de los malos tratos por parte de los 
miembros de las Fuerzas y Cuerpos de 
Seguridad puede tener consecuencias 
penales y disciplinarias. El Tribunal 
Supremo ha dictado entre 1997 y 2003 16 
sentencias condenatorias de torturas. Una 
confesi&#243;n obtenida bajo tortura no tiene 
ninguna validez y no podr&#225; ser utilizada en 
juicio. 
</p>
<p>2005: Fuentes no gubernamentales: No se 
habr&#237;a observado ninguna variaci&#243;n en 
referencia a esta recomendaci&#243;n. Se alega 
que la diligencia se demostrar&#237;a en la 
voluntad de los Juzgados de archivar la 
denuncia. No hay informaci&#243;n sobre casos 
donde funcionarios permanezcan 
suspendidos hasta conocerse el resultado de 
la investigaci&#243;n.

<p>Asegurar a las v&#237;ctimas de la 
tortura o de los malos tratos 
el remedio y la reparaci&#243;n 
adecuados, incluida la 
rehabilitaci&#243;n, la 
indemnizaci&#243;n, la 
satisfacci&#243;n y las garant&#237;as de 
no repetici&#243;n. 
</p>
<p>No existe una legislaci&#243;n eficaz 
que garantice a las v&#237;ctimas de 
tortura una indemnizaci&#243;n justa 
y suficiente. Las normas 
aplicadas por los tribunales para 
calcular el monto de la 
indemnizaci&#243;n son las 
establecidas por la legislaci&#243;n de 
seguros, que son aplicables a las 
lesiones sufridas en accidentes, 
</p>
<p><b><i>2010: Fuentes no gubernamentales</i></b> : no se 
ha producido ning&#250;n avance este a&#241;o en 
cuanto a la reparaci&#243;n de las v&#237;ctimas de 
tortura. 
</p>
<p>- En el a&#241;o 2010 hay conocimiento de dos 
casos en los que denunciantes de tortura 
fueron despu&#233;s denunciados por las 
autoridades. La causa de un detenido fue 
archivada sin ni siquiera tomarle declaraci&#243;n

Juzgado de Instrucci&#243;n incoaba diligencias 
previas por un delito de falsa denuncia tras 
atender a un informe de la fiscal&#237;a. 
</p>
<p>2009: El Gobierno indic&#243; que Espa&#241;a es uno 
de los pocos pa&#237;ses europeos que prev&#233; 
desde hace tiempo que la acci&#243;n de 
reparaci&#243;n se sustancie en el 
correspondiente procedimiento penal a 
efectos de agilizar su resoluci&#243;n.  
</p>
<p>El perjudicado por el delito o falta puede 
optar por ejercitar su acci&#243;n civil en el 
proceso penal o reservarse dicha acci&#243;n para 
su ejercicio ante la jurisdicci&#243;n civil. En el 
caso de que en el proceso penal se dicte 
sentencia absolutoria, la victima puede 
reclamar indemnizaci&#243;n de da&#241;os y 
perjuicios por &#8213;funcionamiento normal o 
anormal de los servicios p&#250;blicos&#8214;. 
</p>
<p>2008: El Ministerio del Interior afirma que 
su cumplimiento excede su &#225;mbito de 
competencia.  
</p>
<p>Todos los ciudadanos tienen el mismo 
derecho a la presunci&#243;n de inocencia y a la

</p>
<p>El acoso y las amenazas por parte de 
funcionarios p&#250;blicos a quienes los han

</p>
<p>2008: Fuentes no gubernamentales: No se ha 
producido ning&#250;n avance. La deficiente 
investigaci&#243;n judicial y excesiva duraci&#243;n de

<p>funcionarios cuando son condenados, as&#237; 
como el hecho de que en muchos los casos 
no son suspendidos, constituyen una nueva 
agresi&#243;n a las v&#237;ctimas. 
</p>
<p>2007: Fuentes no gubernamentales: no se ha 
producido ning&#250;n avance. Las v&#237;ctimas de 
tortura o malos tratos son, casi en su 
totalidad, objeto de una contra-denuncia por 
parte de los funcionarios imputados. Se han 
registrado casos de acoso y amenazas por 
parte de los agentes policiales denunciados. 
</p>
<p>2006: Fuentes no gubernamentales: No hay 
constancia de que se haya producido ni un 
solo avance. 
</p>
<p>2005: El Gobierno inform&#243; que este r&#233;gimen 
exhaustivo de investigaci&#243;n y castigo de la 
tortura se ve completado por las 
disposiciones del ordenamiento espa&#241;ol que 
aseguran un adecuado resarcimiento a las 
victimas de tortura. La legislaci&#243;n ofrece la 
posibilidad de ejercer conjuntamente, en el 
mismo proceso, la acci&#243;n penal y la acci&#243;n 
civil derivadas del delito.  
</p>
<p>2005: Fuentes no gubernamentales: Esta 
recomendaci&#243;n no se habr&#237;a implementado 
debido a la falta real de un sistema jur&#237;dico y

<p>su defensa. Las autoridades 
explicaron que esta pol&#237;tica se 
aplic&#243; para separar a los 
terroristas de ETA de los presos 
que se reinsertar&#225;n en la 
sociedad. 
</p>
<p>69 presos encarcelados a m&#225;s de 1.000 
kil&#243;metros. El alejamiento tambi&#233;n conlleva 
su dispersi&#243;n o separaci&#243;n en diferentes 
m&#243;dulos de cada una de la totalidad de 53 
prisiones. En muchas de ellas incluso no se 
ven entre ellos, y como consecuencia de 
ello, son una treintena de presos los que se 
encuentran totalmente aislados; es decir, sin 
poder ver a otro compa&#241;ero. 
</p>
<p>- El &#193;rea de Seguridad y Justicia del 
Defensor del Pueblo ha prestado atenci&#243;n a 
este aspecto, a ra&#237;z de la recepci&#243;n de quejas 
de familiares de presos o de la iniciaci&#243;n de 
quejas de oficio. Las penas de privaci&#243;n de 
libertad deber&#237;an ser ejecutadas teniendo en 
cuenta la necesidad de guardar un equilibrio 
que respete los derechos elementales de los 
presos y que pueda conducir a la reinserci&#243;n 
de esas personas en la comunidad. 
</p>
<p><b>Gobierno:</b> El Gobierno inform&#243; que la 
pol&#237;tica de separaci&#243;n  y destino a los 
distintos centros penitenciarios de los presos 
y penados por delitos de terrorismo, se 
ajusta a la legalidad, es controlada 
judicialmente y no es contraria a los 
derechos humanos. Adem&#225;s, es una medida  
hoy por hoy necesaria, desde un punto de 
vista de pol&#237;tica criminal frente al 
terrorismo. Es decir, no se adopta como 
castigo, sino como medida eficaz para la 
seguridad colectiva, la seguridad y buen 
orden de los establecimientos penitenciarios, 
as&#237; como para facilitar a los individuos la 
posibilidad de sustraerse a la presi&#243;n del 
grupo.

<p>a. razones de seguridad. Hay que 
recordar las fugas (1985 Martutene) y los 
numerosos intentos de fuga habidos por 
parte de miembros de ETA (1987 Alcal&#225; 
Meco; 1990 Herrera de la Mancha; 1992 en 
Puerto I y Oca&#241;a; 1993 Granada; 2001 
Nanclares y la reciente en Huelva del 2008) 
</p>
<p>b. reinserci&#243;n. La cohesi&#243;n del 
colectivo de presos de ETA en un mismo 
centro impide la adecuada reinserci&#243;n y 
tratamiento de los internos, mediante 
amenazas y la exclusi&#243;n social de las 
familias de aqu&#233;llos que quieren abandonar 
la disciplina de la banda terrorista. 
</p>
<p>c. evoluci&#243;n personal del preso: los 
requisitos de prueba de desvinculaci&#243;n de la 
banda suponen un reconocimiento firme de 
posicionamientos no violentos y de 
reparaci&#243;n del da&#241;o causado, principios 
inspiradores del nuestro ordenamiento 
jur&#237;dico. 
</p>
<p>En relaci&#243;n con la legalidad y oportunidad 
de esta medida: 
</p>
<p>&#61485; El defensor del pueblo manifest&#243; en 
su informe de 19 de octubre de 2009, 
dirigido al Comit&#233; contra la Tortura (CAT): 
&#8213;la permanencia de un recluso en una 
prisi&#243;n pr&#243;xima a su domicilio no es un 
derecho subjetivo. La ley general 
penitenciaria configura esta posibilidad 
como una medida relacionada con el 
tratamiento individualizado, de tal manera 
que seg&#250;n los casos puede ser 
contraproducente para la reinserci&#243;n social 
del preso a que se refiere el art&#237;culo 25.2 de 
la Constituci&#243;n espa&#241;ola. Tanto en los casos </p>

<p>de terrorismo como en cualesquiera otros 
delitos puede ser inadecuado que el preso se 
ubique en un lugar pr&#243;ximo  a su entorno 
social. La llamada dispersi&#243;n de presos ha 
sido y es una actuaci&#243;n legal y respetuosa 
con los derechos de todos.&#8214; 
</p>
<p>&#61485; El apartado XI de las l&#237;neas 
directrices sobre los derechos humanos y la 
lucha antiterrorista adoptadas por el Comit&#233; 
de Ministros del Consejo de Europa el 11 de 
julio de 2002 reconoce que &#8213;los imperativos 
de la lucha contra el terrorismo pueden 
exigir que el trato de una persona privada de 
libertad por actividades terroristas sea objeto 
de restricciones m&#225;s importantes que las 
aplicadas a otros detenidos en lo que se 
refiere en particular a: &#8213;la dispersi&#243;n de 
estas personas dentro del mismo centro 
penitenciario o en diferentes centros 
penitenciarios, con la condici&#243;n de que haya 
una relaci&#243;n de proporcionalidad entre el fin

</p>
<p>La Comisi&#243;n Europea de Derechos 
Humanos, en su decisi&#243;n 1 de octubre de 
1990, , estim&#243; que  la negativa de trasladar a 
un recluso a un centro pr&#243;ximo a residencia 
puede estar justificada en razones de diversa 
&#237;ndole, entre las que se se&#241;alan razones de 
seguridad nacional, seguridad p&#250;blica, 
bienestar econ&#243;mico del pa&#237;s, la defensa del

<p>2009: Las circunstancias tenidas en cuenta 
para la asignaci&#243;n del centro penitenciario a 
los reclusos son, principalmente: a) 
intervenci&#243;n penitenciaria o razones de 
seguridad; b) criterios para la reinserci&#243;n; y 
c) evoluci&#243;n personal del preso. 
</p>
<p>Fuentes no gubernamentales: Los derechos 
de las v&#237;ctimas y la reeducaci&#243;n y 
reinserci&#243;n social son la finalidad de la pena. 
Por tanto, puede ser positiva la dispersi&#243;n de 
presos. 
</p>
<p>Hay aproximadamente 570 presos de ETA 
dispersados en m&#225;s de 50 prisiones a una 
distancia media de 600 km. del Pa&#237;s Vasco, 
un hecho que en s&#237; constituye un riesgo y 
una carga econ&#243;mica para los familiares que 
los visitan, as&#237; como un obst&#225;culo pr&#225;ctico 
para la preparaci&#243;n de la defensa en los 
casos en que los acusados que se encuentran 
en prisi&#243;n provisional est&#225;n internados a 
gran distancia de sus abogados 
(A/HRC/10/3/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>2008: El Gobierno confirma la informaci&#243;n 
presentada anteriormente. 
</p>
<p>De los 66 centros penitenciarios 
dependientes de la Administraci&#243;n General 
del Estado en todo el territorio nacional, 
solamente 23 disponen de Departamentos de 
r&#233;gimen cerrado. 
</p>
<p>Dado el reducido n&#250;mero de poblaci&#243;n 
penitenciaria que se encuentra clasificada en

22 de las 474 personas presas, condenadas o 
acusadas de pertenencia o colaboraci&#243;n con 
ETA se encuentran presas en prisiones 
vascas. 
</p>
<p>2007: El Gobierno afirma que el r&#233;gimen 
penitenciario que se aplica a los presos del 
Pa&#237;s Vasco es el mismo que se aplica a todos 
los presos.  
</p>
<p>Las instituciones penitenciarias espa&#241;olas 
procuran la reinserci&#243;n social de los 
penados, pero atienden tambi&#233;n a la 
retenci&#243;n y la custodia, la ordenada 
convivencia y la seguridad. 
</p>
<p>La dispersi&#243;n es una condici&#243;n necesaria 
para la funci&#243;n rehabilitadora de la pena en 
casos de reclusos pertenecientes a bandas de 
criminalidad organizada o a grupos 
terroristas. 
</p>
<p>2007: Fuente no gubernamentales: No se 
observan avances. Solamente 13 presos se 
encuentran en c&#225;rceles vascas. No hubo 
ninguna repatriaci&#243;n al Pa&#237;s Vasco entre 
finales de 2005 y 2006.

<p><b>Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Manfred Nowak) in the report of his visit to Sri Lanka 
</b></p>
<p><b>from 1 to 8 October 2007 (A/HRC/7/3/Add.6) 
</b></p>
<p>127. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of Sri Lanka, requesting 
information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his predecessor&#8216;s 
recommendations. He expresses his gratitude to the Government for providing detailed information on steps taken during the 
reporting period.  
</p>
<p>128. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the Government&#8216;s efforts to expedite criminal proceedings relating to torture cases by 
establishing various ad hoc commissions of inquiry, including the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate serious cases of 
human rights violations that occurred since 1 August 2005, as well as the establishment of Lessons Learnt Reconciliation 
Commission (LLRC) and the Inter-Agency Advisory Committee (IAAC).56   
</p>
<p>129. The Special Rapporteur echoes the concern raised by the Committee against Torture regarding the prevailing climate of 
impunity for acts of torture and ill-treatment and the failure to investigate promptly and impartially wherever there is reasonable 
ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed. 57 
</p>
<p>130. He calls upon the Government to take steps to address the outstanding concerns raised by the Committee over the LLRC&#8216;s 
limited mandate and its alleged lack of independence, and promptly launch impartial and effective investigations into all allegations 
of torture, rape, enforced disappearances and other forms of ill-treatment, occurred during the last stages of the conflict and in the 
post-conflict phase.58 He looks forward to receiving information on the investigations undertaken into allegations of torture and ill-
treatment and steps taken to hold accountable those responsible.  
</p>
<p>131. The Special Rapporteur takes note of the steps taken to monitor the implementation of the Presidential directions of 7 July 
2006 (reissued in 2007) and the Rules with regard to Persons in Custody of the Police (Code of Departmental Order No. A 20). He 
expresses concern that, as also noted by the Committee against Torture, the suspects held in custody are not afforded statutory rights 
to inform a family member and are not given access to legal counsel at the moment of arrest.  
</p>
<p>132. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to abolish unacknowledged custody and detention facilities allegedly run 
by the Sri Lankan military intelligence and paramilitary groups,59 make police station chiefs, investigating and operative officers 
criminally accountable for any unacknowledged detention, and make it a serious crime.  
</p>
<p>133. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the 18th Constitutional Amendment of 8 September 2010, which eliminates 
the Constitutional Council and empowers the President to make direct appointments of members to key Commissions, including the 
</p>
<p>  
 56  See para. 21 of CAT/C/LKA/CO/3-4.

<p>National Police Commissioner and the Chairman and members of the Human Rights Commission (NHRC). He calls upon the 
Government to ensure that all allegations of torture and ill-treatment are promptly and thoroughly investigated by an independent 
authority with no connection to the authority investigating or prosecuting the case against the alleged victim, and that the 
constitution and activities of the NHRC comply with the Paris Principles. The Special Rapporteur echoes the recommendation of 
the Committee against Torture about establishing an independent national system to effectively monitor and inspect all places of 
detention, including, <i>inter alia, </i>facilities holding LTTE suspects. 60 
</p>
<p>134. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Government&#8216;s decision to lift the long-standing state of emergency on 31 August 
2011, and expresses concern about the new regulations under the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979 (PTA), which unduly 
restrict legal safeguards for persons suspected or charged with a terrorist or related crime. This has also been pointed out by the 
Committee against Torture. 61 
</p>
<p>135. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern about the fact that the burden of proof lies on the prosecution to prove beyond a 
reasonable doubt that a confession or other evidence has not been obtained under any kind of duress, except for cases of confessions 
falling under the PTA. He calls on the Government to ensure that its anti-terrorism measures are compatible with the provisions of 
article 2, paragraph 2 of the Convention. The Special Rapporteur recalls that international customary law and treaty law require 
States to ensure that any statement that is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in 
any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made. 62 
</p>
<p>136. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the proposed plan of the Minister for Prison Reforms and Rehabilitation to separate 
convicts from pre-trial detainees and minor offenders from criminals, and looks forward to receiving information on the steps 
undertaken with respect to implementing a comprehensive structural reform of the prison system, aimed at reducing the number of 
detainees, increasing prison capacities and reducing the overcrowding, separating juveniles and adult detainees as well as remand 
and convicted prisoners. 
</p>
<p>137. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the appeal to the Government to abolish capital punishment or, at a 
minimum, commute death sentences into prison sentences. In his view, the manner of imposition and execution of the death penalty 
in Sri Lanka inevitably involves the commission of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and, in some cases, torture. He regrets 
that no action was taken to ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT) and calls upon the Government 
to take measures to ratify it and establish a National Preventive Mechanism.

between the Government and the 
TMVP-Karuna group, which were 
confirmed by the TMVP 
representative the Special 
Rapporteur met in Trincomalee. 
The TMVP-Karuna group has 
been accused of brutal human 
rights abuses. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The TMVP 
continues to carry out unlawful killings, 
hostage-taking for ransoms, recruitment of 
child soldiers and enforced disappearances. 
On 7 October 2008, Karuna was sworn into 
Parliament, with the full support of President 
and Government. As military commander of 
the TMVP, and previously as a military 
commander in the LTTE, Karuna was 
suspected of serious human rights abuses and 
war crimes, including the abduction of 
hundreds of teenagers to serve as child 
soldiers, holding civilians as hostage, torture 
and killings. There has been no official 
investigation into these allegations. 
 
Non-governmental sources: Karuna continues 
to be a Member of Parliament from the ruling 
Party, the UPFA. 
- In his report following his December 2009 
visit to Sri Lanka, the Special Envoy of the 
Special Representative of the Secretary-
General on Children &amp; Armed Conflict, 
Patrick Cammaert, stated that cases of child 
recruitment and threats of re-recruitment have 
been attributed to a &#8215;commander&#8216; Iniya 
Bharathi who is part of the TMVP breakaway 
faction under Karuna&#8216;s leadership in the 
Ampara district of the Eastern Province.  To 
date, these reports have not been investigated.     
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>There have been no 
reported killings, hostage-taking or 
recruitment of child soldiers as 
stated by the NGOs. Karuna is no 
more with the Tamil Makkal 
Viduthalai Pulikal (TMVP). He 
broke away and he is now a 
Member of Parliament. Both 
TMVP and the Karuna group 
denounced terrorism and have 
joined the democratic mainstream. 
According to the Crimes Division 
of the Sri Lanka Police, there are 
no pending investigations arising 
out of any complaints of either 
Karuna or the TMVP after 2009. If 
there are any complaints with 
credible information the Police 
will conduct impartial 
investigations.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  
Reportedly, no progress has been 
achieved. It is reported that 
impunity persists and  new human 
rights abuses continue to be 
reported by both forces reportedly 
loyal to &#8213;Karuna&#8214; (SLFP Minister 
</p>
<p>Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan) 
and those reportedly loyal to his 
former deputy &#8213;Pillayan&#8214; (TMVP 
</p>
<p>leader and Chief Minister of the 
Eastern Province,  Sivanesathurai 
Chandrakanthan).  Internecine 
violence between the two groups 
has reportedly harmed civilians.

<p>witnesses before Sri Lanka&#8216;s 
&#8213;Lessons Learnt and 
Reconciliation Commission&#8214; 
(LLRC) blamed the groups for 
numerous human rights violations, 
including enforced 
disappearances.63 
</p>
<p>(b) Ensure that detainees 
are given access to legal 
counsel within 24 hours of 
arrest, including persons 
arrested under the 
Emergency Regulations. 
</p>
<p>The Code of Criminal Procedure 
lacks fundamental safeguards, 
such as the right to inform a 
family member of the arrest or the 
access to a lawyer and/or a doctor 
of his or her choice for a person 
arrested and held in custody. The 
Code does not specify the 
interrogation conditions and is 
silent about the possibility of the 
presence of a lawyer and an 
interpreter during the 
interrogation. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   Sri Lanka&#8216;s 
criminal procedure has not been reformed in 
this regard. In practice, linkages between the 
police and criminal lawyers sometimes 
prevent a suspect from being adequately 
represented. In other cases, lawyers who have 
visited police stations along with their clients 
had themselves been assaulted afterwards. 
Non-governmental source also quotes a senior 
police officer stating that one of the principal 
causes for torture was the absence of legal 
representation when a suspect was produced 
before a Magistrate at the very first instance. 
This privilege is afforded, if at all, only to the 
elite. Where the emergency laws were 
concerned, the situation was even worse. 
Since lawyers did not visit army camps or 
STF camps, persons detained under 
emergency regulations did not receive legal 
assistance. 
Detainees are denied confidential information 
with their legal counsel and interviews take 
place in the presence of law enforcement 
personnel, which undermines reporting of ill-
treatment. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The implementation 
of the Presidential directions of 7 
July 2006 (reissued in 2007) is 
monitored by the National Human 
Rights Commission (HRCSL) by 
way of visiting Police Stations and 
examining the records and also the 
conditions of detainees. These 
directives were widely 
disseminated to reach the entire 
Police Force and the three Armed 
Forces.  
When a suspect is arrested under 
the laws of Sri Lanka, he or she 
has to be informed about the 
reason for arrest; the next of kin 
have to be informed of the arrest; 
facilities would be made available 
for the person to contact a lawyer; 
there are Police departmental 
orders with regard to the safe 
custody of the persons including 
many other relevant instructions to 
Officers.

<p> 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Most lawyers are 
now unwilling to take torture cases. Even in 
cases where the accused (victim of torture) is 
able to obtain legal counsel, he is not ensured 
of a private consultation.  
- Additionally there are lapses in informing 
the family within 24 hours when a person has 
been arrested. 
</p>
<p> 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  
Reportedly, there has been no 
change in law or actual procedures 
which is an important protection 
gap. There is still no legal 
requirement that detainees have 
access to legal counsel within 24 
hours of arrest. 
There is no law or regulation on 
the right to have a lawyer during 
interrogation. 
Although Sri Lanka lifted the State 
of Emergency at the end of 
August, it retained the Prevention 
of Terrorism Act (PTA) and 
introduced new regulations under 
the PTA on<i> 29 August  (24  hours 
before the state of emergency 
</i></p>
<p><i>lapsed) </i>that provide, among other 
things, for the continued detention 
of persons previously detained 
under the Emergency 
Regulations64. 
</p>
<p>(c) All detainees should be 
granted the ability to 
challenge the lawfulness of 
the detention before an 
independent court, e.g. 
through habeas corpus 
proceedings. 
</p>
<p>Detainees regularly reported that 
habeas corpus hearings before a 
magistrate either involved no real 
opportunity to complain about 
police torture, given that they were 
often escorted to courts by the 
very same perpetrators, and that 
the magistrate did not inquire into 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Extreme delays 
in the legal procedures in the Court of Appeal 
for habeas corpus applications have rendered 
this remedy practically ineffective. In the 
majority of cases, the preliminary inquiry 
before the Magistrates&#8216; Court takes many 
years and applications filed in the 1980s are 
still pending in the Court of Appeal. No time

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  A practice that 
has now become routine in Sri Lanka is to 
pressure victims of torture to &#8215;settle&#8216; their 
cases.  The alleged accused (and victim of 
torture) who is facing criminal charges 
initiates a Fundamental Rights (FR) case with 
regard to the torture s/he underwent due to the 
ineffectiveness of habeas corpus.  When 
officials learn of the FR case, the police (or 
other officials) then pressure the accused 
(victim) to &#8213;settle&#8214; wherein the criminal 
charges are dropped in exchange for a 
withdrawal of the FR case.  Pressure to 
&#8215;settle&#8216; cases is so prevalent that it is reported 
that even Supreme Court judges have begun 
encouraging victims to &#8215;settle&#8216;. 
</p>
<p>detention in the Supreme Court by 
way of a fundamental rights 
application. <i> 
<b>Non-governmental sources:</b></i> There 
has been no change in law or 
actual procedures. It is alleged that 
the problem persists for criminal 
detainees and reliance on 
extraordinary measures to hold 
detainees without judicial review 
(as has been the case in detention 
for &#8213;rehabilitation&#8214; of former 
LTTE members) further 
compounds this problem.   
</p>
<p>(d) Ensure that magistrates 
routinely ask persons 
brought from police 
custody how they have 
been treated and, even in 
the absence of a formal 
complaint from the 
defendant, order an 
independent medical 
examination in accordance 
with the Istanbul Protocol. 
</p>
<p>Detainees face various obstacles in 
filing complaints and having 
access to independent medical 
examinations, which are 
frequently alleged to take place in 
the presence of the perpetrators, or 
are performed by junior doctors 
with little experience. 
The fact that a system of Judicial 
Medical Officers (JMO) is in 
place in the country is a positive 
sign. Obstacles for victims of 
torture to access the JMOs result 
in loss of important medical 
evidence, impeding criminal 
proceedings against perpetrators. 
There is also no obligation for law 
enforcement officials or judges to 
investigate cases of torture ex 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : Detainees may 
complain of ill-treatment and request a 
medical examination by a JMO. However, 
detainees rarely complain due to fear of 
retribution by the custodial officers, to whose 
charge they are returned after production in 
court. Furthermore, detainees have little 
access to independent medical examinations; 
in many instances victims of torture are 
accompanied to the examination by the 
alleged perpetrators. In addition, doctors and 
JMOs often fail to record evidence of torture 
or provide false reports, and some doctors 
provide treatment to victims without 
disclosing the evidence of torture in official 
records. JMOs have been found to be 
complicit in covering up acts of torture.

- The medical-legal forms are not questioned

Reportedly, suspects have been 
threatened with further violence, 
and their lawyers and families (and 
other witnesses) with arrest or 
physical harm by police officers 
attempting to suppress

about torture.

<p>Jurisdiction for offences under the 
Anti-Torture Act No. 22 lies with 
the High Court. Complaints have 
to be addressed to the Attorney 
General&#8216;s (AG) Department. Upon 
instruction of the AG, the Special

the supervision of the Inspector 
General of the Police (IGP), 
conducts the investigations. The

forwards the complaint to the legal division of 
the police. Upon receipt, the complaint is 
referred to the IGP, who then forwards it to 
the SIU with instructions to begin

</i></p>
<p>AG&#8216;s Department decides to indict 
alleged offenders based on files 
submitted by the SIU and the PTP. 
The indictments by the Attorney 
General have lead so far to only 
three convictions and eight 
acquittals.  Senior police officers 
with regional command 
responsibilities also conduct 
inquiries into torture allegations. 
The National Police Commission 
(NPC) is in charge of disciplinary 
control over all officers except the 
Inspector General. However, this 
procedure was only established in 
January 2007. The legitimacy and 
credibility of the NPC has been 
questioned because of the 
appointments of the 
Commissioners by the President. 
The CID was given the mandate to 
handle all criminal investigations 
into complaints of alleged torture, 
other than complaints relating to 
allegations against CID officers. 
However, complaints of torture 
recorded at police stations are first 
referred to the Assistant 
Superintendent of Police (ASP) or 
the Superintendent of Police (SP) 
of the relevant area. The SIU also 
handles allegations of torture 
referred to the Government by the 
National Human Rights 
</p>
<p>investigate a complaint. These &#8213;special cases&#8214; 
are dealt with by the CID, headed by an ASP. 
The SIU is not solely dedicated to 
investigating allegations of torture; it also 
investigates other offences allegedly 
committed by police officers, such as fraud. 
According to the same information, the SIU&#8216;s 
cadre is insufficient and its officers are liable 
to transfer. The very fact that police officers 
investigate their colleagues impairs public 
confidence in the propriety and efficiency of 
the investigations. 
The National Police Commission&#8216;s long-term 
effectiveness is threatened by the lack of a 
strong constituency supporting its 
independence and by the fact that it has failed 
to improve police accountability. 
The police routinely fabricate information and 
alter reports to support their version of the 
facts. The period within which a crime is 
investigated by the police is susceptible to 
abuse of the parties associated with this 
process in several ways. 
Despite Government commitments to address 
impunity, perpetrators of human rights 
violations do not face a serious threat of 
prosecution. There were no such convictions 
violations in 2008. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The SIU no 
longer is referred to in practice, but the IGP 
hands over the investigation to the Deputy 
IGP, who hands it over to the Assistant 
Superintendant who issues a statement 
</p>
<p>situation has reportedly 
deteriorated.  
 
It is reported that between 2005 
and 2008, when the SIU had 
primary responsibility for 
investigating torture complaints 
reported to the Attorney General, 
60 indictments were issued against 
suspected perpetrators of torture.  
But after 2008 implementation of 
the CAT Act (investigations and 
indictments) stalled as the AG&#8216;s 
office took over responsibility for 
preliminary investigation of torture 
complaints and referred few cases 
to the SIU. Since 2009, there have 
reportedly been no new 
investigations under CAT and no 
prosecutions.65 
 
It is alleged that the National 
Police Commission is no longer an 
independent body since the 18th 
Constitutional Amendment passed 
on 8 September 2010, eliminating 
the Constitutional Council and 
giving the President full control 
over appointments.

reach the prison), but prison 
authorities and prison doctors are 
reportedly not required to report 
injuries or request investigations.  
 
It is reported that public officials 
are not instructed to ensure prompt 
and impartial investigations when 
they have reason to suspect an act 
of torture or ill-treatment.

<p>(g) Ensure that confessions 
made by persons in 
custody without the 
presence of a lawyer and 
that are not confirmed 
before a judge should not 
be admissible as evidence 
against the persons who 
made the confession. 
</p>
<p>Art. 24 to 27 of the Evidence 
Ordinance (EO) do not allow 
confessions in court that are 
extracted through torture. In 
addition, ordinary law provides 
that a confession made to a police 
officer or to another person while 
in police custody is inadmissible 
before the courts. This rule,

<p>however, is not applicable to 
persons detained under 
Emergency Regulations. Over the 
course of his visits to police 
stations and prisons, the Special 
Rapporteur received numerous 
consistent and credible allegations 
from detainees who reported that 
they were ill-treated by the police 
during inquiries in order to extract 
confessions. 
</p>
<p>or an officer above this rank. Therefore, 
persons are charged on grounds based on 
involuntary statements derived through force. 
Courts have convicted persons on evidence of 
confessions in spite of medical reports of 
torture, the absence of legal representation 
and the lack of an interpreter during 
interrogation and trial.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The provision in 
the Emergency Regulations that enabled the 
admissibility of confessions was repealed 
when the ERs were amended by Gazette 
1651/24 in May 2010. However though the 
confession is not admissible when given to a 
police officer, the confession is often brought 
up in cross examination. For example, in 
cases where there is an alleged robbery and 
the stolen goods are found, the prosecution 
brings up the confession as the indication of 
where the stolen goods were hidden.  
 
</p>
<p>will be incumbent on the judge to 
assess the evidentiary value, i.e. 
the truth of the statement. The 
Magistrates have the power to 
order medical examinations and 
they have exercised this judicial 
power in appropriate cases. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No 
real change has been reported: 
whilst the Emergency Regulations 
have been repealed, it is alleged 
that persons are still arrested and 
detained under the Prevention of 
Terrorism Act, under which such 
persons may and have been 
convicted on the basis of a 
&#8213;confession&#8214; made to a police 
officer, even when that 
&#8213;confession&#8214; is retracted in court 
and torture has been alleged.  
  
Reportedly, there remains no legal 
requirement that a lawyer be 
present during questioning of a 
detainee. 
</p>
<p>(h) The burden of proof 
should shift to the 
prosecution to prove 
beyond reasonable doubt 
that the confession was not 
obtained under any kind of 
duress. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The burden of 
proof regarding confessions obtained under 
duress continues to be on the accused, in 
accordance with the Criminal Procedure 
Code. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The burden of 
proving the ingredients of an 
offense is always on the 
prosecution. It is only with regard 
to confessions under PTA that the 
burden shifts to the accused to

</i></p>
<p>an accused person is inadmissible 
in criminal proceedings if the 
making of the confession appears 
to the court to have been made 
under inducement, promise or 
threat.  
 
Voluntariness and truth are 
benchmarks that are taken into 
consideration before a court would 
admit a confession against an 
accused. 
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No 
change has been reported: without 
the PTA being repealed or revised 
to the effect recommended by the 
Special Rapporteur this situation 
will reportedly remain. 
</p>
<p>(i) Expedite criminal 
procedures relating to 
torture cases by, e.g., 
establishing special courts 
dealing with torture and ill-
treatment by public 
officials. 
 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is 
concerned about the long duration 
of investigation with regard to 
cases of torture and ill-treatment 
of often more than two years and 
allegations of threats against 
complainants and torture victims. 
 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There is no 
constitutional or statutory safeguard against 
protracted trials. Indictments take several 
years to be forwarded to the accused. Even 
after an indictment is served and the case 
commences in the High Court, proceedings 
may drag on for years, allowing ample time 
for the accused police officers to threaten, 
intimidate or kill witnesses. The Government 
has said that the Attorney General has 
instructed his officers to give preference to 
cases coming under the CAT Act. However, 
there is little evidence of such prioritisation. 
There have been only three convictions and 
several acquittals under this Act. The vast 
majority of cases remain pending in the courts 
with little hope of a successful outcome.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  In the past, if 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>It is admitted that 
there is some delay in criminal 
proceedings. It is difficult to give 
priority to any one type of case. 
Murder, rape, child abuse are 
examples of cases, that also need 
equal attention. The Attorney 
General however has instructed the 
State counsel to expedite the 
pending torture cases.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources: </i></b> No 
progress.

<p>there was a case of torture alleged against a 
Police Officer, the officer was interdicted till 
the inquiry into the case was complete and the 
Police Officers innocence was proven. 
However this practice is no longer adhered to. 
 
</p>
<p>(j) Allow judges to be able 
to exercise more discretion 
in sentencing perpetrators 
of torture under the 1994 
Torture Act. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur 
appreciates that, by enacting the 
1994 Torture Act, the Government 
has implemented its obligation to 
criminalize torture and bring 
perpetrators to justice. He is also 
encouraged by the significant 
number of indictments, 34, filed 
by the Attorney General under this 
Act. However, he regrets that 
these indictments have led so far 
only to three convictions. One of 
the reported factors influencing 
this outcome is the Torture Act&#8216;s 
high mandatory minimum 
sentence of seven years. It is 
effectively a disincentive to apply 
against perpetrators. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There has been 
recent precedence in the Supreme Court to 
award lesser sentences. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The judiciary is in 
the process of formulating 
guidelines on sentencing policy.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No 
change in policy; no apparent 
official plan to address this 
recommendation.

period of police custody 
under the Emergency 
Regulations and repeal 
other restrictions of human 
rights under them. 
</p>
<p>For three decades, emergency rule 
has continued between intervals in 
Sri Lanka. The Prevention of 
Terrorism Act (PTA) of 1979 was 
suspended in 2002 after the CFA 
was agreed upon. However, the 
law is still in force and its section 
9 (1), allowing to detain a person 
under detention order (DO) for a 
period of &#8213;three months in the first 
instance, in such place and subject 
to such conditions as may be 
determined by the Minister&#8214;, 
renewable to a maximum of 18 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  By Amendment 
Regulation 2008, the period of preventive 
detention of suspects arrested under 
Regulation 19 EMPPR was extended to a 
further period of six months, where it 
appeared that the release of such a person 
would be detrimental to the interests of 
national security, thus extending the entire 
period of preventive detention to one and a 
half years. Such a suspect was mandated to be 
produced before a Magistrate every 60 days 
during this period. After operating for several 
months, this Regulation was suspended by 
order of the Supreme Court on 15 Dec. 08, 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Since the lapse of 
the ER, Regulations have been 
made in terms of Section 27 of the 
PTA for the treatment of detainees 
consequent to the lapsing of the

<p>months, still applies. Although the 
CFA provided for the temporary 
suspension of the PTA, throughout 
this time many provisions of the 
PTA were reintroduced under the 
Emergency Regulations and now 
that the CFA has been abrogated, 
the temporary suspension of the 
PTA has been repealed. 
New Emergency Regulations (ER, 
or Emergency Miscellaneous 
Provisions and Powers 
Regulations, EMPPR) were 
imposed on 14 Aug. 05. They are 
drawn from the PTA and allow 
detention without charge for 90 
days, renewable for up to one 
year. Suspects can also be held for 
up to a year under &#8213;preventive 
detention&#8214; orders. 
</p>
<p>which meant that the old Regulations 19 and 
21 of EMPPR 2005 were revived. 
Accordingly, the current state of the law is 
that suspects are required to be brought before 
a Magistrate after 30 days following arrest 
and can thereafter be kept up to ninety days in 
detention, in a place &#8213;authorised by the 
Inspector General of Police&#8214; (IGP). Following 
the expiration of the 90 day period, they must 
be remanded by a Magistrate into fiscal 
custody. Although the Regulation indicates 
that custody thereafter cannot be more than 
one year, the current practice is that fiscal 
custody is indefinitely extended by periodic 
remand orders issued by Magistrates. Lawyers 
appearing for these suspects say that a suspect 
is typically detainees for up to two years or 
more until the Attorney General decides to 
indict him/her or alternatively ask for the 
suspect&#8216;s discharge. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  According to the 
amendment to the Regulation of May 2010, 
the detention of a person under ER 19 has to 
be notified to a Magistrate within 72 hours 
and the detainee has to be produced before a 
competent court within 30 days. The 
maximum period of detention has been 
reduced to three months. 
- Due to the short period of detention, charges 
are sometimes framed without adequate 
evidence. Bail is not given in cases of those 
detained under the Emergency Regulations or 
the PTA.

from 30th August 2011 
and the Magistrate does 
not take steps to remand 
him on material available, 
the detainee shall be 
released.  
</p>
<p>3. If a detention order either 
under Part II or Part III 
has been issued in respect 
of the detainee before the 
expiry of 30 days, the 
detainee shall not be 
released subject to the 
availability of the right of 
bail in given 
circumstances.  
</p>
<p>4. Those who were remanded 
by the magistrate under 
the provisions of the 
lapsed regulations will be 
deemed to have been 
remanded under the 
Prevention of Terrorism 
Act.

<p>As of 1 September 2011, any

given the above guarantees in 
terms of Code of Criminal

was reactivated in 2006 and since 
31 August 2011, is being used to 
manage detentions that were 
previously under ERs. It is 
reported that the PTA allows for 
an even longer period of detention 
without charge (18 months) than 
was allowed under the ERs (12 
months). 
 
</p>
<p>(l) Develop proper 
mechanisms for the 
protection of torture 
victims and witnesses. 
</p>
<p>In general, the lack of effective 
witness and victim protection 
prevents the effective application 
of the laws in place. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The police and 
security forces are known to put severe 
pressure on petitioners, lawyers, litigants, 
witnesses and families to drop human rights 
cases involving torture. Intimidation of 
witnesses is a common practice among law 
enforcement agencies. Once accused or 
indicted for torture, the law enforcement 
officers are kept in their positions.  
A draft law on Witness and Victims of Crime 
Protection was presented to Parliament in 
2008; however, this Bill has been pending for 
many months in the House. Its range is 
commendably wide but it has also been 
criticized for being seriously flawed 
otherwise. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The Draft Bill on 
Victims, Witnesses and Victims of 
Crime Protection which was 
presented in the Parliament, was 
referred to the Consultative 
Committee and several 
recommendations were made 
therein. Subsequently, the

thereafter the Bill has not been

recommendations and amendments 
are being incorporated into the Bill 
and the Bills is currently with the 
Legal Draftsman.

constitution and activities 
of the NHRC comply with 
the Paris Principles, 
including with respect to 
annual reporting on the 
human rights situation and 
follow-up on past cases of 
violations. 
</p>
<p>The NHRC is empowered to 
conduct investigations into 
complaints of violations of 
fundamental rights.  However, it 
can only make recommendations 
and is not empowered to approach 
courts directly. In Oct. 07, the 
International Coordinating 
Committee of National Institutions 
for the Promotion and Protection 
of Human Rights (ICC) 
downgraded the NHRC&#8216;s status, 
due to concerns about the 
independence of the 
Commissioners, in view of the 
2006 presidential appointments, 
which were done without the 
recommendation of the 
Constitutional Council, as 
prescribed in Sri Lanka law. 
Concern was also express 
regarding the balance, objectivity 
and politicization of its work and 
its failure to issue annual reports 
on human rights, as required by 
the Paris Principles.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The NHRC is 
mandated to investigate fundamental rights 
violations. In practice however, it has no 
enforcement powers, and has been unable to 
put clear policies into place, as well as 
effective and consistent practices in relation to 
investigations. It also suffers from a lack of 
resources and qualified staff. Its independence 
and integrity has been negatively affected as a 
result of its members being unilaterally 
appointed by the President, bypassing the pre-
condition of approval by the Constitutional 
Council. The current Commissioners have not 
demonstrated any commitment to human 
rights protection and are mainly lawyers and 
retired judges. 
The NHRC is still under special review of the 
ICC; until a decision has been reached, it will 
remain under &#8213;B&#8214; status. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>In terms of the 18th 
Amendment to the Constitution, 
the Chairman and Members of the 
Human Rights Commission of Sri 
Lanka are appointed by the 
President after seeking the 
observations of a Parliamentary 
Council. This Council consists of 
the Prime Minister, the Speaker, 
the Leader of the Opposition and a 
nominee each of the Prime 
Minister and the Leader of the 
Opposition. The aforementioned 
nominees have to belong to 
communities other than those to 
which the Prime Minister, Speaker 
and Leader of the Opposition 
belong, ensuring a wide 
representation by all communities.  
 
Other safeguards to guarantees the 
independence and integrity of the 
Human Rights Commission are 
incorporated into the constituting 
legislation, in terms Act No 21 of 
1996. The independence is similar 
to the independence of the 
judiciary, in that they are not 
removable prior to the expiration 
of their terms.  
 
Section 29 of Act No. 21 of 1996 
casts a positive duty on the State to 
provide the Commission with 
adequate funds to discharge its 
statutory functions and duties.   </p>

eliminating the Constitutional

the President to make direct 
appointments to key Commissions, 
it is reported that the NHRC can

<p>(n) Establish appropriate 
detention facilities for 
persons kept in prolonged 
custody under the 
Emergency Regulations. 
</p>
<p>During the Special Rapporteur&#8216;s 
visit to various police stations, he 
observed that detainees were 
locked up in basic cells, slept on 
the concrete floor and were often 
without natural light and sufficient 
ventilation. The conditions for 
those held in police stations under 
detention orders pursuant to the 
Emergency Regulations for 
periods of several months up to 
one year were inhuman. This 
applies both for smaller police 
stations, but particularly for the 
CID and TID headquarters in 
Colombo, where detainees were 
kept in rooms used as offices 
during the daytime, and forced to 
sleep on desks in some cases.

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The emergency

extended period of detention, which at times 
take place in locations not supervised by the 
prison administration. Under the PTA, normal 
prison rules do not apply. Torture, denial of 
proper food and restrictions on visiting hours 
are observed, together with deplorable 
conditions at police stations and Special Task 
Force camps. 
Unauthorized detention centres continue to be 
maintained.

suspected of links to the LTTE in a 
variety of &#8213;rehabilitation&#8214; camps, 
many of which were repurposed 
school buildings or old 
displacement camps with minimal 
facilities.  It is alleged that torture 
has been reported in these facilities 
and more than 1,000 of these 
detainees remain in detention (as 
of 30 September 2011) without 
charge more than two years later. 
</p>
<p>(o) Establish an effective 
and independent 
complaints system in 
prisons for torture and 
abuse leading to criminal 
investigations. 
</p>
<p>The medical personnel in various 
prisons acknowledged that they 
received on a regular basis 
allegations of torture and other 
forms of ill-treatment by persons 
who are transferred from police 
stations to the prisons. In many 
cases, these complaints are 
corroborated by physical evidence, 
such as scars and haematomas. 
However, the medical personnel 
only feels responsible for treating 
obvious wounds and does not take 
any further action, like reporting 
the alleged abuse to the authorities 
or sending the victim to a JMO. 
Sometimes the guards beat 
detainees if they have done 
something wrong. 
 
</p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Prison officials 
admit that torture and ill-treatment occurred 
within prison walls and that there were no 
regular procedures of inquiry and report. 
There have been very few visits to detention 
facilities by Magistrates, the so-called Board 
of Visitors and the Human Rights 
Commission of Sri Lanka. There is no 
effective monitoring of facilities that 
accommodate inmates detained under 
emergency law or at police detention 
facilities. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Magistrates 
rarely, if ever, visit prisons. There has been no 
appointed Board of Visitors nationally or 
locally in each area.  
- Over the past two years, the HRC has 
dramatically scaled down and completely 
stopped its surprise visits to detention 
facilities in some areas. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The Ministry of 
Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms 
has issued instructions to the 
administrators of all prisons to 
visit all wards and cells of their 
prisons daily and to take proper 
immediate action with regard to 
complaints of inmates.  
 
Instructions were also given to 
take immediate action on 
complaints against prison officers 
and to take disciplinary action If 
necessary. A complaint box has 
been placed at the prison entrance 
for the people to visit the inmates 
to place their complaints.  
 
Instructions were also given to 
refer any inmate who has been 
assaulted by the prison officer to 
the judicial medical officer. Once 
in every 30 days authorized 
magistrates visit the detainees in 
the detention centers.

including deficiencies in prison 
conditions and overcrowding.

</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur heard of a 
number of instances of corporal 
punishment at Bogambara prison. 
In one case, a preliminary 
disciplinary inquiry was 
conducted against the officer 
concerned and formal charges 
were to be presented against an 
officer by the Prisons Department.

</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>The Ministry of 
Rehabilitation and Prison Reforms 
has taken disciplinary action 
against the officer at Bogambara 
prison that is said to have assaulted 
an inmate. It is proposed to 
relocate the prisons in Colombo 
and Kandy to new premises with 
modern state of the art facilities. It 
is believed that there will be a 
significant reduction of the prison 
population by the adoption of non-
custodial sentences which will 
further reduce the problem of

<p>allegations. On 14 June 2011, 
seven Tamil detainees in 
Bogambara Prison were reportedly 
tortured by investigating officers 
following a dispute between two 
groups of Sinhalese prisoners who 
were allegedly selling drugs within 
the prison. Guards reportedly 
threatened the prisoners with 
death, saying they would die like 
two well-known Tamil prisoners 
who were tortured and killed by 
Sinhalese prisoners in a 1983 
prison massacre. 
 
The victims, who were reportedly 
bleeding and in severe pain, were 
eventually admitted to the prison

<p>The Government provided the 
Special Rapporteur with statistics 
indicating severe overcrowding of 
prisons. While the total capacity of 
all prisons amounts to 8,200, the 
actual prison population has 
reached 28,000. The combination 
of severe overcrowding and the 
antiquated infrastructure of certain 
prison facilities places unbearable

<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Prisons are faced 
with severe overcrowding. There is a lack of 
adequate sanitation, food and water, and 
inadequate medical treatment, and prisoners 
have little exposure to sunlight. The buildings 
are old, and the possibility of the spread of 
contagious disease remains a serious problem.

<p>48 stipulates that children and young 
offenders should be kept separate from adults 
in police stations and courts, etc. Furthermore, 
the Community Based Corrections Act. No 46 
of 1999 stipulates a wide range of non-
custodial orders for the rehabilitation of 
(child) offenders including unpaid community 
work. In practice, child offenders are kept in 
police cells together with adult offenders prior 
to being produced in court. Consequently, 
children are often exposed to abuse. Children 
kept in custody under emergency law face 
even greater hardships. Further, the police 
hardly follow alternatives to detaining 
children in the police station, such as 
releasing them to their parents or placing 
them in a remand home. The placement of 
children in adult prisons pending trial is a 
common practice, as there is lack of capacity 
in remand homes for children. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There is a 
facility in Thaldena which was reserved for 
youth offenders between the ages of 18 and 
22. However, many of those convicted for

<b>Non-governmental sources:</b></i> It is 
alleged that after the armed

600 children were detained as 
former LTTE child combatant.  
They were initially held with adult 
LTTE suspects and then 
transferred to dedicated 
&#8213;rehabilitation&#8214; facilities for child 
soldiers where they received 
educational instruction, skills 
training and political 
indoctrination. Sri Lanka

A moratorium on death sentence is 
in place in Sri Lanka. In the case 
of killings in Angulana, three 
police officers were convicted.   
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No 
change in law or policy. 
Reportedly, according to Sri 
Lanka&#8216;s Department of Prisons, 96 
people were sentenced to death in 
2010, all were convicted of 
murder. Since 2006, 673 death 
sentences have been issued -- 15 
for drug offences and 658 for 
murder.69 
 
Reportedly, in a very rare 
prosecution of deaths in police 
custody, in August 2011, four 
policemen received the death 
sentence for the 2009 custodial 
killing of two young men in 
Angulana.  It is reported that news 
of the killings sparked large public 
demonstrations against the police. 
 
In April 2011, three Sri Lankan 
solders were sentenced to death for 
rape and murder of a 22 year old 
woman in Jaffna in 1996.

<p>No death sentences have 
reportedly been carried out. 
</p>
<p>(v) Establish centres for the 
rehabilitation of torture 
victims 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  There is no state 
sponsored system of rehabilitation afforded to 
torture victims. 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Section 8 on 
Torture of the NHRAP &#8211; 
Rehabilitation and Reparation, a 
comprehensive reparation 
programme for victims of torture 
has been proposed.  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No 
progress. 
</p>
<p>(w) Ratify the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture, and 
establish a truly 
independent monitoring 
mechanism to visit all 
places where persons are 
deprived of their liberty 
throughout the country, 
and carry out private 
interviews. 
</p>
<p>A number of shortcomings remain 
and, most significantly, the 
absence of an independent and 
effective preventive mechanism 
mandated to make regular and 
unannounced visits to all places of 
detention throughout the country 
at any time, to conduct private 
interviews with detainees, and to 
subject them to thorough 
independent medical 
examinations. It is the Special 
Rapporteur&#8216;s conviction that this 
is the most effective way of 
preventing torture. In the case of 
Sri Lanka, he is not satisfied that 
visits undertaken by existing 
mechanisms, such as the NHRC, 
are presently  fulfilling this role, 
or carrying out this level of 
scrutiny. In this regard, the Special 
Rapporteur welcomes information 
from the Government that it 
intends to establish an inter-
agency body to study possible 
modalities and mechanisms to 
undertake visits to places of 
</p>
<p>Sri Lanka has not signed or ratified the 
OPCAT. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources</i></b> : The Release of 
Remand Prisoners Act No. 8 of 1991 provides 
for monthly visits to prisons by a Magistrate, 
and Section 39 of the Prisons Ordinance 
empowered judges, members of parliament 
and Magistrates to visit the prisons at any 
time and hold therein &#8213;any inspection, 
investigation or inquiry.&#8214; Section 28(2) of the 
Human Rights Commission Act, No 21 of 
1996 empowers any person authorised by the 
Commission to enter at any time any place of 
detention, police station, prison or any other 
place in which any person is detained by 
judicial order or otherwise and to make such 
examinations or inquiries as may be 
necessary, to ascertain the conditions of 
detention of the persons detained therein. 
However, current emergency laws allow for 
detention of persons in places other than 
official detention facilities. By inference, 
visits to such undisclosed and secret places of 
detention are not possible. Though it is 
provided for by law that Magistrates visit 
remand prisons, this is seldom observed in 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>Sri Lanka has not 
accepted Article 21 and 22 of the 
Convention, Ratification of the 
Optional Protocol of the 
Convention would be considered 
by the State party.  
<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  No 
action taken to ratify the Optional 
Protocol. 
 
It is reported that Sri Lanka&#8216;s 
National Human Rights 
Commission (NHRC)  does not 
make regular unannounced visits 
to places of detention, but will 
make a surprise visit if alerted to a 
problem, for example through their 
public hotline. 
 
It is alleged that security forces 
often fail to alert the NHRC to 
detentions. The NHRC reports, for 
example, that officers of the 
Commission visited Mount 
Lavinia Police Station on 15th 
August 2011, on the information </p>

the capacities and efficacy of the 
NHRC in this connection. 
</p>
<p>practice. The Government has announced that 
it was considering the introduction of 
legislation to make it compulsory that 
Magistrates inspected places of detention. 
Yet, this intention has not been translated into 
actual practice. Officers of the NHRC, even 
on the rare occasions when they did visit 
places where persons were detained, were 
only shown the regular holding areas rather 
than the mess rooms and the toilets, where 
torture may actually be taking place. Also, the 
fact that they have to obtain prior permission 
for these visits renders a &#8215;surprise element&#8216; 
impossible in such visits, which could help 
uncover abuse. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The situation 
remains the same. 
</p>
<p>received through the hotline. It is 
alleged that detainees had been 
held in police custody for more 
than seven days and appeared to 
have been tortured. Several other 
detainees were being held on 
detention orders under emergency 
regulations. Reportedly, 
information about these detentions 
had not been sent to the 
Commission as required by per 
provisions of the Human Rights 
Commission of Sri Lanka Act and 
Presidential Directives.    
 
Some places of detention have 
reportedly been kept secret, 
making independent monitoring 
impossible. 
 
</p>
<p>(x) Ensure that security 
personnel undergo 
extensive and thorough 
training, using a 
curriculum that 
incorporates human rights 
education throughout and 
that includes training in 
effective interrogation 
techniques and the proper 
use of policing equipment, 
and that existing personnel 
receive continuing 
education. 
</p>
<p> <b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Human rights 
education, which was introduced into police 
training in the early 1980s, is part of the 
curricula at the Sri Lanka Police Training 
School as well as at the Police Higher 
Training Institute. Human rights and 
humanitarian law also form part of the 
curricula in the training courses at all levels of 
the army and some courses are supplemented 
by training programmes conducted by the 
NHRC, the ICRC, NGOs and universities. 
However, the quality of the training is poor 
and the training facilities are sub-standard. 
The State has no national human rights plan. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The United 
Nations Resident Coordinator&#8216;s Office held a 
Human Rights Training of Trainers for the 
</p>
<p><b>Government: </b>In service training 
programmes are conducted by the 
Judges Training Institute under the 
auspices of the Judicial Services 
Commission. In-house training and 
workshops are periodically 
conducted by the Attorney 
General&#8216;s Department for 
prosecutors.  
In 2010, 23 newly recruited police 
officers were trained on torture 
prevention; 50 inspectors of police, 
sub-inspectors of police, police 
constables, police sergeants, and 
50 chief inspectors, inspectors of 
police, sun-inspectors were trained 
on Torture Act and Mandate of the 
HRCSL.  </p>

<p><b>2007 (A/HRC/7/3/Add.5) 
</b></p>
<p>138. Le 22 Novembre 2011, le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a envoy&#233; le tableau ci-dessous au Gouvernement togolais pour lui demander 
des informations et commentaires sur les mesures prises suite aux recommandations &#233;mises par le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial apr&#232;s sa 
mission d&#8216;avril 2007. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial regrette qu&#8216;&#224; ce jour, le Gouvernement n&#8216;ait pas encore r&#233;pondu &#224; cette demande. Il 
attend de recevoir des informations sur les efforts du Togo pour assurer le suivi des recommandations et reste disponible pour 
fournir tout appui technique dont aurait besoin le Gouvernement togolais.  
</p>
<p>139. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial se f&#233;licite  de la ratification, par le Gouvernement togolais, du Protocole facultatif &#224; la Convention 
contre la torture et autres peines ou traitements cruels, inhumains ou d&#233;gradants (OPCAT) le 20 juillet 2010. Il note que le Comit&#233; 
des droits de l&#8216;homme a recommand&#233; l&#8216;&#233;laboration d&#8216;un m&#233;canisme permettant &#224; tout d&#233;tenu de signaler toute violation dont il 
serait victime.70 Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial aimerait recevoir des informations d&#233;taill&#233;es sur les mesures envisag&#233;es et/ou prises pour la 
mise en place d&#8216;un M&#233;canisme National de Pr&#233;vention au Togo qui pourra effectuer des visites inopin&#233;es dans tous les centres de 
d&#233;tention.  
</p>
<p>140. Le Comit&#233; des droits de l&#8216;homme et le Comit&#233; contre la torture 71 regrettent que la pratique des mutilations g&#233;nitales 
f&#233;minines reste encore r&#233;pandue malgr&#233; les mesures prises par le Gouvernement pour y mettre fin. Le rapporteur sp&#233;cial est 
pr&#233;occup&#233; par le fait que cette pratique ne soit pas sanctionn&#233;e par le syst&#232;me p&#233;nal togolais. Le Gouvernement devrait poursuivre 
et renforcer ses efforts pour mettre fin aux pratiques discriminatoires, telles que les mutilations g&#233;nitales f&#233;minines. &#192; ce titre, le 
Gouvernement devrait intensifier ses efforts de sensibilisation aux mutilations g&#233;nitales f&#233;minines, en particulier au sein des 
communaut&#233;s o&#249; elles sont encore r&#233;pandues. Il devrait p&#233;naliser la pratique et veiller &#224; ce que les auteurs de mutilations g&#233;nitales 
f&#233;minines soient traduits en justice. 
</p>
<p>141. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial est pr&#233;occup&#233; par le fait que le Gouvernement togolais n&#8216;ait toujours pas adopt&#233; de disposition p&#233;nale 
qui d&#233;finisse et criminalise explicitement la torture; et que, dans ce contexte, la pratique de la torture et des traitements cruels, 
inhumains ou d&#233;gradants demeure impunie. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial exhorte le Gouvernement togolais &#224; adopter une disposition 
p&#233;nale d&#233;finissant la torture conform&#233;ment aux standards internationaux, ainsi que des dispositions incriminant et sanctionnant les 
actes de torture par des peines proportionn&#233;es &#224; leur gravit&#233;; et &#224; s&#8216;assurer que tout acte de torture ou traitement cruel, inhumain ou 
d&#233;gradant soit l&#8216;objet de poursuites et de sanctions proportionnellement &#224; sa gravit&#233;.

les locaux de l&#8216;Agence Nationale de Renseignement (ANR), et par les all&#233;gations de d&#233;c&#232;s r&#233;sultant de mauvais traitements en

<b>Gouvernement:</b> le 20 juillet 2010, le 
Togo a ratifi&#233; le protocole facultatif se 
rapportant &#224; la convention contre la 
torture et aux autres peines ou 
traitements cruels, inhumains ou 
d&#233;gradants.  
Les 20 et 21 juillet 2010, un s&#233;minaire 
a &#233;t&#233; organis&#233; par le Haut 
Commissariat des NU aux Droits de 
l&#8216;Homme et par l&#8216;association pour la 
pr&#233;vention  de la torture sur les 
m&#233;canismes de pr&#233;ventions de la 
torture pour le Togo. Une s&#233;rie de 
recommandations ont &#233;t&#233; mises en 
place, ce qui permettra une pr&#233;vention 
efficace de la torture dans les lieux de 
d&#233;tention.

d&#233;tenus qui sont institu&#233;s &#8215;Chef de

responsabilit&#233; de g&#233;rer le quotidien de 
leurs cod&#233;tenus. Ainsi, ceux-ci 
prennent des mesures de gestion du 
courrier des d&#233;tenus, mais la 
confidentialit&#233; des correspondances 
dans la pratique n&#8216;est pas souvent 
garantie. L&#8216;envoi de courriers est 
m&#234;me souvent soumis au paiement de 
certains frais non

<p>- Il n&#8216;existe aucun m&#233;canisme formel

- Les tortures et intimidations

Pour les quelques rares victimes qui

<p>mesure n&#8216;est prise pour sanctionner les 
auteurs de ces actes. 
- Dans la brigade pour mineurs, des cas 
de ch&#226;timents corporels sont constat&#233;s 
y compris en pr&#233;sence de la principale 
responsable de la structure. 
- Dans la moiti&#233; sud du pays (Lom&#233;

psychologiques, les ch&#226;timents 
corporels, la privation volontaire de

dans certaines unit&#233;s de police et de 
gendarmerie b&#233;n&#233;ficiant de 
l&#8216;accompagnement des ONG, les 
ch&#226;timents corporels sont devenus des 
exceptions. Les services de la Brigade 
des mineurs se trouvent seulement 
dans la  ville de Lom&#233;. Aucune brigade 
ne se trouve dans les autres r&#233;gions et

parfois en d&#233;tention les mineurs avec

<p>97. Le Gouvernement devrait 
mettre en place des m&#233;canismes 
pour faire respecter l&#180;interdiction 
de la violence &#224; l&#180;encontre des 
femmes, y compris les pratiques 
traditionnelles comme les 
mutilations g&#233;nitales, continuer 
d&#180;organiser des campagnes de 
sensibilisation, et faire une &#233;tude 
pour &#233;valuer la pr&#233;valence des 
mutilations g&#233;nitales au Togo. 
</p>
<p>La pratique de la mutilation 
g&#233;n&#233;rale persiste et continue d&#180;&#234;tre 
accept&#233;e par la soci&#233;t&#233; et les 
m&#233;canismes pour faire respecter 
son interdiction sont quasiment 
inexistants. Le RS a eu 
connaissance d&#180;une seule 
condamnation, prononc&#233;e en 1998, 
pour infraction &#224; la loi no 98-106 
de 1998. 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> En 1999, le Ministre 
des affaires sociales &#224; l&#180;&#233;poque, a 
entrepris une campagne de 
sensibilisation &#224; l&#180;&#233;chelle nationale 
avec l&#180;appui de UNFPA et UNICEF, 
suite &#224; laquelle les ONGs ont pris le 
relais. En janvier 2009, le 
Gouvernement a indiqu&#233; que la 
pratique n&#180;est plus accept&#233;e par la 
population. Le taux de pr&#233;valence des 
mutilations g&#233;nitales au Togo est pass&#233; 
de 12%en 1996 &#224; 6.9% en 2008 
(rapport d&#180;&#233;tude de Minist&#232;re de

</i></b> - Les campagnes de sensibilisation 
continuent; des projets de reconversion 
des exciseuses sont mis en place dans 
le Nord du pays pour &#233;radiquer le 
ph&#233;nom&#232;ne, n&#233;anmoins la pratique 
continue dans la clandestinit&#233;. 
- Le Code de l&#8216;enfant a repris les 
&#233;l&#233;ments de la loi N&#176;98-106 de 1998, 
et les a am&#233;lior&#233;s en sanctionnant 
m&#234;me la complicit&#233; des actes de 
mutilations g&#233;nitales par le silence et la 
non d&#233;nonciation. Des peines 
d&#8216;emprisonnement sont pr&#233;vues &#224; 
l&#8216;encontre des auteurs de cette pratique 
dont la non-d&#233;nonciation est 
constitutive d&#8216;infraction.  
- Le manque de contr&#244;le permet, 
puisque la tradition est complice, de 
continuer la pratique en cachette; ce 
qui est plus dangereux.

<p>98. Le Gouvernement togolais 
devrait soutenir la Commission 
Nationale des Droits de l&#180;Homme 
dans les efforts qu&#8216;elle d&#233;ploie

<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> En 2009, l&#8216;inspection 
des prisons et autres lieux de d&#233;tention 
est confront&#233;e &#224; des difficult&#233;s li&#233;es &#224; 
l&#8216;insuffisance des moyens humains, 
mat&#233;riels et financiers. C&#8216;est pourquoi, 
dans le cadre du Programme National 
de Modernisation de la Justice (PNMJ) 
(2005-2010), le sous-programme 1 a 
pr&#233;vu le renforcement de contr&#244;le des 
capacit&#233;s des juridictions par le 
renforcement de contr&#244;le de 
l&#8216;inspection g&#233;n&#233;rale des services 
juridictionnels et p&#233;nitentiaires et la 
cr&#233;ation d&#8216;une direction des parquets. 
Il s&#8216;agira de r&#233;organiser, d&#8216;&#233;quiper et 
de doter en personnel ces deux 
institutions.  
Depuis novembre 2007, le PNMJ a 
organis&#233; plusieurs ateliers de 
renforcement des capacit&#233;s des 
officiers de police judiciaire afin de 
mieux accomplir leur mission. 140 
officiers de police judiciaire ont d&#233;j&#224; 
profit&#233; des ces formations. 
 
<b><i>Des sources non gouvernementales:

insuffisantes. 
- Un effort est fait pour le respect des 
d&#233;lais de garde &#224; vue. A l&#8216;int&#233;rieur du 
pays la probl&#233;matique du non respect 
du d&#233;lai l&#233;gal de garde &#224; vue persiste &#224; 
cause, tr&#232;s souvent, du manque

<p>- L&#8216;examen m&#233;dical des d&#233;tenus n'est  
toujours pas devenu syst&#233;matique. 
- La plupart du temps, ceux qui sont 
souffrants ou qui ont subit de mauvais 
traitements lors de leurs interpellation 
ou de leurs d&#233;tention, sont oblig&#233;s de 
payer de leurs propres poches les soins 
&#224; l&#8216;infirmerie de la gendarmerie. De 
plus, les m&#233;decins ne consultent pas ou 
tr&#232;s peu dans les prisons. 
- L&#8216;Etat a mis en place un fonds d&#8216;aide 
juridictionnelle mais qui n&#8216;est pas 
op&#233;rationnel. D&#8216;autres institutions 
notamment l&#8216;Ambassade des Etats-
Unis ont financ&#233; la mise en place d&#8216;une 
ligne verte d&#8216;assistance juridique &#224; 
toute personne y compris les d&#233;tenus. 
- Des personnes d&#233;tenues pour des 
d&#233;lits mineurs restent 3 &#224; 6 mois voire 
un an sans jugement ni inculpation; les 
raisons &#233;voqu&#233;es sont souvent 
l&#8216;existence d&#8216;un juge unique. 
</p>
<p>100. Le Gouvernement devrait 
faire en sorte que les personnes 
plac&#233;es en d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive 
comparaissent rapidement devant 
un juge et soient inform&#233;es en 
tout temps de leurs droits et de 
l&#180;&#233;tat d&#180;avancement de leur 
affaire, fixer des limites &#224; la dur&#233;e 
de la d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive et 
veiller &#224; ce que ces d&#233;lais soient 
respect&#233;s en organisant 
p&#233;riodiquement des inspections 
ind&#233;pendantes.  
</p>
<p>Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a constat&#233; 
personnellement dans de nombreux 
cas que la dur&#233;e maximale de la 
garde &#224; vue dans les postes de 
police ou de gendarmerie 
(quarante-huit ou quatre-vingt-
seize heures) &#233;tait expir&#233;e et 
qu&#180;elle n&#180;avait pas &#233;t&#233; prolong&#233;e 
par le minist&#232;re public comme la 
loi l&#180;exige. Cela signifie que de 
nombreux d&#233;tenus passent de 
longues p&#233;riodes dans des 
conditions &#233;pouvantables sans 
aucun fondement juridique.  
De nombreux prisonniers en 
d&#233;tention avant jugement ont 
d&#233;clar&#233; qu&#180;ils n&#180;avaient pas &#233;t&#233; 
pr&#233;sent&#233;s &#224; un juge ou un 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement </b>: La circulaire No. 
022/MISD du 17 mai 2004 autorise la 
personne plac&#233;e en garde &#224; vue &#224; avoir 
un entretien de 15 minutes avec son 
conseil d&#232;s la 24&#232;me heure de garde &#224; 
vue dans le but de pr&#233;venir les 
traitements inhumains.  
- En 2008, les procureurs de la 
R&#233;publique et les juges d&#180;instruction 
font des visites p&#233;riodiques et 
inopin&#233;es dans les centres de d&#233;tention 
(commissariats, brigades de 
gendarmerie et prisons). De plus, 
l&#180;effectif des magistrats augmente de 
25 personnes chaque ann&#233;e sur 5 ans 
suivant les objectifs fix&#233;s par le PNMJ. 
Les magistrats en fonction suivent des 
formations continues.

Quoique des efforts soient faits dans ce

d&#233;tenus est pr&#233;occupante. La dur&#233;e de 
la d&#233;tention pr&#233;ventive n&#8216;est pas 
toujours respect&#233;e. 
- Les d&#233;tenus pr&#233;ventifs sont souvent 
oubli&#233;s et les infractions graves 
demeurent de cinq &#224; 10 ans sans 
jugement. 
- Les personnes en garde &#224; vue ne 
connaissent pas, pour la plupart, leurs 
droits. Elles pensent qu&#8216;un avocat est 
cher et elles sont livr&#233;es &#224; elles-m&#234;mes. 
Ainsi, la pratique constat&#233;e par le

- Les moyens ne sont pas &#224; la

<p>traitement des d&#233;tenus, en instituant 
une garde f&#233;minine dans les centres de 
d&#233;tention. Le texte cr&#233;ant le corps des 
gardiens de prisons est adopt&#233; en 
conseil des ministres et le processus de 
recrutement des surveillants des deux 
sexes s&#8216;inscrit dans cette perspective.  
Un d&#233;cret portant sur la cr&#233;ation du 
corps des surveillants des 
&#233;tablissements p&#233;nitentiaires a &#233;t&#233; 
adopt&#233; par le conseil des ministres le 
14 janvier 2009.  
 
<b><i>Des sources non gouvernementales:</i></b>  Il 
n&#8216;y a pas de s&#233;paration entre les 
d&#233;tenus pr&#233;ventifs et les d&#233;tenus 
condamn&#233;s &#224; cause du manque 
d&#8216;infrastructures. 
- Peu de personnel f&#233;minin existe pour 
le moment, notamment au sein de 
l&#8216;administration p&#233;nitentiaire, seule 
une femme r&#233;gisseur sur les 12 prisons 
que compte le Togo. 
- Le gouvernement a donn&#233; 
l&#8216;impression d&#8216;agir dans ce sens, mais 
l&#8216;action n&#8216;est pas perceptible. 
</p>
<p>105. Les autorit&#233;s togolaises 
devraient faire en sorte que les 
d&#233;tenus ne soient pas obliges de 
se d&#233;shabiller lorsqu&#180;ils sont 
plac&#233;s en garde &#224; vue dans les 
locaux de la gendarmerie.  
 
</p>
<p>Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a &#233;t&#233; 
inform&#233; de l&#180;existence d&#180;une 
instruction sp&#233;ciale de la 
gendarmerie visant &#224; pr&#233;venir les  
suicides, que certains responsables 
ont interpr&#233;t&#233;e comme signifiant 
que les d&#233;tenus devaient rester nus 
jour et nuit dans leur cellule. Or, 
d&#180;apr&#232;s le Gouvernement, la 
gendarmerie n&#180;a jamais donn&#233; 
l&#180;ordre de laisser nues les 
personnes en garde &#224; vue.  
 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> Depuis les 
recommandations formul&#233;es en avril 
2007, les dispositions pratiques ont &#233;t&#233; 
prises par les autorit&#233;s au niveau de la 
gendarmerie et de la police. En vertu 
de ces dispositions, les d&#233;tenus sont 
dans leurs tenues lorsqu&#180;ils sont en 
garde &#224; vue au bureau en attendant les 
instructions. Lorsqu&#180;ils doivent &#234;tre 
intern&#233;s dans la chambre de suret&#233;, ils 
sont fouill&#233;s et d&#233;barrass&#233;s de tout 
objet pouvant leur permettre de se 
suicider. Ainsi, ils sont gard&#233;s en short 
de sport ou en culotte, mais jamais nus.

Des sources non gouvernementales: 
Malgr&#233; la modernisation de la justice 
amorc&#233;e, la corruption dans le domaine

Dans les prisons, le pouvoir est

notamment en maintien de  
l&#180;ordre pour la s&#233;curit&#233;. Les missions 
essentielles sont : les missions de

En ce qui concerne les prisons, en 2008

Le maintien de l&#8216;ordre dans les prisons

<p>Souvent les mineurs, et 
quelquefois m&#234;me les jeunes 
enfants, sont plac&#233;s en d&#233;tention au 
lieu d&#180;&#234;tre confi&#233;s aux services

de Lom&#233;, par exemple, des enfants 
abandonn&#233;s, victimes de la traite et 
marginalis&#233;s, dont certains &#226;g&#233;s de 
moins de 10 ans, sont d&#233;tenus avec 
de jeunes adultes d&#233;linquants.  
 
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> Le code de l&#180;enfant a 
&#233;t&#233; adopt&#233; et promulgu&#233; le 6 juillet 
2007. Des brigades pour mineurs ont 
&#233;t&#233; &#233;rig&#233;es au niveau de chaque r&#233;gion.  
Des sources non gouvernementales: La 
situation est corrig&#233;e depuis l&#8216;adoption 
du code de l&#8216;enfant qui a pr&#233;vu la 
protection sp&#233;ciale des enfants en 
situation difficile ou en danger, et la 
protection des enfants victimes de 
traites. Depuis lors ces cat&#233;gories 
d&#8216;enfants ne sont plus envoy&#233;es &#224; la 
brigade pour mineurs  mais 
syst&#233;matiquement orient&#233;es vers les 
structures de prise en charge des 
enfants, avec l&#8216;appui des ONG et des 
partenaires financiers. De m&#234;me, un 
document d&#233;terminant le paquet 
minimum de services pour la prise en 
charge des enfants vuln&#233;rables au Togo 
a &#233;t&#233; &#233;labor&#233; en 2009 et un d&#233;cret 
portant normes et standards applicables 
aux structures d&#8216;accueil et de 
protection des enfants vuln&#233;rables au 
Togo vient d&#8216;&#234;tre adopt&#233; en ao&#251;t 2010. 
- Actuellement la seule brigade pour 
mineurs du Togo se trouve &#224; Lom&#233;. 
Des centres de transit ont &#233;t&#233; 
&#233;galement cr&#233;es en vue d&#8216;accueillir les 
enfants victimes de traite et les enfants 
de la rue. Ainsi, cinq structures existent

de la peine de mort &#233;tait envisag&#233;e 
dans le cadre des r&#233;formes 
l&#233;gislatives en cours.  
</p>
<p><b>Gouvernement :</b> En juin 2009,

solicitando informaci&#243;n y comentarios sobre las medidas adoptadas con respecto a la aplicaci&#243;n de sus recomendaciones. El 
Gobierno proporcion&#243; informaci&#243;n el 30 de enero de 2012. El Relator Especial quisiera agradecer al Gobierno por la informaci&#243;n 
proporcionada, invitarle a enviar informaci&#243;n sobre todas las recomendaciones emitidas, e informar de su disposici&#243;n para ayudarle 
en los esfuerzos para prevenir y combatir la tortura y los malos tratos. El Relator Especial toma nota de las respuestas 
proporcionadas por el Gobierno. Sin embargo, desafortunadamente, en esta ocasi&#243;n no ha sido posible incorporar la informaci&#243;n en 
el presente informe, debido a la recepci&#243;n de tal respuesta en fecha muy reciente.  
</p>
<p>145. En el mes de febrero de 2012, el Gobierno de Uruguay emiti&#243; una invitaci&#243;n formal al Relator Especial para realizar una 
visita de seguimiento. El Relator Especial se compromete a contemplar la posibilidad de una tal visita en su calendario de 
actividades y desea agradecer al Gobierno de Uruguay por esta invitaci&#243;n. Ella demuestra un compromiso serio de combatir la 
tortura y mejorar las condiciones de detenci&#243;n, y constituye un ejemplo de mejores pr&#225;cticas. 
</p>
<p>146. Respecto a la reforma del sistema de justicia penal, el Relator Especial toma nota de que el proyecto del C&#243;digo de Proceso 
Penal sigue a consideraci&#243;n de la Comisi&#243;n de Constituci&#243;n y Legislaci&#243;n del Senado y solicita al Gobierno a que siga

lanzamiento del programa &#8213;Apoyo a la reforma del sistema de justicia penal y a la mejora de las condiciones de vida y de

del delito de tortura en la Ley 18.026 y apreciar&#237;a adem&#225;s contar con informaci&#243;n acerca de los resultados de la evaluaci&#243;n de dicha 
definici&#243;n seg&#250;n la recomendaci&#243;n del Comisionado Parlamentario para el Sistema Carcelario. Sin embargo, el Relator Especial 
lamenta que el Gobierno de Uruguay no haya proporcionado informaci&#243;n en cuanto a la reforma del C&#243;digo Penal, en particular con 
respecto a la inclusi&#243;n de la tortura como delito independiente. 
</p>
<p>147. Con respecto al problema cr&#243;nico de hacinamiento en los centros de reclusi&#243;n, el Relator reconoce las acciones tomadas por 
el Gobierno, en particular la construcci&#243;n de nuevos establecimientos penitenciarios y m&#243;dulos, la habilitaci&#243;n o cierre de algunos 
de los m&#243;dulos con mayores problemas de hacinamiento y deterioro edilicio, y los intentos a establecer medidas alternativas a la 
prisi&#243;n preventiva. El Relator toma nota del cierre del m&#243;dulo 3 del COMCAR e insta al Gobierno a tratar como prioridad el cierre 
de los m&#243;dulos 2 y 4. El Relator agradece al Gobierno por proveer estad&#237;sticas detalladas en cuanto al hacinamiento en los 
establecimientos penitenciarios,  reconoce los avances realizados en los &#250;ltimos a&#241;os, y toma nota que el Gobierno reconoce que la 
situaci&#243;n sigue siendo cr&#237;tica en 11 de los 31 establecimientos.  
</p>
<p>148. En relaci&#243;n a las condiciones de vida en las c&#225;rceles, el Relator Especial ve como un paso positivo el aumento de los 
recursos financieros destinados al mejoramiento de la situaci&#243;n de las personas detenidas. El Relator aplaude el inicio de instancias 
de di&#225;logo con la poblaci&#243;n detenida y las acciones tomadas para incluir a esta poblaci&#243;n en el proceso de mejorar las condiciones 
de vida. El Relator agradecer&#237;a contar con informaci&#243;n detallada sobre la participaci&#243;n de la poblaci&#243;n privada de su libertad en la 
formulaci&#243;n e implementaci&#243;n de la estrategia del Gobierno para dignificar las condiciones de reclusi&#243;n. El Relator encomia el </p>

<p>149. El Relator Especial toma nota tambi&#233;n de las medidas adoptadas para realizar la reubicaci&#243;n de las c&#225;rceles de la &#243;rbita 
policial a la &#243;rbita civil. Sin embargo, lamenta que el Gobierno no tenga previsto la creaci&#243;n de un Ministerio de Justicia. Con 
respecto a la recomendaci&#243;n del Relator sobre la creaci&#243;n de un cuerpo de guardias de prisiones bien entrenado que sustituya al 
personal policial, el Relator toma nota de la creaci&#243;n de cargos para operadores penitenciarios. El Relator Especial solicita al 
Gobierno proporcionar m&#225;s informaci&#243;n acerca de los roles tanto del personal policial como del personal penitenciario en los 
establecimientos carcelarios. El Relator Especial lamenta que el Gobierno no haya proporcionado informaci&#243;n en cuanto a la 
utilizaci&#243;n de personal militar para encargarse de la custodia perimetral de establecimientos penitenciarios. El Relator adem&#225;s toma 
nota de los programas de capitaci&#243;n y sensibilizaci&#243;n en derechos humanos planeados para funcionarios policiales y penitenciarios. 
Sin embargo, considera que la preparaci&#243;n de documentos y manuales no es suficiente; es necesario organizar cursos extensos y 
obligatorios para entrenar al personal policial a trabajar en el &#225;mbito penitenciario aun si solo es por un periodo corto.  </p>

</p>
<p>(a) Emprender una reforma 
profunda de los sistemas 
penitenciario y de justicia penal 
encaminada a la prevenci&#243;n del 
delito y la resocializaci&#243;n de los 
delincuentes, en lugar de 
centrarse en las medidas 
punitivas y adoptar una pol&#237;tica 
basada simplemente en encerrar 
a los sospechosos y a los 
delincuentes convictos. 
</p>
<p>- Recurso a la prisi&#243;n preventiva 
como regla general y no excepci&#243;n.  
- Encierro de los reclusos durante 
casi 24 horas, escasas posibilidades 
de rehabilitaci&#243;n y preparaci&#243;n para 
la reinserci&#243;n en la sociedad y falta 
de actividades educativas o de ocio.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Fuentes no gubernamentales:</i></b>  El

marzo de 2010 ha se&#241;alado que la 
atenci&#243;n de la situaci&#243;n carcelaria 
constituye una de las prioridades del 
gobierno. Las autoridades han 
expresado su decisi&#243;n pol&#237;tica de 
encarar reformas par aliviar las graves 
condiciones de hacinamiento y de 
carencias edilicias y abordar un 
tratamiento integral de las personas 
privadas de libertad. 
- El Ministro del Interior indic&#243; que 
&#8213;es necesario formular una nueva 
pol&#237;tica penitenciaria para los 
pr&#243;ximos 20 a&#241;os, para salir de la 
emergencia y para tener un sistema 
que permita la reinserci&#243;n de las 
personas que han delinquido.&#8214; 
- Los antecedentes que intentaron 
reformas de tipo m&#225;s integral, incluida 
la Ley de Humanizaci&#243;n del Sistema 
Carcelario, han quedado inoperativos 
como consecuencia de la oposici&#243;n de 
algunos sectores pol&#237;ticos y la no 
aplicaci&#243;n de la misma por parte del 
sistema judicial. 
- El Estado no ha emprendido ninguna 
iniciativa tendiente a la postergada 
reforma del Sistema de Justicia Penal, 
C&#243;digo Penal y C&#243;digo de Proceso 
Penal. Desde 2006, una Comisi&#243;n 
elabor&#243; una base m&#237;nima para la 
reforma del CPP, remitidas al 
Parlamento Nacional en setiembre de 
2009, y a&#250;n siguen sin discutirse en las

<p><b>Gobierno:</b> El gobierno que asumi&#243; 
funciones el 1 de marzo de 2010 ha 
se&#241;alado, sin dubitaciones, la 
necesidad de actuar en varios niveles a 
efectos de paliar la crisis penitenciaria 
nacional. En tal sentido, en el terreno 
de las soluciones profundas se ha 
coincidido en la necesidad de 
introducir reformas sustantivas en el 
sistema penal y procesal penal 
nacional. A ese respecto, y en 
seguimiento del proceso iniciado por 
el gobierno anterior, una Comisi&#243;n de 
alto nivel integrada por expertos ha 
hecho entrega de los dos proyectos de 
nuevos C&#243;digos que se han elaborado. 
Estos documentos han sido analizados 
por el Poder Ejecutivo y se encuentran 
en condiciones de ser remitidos al 
Parlamento para su consideraci&#243;n. Sin 
embargo, se han advertido lagunas o 
vac&#237;os en las normas propuestas y por 
ello, el Ministerio del Interior con la 
cooperaci&#243;n financiera y t&#233;cnica del 
Programa de las Naciones Unidas para 
el Desarrollo, ha formulado la 
iniciativa de contar con una 
consultor&#237;a legal, especializada en 
derechos humanos, cuyo prop&#243;sito es 
completar el marco normativo penal y 
procesal penal propuesto, supliendo las 
carencias se&#241;aladas. Entre las 
carencias anotadas se encuentra la falta 
de formulaci&#243;n de un delito aut&#243;nomo 
de tortura, distinto del crimen de lesa 
humanidad previsto ya en la ley 
interna uruguaya, as&#237; otras conductas 
punibles contenidas en la definici&#243;n de 
malos tratos.

con reclusos, los que act&#250;an como

</p>
<p>ha considerado la creaci&#243;n de un 
Ministerio de Justicia. Las discusiones 
sobre una nueva institucionalidad, que 
podr&#237;a depender directamente del 
Poder Ejecutivo y estuviera constituida 
colegiadamente por las diversas 
agencias del Estado involucradas en la 
materia, parece ser el pr&#243;ximo paso, 
una vez atendida la &#8213;emergencia 
carcelaria&#8214; y la reducci&#243;n del 
hacinamiento. Sin embargo, se prev&#233; 
la creaci&#243;n de un Instituto Nacional de 
Rehabilitaci&#243;n, dentro del Ministerio 
del Interior, aunque con cierto grado 
de autonom&#237;a.  
- Hasta tanto, las &#250;nicas medidas 
materializadas, a trav&#233;s de la 
promulgaci&#243;n de la Ley N&#186; 18.667 &#8213;de 
Emergencia carcelaria&#8214;, de fecha 
13/7/2010, prev&#233; que, la faltante de 
recursos humanos que se adscriban al 
trato directo con la poblaci&#243;n, se 
superar&#225; con la creaci&#243;n de 1500 
nuevos cupos para funcionarios 
policiales. 
- Un aspecto preocupante ha sido la 
introducci&#243;n en el debate p&#250;blico a 
prop&#243;sito de la incorporaci&#243;n de 
funcionarios del Ministerio de Defensa 
en labores policiales. El Presidente 
Jos&#233; Mujica ha planteado su propuesta 
de que efectivos militares pasen a ser 
quienes realicen los controles de 
seguridad de las visitas, en el ingreso y 
egreso de los establecimientos 
carcelarios. Esta responsabilidad se 
sumar&#237;a a la ya asumida para la 
custodia de la seguridad perimetral. La

<p>esencialmente distinta de la Seguridad, 
resulta altamente preocupante, m&#225;xime 
cuando la reconversi&#243;n de estos roles 
estar&#225; dada por un &#8213;curso&#8214; de 
capacitaci&#243;n. El argumento para ello 
se asienta en la incapacidad del Estado 
para gestionar eficientemente 29 
establecimientos, hacinados, ruinosos 
y con serio d&#233;ficit de personal. 
 
<b>Gobierno:</b> Existe consenso sobra la 
necesidad de que el Instituto Nacional 
de Rehabilitaci&#243;n tenga 
responsabilidades en la gesti&#243;n de las 
medidas de privaci&#243;n de libertad en 
todo el pa&#237;s, y se integre por personal 
civil especializado sometido a un 
Estatuto espec&#237;fico. En este marco, y 
como mecanismos adecuados para 
favorecer el proceso de transici&#243;n, 
adem&#225;s de la creaci&#243;n de vacantes 
civiles en este nuevo escalaf&#243;n, se ha 
resuelto un paulatino traspaso de 
vacante desde el Escalaf&#243;n policial 
hacia el Escalaf&#243;n &#8213;S&#8214; (Penitenciario). 
El citado Escalaf&#243;n hab&#237;a sido creado 
por el art&#237;culo 48 de la ley 15.851 del 
14/12/1986 pero su puesta en 
funcionamiento no se hab&#237;a 
instrumentado hasta el presente. 
</p>
<p>(c) Dentro del nuevo ministerio, 
crear un cuerpo de guardias de 
prisiones bien entrenado y 
dotado de recursos que sustituya 
a los oficiales de polic&#237;a que 
actualmente desempe&#241;an esa 
funci&#243;n. La escasez de personal 
en los centros de reclusi&#243;n 
conduce a una falta de seguridad

 - Para los adolescentes privados de 
libertad existe una escasez cr&#243;nica

<p>cuerpos de mediaci&#243;n no violenta que

intra-carcelaria se multiplica 
exponencialmente debido a las 
condiciones materiales de vida 
(edilicias y de servicio), de 
interelacionamiento con los pares y la

- Existe una iniciativa para la creaci&#243;n 
del Escalaf&#243;n Penitenciario, el cual 
dote a los guardias de las c&#225;rceles de 
un estatuto propio diferenciado de lo

reestructurar el sistema de privaci&#243;n de

propuesta de que los centros

<b>Gobierno:</b> El Documento de 
Consenso Interpartidario, aprobado en 
agosto del 2010 plantea, reestructurar 
el sistema de privaci&#243;n de libertad 
tanto para adultos como para 
adolescentes, privilegiando las 
medidas alternativas o sustitutivas de 
la prisi&#243;n preventiva, incluida la 
propuesta de que los centros 
penitenciarios se ubiquen 
institucionalmente fuera de la &#243;rbita y 
gesti&#243;n de la polic&#237;a. En dicho marco y 
tomando en consideraci&#243;n que durante 
el a&#241;o 2010 dio comienzo la discusi&#243;n 
de la asignaci&#243;n presupuestal para los 
pr&#243;ximos cinco a&#241;os de gesti&#243;n, el 
mensaje y el proyecto de ley remitido 
por el Poder Ejecutivo a las C&#225;maras 
contiene disposiciones financieras que 
permiten asegurar el funcionamiento 
de una nueva institucionalidad. En 
efecto, est&#225; prevista la creaci&#243;n de

provienen de sectores hist&#243;ricamente 
desafiliados, segregados y 
estigmatizados. La justicia para ellos 
opera de una manera discriminadora, 
selectiva y con mayor punitividad. 
- En el caso de los adolescentes 
atendidos en la &#243;rbita de la libertad 
asistida (PROMESEC), se ha 
comprobado la eficiencia de las 
acciones ya que s&#243;lo el 2% de los

- Las l&#243;gicas instaladas no son avanzar 
en el terreno de las penas alternativas 
sino reproducir m&#225;s y mayor encierro, 
alimentando un circuito de 
reproducci&#243;n de la violencia.

abril se inaugur&#243; el Establecimiento El 
Molino, para el alojamiento de 
mujeres privadas de libertad con hijos 
nacidos en prisi&#243;n o en per&#237;odo de 
lactancia.  
- El primer sector del Establecimiento 
Punta Rieles podr&#225; albergar a 173 
presos, del Centro Nacional de 
Rehabilitaci&#243;n y del COMCAR. Al 
final de 2010 se espera contar con

de la ampliaci&#243;n de 250 plazas en el 
COMCAR y en la C&#225;rcel Las Rosas de

Fuentes no gubernamentales: Las 
condiciones generales de reclusi&#243;n no 
han cambiado, ya que hasta el

- El uso abusivo de la privaci&#243;n de

sostenida del sistema carcelario, 
desembocan en una de sus m&#225;s graves 
consecuencias: el hacinamiento que

<p>general del 138 % -que supera el l&#237;mite 
cr&#237;tico de 120%- 5 de los 29 
establecimientos de reclusi&#243;n registran 
&#237;ndices de entre el 173 % y el 301%. 
Bajo una superpoblaci&#243;n de tal 
magnitud, los impactos en la 
cotidianeidad son perversos, 
agrav&#225;ndose a&#250;n con la escasez, en el 
mejor de los casos, y la total ausencia 
en la mayor&#237;a de los otros, de 
alternativas socio-educativas, 
recreativas, culturales y  laborales que, 
colaboren hacia el proceso de 
resocializaci&#243;n y rehabilitaci&#243;n de las 
personas privadas de libertad. La 
incapacidad del sistema para proveer 
alternativas de formaci&#243;n y de trabajo, 
est&#225;n directamente vinculadas a la 
reincidencia en el delito, toda vez que, 
sin herramientas y  sin la 
incorporaci&#243;n de competencias 
sociales para la inserci&#243;n al egreso, 
seis de cada diez personas que han 
estado en prisi&#243;n, vuelven al sistema. 
Uruguay posee marcos legislativos 
importantes a los efectos de garantizar 
el ejercicio de los derechos al trabajo y 
a la educaci&#243;n de la poblaci&#243;n reclusa. 
- El ejercicio concreto de los derechos 
a la educaci&#243;n y al trabajo, en 
situaci&#243;n de privaci&#243;n de libertad, es 
sin embargo un gran debe. Seg&#250;n datos 
de la Direcci&#243;n de Desarrollo 
Penitenciario del Ministerio del 
Interior, el 45 % de la poblaci&#243;n 
reclusa, trabaja y/o estudia. Seg&#250;n 
estas cifras, alrededor de 2000 presos 
estudian y 998 trabajan en los 
establecimientos bajo la conducci&#243;n de 
la Direcci&#243;n Nacional de C&#225;rceles. </p>

<p>Aproximadamente 1.370 presos 
cumplen tareas laborales en las 
c&#225;rceles departamentales y en los 
establecimientos que dependen del 
Ministerio del Interior. Sin embargo, a 
trav&#233;s de la encuesta aplicada a una 
muestra estad&#237;sticamente 
representativa de 1300 personas 
privadas de libertad, s&#243;lo el 13 % dice 
estar trabajando, y de ese porcentaje, 
s&#243;lo el 7 % recibe a cambio una 
remuneraci&#243;n por la tarea. Esa 
remuneraci&#243;n, se operativiza 
solamente en las c&#225;rceles dependientes 
de la Direcci&#243;n Nacional de C&#225;rceles y 
en unas pocas dependientes del 
Subsistema de Jefaturas del Interior.  
- En cuanto a la educaci&#243;n, se han 
registrado avances significativos en los 
&#250;ltimos a&#241;os, incluyendo la 
generalizaci&#243;n de la ense&#241;anza 
primaria en la totalidad de los 
establecimientos. Al finalizar 2009, 
Educaci&#243;n Secundaria dispon&#237;a de 110 
docentes, distribuidos en 12 
establecimientos, para dictar clases de 
ciclo b&#225;sico y bachillerato. Quedan 
fuera de la cobertura sin embargo, 17 
establecimientos.  
- El m&#225;s serio d&#233;ficit detectado se 
encuentra en los procedimientos y la 
transparencia para la contabilizaci&#243;n 
de las medidas de redenci&#243;n de pena. 
Son numerosos los casos denunciados 
por personas privadas de libertad, que 
a la hora de asistir a una revista de la 
Suprema Corte de Justicia, constatan 
que los c&#243;mputos que all&#237; figuran, en

<p>tiempo trabajado o estudiado; y en 
otros muchos ni siquiera llegan al 
expediente los informes que acreditan 
que esa persona trabaja y/o estudia.  
- En muchos casos, cuando la medida 
de redenci&#243;n de pena se refiere al 
trabajo, si no media el peculio, el 
registro es nulo. La persona trabaja 
pues, adem&#225;s de sin percibir beneficio 
econ&#243;mico alguno por su tarea, sin 
tener la capacidad de acogerse al 
beneficio de la conmutaci&#243;n de la pena 
por trabajo.   
- El acceso al agua sigue siendo un 
problema central en diversos 
establecimientos. COMCARr, &#8213;Las 
Latas&#8214; en el Penal de Libertad, 
Canelones, Cabildo y Las Rosas 
(Maldonado), registran las situaciones 
m&#225;s graves. En algunos de estos 
centros, por ejemplo en Las Rosas, el 
suministro durante todo el a&#241;o se 
limita a dos horas diarias, distribuidas 
en dos turnos. Ese suministro se hace a 
trav&#233;s de un &#250;nico ca&#241;o de plastiducto 
por m&#243;dulo, a trav&#233;s del cual los 
reclusos deben llenar tarrinas para 
acopiar y administrar durante todo el 
d&#237;a. En Canelones, los cortes se 
producen frecuentemente, por razones 
no argumentadas desde las autoridades 
carcelarias, y preponderantemente en 
los meses de verano. En la c&#225;rcel 
femenina de Cabildo, el agua proviene 
de tanques de almacenaje, muy 
contaminados, por lo cual los &#237;ndices 
de potabilidad no son adecuados. A la 
escasez de suministro de agua se 
asocian problemas vinculados a la 
higiene personal y del ambiente, la </p>

tienen como veh&#237;culo el agua, lo cual 
en muchas ocasiones es factor adem&#225;s 
de generaci&#243;n de conflictos internos. 
- En relaci&#243;n con los menores, en 
hogares de la Colonia Berro (Sarand&#237;, 
Piedras y Ser), las pr&#225;cticas 
discrecionales para la conducci&#243;n de 
los adolescentes a los gabinetes 
sanitarios sigue siendo una constante. 
Los j&#243;venes contin&#250;an encerrados 24 
horas al d&#237;a, y a&#250;n necesitan evacuar 
sus necesidades fisiol&#243;gicas en 
condiciones inaceptables. 
- Los adolescentes s&#243;lo tienen acceso a 
actividades educativas o de ocio en 
algunos centros. En otros centros, los 
detenidos permanecen en sus celdas 
entre 20 y 22 horas por d&#237;a en general, 
incluso 24 horas en caso de castigo. La 
reinserci&#243;n social es casi inexistente. 
Existe tambi&#233;n la utilizaci&#243;n casi 
sistem&#225;tica de la violencia en contra de 
los adolescentes por parte de la polic&#237;a 
durante el arresto, motines o requisas, 
y por  parte de los guardias de manera 
cotidiana. En Puertas, Ser, Piedras y 
Ariel, la mayor&#237;a de las celdas tienen 
un dram&#225;tico nivel de insalubridad. 
- Para las mujeres, el traslado al actual 
centro de Rehabilitaci&#243;n 
descongestion&#243; en parte la c&#225;rcel de 
Cabildo. Sin embargo, esto ha 
acarreado nuevas complejidades, como 
la coexistencia de dos modelos de 
privaci&#243;n de libertad contrapuestos: el 
de CNR, gerenciado  por un equipo 
multidisciplinario y con un r&#233;gimen de 
m&#237;nima seguridad y el de la Direcci&#243;n

descongestionamiento de Cabildo fue 
transitorio, ya que debido al alto

nuevamente. El Hogar &#8213;Nuevo

Frente a un d&#233;ficit de 2000 plazas en el 
sistema, con una tasa de densidad 
global de 129% est&#225; previsto que entre 
finales del corriente a&#241;o e inicios del

cada una durante este per&#237;odo de

de un monto significativo de recursos

por representantes del citado &#243;rgano 
judicial y del Ministerio del Interior 
han elevado una propuesta de ley

- La realizaci&#243;n del derecho efectivo a 
la educaci&#243;n y el trabajo en el sistema 
carcelario constituye uno de los 
problemas m&#225;s graves. En el marco de 
los Acuerdos Interpartidarios, el 
documento de consenso aprobado 
establece que &#8213;se asegurar&#225; que toda 
persona privada de su li8bertad en 
cumplimiento de un disposici&#243;n 
judicial, pueda realizar tareas 
productivas y remuneradas 
(procurando el reconocimiento de sus 
tareas a los efectos previsionales en lo 
aplicable) as&#237; como formarse, estudiar 
y culminar sus estudios, lo que 
facilitar&#225; claramente la reinserci&#243;n del 
detenido. En dicho marco, se han 
iniciado contactos con el Ministerio de 
Trabajo y Seguridad Social para el 
desarrollo de un plan nacional de 
est&#237;mulo al trabajo de los reclusos y 
los reci&#233;n liberados.  
Este aspecto de la cuesti&#243;n constituye 
un eje b&#225;sico de la solicitud de 
cooperaci&#243;n formulada ante la Uni&#243;n 
Europea, ya que es intenci&#243;n del 
gobierno instalar emprendimientos 
productivos de distinto alcance en los 
centros penitenciarios como una 
estrategia de reinserci&#243;n social, 
desarrollo y est&#237;mulo de aptitudes y 
creaci&#243;n de alternativas &#250;tiles para la 
facilitaci&#243;n del egreso y la 
reintegraci&#243;n social. Actualmente se

<p><b><i>Fuentes no gubernamentales:</i></b>  Las

han clausurado. En esta &#250;ltima c&#225;rcel 
se prev&#233; el cierre del m&#243;dulo 5 y el 
m&#243;dulo 2. Los reclusos alojados en el 
primero ser&#225;n trasladados a la c&#225;rcel 
de Punta de Rieles, mientras que &#8211;la

- Se contin&#250;an recibiendo alegaciones 
de malos tratos y golpizas a 
adolescentes por parte de los 
funcionarios policiales que custodian 
los hogares. La violencia f&#237;sica se 
ejerce en general en las persecuciones 
que los funcionarios realizan durante 
las fugas y al momento de la detenci&#243;n 
de los j&#243;venes. A su vez, se ha 
constatado, a trav&#233;s de entrevistas con 
los j&#243;venes, que los mismos sufren 
graves maltratos y golpizas en los 
centros de detenci&#243;n transitorios. 
- En establecimientos donde se 
encuentran recluidas las mujeres, estos 
fen&#243;menos se agravan, ya que son 
doblemente estigmatizadas, toda vez 
que el sistema no est&#225; pensado en 
perspectiva de g&#233;nero ni contempla

<p>mecanismos y agencias como la

carcelaria no tiene condena, vencido 
adem&#225;s el plazo razonable y 
contrariamente al car&#225;cter excepcional 
del encarcelamiento cautelar. La 
jurisprudencia local ha establecido en 
diversos fallos que la prisi&#243;n 
preventiva es la regla, siendo 
excepcional la procedencia de la

Lucha contra la impunidad y

<p>(k) Enmendar el C&#243;digo Penal a 
fin de incluir la definici&#243;n de la 
tortura como delito 
independiente, en consonancia 
con lo dispuesto en los art&#237;culos 
1 y 4 de la Convenci&#243;n contra la 
Tortura. 
</p>
<p>- Seg&#250;n la Ley No. 18026 cualquier 
caso de tortura se considera un 
crimen de lesa humanidad.  
- La definici&#243;n de tortura abarca 
tambi&#233;n actos de trato cruel, 
inhumano o degradante.  
</p>
<p><b><i>Fuentes no gubernamentales</i></b> : La 
aprobaci&#243;n de la Ley No. 18026 
incluye el delito de tortura entre otros, 
lo que ha significado un avance 
sustantivo en la legislaci&#243;n. Sin 
embargo, la no inclusi&#243;n de la ley en el 
corpus del C&#243;digo Penal hace dif&#237;cil su 
aplicaci&#243;n pr&#225;ctica y no contempla 
casos de torturas de civiles y 
delincuentes comunes, es decir, que el 
delito de tortura no est&#225; tipificado 
como delito aut&#243;nomo. Asimismo el 
marco conceptual desde donde se 
enunci&#243; la ley se relaciona 
directamente con contextos 
autoritarios, totalitarios, etc., lo que 
podr&#237;a generar una lectura unilineal de 
la misma. En este sentido, la tortura en 
forma exclusiva y en forma excluyente 
se relaciona con las violaciones a los 
derechos humanos durante la &#250;ltima 
dictadura c&#237;vico-militar. El actual 
Gobierno ha expresado su voluntad de 
incluir el delito de tortura en la 
reforma del C&#243;digo Penal, pero ello 
a&#250;n no se ha concretado. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(l) Asegurar que todas las 
denuncias de tortura y malos 
tratos se investiguen 
minuciosamente y sin demora 
por una autoridad independiente 
que no tenga relaci&#243;n con la 
autoridad encargada de llevar la 
investigaci&#243;n o el enjuiciamiento 
del caso. 
</p>
<p>- La Direcci&#243;n de Asuntos Internos

de investigar dichas denuncias, 
aunque depende de la misma

Colonia Berro ha aumentado 
considerablemente desde 2005. En 
2009 se  incrementaron las horas 
docentes en la Escuela Educacional 
Dr. Roberto Berro. Las mismas 
sufrieron alguna interrupci&#243;n en 2009

la carga horaria de actividades. 
Asimismo, se logr&#243; elevar el tiempo de

Fuentes no gubernamentales: Si bien 
las actividades socio-educativas han 
aumentando considerablemente, no se

<p><b>Uzbekistan 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Follow-up to the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur (Theo van Boven) in the report of his visit to 
</b></p>
<p><b>Uzbekistan from 24 November to 6 December 2002 (E/CN.4/2003/68/Add.2) 
</b></p>
<p>150. By letter dated 22 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur sent the table below to the Government of the Republic of 
Uzbekistan, requesting information and comments on the follow-up measures taken with regard to the implementation of his 
predecessor&#8216;s recommendations. By letter dated 13 February 2012, the Government of Uzbekistan responded by providing 
information on the measures taken with regard to the implementation of the recommendations. The Special Rapporteur regrets that 
due to late submission of the Government&#8216;s response, it has not been possible to consider the information for the purpose of drafting 
the observations. 
</p>
<p>151. The Special Rapporteur observes that the definition of torture in the amended Criminal Code does not cover acts by &#8213;other 
persons acting in an official capacity&#8214; and lacks adequate penalties. He reiterates his concern about the reports on the use, by courts, 
of evidence obtained under coercion, including by torture.  
</p>
<p>152. The Special Rapporteur expresses concern at the reported allegations of acts of harassment and intimidation, of forcible and 
arbitrary removal of peaceful protesters, and of lack of a fair trial in the context of two peaceful assemblies held in Tashkent in late 
</p><p>2010. The Special Rapporteur calls upon the Government to launch prompt, impartial and thorough investigations into these cases 
and initiate public prosecutions, where the evidence warrants it. 
</p>
<p>153. The Special Rapporteur remains concerned at the reported detention on allegedly fabricated charges, arbitrary detention, 
confession obtained under torture, and the absence of information on the complaints of torture and ill-treatment received by the 
Ombudsman. He wishes to note that an effective and independent mechanism still remains to be established outside the procuracy 
to investigate all allegations of torture and ill-treatment promptly, independently and thoroughly and prosecute and punish the 
alleged perpetrators by means of criminal sanctions.  
</p>
<p>154. The Special Rapporteur echoes the concern expressed by the Human Rights Committee73 about the lack of full 
implementation of the right to habeas corpus and calls upon the Government to take steps to ensure that the amended legislation on 
habeas corpus is fully applied in practice.   
</p>
<p>155. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the consideration by the Office of the Prosecutor General of the question of ratification of 
the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and encourages the Government to make the declaration provided for in 
article 22 of the Convention recognizing the competence of the Committee against Torture to receive and consider communications 
from individuals who claim to be victims of a violation of the provisions of the Convention.

<p>156. Finally, the Special Rapporteur wishes to reiterate the request made in 2010 to conduct a follow-up visit to the country to 
make an assessment of the various legislative amendments and their practical implementation with regard to the fight against torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. </p>

<p>(a)The highest authorities 
need to publicly condemn 
torture.  They should declare 
unambiguously that they will 
not tolerate torture and 
similar ill-treatment by public 
officials and that those in 
command at the time abuses 
are perpetrated will be held 
personally responsible for the 
abuses.   
</p>
<p> <b>Government:</b> this recommendation has been fully 
implemented as reflected in numerous legislative, 
practical and judicial reforms, such as the prohibition of 
torture contained in article 26 of the 1992 Constitution, 
the accession to the Convention against Torture in 1995, 
the criminalization of torture by article 235 of the 
Criminal Code; the participation of the Parliament of 
Uzbekistan in the monitoring of the Convention against 
Torture; the Supreme Court resolutions of 19 December 
2003 and 24 September 2004 which excludes evidence 
obtained under torture, violence, threats, etc.; 
- The Supreme Court issued a resolution on 14 June 
2008 on &#8213;The courts&#8216; practice of the examination of 
criminal cases by judges related to torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8214;, 
which obliges judges to issue a separate decision in 
relation to the member of the law enforcement bodies 
who allegedly  committed the violation;  
- The concluding observations of the Committee against 
Torture were subject of sessions of a number of Senate 
Committees;  
- The Office of the General-Prosecutor held a session on 
the strengthening of the prosecutorial supervision 
(&#8215;nadzor&#8216;) in this regard; 
- The Ministry of Internal Affairs held a session in 2008 
during which questions of inadmissibility of coerced 
evidence were discussed; 
- In 2008, the office of the Prosecutor received 2222 
complaints in relation to unlawful actions by members 
of the law enforcement bodies (163 less then in 2007), 
among which 1643 concerned staff of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs, 7 regarding servants of the Security 
Service and 104 regarding judges. 104 of the complaints 
were related to allegations of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. 9 
criminal cases were opened against members of the law 
enforcement bodies; the concerned persons were

- Special units in charge of respect for human rights 
were created in the Ministry of Justice, the office of the 
Prosecutor General, and the Ministry of Interior, which 
deal with complains and petitions by citizens, including 
about torture;  
- The Prosecutor&#8216;s office, Ombudsman, the National 
Human Rights Centre and a number of international 
organizations and diplomatic missions monitor places of 
detention;  
- The 2004 National Action Plan against Torture guides 
anti-torture work. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The practice of torture and 
other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment 
or punishment was not condemned by the highest 
authorities or the media; Official state agencies and 
Government-controlled national media still avoid the 
word &#8213;torture&#8214; in their official documents or 
publications. Official public figures who are responsible 
for the investigation of criminal cases or handling of 
complaints and petitions on tortures or other forms of 
cruel treatment, do not feel personally responsible 
despite the legal prohibition of torture in the Criminal 
Code. Moreover, the practice of investigating criminal 
cases in the system of law-enforcement agencies of 
Uzbekistan, enormous influence of the so-called 
principle of &#8213;automatism&#8214; on the system of criminal 
proceedings in the country, in practice results in the 
following &#8211; in case a person is arrested, he/she should 
necessarily be accused, pass through the investigation, 
face the trial, be convicted, and sentenced to 
punishment.  
- Based on this approach, the highest officials encourage 
the use of torture in the system of criminal justice in 
order to obtain confessions as evidence.  
Concerning the 2004 National Action Plan against 
Torture, a set of formal actions were included. </p>

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  Since the successful 
performance of law enforcement bodies is measured by 
the number of resolved cases, torture remains the most 
frequent and widely practiced mean of obtaining 
confession in view of resolving cases. 
 
Government: Special human rights entities established 
within the Ministry of Justice, Office of the Prosecutor 
General, Ministry of Internal Affairs, are responsible for 
complaints on various human rights issues. In 2009, out 
of 3089 complaints received on unlawful activities of

2010) complaints were related to the use of torture and 
other unlawful forms of treatment. 6 (7 in 2010) 
criminal cases were filed against the members of law 
enforcement bodies who were subsequently removed 
from the office. 9 criminal cases were filed in 2008. 4 
employees of the law enforcement bodies were 
sentenced to various terms of imprisonment with 
charges of &#8213;intentionally causing body injury&#8214;. 
- Incidents of torture and other forms of cruel treatment 
committed by law enforcement bodies are being 
discussed during the board meetings of the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs and the Prosecutor General, in the 
Parliament and in the Plenum of the Supreme Court as 
well as during the sessions of the Interagency task-force

official authority, failing to act, neglecting official duty; 
4 members were accused of committing torture and

186 employees of the organs of internal affairs were

</p>
<p>(b)The Government should 
amend its domestic penal law 
to include the crime of torture 
the definition consistent with 
article 1 of the Convention 
against Torture and supported 
by an adequate penalty. 
</p>
<p>The prohibition of torture as 
contained in article 26 of 
the Constitution;  
Torture was not 
criminalized with 
commensurate penalties in 
criminal law.  
</p>
<p>- CAT/C/UZB/CO/3, para. 5 dated November 
2008 holds that: &#8213;While the Committee 
acknowledges the efforts made to amend 
legislation to incorporate the definition of 
torture of the Convention into domestic law, 
it remains concerned that in particular the 
definition in the amended article 235 of the 
Criminal Code restricts the prohibited 
practice of torture to the actions of law 
enforcement officials and does not cover acts 
by &#8213;other persons acting in an official 
capacity&#8214;, including those acts that result 
from instigation, consent or acquiescence of 
a public official and as such does not contain 
all the elements of article 1 of the 
Convention.&#8214;

<p> 
<b>Government:</b> In December 2008, an order was issued 
by the Ministry of Internal Affairs on the &#8213;Adoption of 
the Plan for major activities for the implementation of 
the National Action Plan for the implementation of the 
concluding observations of the Committee against 
Torture.&#8214;    
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   Article 235 of the 
Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan is 
practically not applied;  no official judicial proceedings 
have been conducted on the basis of article 235 of the

<p>- Torture is normally applied with the consent or at 
the request of higher officers, officials or other public 
figures; those who use tortures are encouraged, awarded 
or promoted in rank;  
- There have not been cases of exclusion of 
testimonies extorted under torture. 
 
<b>Government:</b> Under article 235 of the Criminal Code, 
torture and other forms of other cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment and punishment are criminally 
punishable acts.  
If the crime is committed by a person not belonging to 
law enforcement bodies, but with the knowledge of or 
with implicit consent of the investigator, interrogator or 
a staff of the organs of law enforcement, the action is 
qualified as aiding and abetting the use of torture and 
other forms of ill-treatment. If unlawful actions were 
used to obtain confession, the perpetrators are held 
accountable for obtaining evidence by torture. 
</p>
<p>(c)Amend the domestic penal 
law to include the right to 
habeas corpus. 
 
</p>
<p>No habeas corpus. <b>Government:  
</b>- Article 19 of the Constitution holds that the rights and 
freedoms of citizens are inviolable and only a court has 
the right to restrict them; 
- The institute of habeas corpus is being introduced in 
progressive stages. The adoption of the Presidential 
Decree of 2005 &#8213;On the transfer of the right to sanction 
pre-trial detention to the courts&#8214; was followed by the 
adoption of new legislation on 11 July 2007 which 
amended, inter alia, articles 18 and 29 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code and article 10 of the Law on Judges. In 
addition, according to the amended article 243 of the 
Criminal Procedure Code, judges are now obliged to 
issue: 1) a decision about the pre-trial detention; 2) deny 
the pre-trial detention or 3) extend the period of custody 
for up to 48 hours for the parties to present additional 
evidence.

<p>protection of the constitutional rights and freedoms in 
criminal procedures. First, it only allows pre-trial 
detention for premeditated crimes for which the foreseen 
sentence is higher than 3 years or for crimes by 
negligence with a sentence higher than 5 years. Second, 
the amended legislation provides that the two parties 
(prosecutor and detained person as well as his/her 
defence counsel) must be present in the judicial 
deliberations on the decision regarding measures for pre-
trial detention. Third, the maximum period of remand in 
custody is 72 hours, which can be extended for another 
48 hours on the request of both parties. Fourth, the 
decision of the court to adopt measures for detention in 
remand can be appealed to a court within 72 hours of the 
adoption of the decision. The maximum period for 
detention pending investigation is 3 months, which can 
be extended by the court by 5 months upon request of 
the prosecutor of the department, by 7 months by the 
Deputy Prosecutor-General, by 9 months by the 
Prosecutor-General, by 1 year by the Prosecutor-General 
in case of serious difficulties in the investigation. In 
2008, 453 individuals were released from custody. In the 
period of 6 months in 2009, 240 individuals were 
released from custody: 127 by the investigators, 77 by 
the court and 36 by prosecutors. In the same period in 
2008, 216 individuals were released from custody.  
- The proposal to shorten the maximum period of 
custody from 72 hours to 48 hours is being considered. 
- Article 286 of the Administrative Code holds that 
relatives and the lawyer of any detained person have to 
be informed of the arrest. Article 294 provides for the 
right of a person under administrative detention to legal 
aid at any moment, starting from his/her arrest. Article 
297 describes in detail the rights of lawyers to 
familiarize themselves with case materials, to file 
petitions and complaints.

<p>improve following the introduction of habeas corpus 
because the judges issue the sanctions to detain based on 
instructions of officials from the executive branch; in 
99% of all cases the requests by prosecutors to sanction 
pre-trial detention are granted by courts;  
- The court does not have the right to verify the 
legality of detention; the reconsideration of the decision 
of the court can be done only through an appeal within 3 
days, i.e. the detainee does not have the right to 
periodically apply to a court within reasonable time 
periods asking for the detention order to be revoked; the 
participation of the lawyer at this stage is not mandatory; 
the hearings are conducted in closed sessions; 
- The judge who considers the detention request of 
the prosecutor has the right to consider the criminal case 
concerning the same individual in all instances; 
- Article 286 of the Administrative Code is not applied, 
relatives and friends of the detained persons are usually 
not notified, in some cases the lawyers are not allowed 
to be present in the courts.

<p>the case. If the defendant is under arrest, the defence is 
entitled to have a private appointment without any 
restriction as to the frequency and duration of the 
appointment and without asking for permission from 
public officials. 
 
With a view of ensuring the independence of defence, 
norms providing written permission for participation in 
the case or permission for appointment are excluded 
from the judicial process.  
For any form of influence on defence, an administrative 
liability is established.  
Article 243 of the Criminal Procedural Code provides 
the order of the use of pre-trial detention measures. 
Preventive measures in a form of pre-trial detention 
might be applied only in relation to the suspect in 
custody or any person involved as witness.  
The request on the application of measures for pre-trial 
detention is being considered in a closed judicial session 
attended by prosecutor, defence counsel, the suspect or 
accused, over the period of 12 hours from the moment of 
receipt of documents and no later than the last day of 
detention.  
The decision of the court to admit or decline the use of 
pre-trial detention measure enters into force from the 
moment of its adoption and is subject to immediate 
execution. Under article 241 of the Criminal Procedural 
Code, the decision can be appealed to a court. The Court 
of appeal can approve or revoke the court decision on 
the use of pre-trial measures of detention within 3 days. 
The appeal or protest itself does not prevent the 
implementation of the decision of the court.

<p>(d)Take necessary measures 
to establish and ensure the 
independence of the judiciary 
in conformity with 
international standards and to 
ensure respect for the 
principle of the equality of 
arms between the prosecution

proceedings. 
 
</p>
<p>Although granted by law, in 
practice the judiciary was 
not fully independent. 
</p>
<p>- CAT/C/UZB/CO/3, para. 19: &#8213;The Committee remains 
concerned that there is a lack of security of tenure of 
judges, that the designation of Supreme Court judges 
rests entirely with the Presidency, and that lower level 
appointments are made by the executive which re-
appoints judges every five years.&#8214;  
 
<b>Government:</b> The independence of judges is guaranteed 
by the Constitution and by the Law on &#8213;Courts&#8214;; the 
only basis for a judicial decision is the law and that no 
outside interference is permitted; the governing 
principles are objectivity, justice, transparency, 
openness and equality of the parties;  
- The &#8213;Concept note on the deepening of judicial 
reform&#8214; led to amendments to several laws to ensure the 
effective implementation of the transfer of sanctioning 
of pre-trial detention to courts; 
- The material basis of general courts has been 
improved;  
- Regulations on &#8213;Guaranteeing the right to legal 
defence of detained, suspected and accused persons&#8214;;  
- At present, the equality between the prokuratura and 
the lawyer exist in practice in judicial procedures. The 
President issued an order on 23 June 2008 on &#8213;The 
educational research centre on democratisation and the 
liberalisation of the court legislation and the respect for 
the independence of the judicial system&#8214;. First, a 
separate information, analytical and consultative body 
was established within the system of the Supreme Court, 
which works on the development of the judicial-legal 
reform. The Centre is also in charge of monitoring the 
courts&#8216; practice and elaborates proposals for the 
improvement of the justice system. The Centre initiated 
a series of legislative proposals such as the 
strengthening of the powers of the lawyer in the criminal 
trial, the improvement of the execution of judicial

<p>decisions and the limitation of the powers of the 
prokuratura in the areas of the supervision (&#8215;nadzor&#8216;) 
over the investigation of criminal cases. 
- In 2008, the prokuratura sent 14407 criminal cases in 
relation to 21865 individuals to the courts which 
included an accusation; it closed 1088 cases in relation 
to 199 individuals and sent 415 cases in relation to 495 
individuals to the courts where the parties have reached 
an agreement. The Ministry of Internal Affairs, opened 
30343 cases in relation to 38890 individuals; it closed 
2149 cases in relation to 449 individuals and sent 9879 
cases in relation to 10430 individuals to the courts where 
the parties have reached an agreement.    
Non-governmental sources:  The courts in practice do 
not perform the task of impartial, full and objective 
consideration of complaints and petitions of defendants 
in respect of torture or other similar forms of treatment / 
punishment during the pre-trial period of the criminal 
proceeding in contravention of provisions of the Law 
&#8213;On courts&#8214;. 
- One of the reasons for this situation is the involvement 
of the President in the appointment of judges of all 
levels (article 63 parts 1-4 of the Law &#8213;On courts&#8214;) as 
well as appointment of judges for a comparatively short 
period of five years (article 63 part 5 of the Law). 
Though the law guarantees the independence of the 
judiciary (articles 67 &#8211; 74 of the Law), judges realize 
that their time in office would not be prolonged in case 
they &#8213;offend&#8214; the government.  
- In practice it is very difficult to find judges who act in 
accordance with the law in pronouncing their verdicts; 
cases are considered with an accusative bias and very 
often the verdicts of the courts repeat the accusations, 
sometimes including spelling mistakes and misprints 
contained therein. The judges demonstrate with all their 
appearance that nothing depends on them, they can not 
deliver an objective and legal judgment due to the fact 
that the &#8213;case is under control&#8214;, and the judgment of </p>

<p>acquittal will be either repealed due to the mildness of 
the sentence by way of supervision on the basis of the 
protest issued by the higher level prosecutor or court, or 
within one year after its coming into. 
- The material status of judges of general jurisdiction has 
partially improved; but the status of social protection to 
judges does not correspond to their position. 
 
<b>Government:</b> The functional independence of judiciary 
is guaranteed by the Constitution and the Law on 
&#8213;Courts&#8214;. With a view of strengthening the 
independence of judiciary, a Commission on the 
selection and recommendation for the position of judges 
was established. The Commission is composed of 
judges, members of Oliy Majlis, academicians and 
jurists, members of the law enforcement bodies and 
NGOs. The upper house of the Parliament selects judges 
of the Supreme Court and Supreme Economic Court 
upon the presentation of the President. The regional, 
district and other judges are appointed by the President.  
- The outcome of the Review of the Universal Periodic 
Review on Uzbekistan adopted on 21 August 2009, 
provides measures to further strengthen the 
independence of judges through examining the practice 
of appointment of judges and conducting survey among 
judges on the issues of appointment of judges.  
- In accordance with the redrafted Law on &#8213;Courts&#8214;, the 
judicial system was separated from the organs of 
executive branch. The Ministry of Justice is not involved 
in presenting candidates for the position of judges, 
dismissal or early termination of power.  
- A High Qualification Commission under the President 
was established to deal with the organizational issues of 
the judiciary, including the selection and 
recommendation of candidates for the position of 
judges.  
A department on the execution of judicial decisions was 
established to provide material-technical and financial </p>

<p>support for the activities of judges. Specialization of 
judges of general jurisdiction was carried out; courts 
dealing with criminal and civil cases were established.  
- The Centre for the professional qualification of judges, 
operating under the Ministry of Justice, incorporated the 
issues on the application of article 235 of the Criminal 
Code in the training curriculum for induction and 
professional development of judges. Special manuals 
were developed for judges and employees of justice 
sector on the issues of examination of complaints related 
to torture.  
Lectures are organized for judges on the issues of 
international human rights treaties and international 
cooperation of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the area of 
human rights. 
- In December 2009, a human rights Resource centre 
was established. 
In early 2010, a number of practical seminars on the 
issues of international standards in the area of execution 
of justice were organized together with the Ministry of 
Justice, Supreme Court and Research Centre within the 
Supreme Court.

Majlis of the Republic of Uzbekistan&#8214;;  
- With regard to each allegation of torture or other illegal 
methods of interrogation, a thorough examination has to 
be conducted including a medical-legal examination. 
Depending on the results, appropriate steps have to be 
taken (art. 15 of the Criminal-Procedure Code); judges 
examine all allegations closely;  
- Ministry of Interior Decree No. 334 of 18 December 
2003 created a complaints system; Special inspection 
units have been put in charge of investigating torture 
allegations; they are independent and they may involve 
civil society representatives; The &#8213;Unit on Respect for

<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   When the Office of the 
Ombudsman receives torture complaints, the latter are 
referred to the agencies accused of the torture for 
investigation;  
- Judges do not take appropriate steps when they receive 
allegations of torture and illegal methods of 
interrogation; 
  - Order &#8470; 334 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs dated 
18 December 2003 is not operational. The groups that 
investigate cases of torture do not allow for any  
involvement of civil society or representatives of the 
International Committee of the Red Cross; 
- Usually the report of the Government to the Human 
Rights Committee contains 3 or 4 cases which confirm 
massive absence of such cases &#8211; the reports are 
submitted with some periodicity once in 4 or 5 years i.e. 
the figures speak for themselves.  
- The human rights units established in the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Justice 
act formally, there is no established practice of regular 
cooperation or partnership with human rights groups or 
non-governmental non-commercial organizations in 
terms of revealing cases of tortures and bringing 
officials to account.  
- The &#8213;Regulation on the procedure of ensuring the 
protection of rights of detained, suspected and accused 
persons at the stage of pre-trial and trial investigation&#8214; 
provides that the detained persons have the right to

<p>as to the right of having confidential meeting with their 
lawyers. However, the Regulations signed by the Chief 
Investigation Department of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs jointly with the Bar Association of Uzbekistan 
were initially launched as a joint project. This pilot 
project covered only the capital of Uzbekistan i.e. 
Tashkent. Currently this project is no longer working. 
- According to the official statements, the Government 
of Uzbekistan has recently formed new divisions within 
several key ministries (Department on human rights with 
the Ministry of Justice, Commission on human rights 
with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Division on human 
rights and international norms with the Office of the 
Prosecutor General of the Republic of Uzbekistan).  
- The newly established Department on Human Rights 
with the Ministry of Justice of Uzbekistan was created 
with the same purpose of receiving individual 
complaints on alleged cases of human rights violations, 
including alleged case of torture.  
- Nevertheless, all these measures above remain of a

<p>structures operate on the basis of internal rules and 
regulations, which are usually not published and 
therefore rarely accessible to persons outside these

information on measures and mechanisms of internal 
control in respect of behavior and discipline of the staff 
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and National Security 
Service.  
 
The new ministerial regulations on human rights as well 
as ministries themselves both seriously lack 
transparency in their activities. Moreover, the staff of 
these subdivisions does not have specialized 
professional training for the receipt and handling 
complaints and petitions relating to the facts of torture 
and other violations of human rights. They are 
overloaded with other tasks, as many of them are still </p>

Non-governmental sources: The procuracy has the 
authority to supervise the activities of all actors of 
judicial process, including judges, while it remains 
under the sole supervision of the superior prosecutor. 
Other bodies are hardly capable to uphold cases of 
torture independently and promptly. 
 
<b>Government:</b> According to article 4 of the Law on 
&#8213;Procuracy&#8214;, the organs of procuracy carry out state 
prosecution in the examination of criminal cases, 
participate in the consideration of civil cases and cases 
of administrative offences and examination of judicial 
acts inconsistent with the law. The procuracy does not 
have authority to supervise the activities of courts.    
- The Law of 10 April 2009 on &#8213;Amending and 
supplementing several legislative acts with a view of 
improving the activities of the Human Rights 
Commissioner of the Oliy Majlis (Ombudsman)&#8214;, 
strengthens the authority of the Ombudsman in the 
criminal-procedural and criminal-executive legislation. 
According to article 14 of the above law, during the 
examination of complaints and monitoring of human 
rights violations, the Ombudsman is allowed to meet and 
talk to person in custody. Relevant amendments to 
article 216 of the Criminal Procedural Code and article 
18, 40 and 79 of the Criminal Administrative Code were 
made to this effect. Additional amendments to the 
Criminal Administrative Code allow the Ombudsman to 
visit without any obstacles places of detention either by 
his/her own initiative or upon receiving a complaint. The 
Ombudsman and his regional representatives carry out 
regular monitoring in places of detention. From 
November 2009 to November 2010, the Ombudsman 
and his representative visited 2 medical treatment 
facilities in the system of execution of punishment, 
Zangiatinskaya correctional colony and 3 investigation 
isolators. In 2009, the percentage of complaints received </p>

Ombudsman, 886 complaints have been taken under 
monitoring and 115 were resolved. In 2009, the 
estimated percentage of positively resolved appeals was 
13% of all appeals transmitted by the Ombudsman.  
Complaints received from persons under detention, as 
well as from their relatives were related to the issues of 
their transfer to another detention facility, granting 
amnesty, allowing access to medical treatment. In the 
2010 financial year, out of 48 complaints received from 
persons currently detained, 31 complaints were taken 
under scrutiny, and 4 complaints were considered on 
merits.

<p>(f)Any public official indicted 
for abuse or torture should be 
immediately suspended from 
duty pending trial.  
</p>
<p>No suspensions. <b>Government:</b> articles 256, 257, and 266 of the Criminal 
Procedure Code provide for dismissal of public officials 
accused of torture.  
- Disciplinary punishments are common; some criminal 
cases opened; 
- In 2008, as a result of an examination by organs of the 
&#8215;prokuratura&#8216; of complaints of alleged cases of torture 
by members of the law-enforcement bodies, 9 criminal 
cases were initiated. After the indictments, the 
respective members of the law-enforcement bodies were 
suspended from their functions in compliance with 
existing legislation. 
 
Non-governmental sources:   
- Impunity is wide-spread; reprisals against 
complainants and intimidation is wide-spread;  
- Articles 256, 257 and 266 of the Criminal and

do not suspend officials accused of torture;

- Practically there were no cases when an official 
accused of using torture, was suspended from the case 
and performing his responsibilities. The so called 
principle of protecting the &#8213;esprit de corps&#8214; is in 
operation. 
- There are many cases in practice, when an officer who 
used torture remains in the same unit of the law 
enforcement agency and continues pressing the victim of 
torture and his/her relatives (for example, through 
regular home visits, visits to the hospital as well as 
making regular telephone calls) for the purpose of 
withdrawal of their complaint on torture. Independent 
observers and human rights activists have a lot of 
information confirming frequent cases when an officer 
of law enforcement agencies, especially the prison 
guards in the colonies of the penitentiary institutions in 
Uzbekistan, are covertly encouraged to use torture 
against the arrested and convicted persons, but they are 
asked to do that &#8213;carefully&#8214; in order to avoid traces of 
torture so that the victim would never let anybody know 
about the facts of torture. The victims of tortures and 
their relatives very often say that the officers of law-
enforcement agencies that used torture receive 
promotion and continue their service in the same system.  
- Upon receipt of a complaint or petition on torture, the 
management of law-enforcement agency traditionally 
does its best not to accept or register such complaint, 
stating that the facts in the complaint are not true, as this 
is the intention of an arrested / suspected / accused 
person to avoid punishment. This irresponsible approach 
towards the complaints on cases of torture is very 
frequently observed among judges. At best, when the 
traces of torture are visible and they are properly 
documented by the defense, disciplinary proceedings are 
launched against the officer who used torture, or the 
criminal case is launched on the basis of articles 205 and 
206 (&#8213;Abuse of authority&#8214; and &#8215;Misuse of authority&#8214;) of </p>

torture or the defense on the initiation of a criminal 
prosecution on the basis of article 235 (torture) of the 
Criminal Code in 99.9% of cases remain not satisfied. 
 
<b>Government:</b> In 2009, the organs of procuracy 
registered 3089 (2222 in 2008) complaints about 
unlawful activities of members of law enforcement 
bodies. 146 (104 in 2008) complaints out of 3089 were 
related to the use of torture and other forms of ill-
treatment. During the examination of complaints with 
respect to 10 employees of the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, 7 criminal cases (9 cases in 2008) were initiated 
under article 235 of the Criminal Code. During the 
inspection carried out by the organs of procuracy in 
2009 and in the period of 9 months in 2010, 13 criminal

<p>General Prosecutor, and the Ministry of Justice in order 
to take joint measures for the protection of the rights of 
individuals deprived of liberty. In September 2008, a 
Human Rights Unit was established within the system of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs and their territorial 
departments which are called upon to examine 
allegations of human rights violations by staff of the 
organs of internal affairs, including complaints about 
torture. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The unit &#8214;On protection of 
human rights&#8214; created with the Ministry of Internal 
Affairs in 2007 is ineffective;  
- Responding to this recommendation the Government 
claims that &#8213;In 2007 the Ministry of Internal Affairs 
approved the &#8213;Program of actions&#8214; for the purpose of 
eliminating all violations in the area of human 
resources&#8214;. This program remains on paper as there is no 
coordination of the efforts of involved agencies as well 
as responsibility for non-implementation of activities 
envisaged by the program. The agencies have their own 
units of control over the performance of their officers, 
but one can not speak of the efficiency of their activity, 
as the professional achievements and effectiveness of a 
law-enforcement agency are assessed not on the basis of 
the number of complaints / petitions on tortures that 
were considered by this agency and acted upon, but on 
the basis of the number of criminal cases properly 
handled by this agency and the number of accused 
persons subsequently sentenced. Such an attitude is 
subsequently replicated in the behaviour and 
professional activity of officials and staff of the law 
enforcement agencies.  
 
<b>Government:</b> Once in every 10 days, the members of 
the prosecutor&#8216;s office review the lawfulness of holding 
detainees in temporary isolators. Public prosecutors

<p>review the complaints of detainees.  
- The Ombudsman is authorised to  investigate cases of 
grave human rights violations, including cases of torture 
in relation to the activities of procuracy and Ministry of 
Internal Affairs.  
 
In 2010, the employees of the human rights department 
at the Ministry of Internal Affairs considered 2442 
complaints, out of which 5 complaints were related to 
human rights violations of detainees, 14 were on the 
issues of torture and ill-treatment, 12 were related to the 
failure of authorities to act, 17 were on illegal arrest or 
detention, 17 were on holding liable innocent persons, 
29 were on human rights violations of citizens, 48 were 
related to abuse of power, 43 were on neglect of official 
duty, 52 were about exceeding power and official 
powers, 155 were related to violating the law on the 
treatment of citizens, 2050 were about other illegal 
activities committed by the employees of organs of 
internal affair.  
Out of 2442, 1882 or 77% were not justified, and 
criminal cases were initiated in relation to 358 (14.6%) 
complaints related to 49 employees. Administrative 
disciplinary measures were applied to other employees.  
During 2010-2011, the Ombudsman and the Ministry of 
Internal Affairs in collaboration with international 
organisations will be holding seminars and conferences 
on issues of the protection of human rights through 
increasing human rights culture in the activities of law 
enforcement bodies.

- Amendments to the Administrative Code of December 
2005 strengthen the transparency of NGOs and seek to 
reinforce their responsibility for the implementation of 
their own statutes to ensure that the State can take legal 
action against persons or organisations that violate 
national legislation; 
- On 13 December 2004, the ICRC decided to stop their 
visits; although the Uzbek side has asked them to take 
up the visits again, the ICRC so far has denied to do so;  
- In 2008, the ICRC has conducted 19 visits to colonies

<p>international and local NGOs and media have not been 
allowed to visit the places of detention;  
- Order &#8470; 346 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs  
is ineffective, the applications for visits by family 
members  are often left without response; 
- There is also lack of access by the independent 
doctors to inmates in order to reveal traces of torture; 
- The system of execution of punishment is under 
the control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs if 
Uzbekistan. The Government claims that &#8213;the Ministry 
of internal affairs has issued the order No 268 dated 
October 8, 2004 &#8215;On the Approval of Instructions with 
regard to a model agreement on cooperation between 
institutions and organs of the penitentiary system with 
NGOs&#8216;. According to the Government, based on this 
model agreement on cooperation between the NGOs and 
penitentiary institutions, the NGOs and other 
independent observers have the opportunity to visit the 
colonies of the system of execution of punishment. 
- This statement is far from the reality. This model 
agreement was never published, the NGOs and 
independent ob-servers willing to visit penitentiary 
institutions of Uzbekistan are not aware of this 
agreement and were never informed. Currently the 
penitentiary system of Uzbekistan remains completely 
closed and not accessible to the independent observers 
from the international organizations, NGOs and human 
rights groups.

visits were carried out by the representatives of state 
bodies, NGOs and mass media, compared to 56 visits 
carried out by national and international organisations in 
2009. The ICRC delegates visited 51 colonies in 2010,

19 December 2003 implements this recommendations, 
i.e. any investigator, prosecutor or judge has to ask each 
person coming from a place of detention how he/she was 
treated during investigation and interrogation;  
- In accordance with Prosecutor General&#8216;s order no. 41 
of 31 May 2004, the prosecutor, when sanctioning 
arrest, must question the suspected or accused person 
and ask about whether or not any forms of torture or ill-
treatment were used by the investigator or anybody else 
to extract a confession. 
- The Supreme Court issued a resolution on 14 June 
2008 on &#8213;The courts&#8216; practice of the examination of 
criminal cases by judges related to torture and other 
cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment&#8214;, 
which obliges judges to issue a separate decision in 
relation to the member of the law enforcement bodies 
who allegedly committed the violation. 
Non-governmental sources:  Judges do not observe the 
presumption of innocence in pronouncing verdicts;

<p>- Judges, prosecutors and investigators do not 
apply article 17 of the Criminal and Criminal 
Procedure Codes;

<p>- Investigators, prosecutors and judges do not 
ask persons arriving from the places of

investigation and interrogation since the 
Resolution of the Plenary of the Supreme 
Court is not the law, but only a

&#8213;Schedule of interrogation in court&#8214; says the 
following: &#8213;The interrogation of the accused 
person starts with the proposal of the 
chairperson to give evidence on the aspects 
of the case which were known to this person. 
After that the accused person is being 
interrogated by the public prosecutor, civic 
prosecutor, as well as the complainant, the 
civil claimant, and their representatives, the 
defence attorney, the civic defence attorney, 
the civil defendant and his representative&#8214;. 
In general, investigation and proceedings in 
court are conducted with an accusatory bias. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> In accordance with Article 23 of the 
Criminal Procedural Code, the person is innocent until 
proved guilty by the court. The person is not obliged to 
prove his or her innocence. All suspicions in the course 
of judicial investigation, if not approved, will be 
delivered in favour of the suspect.

State party that confessions under torture have been used 
as a form of evidence in some proceedings, and 
notwithstanding the Supreme Court&#8216;s actions to prohibit 
the admissibility of such evidence, the Committee 
remains concerned that the principle of non-
admissibility of such evidence is not being respected in 
every instance.&#8214;

Criminal Procedure Code, an instruction for the staff of 
the Prosecutor&#8216;s Office was elaborated, which provides

<p>Procedure Legislation on Admission of Proof&#8214; of 24 
September 2004 prohibits the use of evidence obtained 
by any illegal means of investigation; 
- Between 2004 and 2007 about 50 criminal cases were 
returned for additional investigation because the 
evidence was excluded as having been obtained under 
torture, violence or deceit;  
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:

<p>- Allegations of torture by the accused and 
their lawyers are routinely ignored by 
judges;

<p> Prosecutors interrogate the suspected and accused in the

is the main document which regulates criminal 
proceedings, it does not contain any direct prohibition 
on the use of evidence exerted under torture as a proof. 
Article 3 of the Resolution of the Plenary of the 
Supreme Court &#8213;On the application of certain norms of 
criminal and procedural legislation in respect of the 
admission of proof&#8214; dated 24 September 2004, prohibits 
the use of proofs obtained illegally. The Resolution of 
the Plenary of the Supreme Court No 17 of 2003 also 
says that the evidence received by means of torture, 
force, threat, deceit or any other cruel and degrading 
human dignity treatment, other illegal means as well as 
in violation of the rights of the suspect, can not be 
presented as the basis for the accusation. Moreover, in 
accordance with this Regulation, the investigator, 
prosecutor and judge should ask the person delivered 
from the pre-trial prison or the detention centre how 
he/she was treated there. Each complaint of a person 
brought from the pre-trial prison or the detention centre 
on torture or any other illegal method of investigation, 
should be fully checked and verified including through 
the medical and legal examination. Based on the results 
of this study, appropriate decisions should be taken, </p>

<p>confirmed. The examined judicial practice of the 
criminal cases revealed that in 2008, only in two cases 
violations of the right to defence were established. In 
those cases, the judicial decision was declared void and 
sent for additional investigation or a new procedure.     
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   Judges continue to ignore 
torture complaints in practice. Available information 
shows that in 99% of cases the judges tend to think that 
complaints/ petitions relating to torture and ill-treatment 
by accused persons are attempts to escape justice. The 
Criminal and Criminal Procedure Codes do not contain a 
norm prohibiting the use of evidence obtained in a 
detention facility of the National Security Service or the 
Ministry of Internal Affairs in the absence of a lawyer or 
not confirmed in the presence of a judge. The response 
of the Government to the recommendation (k) of the UN 
Special Rapporteur refers to an order of the Prosecutor 
General as well as the Resolution of the Plenary of the 
Supreme Court of Uzbekistan, which are not laws and 
have only the character of recommendations. 
 
<b>Government:</b> According to the National Plan of Action 
on the implementation of the recommendations of the 
UN Committee on Human Rights, the question of 
improving the practices of investigative activities (e.g., 
interrogations) through video and audio taping will be

criminal cases, describe mechanisms for 
providing free legal aid, establish a 
procedure for renouncing defence counsel, as 
well as a procedure for filing complaints 
about violations of the right to legal defence. 
</p>
<p>- By amended legislation of 31 December 2008, the 
rights of detained, suspected or convicted persons were 
strengthened. The amended provisions of the Criminal 
Procedural Code now provide, inter alia, for the right of 
the suspected person to know with what he/she is 
charged; the right to make phone calls or otherwise 
inform a lawyer or a relative of the arrest and the place 
of detention; to have a defense lawyer and to meet with 
him/her in person confidentially with no limitation in 
numbers and the right to request for the first 
interrogation not later then 24 hours after the arrest. The 
amended provisions also guarantee that the defence 
lawyer have access to the case at all stages of the 
criminal trial and in case of a detained person from the 
moment of the factual arrest. A number of other rights of 
the defense counsel are provided by the amended 
legislation.  
- Access to relatives or other persons, with the exception 
of the defence counsel, is only granted with written 
permission of the respective investigator. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   Arrest protocols are often 
issued in violation of the prescribed time limits, as the 
Criminal and Criminal Procedure Codes provide that 
they should be composed immediately after the delivery 
of the person to the law-enforcement agency; following 
the issuing of the protocol, access to a lawyer is granted. 
It is difficult to prove this, since the court, when 
sanctioning the arrest,  does not have the power to check 
the legality of detention and release the person in case it 
determines that the detentions was illegal; 
- Nobody has the opportunity to check whether the </p>

moment of calling the witness, a joint decree ensuring 
the requirements of the above law was signed by the 
General Prosecutor&#8216;s Office, Ministry of Internal 
Affairs, National Security Service, States Customs 
Committee and Ministry of Justice.

<p><b>Government:</b> On 8 June 2005, the Minister of Justice 
issued decree No. 92 &#8213;On Perfecting the Bar&#8216;s 
Functioning&#8214; to improve the training of defence lawyers 
by introducing amendments to the law &#8213;On the Bar&#8214;; 
</p>
<p>- In 2006/2007, 78 defence lawyers were 
trained in the Ministry of Justice&#8216;s training 
centre; seminars on criminal justice are 
regularly being held for prosecutors at 
Tashkent State Juridical Institute; also the 
Institute of the National Security Service 
contributes to the up-grading of the 
qualifications of future defence lawyers; 
</p>
<p>- Numerous seminars for staff members of 
law-enforcement organs were held;  
</p>
<p>- Amendments in the Law on Lawyers made 
in December 2008 strengthen the right of the 
individual to professional legal assistance. 
The amendments include: (1) the creation of 
a Chamber of Defence lawyers with 
mandatory membership which replaces the

<p>A Chamber of Defence lawyers was 
established with territorial branches in 
the Republic of Karakalpakstan,

<p> 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The reform of the bar 
effectively deprived the lawyers of their independence; 
the Chamber of defense lawyers with mandatory 
membership which was established instead of the Bar 
Association was turned into a quasi-ministry or sort of a 
department with the Ministry of Justice. The Chamber 
and the Ministry have the right of oversight over the

have the right to make a submission for the purpose of 
cancelling a lawyer&#8216;s license.

<p>and security departments of the prison administration of 
the Ministry of Internal Affairs participated. UNODC 
had requested judges and prosecutors to also participate 
in the training, but this request did not receive a positive 
response from the Uzbek authorities.  
- The training was guided by the provisions of the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman 
or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. The medical 
specialists received training on the medical aspects of 
torture prevention, detection, assessment and 
documentation, based on the &#8213;Manual on the Effective 
Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
(The Istanbul Protocol).  Prison staff received training 
on selected prison management topics, related to the 
prevention of ill-treatment and torture. The main 
training tool used for this element of the training was &#8213;A 
Human Rights Approach to Prison Management, 
Handbook for Prison Staff&#8214;, published by the 
International Centre for Prison Studies.   
- Following this training a request was received from the 
Main Department of Execution of Penalties (GUIN) to 
conduct a follow up training activity to cover all regions 
of Uzbekistan.  UNODC submitted a project proposal 
for discussion, which includes a nation-wide training on 
the prevention, detection, documentation and assessment 
of torture, for prison staff, prison medical staff, Ministry 
of Health forensic experts, as well as judges and 
prosecutors. 
 - In general, educational activities are rather of a one-
time character, very often they are formal and do not 
really influence the mentality of the staff of law-
enforcement agencies;  
- An analysis of educational activities and courses which 
are regularly organized for law-enforcement officers 
shows that these activities and courses focus on 
propaganda activities.

<p>Questions of Applying the Law on Compensation for 
Moral Damage.&#8214; provide for compensation;  
- With the objective to establish a system of adequate 
compensation for victims of torture, the Supreme Court 
and the Office of the Prosecutor-General are studying 
the courts&#8216; practices on compensation for victims of 
torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment, which is within the framework of the 
National Action Plan on the recommendations of the 
Human Rights Council on the results of the Universal 
Period Review of Uzbekistan.   
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>  The existing criminal law 
provides for compensation in case of rehabilitation of 
the accused person. The civil legislation prescribes 
compensation of moral damage, but this requires that the 
person be recognized as a victim of a crime and that the 
perpetrator be found guilty by a court verdict; there are 
therefore no cases of compensation in practice.

<p>48 individuals have been commuted (33 individuals 
received life imprisonment and 15 long-term 
imprisonment). Family members and the lawyers of the 
concerned individuals were informed about the 
respective decisions. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   Following the abolition of 
the death penalty, two new concepts were introduced in 
the criminal legislation: life imprisonment and long-term 
imprisonment. However, with regard to previously 
executed death penalties, information remains de-facto 
and de-jure a state secret, the relatives of persons that 
were executed by shooting in Uzbekistan had no 
opportunity to bear farewell to the condemned as no last 
meeting with them was envisaged in the legislation. 
Until now many people do not know the date of the 
execution of their relatives as well can not visit their 
grave, as the place of burial is not disclosed being a state 
secret. The law that was passed does not provide for the 
disclosure of the places of burial of executed persons as 
well as informing the relatives of the sentenced persons 
on the date of execution.  
- The section of the Law on life imprisonment has a 
number of mutually exclusive provisions which leave 
room for the interpretation: The issue of pardoning those 
sentenced to the life imprisonment. Uzbekistan 
abolished the cruelest type of punishment &#8211; the death 
penalty. However, instead, other types of punishment 
that are almost equal in terms of severity (life 
imprisonment and long-term imprisonment) were 
introduced. In accordance with the Law &#8213;On 
introduction of changes and amendments to some 
legislative acts of the Republic of Uzbekistan due to the 
abolition of the death penalty&#8214; the right of submitting an 
application for pardon in respect of those sentenced to 
life imprisonment and long-term imprisonment emerges 
upon the expiration of a long period of time: 25 or 20 
years for life imprisonment and 20 or 15 years for long-</p>

<p>term imprisonment. 
- The law also contains a new version of article 50 of the 
Criminal and Criminal Procedural Code, which says 
that, in case of presidential clemency, the persons 
sentenced to life imprisonment shall automatically be 
considered sentenced to long term imprisonment (25 
years) and that they are bound to serve this sentence in a 
strict regime colony. Therefore, it is possible to release 
those who benefited from presidential clemency after 45 
years only.  
- Moreover, the possibility of a pre-term submission of 
an application of pardon is dependent on the desire of 
the administration of the colony, as the administration 
decides at its discretion whether &#8213;the accused person has 
firmly embarked on the path of correction, has not had 
any disciplinary punishments for violations of the 
established regime, has a good attitude to labour and 
training as well actively participates in correctional 
measures&#8214;. Against the background of the lack of 
transparency of penitentiary institutions and of any 
public rules in respect of administering the colonies in 
Uzbekistan, it is probable that the abovementioned 
powers of the administration of the colony on the 
execution of punishment will be implemented on an 
arbitrary basis.  
- All this means that the Government does not apply an 
individual approach towards each person sentenced to 
life or long term imprisonment, but rather applies the 
same treatment to all persons sentenced to life or long 
term imprisonment.  
- Another proof of this assumption are the changes that 
were introduced to article 136 (The rules of serving the 
life imprisonment sentence) after the abolition of the 
death penalty: &#8213;The persons sentenced to life 
imprisonment shall stay for the first ten years in strict 
conditions.  After serving at least ten years, the persons 
sentenced to life imprisonment, provided they have no 
disciplinary penalties for the violation of the established </p>

<p>regime, can be transferred from strict conditions to 
ordinary conditions. After serving at least fifteen years 
the persons sentenced to life imprisonment, provided 
they have no disciplinary penalties for violations of the 
regime, can be transferred from ordinary conditions to 
softer conditions&#8214;.  These rules of applying 
encouragement measures towards persons sentenced to 
life imprisonment (the transfer from strict conditions to 
ordinary and relieved conditions of stay), prescribed in 
the legislation contradict the principle of progress in 
administering persons sentenced to life imprisonment. 2) 
The law does not provide for the possibility to have a 
criminal case reviewed. The risk of sentencing an 
innocent person to life imprisonment is as possible as it 
has been before. In case all instances of appeal in respect 
of indictment of the court have been exhausted and the 
presidential clemency remains the only hope for the 
restoration of justice, in accordance with the Law the 
right to appeal for pardon can emerge only after serving 
20 years of sentence.  
- According to paragraph 2 article 136 of the Criminal 
and Criminal Procedural Codes, those sentenced to life 
imprisonment must be put in prison cells by at last two 
persons. Upon the request of inmates or in case of 
necessity they may be placed in solitary confinement.  
- Overall the rules imposed on persons convicted to 
long-term and life imprisonment are very restrictive and 
contradict the principle of rehabilitation and 
reintegration. 
 
<b>Government:</b> In the period of 2005-2010, none of the 
earlier passed death penalties were executed.  
 
According to norms regulating the order of submitting a 
request for amnesty in the Criminal Administrative 
Code, a request for amnesty can be submitted by persons 
sentenced to life imprisonment or to long period of 
imprisonment.   </p>

<p>(t) The Government should 
give urgent consideration to 
closing Jaslyk colony which 
by its very location creates 
conditions of detention 
amounting to cruel, inhuman 
and degrading treatment or 
punishment for both its 
inmates and their relatives.  
</p>
<p> Government: Jaslyk prison was built taking into account 
all sanitary norms and international standards;  
- The implementation of the recommendation to close 
Jaslyk colony is currently not being studied. More than a 
quarter of the prisoners detained at Jaslyk colony lived 
in the Republic of Karakalkakstan and Khorezmskoy 
department prior to their arrests. As there are no other 
detention facilities in these regions, it is much cheaper 
and easier for the prisoners&#8216; families to visit them in 
Jaslyk than in other colonies. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   In 2008 a new colony was 
built in Jaslyk; The Government has interpreted this 
recommendation of the UN Special Rapporteur and 
shifted the discussion on the situation in Jaslyk to the 
issue of treatment of inmates rather than the issue of the 
geographic location of the colony. Moreover, in 2008 a 
new block was commissioned in Jaslyk for the purpose 
of holding the persons sentenced to life or long term 
imprisonment. 
</p>
<p> 
 
</p>
<p>(u) All competent government 
authorities should give 
immediate attention and 
respond to interim measures 
ordered by the Human Rights 
Committee and urgent 
appeals dispatched by United 
Nations monitoring 
mechanisms regarding 
persons whose life and 
physical integrity may be at 
risk of imminent and 
irreparable harm. 
</p>
<p><b>Government:</b> The Supreme Court takes the decisions 
about interim measures; 
- The Ministry for Foreign Affairs is continuously 
working on the preparation of replies to requests of 
treaty bodies and special procedures, which include 
information on criminal cases against Uzbek citizens. In 
2009, 5 replies have been sent to the Human Rights 
Committee in relation to 11 citizens of Uzbekistan and 
10 replies have been sent to special procedures in 
relation to 39 citizens of the country. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   The relevant authorities 
are not responsive to the requests of the United Nations 
Human Rights Committee in terms of persons whose life 
and physical health can be subject to inevitable and 
irrecoverable harm; 
- Currently there are over 180 persons accused on the 
basis of political and religious grounds in colonies;

<p>(v) Make the declaration 
provided for in article 22 of 
the Convention against 
Torture and Other Cruel, 
Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment 
recognizing the competence 
of the Committee against 
Torture to receive and 
consider communications 
from individuals who claim to 
be victims of a violation of 
the provisions of the 
Convention, as well as to 
ratifying the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention, 
whereby a body shall be set 
up to undertake regular visits 
to all places of detention in 
the country in order to 
prevent torture; invite the 
Working Group on Arbitrary 
Detention and the Special 
Representative of the 
Secretary-General on human 
rights defenders as well as the 
Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and 
lawyers to carry out visits to 
the country. 
</p>
<p> <b>Government:</b> the question of making a declaration 
under article 22 of the Convention against Torture is 
under consideration; 
- The recommendation to make the declaration under 
article 22 of the Convention against Torture and the 
Optional Protocol (OPCAT) is an attempt to impose an 
unwanted step on a sovereign State. Whereas 
Uzbekistan has not acceded to the OPCAT, many 
measures have been taken to extend national and 
international monitoring efforts;  
- A Working Group studies and elaborates proposals for 
the implementation of article 22 of the UN Convention 
Against Torture which provides for an individual 
complaint procedure. The Government notes that the 
country ratified the Optional Protocol to the 
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 
1995 which also provides for an individual complaint 
mechanism. Studies are being undertaken on the 
practices of the work of the Committee against Torture 
regarding the individual complaint mechanism for the 
establishment of a national preventive mechanism 
compliant with the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
Against Torture. 
 
<b><i>Non-governmental sources:</i></b>   In November 2007, the 
Government of Uzbekistan confirmed that it is 
considering making a declaration in accordance with 
article 22 of the UN Convention Against Torture before 
the UN Committee Against Torture. There were no 
developments or news on this matter since then. Rather, 
in contradiction to that commitment, the Government 
made another statement, which said that &#8213;the 
recommendation to make a declaration in accordance 
with Article 22 of the UN Convention Against Torture 
as well as Optional Protocol thereto (OPCAT) is an 
attempt to compel a sovereign state to make a move

During the period under review none of the 
recommended representatives of the UN special 
procedures were invited. 
 
<b>Government:</b> The question of the ratification of the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention was considered by 
the Office of the Prosecutor General and a position 
paper from 2009 November was transmitted to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
A positive decision on the ratification of the Optional 
Protocol could be taken after establishing a national 
preventive mechanisms against torture and introducing 
amendments in the criminal-procedural and criminal-
administrative legislations in relation to unlimited access 
to places of detention by international experts and the 
level of readiness of the Republic of Uzbekistan to 
recognise the jurisdiction of the Sub-Committee.

</b></p>
<p><b>  Guidelines for the submission of information on the follow-up to the country visits of the Special Rapporteur on the question 
</b></p>
<p><b>of torture 
</b></p>
<p>1  Follow-up is a key-element in ensuring the effectiveness of recommendations of Special Procedure mechanisms. In this 
context, all Governments are urged to enter into a constructive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur on torture with respect to the 
follow-up to his recommendations, so as to enable him to fulfil his mandate more effectively.  
</p>
<p>2  To obtain a comprehensive picture, the Special Rapporteur welcomes written information from international, regional, 
national and local organizations regarding follow up measures. The Special Rapporteur encourages information submitted through 
national coalitions or committees.  
</p>
<p>3. A summary of the content of the submissions from non-governmental sources is integrated in the follow-up table, which is 
then forwarded to the concerned State for its input and comments. In particular, States are requested to provide information on the 
consideration given to the recommendations, the steps taken to implement them, and any constraints which may prevent their 
implementation. 
</p>
<p>4. For a given country visit report, written information regarding follow-up measures to each of the recommendations should be 
submitted to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Submissions should not exceed 10 pages in length.  
</p>
<p>5. The Special Rapporteur will include summaries of the written information submitted to him in the addenda on the follow-up 
to country visits of the report to the Human Rights Council.
