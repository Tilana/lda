RULING

1.      
The Appellant was charged for Robbery with Violence, Damaging property and Unlawful use of Motor Vehicles in three separate indictments and he pleaded guilty to all indictments.

2.      
The learned High Court Judge convicted the Appellant and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment for robbery with violence, 1 year imprisonment for damaging property and 4 months imprisonment for unlawful use of motor vehicles and the sentences to run concurrently.

3.      
The Appellant filed an application for leave to appeal against sentence stating that the sentence was harsh and excessive.

4.      
When the Appellant's application was taken up for hearing on 7th November 2012, the Appellant made an application to withdraw his appeal. State Counsel did not object to the application for withdrawal.

5.      
 A single Judge of the Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to decide on an application to withdraw an appeal. In terms of Rule 39 of the court of Appeal Rules the single Judge should direct the application for withdrawal to be made before the full court.

6.      
Therefore I direct that this case be placed in the list to be heard by the full court.
