<p><i> Welcoming </i>the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, 
</p>
<p>adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 55/2 of 8 September 2000, to take 
</p>
<p>measures to eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many societies and 
</p>
<p>to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies, and looking forward to its 
</p>
<p>effective implementation at all levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>the landmark importance of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of 
</p>
<p>Action in the pursuit of the universal promotion and protection of human rights and its 
continued relevance in responding to contemporary challenges, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of 
</p>
<p>Cultural Expressions, approved by the General Conference of the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on 20 October 2005,<b> </b></p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>that cultural diversity, flourishing within a framework of democracy, 
</p>
<p>tolerance, social justice and mutual respect between peoples and cultures is indispensible 
</p>
<p>for peace and security at the local, national and international levels, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the importance of cultural diversity for the full realization of the human 
</p>
<p>rights and fundamental freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
</p>
<p>and other universally recognized instruments, 
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing</i> <i>also</i> the contribution that diverse cultures have been making to the 
development and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> that multiculturalism, solidarity, respect and tolerance can play an 
</p>
<p>important role in the promotion and protection of human rights by combating xenophobia, 
violence and discrimination, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind</i> <i>also</i> that the promotion and upholding of tolerance, respect, 
</p>
<p>pluralism and diversity is essential for the promotion and protection of human rights in 
</p>
<p>multicultural contexts and, in particular, for combating racism, xenophobia, intolerance and 
</p>
<p>discrimination,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> the primary responsibility of States in the promotion and protection of 
</p>
<p>human rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also</i> that, as expressed in the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity, 
</p>
<p>no one may invoke cultural diversity to infringe upon the human rights guaranteed by 
</p>
<p>international law, nor to limit their scope, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Emphasizes</i> that the universal promotion and protection of human rights, 
</p>
<p>including cultural rights, and mutual respect for cultural diversity should reinforce each 
</p>
<p>other; 
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Stresses </i>the importance of adopting policies that ensure non-discrimination 
</p>
<p>and equitable access to social, political and economic rights, thus reducing disadvantage 
</p>
<p>and inequality; 
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Decides</i> to convene, within existing resources, at its twentieth session, a

</p>

</p>
