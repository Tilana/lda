</p>
<p> <i>Recalling </i>the United Nations Millennium Declaration, in particular the first Millennium

</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>the outcome of the High-level Conference on World Food Security: the Challenges 
of Climate Change and Bioenergy, held in Rome from 3 to 5 June 2008,  
</p>
<p><i> Resolved </i>to act to ensure that the human rights perspective is taken into account at the

</p>
<p>                                                 
<b>*</b> The resolutions and decisions adopted by the Human Rights Council will be contained in the report of the Council 
on its twelfth session (A/HRC/12/50), chap. I. </p>

 <p><i> Welcoming </i>the panel discussion on the realization of the right to food in the context of the 
global food crisis, held by the Council on 9 March 2009, which offered an opportunity for 
persons affected by the crisis to participate and provide input to the discussions,  
</p>
<p><i> Acknowledging </i>the task force established by the Secretary-General, and supporting the 
Secretary-General to continue his efforts in this regard,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the complex character of the current global food crisis, as a combination of 
several major factors, both structural and conjunctural, also negatively affected by, inter alia, 
environmental degradation, drought and desertification, global climate change, natural disasters 
and the lack of the necessary technology, and also that a strong commitment from national 
Governments and the international community as a whole is required to confront the major 
threats to food security,  
</p>
<p><i> Concerned</i> by the fact that the effects of the world food crisis are not over and that they 
continue to have serious consequences on the most vulnerable people, particularly in developing 
countries, which have been further aggravated by the world economic and financial crisis, 
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation </i>the report of the Special Rapporteur on the right to 
food (A/HRC/12/31), and takes note of his recommendations;  
</p>
<p> 2. <i>Expresses </i>grave concern at the fact that the current world food crisis seriously 
undermines the realization of the right to food for all, and especially for one sixth of the world 
population, mainly in developing and least developed countries, suffering from hunger, 
malnutrition and food insecurity;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Encourages </i>States to mainstream the human rights perspective in building and 
reviewing their national strategies for the realization of the right to adequate food for all, which 
could include, inter alia, the mapping of the food insecure, the adoption of relevant legislation 
and policies with a right to food framework, the establishment of mechanisms to ensure 
accountability so that rights-holders are able to claim their right to food, and the establishment of 
mechanisms and processes that ensure the participation of rights-holders, particularly the most 
vulnerable, in the design and monitoring of such legislation and policies;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Also encourages </i>all States to invest or promote investment in agriculture and rural 
infrastructure in a manner that empowers the most vulnerable and affected by the current crisis in 
order to ensure their realization of the right to food;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Calls upon </i>States, individually and through international cooperation and assistance, 
relevant multilateral institutions and other relevant stakeholders, to take all necessary measures 
to ensure the realization of the right to food as an essential human rights objective, and to 
consider reviewing any policy or measure that could have a negative impact on the realization of 
the right to food, particularly the right of everyone to be free from hunger, before instituting such 
a policy or measure;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Stresses </i>that States have a primary obligation to make their best efforts to meet the 
vital food needs of their own populations, especially of vulnerable groups and households, such 
as by enhancing programmes to combat mother-child malnutrition, and to increase local </p>

<p> 
production for this purpose, while the international community should provide, through a 
coordinated response and upon request, international cooperation in<b> </b>support for national and 
regional efforts by providing the necessary assistance for increasing food production, particularly 
through agricultural development assistance, the transfer of technology, food crop rehabilitation 
assistance and food aid, with a special focus on the gender-sensitive dimension; 
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Encourages </i>all relevant international organizations and agencies to bring a human 
rights perspective and the need for the realization of the right to food for all to their studies, 
research, reports and resolutions on the issue of food security;  
</p>
<p> 8. <i>Requests</i> the Special Rapporteur to continue to promote the right to food as outlined 
in his mandate and, as part of it, to continue to follow up on the world food crisis through a 
continued dialogue with stakeholders at all levels, including with all relevant international 
organizations and agencies of the United Nations system, in order to contribute to identifying 
means to implement the right to food; 
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Also requests</i> the Special Rapporteur, within the framework of his mandate, to 
inform the Council on the crisis, the impact of the crisis on the realization of the right to food 
and progress made and obstacles encountered in relation to the implementation of measures to 
respond to the world food crisis and of evolving best practices in this regard; 
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Requests </i>the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to bring the 
present resolution to the attention of all relevant international organizations and agencies;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Decides </i>to remain seized of the implementation of the present resolution.
