Nature of Operations 
 
Uranerz Energy Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, U.S.A. on May 26, 1999. Effective July 5, 2005, the Company
changed its name from Carleton Ventures Corp. to Uranerz Energy Corporation. The Company has mineral property interests in the United States.
 
The  Company  is  an  Exploration  Stage  Company,  as  defined  by  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (“FASB”)  Accounting  Standards  Codification 
(“ASC”) 915, Development Stage Entities. The Company’s principal business is the acquisition and exploitation of uranium resources.
 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
a)
b)
c)
Basis of Presentation 
 
The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States for interim financial information and with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) instructions for companies filing Form 
10-Q. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual 
financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position 
as  of  September  30,  2011,  and  the  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  for  the  period  then  ended.  The  financial  data  and  other  information 
disclosed in the notes to the interim consolidated financial statements related to this period are unaudited. The results for the three-month and nine-
month periods ended September 30, 2011 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarter or the entire year 
ending December 31, 2011. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been condensed pursuant to the Securities and Exchange 
Commission's rules and regulations and do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles 
for complete financial statements.  Therefore,  these unaudited interim  consolidated financial statements should be  read in conjunction  with the 
Company’s annual audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2010, included in the Company’s 
Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on March 15, 2011 with the SEC.
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
The Company considers all highly liquid instruments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash equivalents.
 
Mineral Property Costs 
 
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties. 
 
Mineral  property  exploration  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  Costs  for  acquired  mineral  property  databases  are  similarly  expensed  upon 
acquisition. 
 
Mineral  property  acquisition  costs  are  expensed  upon  acquisition  unless  a  property  can  be  economically  developed  as  a  result  of  establishing 
proven  and  probable  reserves  and  a  bankable  feasibility  study.  In  the  event  that  a  mineral  property  is  acquired  through  the  issuance  of  the 
Company’s shares, the mineral property will be recorded at the fair value of the respective property or the fair value of common shares, whichever 
is more readily determinable. 
 
When mineral properties are acquired under option agreements with future acquisition payments to be made at the sole discretion of the Company, 
those future payments, whether in cash or shares, are recorded only when the Company has made or is obliged to make the payment or issue the 
shares. 
 
As of the date of these financial statements, the Company has no capitalized mineral property expenditures.

Restoration and Reclamation Costs (Asset Retirement Obligations)
 
United States regulatory authorities require the Company to restore and reclaim its mine area after mining is completed. Pursuant to ASC 410, 
Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations, the fair value of asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a 
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount 
of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. Future reclamation and remediation costs are 
accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each period of the costs expected to be incurred at each project.
 
Estimations  and  assumptions  involved  in  using  the  expected  present  value  technique  to  determine  fair  values  are  reviewed  periodically.  At 
September  30,  2011,  the  Company  had  $200,352  accrued  for  restoration  and  reclamation  obligations;  $167,352  was  added  to  construction  in 
progress during the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and $33,000 expensed prior to 2011.
 
Income Taxes 
 
Potential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 
740, Income Taxes as of its inception. Pursuant to ASC 740 the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for net operating losses carried
forward. The potential benefits of net operating losses have not been recognized in these consolidated financial statements because the Company 
cannot be assured it is more likely than not it will utilize the net operating losses carried forward in future years. 
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 
Financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable. Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and 
Disclosures and ASC 825, Financial Instruments the fair value of cash equivalents and marketable securities is determined based on “Level 1”
inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The recorded values of all other financial instruments approximate 
their current fair values because of their nature and respective relatively short maturity dates or durations. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
Comprehensive Income 
 
In June 2011, ASC guidance was issued related to comprehensive income. Under the updated guidance, an entity will have the option to present 
the total of comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. 
In addition, the update requires certain disclosure requirements when reporting other comprehensive income. The update does not change the items 
reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassifies to income. The update is effective 
for  the  Company’s  fiscal  year  beginning  January  1,  2012.  The  Company  does  not  expect  the  updated  guidance  to  have  an  impact  on  the

Fair Value Accounting 
 
In May 2011, ASC guidance was issued related to disclosures around fair value accounting. The updated guidance clarifies different components 
of  fair  value  accounting  including  the  application  of  the  highest  and  best  use  and  valuation  premise  concepts,  measuring  the  fair  value  of  an 
instrument classified in a reporting entity’s shareholders’ equity and disclosing quantitative information about the unobservable inputs used in fair 
value measurements that are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The update is effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning 
January 1, 2012. The Company does not expect the updated guidance to have a significant impact on the consolidated balance sheet, results of 
operations or cash flows.
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
At September 30, 2011, the Company had $41,030,981 in cash and cash equivalents. Pursuant to ASC 820 the fair value of cash equivalents is determined
based on “Level 1” inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company places cash investments in instruments that
meet credit quality standards, as specified in the investment policy guidelines.

Shareholder Rights Plan 
 
The  Company  has  adopted  a  Shareholder  Rights  Plan  (the  "Plan")  effective  August  25,  2010.  The  Plan  confers  one  right  (a  "Right")  for  each  of  the
Company’s outstanding shares of common stock, as at August 25, 2010 and for shares of common stock issued thereafter. Each Right will be evidenced by
the Company's shares of common stock and will trade with the Company's shares of common stock. Under the terms of the Plan, the Rights separate and
become exercisable upon a “flip-in event”: if a person or group acquires 20% or more of the Company's common stock other than through a take-over bid 
which meets certain requirements, among them that the offer be extended to all shareholders, that it remain open for 60 days, and that it receive approval
of not less than 50% of independent shareholders. If a flip-in event occurs as described in the Plan, the Rights entitle the holder of each Right to purchase
for $8.75 per share (the “exercise price”) that number of shares of common stock of the Company which has a market value of twice the exercise price,
subject to certain adjustments as provided under the Plan. The Plan is effective for a three-year period.

Segment Disclosures 
 
The Company has two operating segments both involving the acquisition and exploitation of uranium and mineral resources. These operating segments
consist of the Arkose Mining Venture (“Arkose”) and the Company’s remaining operations.
 
Factors used to identify the Company’s reportable segments include the organizational structure of the Company and the financial information available
for  evaluation  by  the  chief  operating  decision-maker  in  making  decisions  about  how  to  allocate  resources  and  assess  performance.  The  Company’s 
operating segments have been broken out based on similar economic and other qualitative criteria. The Company operates both reporting segments in one
geographical area, the United States. 
 
The  Chief  Executive  Officer  is  the  Company’s  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker  (CODM)  as  defined  by  ASC  280,  Segment  Reporting.  The  CODM 
allocates resources and assesses the performance of the Company based on the results of operations.

General
We are a U.S.-based uranium company focused on achieving near-term commercial in-situ recovery (“ISR”) uranium production. ISR is a mining process that uses 
a “leaching solution” to extract uranium from underground ore bodies; it is the generally accepted extraction technology used in the Powder River Basin area of 
Wyoming (ISR comprised 41% of world uranium production in 2010). We control a large strategic land position in the Pumpkin Buttes Uranium Mining District 
of the central Powder River Basin of Wyoming, U.S.A. Our management team has specialized expertise in the ISR uranium mining method, and a record of 
licensing, constructing, and operating ISR uranium projects.
We are principally focused on the development of our properties in the Powder River Basin area into commercial ISR uranium mines. Our plan of operations is to 
bring  two  properties  into  production,  the  Nichols  Ranch  and  Hank  units,  together  referred  to  as  the  Nichols  Ranch  ISR  Uranium  Project,  and  continue  the 
exploration and development of our other Wyoming Powder River Basin properties.
In  July  2011  we  received  the  final  authorizations  required  to  allow  us  to  begin  construction  of  our  Nichols  Ranch  ISR  Uranium  Project.  We  commenced 
construction of the facility described below and related infrastructure immediately thereafter, with a target completion date of late 2012. At the Nichols Ranch ISR 
Uranium Project we expect to take our Nichols Ranch and Hank units into production of uranium concentrate, which can be sold directly to utilities for processing 
into fuel used in nuclear electrical generating facilities.
A third project is in the license application preparation stage. In March 2010, we commenced preparation of the environmental permit and license applications for 
the Jane Dough unit, which is adjacent to the area currently being developed at the Nichols Ranch unit and will share its infrastructure. Jane Dough includes the 
Doughstick, South Doughstick and North Jane properties. Additional units may be added as we assess our geological data.
The mine plan for the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project includes a central processing facility at our Nichols Ranch unit and a satellite ion exchange uranium 
concentrating facility at our Hank unit. The production level from these two units is planned to be in the range of 600,000 to 800,000 pounds per year (as U3O8). 
The central processing facility is licensed for a capacity of two million pounds per year of uranium (as U3O8) and is intended to process uranium-bearing well field 
solutions from Nichols Ranch, as well as uranium-loaded resin transported from the Hank satellite facility, plus uranium-loaded resin from any additional satellite 
deposits that may be developed on our other Powder River Basin properties. The Jane Dough unit is compatible with this plan. We believe this centralized design 
enhances  the  economics  of  our  potential  additional  satellite  projects  by  maximizing  production  capacity  while  minimizing  further  capital  expenditures  on 
processing facilities.
We plan to use the ISR mining process whereby a ‘leaching’ agent, which contains an oxidant such as oxygen with sodium bicarbonate (commonly known as 
baking soda) and carbon dioxide, is added to the native groundwater and injected through wells into the ore body in a sandstone aquifer to dissolve minerals 
containing uranium. This solution is then pumped via other wells to the surface for processing into finished yellowcake product ready for sale to utilities requiring 
nuclear fuel for operations — resulting in a cost-efficient and, relative to other common mining methods, a more environmentally friendly mining process. The 
ISR mining process differs dramatically from conventional mining techniques in that ISR mining leaves the rock matrix in place. The ISR technique avoids the 
movement and milling of rock and ore as well as mill tailing waste associated with more traditional mining methods.
In  anticipation  of  receiving  all  the  approvals  necessary  to  begin  production,  we  commenced  a  marketing  program  for  conditional  sales  of  uranium  from  our 
Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project. In July of 2009 we announced that we entered into a sales agreement with Exelon Generation Company, LLC for the sale of 
uranium over a five year period at defined pricing. In August of 2009 we announced our second contract for the sale of uranium to a U.S. utility also over five 
years, with a pricing structure that contains references to both spot and long-term prices and includes floor and ceiling prices. These long-term contracts for the 
sale of uranium are with two of the largest nuclear utilities in the U.S. These two agreements do not individually represent a substantial portion of our targeted 
uranium production and our business is not substantially dependent on these agreements.
Our Powder River Basin properties include:
(cid:122) our 100% owned properties that totaled 25,261 acres as of September 30, 2011; and  
(cid:122) our 81% interest in Arkose Mining Venture properties that totaled 62,153 acres as of September 30, 2011.
Our 100% owned properties are comprised of unpatented mineral lode claims, state leases and fee (private) mineral leases, summarized as follows:

Through a combination of claim staking, purchasing and leasing, we have also acquired interests in projects that lie within the Powder River Basin but outside of 
the project areas discussed above. These additional properties include the Verna Ann and Niles Ranch projects. However, due to our focus on other projects, we 
have not yet initiated exploration work on these projects.
Information regarding the location of and access to our Wyoming properties, together with the history of operations, present condition and geology of each of our 
properties, is presented in Item 2 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 under the heading “Description of Properties”, 
previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2011.
During the third quarter of 2011 we:
(cid:122) Commenced construction of the Nichols Ranch production facility;  
(cid:122) Installed 39 monitor wells at Nichols Ranch;  
(cid:122) Constructed a bulk cement silo and acquired ancillary service equipment;  
(cid:122) Purchased well field construction equipment;  
(cid:122) Hired four new employees for well field development at Nichols Ranch;  
(cid:122) Continued preparation of permit applications for a third mining unit;  
(cid:122) Continued our 2011 exploration program: drilled a total of 186 holes for a total of 140,000 feet, with three drill rigs;
(cid:122) Issued 254,500 shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options, for proceeds of $347,725; and  
(cid:122) Dropped 254 unpatented mining claims for lack of economic potential, reducing carrying expenses by $35,560 per annum.
Our focus is on exploration in the Powder River Basin, construction of a processing facility and installation of the environmental monitor and production wells for 
the first well field of the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project. Up to six drilling rigs will be engaged for installing monitor and production wells. For the remainder 
of the 2011drilling season we expect to finish the monitor well installation program (75 wells). Additional drill rigs and field employees will be added. Exploration 
activities will concentrate on our southern targets.
Subsequent Event
On October 5, 2011, the Ontario Securities Commission issued a final receipt for the Company’s Short Form Prospectus, which along with the Company’s S-3 
Shelf Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 3, 2011 
(jointly the “2011 Prospectus”), allows the Company to offer and sell, from time to time over a twenty-five month period, up to US$100,000,000 in shares of the 
Company’s common stock, par value $0.001, warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, units of the Company, subscription receipts of the 
Company, and debt securities of the Company, or any combination thereof in one or more transactions under the 2011 Prospectus. The Company may also offer 
under the 2011 Prospectus any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants or subscription receipts.
Financial Position
The  Company's  overall  financial  position  is  disclosed  in  the  Company's  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2010  filed  with  the 
Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2011 and the unaudited consolidated Financial Statements at September 30, 2011 as provided herein under the 
section heading "Financial Statements" above.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are carrying out an exploration, environmental and mine design program with a budget of approximately $3,600,000 in 2011. This plan, plus general and 
administrative  expenses  of  approximately  $6,200,000,  amounts  to  cash  requirements  of  approximately  $9,800,000  for  the  year  ending  December  31,  2011  as 
reported in Item 2 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 under the heading "Description of Properties", previously filed with 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mineral property acquisitions, dependent upon opportunities that may arise, and Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project 
capital costs will be additional expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, mineral property expenditures incurred were $1,998,715 and 
$4,214,524 was incurred for Nichols Ranch capital assets.
At September 30, 2011 we had cash and short term securities of $41,030,981 and working capital of $40,346,000, as compared to cash and short term securities of 
$36,437,370  and  working capital  of  $36,526,165  as at December  31,  2010.  Our  cash  is invested in bank  guaranteed  savings  accounts  which are  available  on 
demand.
Net cash used in operating activities was $6,772,101 for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to $8,562,245 for the corresponding period in 2010. 
The decrease in net cash used in operations of $1,790.144 resulted primarily from an increase in cash expenditures for general and administrative expenses of 
$1,183,464 and a decrease in mineral property expenditures of $3,557,218 over 2010. Net cash used to purchase property and equipment was $3,401,477 for the 
nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to $143,387 used in the corresponding period in 2010. Asset acquisitions for Nichols Ranch accounted for most 
of the 2011 investment in property and equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $14,767,575 for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, from proceeds of issuance of common stock on 
the exercise of options and warrants, compared to $597,558 provided in the corresponding period in 2010. The $14,170,017 increase is almost all attributable to the 
issuance of common stock.
During the twelve-month period following the date of this quarterly report, we anticipate that we will not generate a significant amount of revenue. The Nichols 
Ranch  ISR  Uranium  Project  is  expected  to  incur  additional  expenditures  of  approximately  $30  million  before  it  commences  production  in  late  2012.  Our 
exploration plans will be continually evaluated and modified as exploration and environmental results become available. General and administrative expenses, 
planning and environmental expenses are incurred throughout the year; most of our exploration expenditures are incurred during the nine-month period of March 
through November. Modifications to our plans will be based on many factors including results of exploration, assessment of data, weather conditions, exploration 
costs, the price of uranium and available capital. Further, the extent of exploration programs that we undertake will be partially dependent upon the amount of 
financing available to us.
To date, our primary source of funds has been equity investments, and this trend is expected to continue together with production related financing when we are in 
production. We believe we have sufficient cash to bring the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project into production, continue our exploration and planning and to 
meet on-going operating expenses for the next twelve months, and beyond, as we scale our operations to the resources we have available. We anticipate that any
additional funding may be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock and the exercise of share purchase options or debt, depending on 
capital markets. Accordingly, in 2011, we increased the number of shares of common stock available for issuance upon exercise of options granted under our stock 
option plan from 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 and increased our authorized common shares from 200,000,000 to 750,000,000.
Our current short term investments have not been devalued by the current stock market disruptions as these investments are primarily in low risk bearer deposit 
notes issued and guaranteed by Canadian Chartered Banks. Rates of return, however, are at historic lows. At the end of the investment period of these securities we 
plan  on  reinvesting  the  securities  in  similar  short  term  instruments.  Management  and  the  board  of  directors  periodically  meet  to  review  the  status  of  these 
investments and determine investment strategies, taking into account current market conditions and the short and long term capital needs of the Company.
Results of Operations
Three-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to three-month period ended September 30, 2010
Revenue and Operating Expenses
We have not earned any revenues to date and we anticipate that we will not generate any significant revenues during the twelve-month period following the date of 
this quarterly report.
We  incurred  total  operating expenses of  approximately  $2,344,739  for  the three-month  period  ended September  30,  2011,  as  compared to  $4,330,149  for the
corresponding period in 2010. The decrease of operating expenses in the amount of $1,985,410 was primarily attributable to a $2,059,823 decrease in mineral 
property expenses resulting from reduced exploration drilling and a 2010 geological data acquisition of $1,258,000.
We had no significant financing expense for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. Our interest income of $18,938 for the three-month 
period ended September 30, 2011 was comparable to 2010. This income resulted from short term investments which are periodically adjusted to market.
Net loss for the three-month period ended September 30, 2011 was approximately $2,113,094, as compared to approximately $4,063,598 for the corresponding 
period in 2010.
Nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 compared to nine-month period ended September 30, 2010
We incurred total operating expenses of approximately $12,059,113 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, as compared to $12,947,206 for the
corresponding period in 2010. The decrease of operating expenses in the amount of $888,093 was primarily attributable to a $1,426,829 increase in stock-based 
compensation included in general and administrative expenses, a $1,183,464 increase in other general and administrative expenses arising from the growth of the 
Company’s activities offset by a $3,557,218 decrease in mineral property expenditures.
We had no significant financing expense for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. We earned $60,025 of interest income for the nine
month  period  ended  September  30,  2011  as  compared  to  $44,970  for  the  corresponding  period  in  2010.  This  increase  resulted  from  additional  short  term 
investments; interest rates have not changed.
Net loss for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011 was approximately $11,558,864, as compared to $12,410,532 for the corresponding period in 2010, 
a decrease of $851,668. The net loss was affected by variation of operating expenses described above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in 
financial  condition,  revenues  or  expenses,  results  of  operations,  liquidity,  capital  expenditures  or  capital  resources  that  are  material  to  stockholders  except  as 
disclosed  in  the  unaudited  Financial  Statements  at  September  30,  2011.  The  Company  has  had  no  material  changes  to  its  off-balance  sheet  arrangements  as 
disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15,
2011 and the unaudited Financial Statements at September 30, 2011 as provided herein under the section heading “Financial Statements” above.
Critical Accounting Policies
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. 
We  regularly  evaluate our  estimates and assumptions related to  the  useful life and recoverability  of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation  and  deferred 
income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to 
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual 
of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. 
To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected.
We  believe  the  following  critical  accounting  policies  require  us  to  make  significant  judgments  and  estimates  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial 
statements.
Mineral Property Costs
The Company is primarily engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral properties.
Mineral property exploration costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for acquired mineral property databases are similarly expensed upon acquisition.
Mineral property acquisition costs are expensed upon acquisition unless a property can be economically developed as a result of establishing proven and probable 
reserves and a bankable feasibility study. In the event that a mineral property is acquired through the issuance of the Company’s shares, the mineral property will 
be recorded at the fair value of the respective property or the fair value of common shares, whichever is more readily determinable.
When mineral properties are acquired under option agreements with future acquisition payments to be made at the sole discretion of the Company, those future 
payments, whether in cash or shares, are recorded only when the Company has made or is obliged to make the payment or issue the shares.
As of the date of this report, the Company has no capitalized mineral property expenditures.
Restoration and Reclamation Costs (Asset Retirement Obligations)
United States regulatory authorities require the Company to restore and reclaim its mine area after mining is completed. Pursuant to ASC 410, Asset Retirement 
and Environmental Obligations, the fair value of asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value 
can be made. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying 
amount is depreciated over the life of the asset. Future reclamation and remediation costs are accrued based on management's best estimate at the end of each 
period of the costs expected to be incurred at each project.
Estimations and assumptions involved in using the expected present value technique to determine fair values are reviewed periodically.
Contractual Obligations
The Company has had no material changes to its contractual obligations as disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission on March 15, 2011 and the unaudited Financial Statements at September 30, 2011 as provided herein under the section heading “Financial 
Statements” above.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
Our operations are not yet exposed to risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and credit. Commodity price risk is defined as the potential loss that 
we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of uranium. Interest rate risk results from our debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing 
and liquidity for our business. Credit risk would arise from the extension of credit throughout all aspects of our business but is not yet significant. Industry-wide 
risks can, however, affect our general ability to finance exploration, and development of exploitable resources; such effects are not predictable or quantifiable.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
At the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with the participation of the Company’s management, 
including its Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), Glenn Catchpole, and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Benjamin Leboe, of the effectiveness of the design and 
operations of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a – 15(e) and Rule 15d – 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that 
evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were 
adequately designed and effective in ensuring that: (i) information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and 
Exchange Commission under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms; 
and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including 
our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or 
submitted  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded,  processed,  summarized  and  reported,  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  Securities  and  Exchange 
Commission's  rules  and  forms.  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and  procedures  designed  to  ensure  that  information 
required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, to allow 
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have 
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
The  term  “internal  control  over  financial  reporting”  is  defined  as  a  process  designed  by,  or  under  the  supervision  of,  the  registrant's  principal  executive  and 
principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the registrant's board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide 
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:
Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the registrant;
(a)
(b)
(c)

I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Uranerz Energy Corporation:
 
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
with respect to the period covered by this report;
 
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
material  respects  the  financial  condition,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows  of  the  registrant  as  of,  and  for,  the  periods
presented in this report; 
 
The  registrant’s  other  certifying  officer  and  I  are  responsible  for  establishing  and  maintaining  disclosure  controls  and 
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined

d.
Designed  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures,  or  caused  such  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  to  be  designed
under  our  supervision,  to  ensure  that  material  information  relating  to  the  registrant,  including  its  consolidated
subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is
being prepared; 
 
Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal controls over financial reporting to be
designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
 
Evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  the  registrant’s  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  and  presented  in  this  report  our
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
report based on such evaluation; and 
 
Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
registrant’s  most  recent  fiscal  quarter  (the  registrant’s  fourth  fiscal  quarter  in  the  case  of  an  annual  report)  that  has 
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting; 
and
The  registrant’s  other  certifying  officer  and  I  have  disclosed,  based  on  our  most  recent  evaluation  of  internal  control  over 
financial  reporting,  to  the  registrant’s  auditors  and  the  audit  committee  of  the  registrant’s  board  of  directors  (or  persons 
performing the equivalent functions):
a.
b.
All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial 
information; and 
 
Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the
registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
