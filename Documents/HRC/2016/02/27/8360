<p><i>Summary 
</i> The present report is the fourth annual report submitted to the Human Rights 
Council by the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, pursuant to Council 
resolution 15/14. 
</p>
<p> In the present report, the Special Rapporteur provides a summary of the activities 
carried out during his third year in the mandate, including cooperation with other 
international and regional mechanisms and bodies in the field of indigenous rights, and the 
activities carried out in his four main areas of work: promoting good practices; country 
reports; specific cases of alleged human rights violations; and thematic studies.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur devotes the second half of the report to an analysis of the 
impact of extractive industries operating within or near indigenous territories following the 
distribution of a questionnaire on the issue to Governments, indigenous peoples, 
corporations and civil society. The growing awareness of the impact of extractive industries 
on the rights of indigenous peoples is further raised by the concerns expressed by many of 
the responses received confirming the assertion that these projects and industries are 
becoming the greatest challenges to the exercise of the rights of indigenous peoples. This 
situation is further evidenced by the lack of understanding of basic minimum standards on 
the effects of extractive industries affecting indigenous peoples and about the role and 
responsibility of the State to ensure protection of their rights.  
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur concludes with the need to continue the study of this issue

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples pursuant to his mandate under Council 
resolution 15/14. In the report, the Special Rapporteur provides a summary of the activities 
carried since his previous report to the Council (A/HRC/15/37). He then identifies and 
analyses the issues relating to extractive industries operating on or near indigenous lands.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur acknowledges with gratitude the assistance provided by the 
Support Project for the Special Rapporteur on Indigenous Peoples at the University of 
Arizona College of Law. This assistance was indispensable for the preparation of the report 
and the addenda thereto, and for carrying out the work reflected in these reports. He is also 
thankful to the many indigenous peoples, States, United Nations bodies and agencies and 
non-governmental organizations that cooperated with him over the past year in the 
implementation of his mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Summary of activities 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Cooperation with international mechanisms and bodies 
</b></p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur continued to implement his mandate while cooperating with 
the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples, as mandated by the Human Rights Council in its resolutions 6/12 and 
15/14. As in past years, he attended the annual sessions of the Permanent Forum, in May 
2011, and of the Expert Mechanism, in July 2011, and participated in discussions of issues 
that are under consideration by them. In particular, he contributed to the study of the Expert 
Mechanism on the right of indigenous peoples to participation and provided comments 
relevant to the review of the Permanent Forum of its priorities and working methods during 
its previous session.  
</p>
<p>4. Additionally, during the annual sessions of the above mechanisms, the Special 
Rapporteur continued his practice of holding parallel meetings with indigenous peoples and 
organizations, which provided him with an invaluable opportunity to meet with 
representatives of indigenous peoples and organizations to learn of specific situations and 
concerns, in a manner complementing the more general discussions of indigenous issues by 
the Permanent Forum and Expert Mechanism during their annual sessions. 
</p>
<p>5. In July 2011, as on previous occasions, the Special Rapporteur met with the 
members of the Expert Mechanism and representatives of the Permanent Forum in Geneva 
to share work agendas, discuss the strengths and limitations of their respective mandates 
and explore methods for most effectively carrying out their work.  
</p>
<p>6. The Special Rapporteur moreover continued to combine efforts with a range of 
United Nations, regional and specialized bodies on matters concerning indigenous peoples. 
Over the past year, the Special Rapporteur has provided observations on initiatives of the 
United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the International Finance Corporation of the 
Word Bank Group, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the Pan-
American Health Organization. This work relates to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s efforts to 
promote good practices (see paragraphs 8 &#8211; 14 below).  
</p>
<p>7. The Special Rapporteur continued to exchange information with the Inter-American 
Commission on Human Rights on cases of alleged violations of the rights of indigenous 
peoples in the Americas in an attempt to ensure coordinated efforts and to avoid 
unnecessary duplication. </p>


<p><b> B. Areas of work 
</b></p>
<p>8. While cooperating with other international mechanisms, the Special Rapporteur 
continued to carry out work in four interrelated areas: promotion of good practices; country 
reports; communications on specific cases of alleged human rights violations; and thematic 
studies.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Promotion of good practices 
</b></p>
<p>9. In accordance with his mandate, the Special Rapporteur continued to advocate for 
legal, administrative and programmatic reforms at the domestic and international levels to 
give effect to the rights enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and other relevant international instruments.  
</p>
<p>10. An important aspect area of work was promoting support for the Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples by those States that did not originally vote in favour of it 
upon its adoption by the General Assembly in 2007.1 In the past year, the Special 
Rapporteur has welcomed the statements of support for the Declaration by the 
Governments of Canada and of the United States of America, statements that have made 
their opposition to the Declaration a thing of the past. The outstanding challenge is still to 
implement the Declaration&#8217;s provisions through concerted efforts at the domestic and 
international levels. The Special Rapporteur is committed to working together with States, 
United Nations agencies, indigenous peoples and other interested parties in order to meet 
this challenge.  
</p>
<p>11. In connection with promoting the implementation of the Declaration in the United 
States, in June 2011, the Special Rapporteur provided testimony at a hearing of the United 
States Senate Committee on Indian Affairs entitled &#8220;Setting the standard: the domestic 
policy implication of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>12. On an ongoing basis over the past year, the Special Rapporteur provided technical 
and advisory assistance to Governments as they developed laws and policies to advance the 
rights of indigenous peoples. For example, at the request of the Government of Suriname, 
and of indigenous and tribal peoples in that country, the Special Rapporteur provided 
observations and recommendations on a process to develop legislation to secure indigenous 
and tribal peoples&#8217; rights to lands and resources in the light of binding judgements issued 
thereon by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights.2 These observations and 
recommendations were based in part on information gathered during a visit to Suriname by 
the Special Rapporteur in March 2011. 
</p>
<p>13. Also during the past year, the Special Rapporteur provided comments on various 
drafts of legislation currently under consideration by the National Assembly of Ecuador to 
coordinate indigenous customary justice systems with the national justice system. In this 
connection, in June 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in a videoconference with the 
National Assembly of Ecuador, during which he addressed specific questions and concerns 
regarding the proposed legislation. Furthermore, over the course of several weeks in 
February 2011, the Special Rapporteur provided observations on the initiative of the 
Government of Guatemala to regulate a procedure for consultation with indigenous 
peoples.  
</p>
<p>14. Other activities relating to the promotion of best practices include providing 
guidance and orientation to numerous United Nations programmes and agencies, 
multinational organizations and other groups on the rights of indigenous peoples in various 
contexts. This has included the following activities:  
</p>
<p>  
  1 General Assembly resolution 61/295. 
  2 See A/HRC/18/35/Add.7. </p>


<p>&#8226; In November 2010, the Special Rapporteur participated in a seminar in Geneva on 
land and human rights, hosted by OHCHR, providing information and analysis of 
the particular human rights concerns of indigenous peoples in relation to lands 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In January 2011, the Special Rapporteur participated in a meeting in Paris of a 
working group of State delegates to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD), providing comments to draw attention to indigenous issues 
in the process of updating the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In February 2011, the Special Rapporteur provided extensive observations on the 
UNDP draft guidelines on consultation with indigenous peoples for activities carried 
out in the context of the climate change mitigation programme for reducing 
emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Also in February 2011, the Special Rapporteur provided input into the development 
of a regional intercultural health policy by the Pan-American Health Organization 
during a special meeting convened in Washington, D.C. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In March 2011, the Special Rapporteur gave the keynote address at an expert 
workshop in Berlin, convened by the Federal Ministry on Economic Cooperation 
and Development of Germany concerning German development cooperation in 
Africa and Asia  
</p>
<p>&#8226; At various times over the past year, the Special Rapporteur provided guidance to the 
International Finance Corporation during the review of its Performance Standard 7 
on indigenous peoples, including by meeting with Corporation officials, and 
providing written comments on drafts of the Performance Standard 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In April 2011, the Special Rapporteur gave the keynote address at the biennial 
conference of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council in Australia, at which 
the Land Council discussed the<b> </b>United Nations Declaration on Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples as a benchmark for major aspects of its work 
</p>
<p>&#8226; In May 2011, the Special Rapporteur gave the keynote speech at a session in Geneva 
of the WIPO Intergovernmental Committee on Intellectual Property and Genetic 
Resources, Traditional Knowledge and Folklore , which is in the process of 
developing an international legal instrument on traditional knowledge, genetic 
resources and traditional cultural expressions 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The Special Rapporteur has been working in ongoing collaboration with UNDP to 
produce a resource guide on indigenous peoples&#8217; rights for UNDP staff and others 
working on indigenous issues 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Country reports  
</b></p>
<p>15. Over the past year, the Special Rapporteur has issued various reports on the human 
rights situation of indigenous peoples in specific countries (see addenda to the present 
report). These reports include conclusions and recommendations aimed at strengthening 
good practices, identifying areas of concern and improving the human rights conditions of 
indigenous peoples in specific countries or regions. Since submitting his previous report to 
the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur has completed his reports on the 
situation of Sami people living in the S&#225;pmi region of Norway, Sweden and Finland 
(A/HRC/18/35/Add.2) and on the situation of the Maori people in New Zealand 
(A/HRC/18/35/Add.4). In 2011, the Special Rapporteur will also present reports to the 
Human Rights Council on indigenous peoples in the Congo (A/HRC/18/35/Add.5) and in 
New Caledonia (France) (A/HRC/18/35/Add.6).  
</p>
<p>16. Later in 2011, the Special Rapporteur will carry out a visit to Argentina. He has also 
received invitations from the Governments of Panama and of El Salvador to evaluate the 
situation of indigenous peoples in those countries. The Special Rapporteur has outstanding </p>


<p>requests to visit Bangladesh, Cambodia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and the United 
States, which he hopes will be considered favourably.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Specific cases of alleged human rights violations 
</b></p>
<p>17. Pursuant to his mandate from the Human Rights Council, the Special Rapporteur has 
continued to gather, request, receive and exchange information from all relevant sources, 
including indigenous peoples and Governments on cases of alleged human rights violations. 
The Special Rapporteur has also continued his practice of providing observations and 
recommendations on the underlying human rights issues involved in cases under 
consideration. Summaries of the letters sent by the Special Rapporteur communicating his 
concerns over particular situations and responses received from Governments, together with 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s observations and recommendations, are included in his 
communications report (A/HRC/18/35/Add.1). 
</p>
<p>18. As has been his practice since the beginning of his mandate, the examination of 
particular cases has also involved on-site visits to examine in greater depth the issues raised 
in communications with Governments. In April 2011, the Special Rapporteur travelled to 
Costa Rica to assess the situation of indigenous peoples affected by the potential 
construction of the Diqu&#237;s hydroelectric project. Following that visit, the Special 
Rapporteur provided the Government and indigenous stakeholders with his observations 
and recommendations on the situation (see A/HRC/18/35/Add.8); he looks forward to 
continuing his constructive dialogue with the Government and affected indigenous groups 
about this situation. Also in the past year, the Special Rapporteur completed a report on 
natural resource extraction and other projects affecting indigenous peoples in Guatemala, as 
well as a report on the specific case of the Marlin Mine in that country 
(A/HRC/18/35/Add.3). These reports were largely based on information gathered during 
the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit to Guatemala in June 2010. 
</p>
<p>19. On occasion, the Special Rapporteur has issued media or other public statements on 
issues of immediate concern arising in specific countries. Public statements that the Special 
Rapporteur has issued since his previous report to the Human Rights Council have related 
to Government reactions to protests by Rapa Nui people in Easter Island (Chile); concerns 
surrounding a hunger strike by Mapuche indigenous prisoners protesting charges brought 
against them under an anti-terrorism law in Chile; protests by indigenous peoples in 
Panama against legislation on mining; laws and policies regarding consultation with 
indigenous peoples in Peru; and concerns over legislation adopted by the state of Arizona 
(United States) allowing enhanced police powers to detain suspected illegal immigrants, 
and the effects of this legislation on indigenous peoples in the United States/Mexico border 
region. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Thematic studies 
</b></p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur has continued to examine recurring issues of interest and 
concern to indigenous peoples worldwide. As noted above, the Special Rapporteur provided 
input to the study of the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples on the 
right of indigenous peoples to participate in decision-making, including during a meeting of 
experts convened by the Expert Mechanism in March 2011, in Geneva. In particular, he 
shared examples of good practices of indigenous participation in various contexts based on 
cases that have come to his attention during his tenure as a mandate holder. 
</p>
<p>21. Building on his previous thematic studies on the duty to consult with indigenous 
peoples3 and the responsibility of corporations to respect the rights of indigenous peoples,4 
in 2011 the Special Rapporteur is examining issues associated with large-scale projects for 
</p>
<p>  
  3 See A/HRC/12/34. 
  4 A/HRC/15/37. </p>


<p>the extraction or development of natural resources on or near indigenous lands. A review of 
the responses to a questionnaire on these issues and an initial assessment has been 
incorporated into the section below.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Extractive industries operating within or near indigenous 
territories 
</b></p>
<p>22. The impact of extractive industries on indigenous peoples is a subject of special 
concern to the Special Rapporteur. In several country-specific5 and special reports,6 and in 
his review of particular cases,7 he has examined various situations in which mining, 
forestry, oil and natural gas extraction and hydroelectric projects have affected the lives of 
indigenous peoples. Also, as noted above, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s previous thematic 
studies have focused on the duty of States to consult indigenous peoples and corporate 
responsibility, issues that invariably arise when extractive industries operate or seek to 
operate on or near indigenous territories.  
</p>
<p>23. In 2003, in his report to the Commission on Human Rights, the previous mandate 
holder examined issues associated with large-scale development projects, raising concern 
about the long-term effects of a certain pattern of development that entails major violations 
of the collective cultural, social, environmental and economic rights of indigenous peoples 
within the framework of the globalized market economy.8 
</p>
<p>24. Since then, numerous developments have taken place in this area. In 2007, the 
discussion and adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples contributed to a greater awareness about the human rights 
implications for indigenous peoples of natural resource extraction and other development 
projects. Following the revision of World Bank policy on indigenous peoples in 2005, 
several international and regional financial institutions have developed their own policies 
and guidelines regarding public or private projects affecting indigenous peoples.9 Among 
the latest of these developments, in May 2011, OECD updated its Guidelines for 
Multinational Enterprises to strengthen standards for corporations in the field of 
international human rights, including those pertaining to indigenous peoples. Also, the 
International Financial Corporation has undertaken a revision of its performance standard 
on indigenous peoples, a process to which the Special Rapporteur contributed (see 
paragraph 14 above).  
</p>
<p>25. The work of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights 
and transnational corporations and other business enterprises, which has led to the 
development of the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; framework and the principles for its 
implementation, has further contributed to raising the awareness of the impact of business 
operations on human rights. The framework and principles, which were endorsed by the 
Human Rights Council in its resolution 17/4, provide further grounding for advancing in 
the operationalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in the context of business operations.  
</p>
<p>26. Extractive industry activities generate effects that often infringe upon indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights; public agencies and private business enterprises involved in the extraction 
or development of natural resources, in both developing and developed countries, have 
</p>
<p>

<p> A/HRC/15/37/Add.2, paras. 41-42; A/HRC/12/34/Add.6, paras. 33-39; and A/HRC/12/34/Add.2, 
 paras. 55-58.

<p>contributed to these effects. Notably, some Governments have attempted to mitigate the 
negative effects of extractive operations, yet human rights continue to be violated as a result 
of an increasing demand for resources and energy. The Special Rapporteur considers the 
ever-expanding operations of extractive industries to be a pressing issue for indigenous 
peoples on a global scale. He therefore aims to contribute to efforts to clarify and resolve 
the problems arising from extractive industries in relation to indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Review of responses to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire 
</b></p>
<p>27. On 31 March 2011, the Special Rapporteur distributed a questionnaire in order to 
collect and understand views, concerns and recommendations relating to extractive 
industries operating on or near indigenous territories. The initiative was received 
favourably, generating a large number of responses from Governments, indigenous peoples, 
corporations and members of civil society. Academic experts and members of indigenous 
communities acting in their individual capacities also made valuable contributions to the 
study.  
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur cordially thanks all contributors for their detailed responses 
to the questionnaire and appreciates their support for his efforts to fulfil his mandate to 
examine ways and means of overcoming existing obstacles to the full and effective 
protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and to identify, exchange and promote best 
practices.  
</p>
<p>29. The sections below contain an overview of the main issues raised in questionnaire 
responses, with a primary focus on the perceived challenges created by extractive industries 
operating in indigenous territories. It should be noted that the Special Rapporteur requested 
and received examples of good practices in relation to natural resource extraction projects 
operating in or near indigenous territories. He continues to analyse these examples and 
hopes to provide further reflections on good practices in his future observations on the issue 
of natural resource extraction and indigenous peoples.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Environmental impact 
</b></p>
<p>30. Responses to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire by States, businesses and 
indigenous peoples provide a detailed review of the significant impact that extractive 
industries have had on indigenous peoples&#8217; lands and resources. The gradual loss of control 
over indigenous lands, territories and natural resources was listed by respondents as a key 
concern, an issue that is seen as stemming from deficient protective measures for 
indigenous communal lands. The majority of indigenous representatives and organizations 
also listed environmental impact as a principle issue of concern. Responses highlighted 
examples of the degradation and destruction of ecosystems caused by extractive industries, 
as well as the devastating resultant effects on indigenous peoples&#8217; subsistence economies, 
which are closely linked to these ecosystems. Common negative environmental effects 
reported in the responses include the pollution of water and lands and the depletion of local 
flora and fauna.  
</p>
<p>31. With respect to the negative impact of extractive operations on water resources, it 
was noted that water resource depletion and contamination has had harmful effects on 
available water for drinking, farming and grazing cattle, and has affected traditional fishing 
and other activities, particularly in fragile natural habitats. For example, the Government of 
the Philippines described an open-pit mining operation in the province of Benguet, where 
operations had left a wasteland where &#8220;no fresh fish could ever be found in creeks and 
rivers&#8221;. It should be noted that reports of the adverse impact of extractive operations on 
water resources were not limited to exceptional cases of, for example, oil pipeline breaks. 
Adverse effects have also reportedly resulted from routine operations or natural causes, 
including the drainage of industrial waste into water systems caused by rain.  </p>


<p>32. A number of Governments and companies highlighted the fact that a significant 
proportion of harmful environmental effects of extractive industry operations could be 
traced back to past practices that would be deemed unacceptable under current legal and 
extractive industry standards. For example, the Regional Association of Oil, Gas and 
Biofuels Sector Companies in Latin American and the Caribbean indicated that, throughout 
Latin America, serious environmental problems persist from the unregulated oil extraction 
activities that took place for more than 40 years. Similarly, the Government of Ecuador 
made reference to the Chevron-Texaco operations in the Amazon region, stating that the 
negative environmental legacy resulted from past resource exploitations that lacked 
regulation and control.  
</p>
<p>33. Numerous questionnaire respondents also made an explicit connection between 
environmental harm and the deterioration of health in local communities. Several 
respondents suggested that the overall health of the community had been negatively 
affected by water and airborne pollution. Other reports highlighted an increase in the spread 
of infectious disease brought about by interaction with workers or settlers immigrating into 
indigenous territories to work on extractive industry projects. Respondents also linked 
environmental degradation to the loss of traditional livelihoods, which consequently 
threatens food security and increases the possibility of malnutrition.  
</p>
<p><b> 2.  Social and cultural effects 
</b></p>
<p>34. A second major issue cited by questionnaire respondents focused on the adverse 
impact of extractive industry operations on indigenous peoples&#8217; social structures and 
cultures, particularly when those operations result in the loss of lands and natural resources 
upon which indigenous communities have traditionally relied. In such cases, resource 
extraction can jeopardize the survival of indigenous groups as distinct cultures that are 
inextricably connected to the territories they have traditionally inhabited.  
</p>
<p>35. Several indigenous and non-governmental organizations reported that the forced 
emigration of indigenous peoples from their traditional lands &#8211; either because of the taking 
of those lands or environmental degradation caused by resource extraction projects &#8211; has 
had an overall negative impact on indigenous cultures and social structures. One non-
governmental organization dramatically described the migration process as the transition of 
&#8220;ecosystem people&#8221; into &#8220;ecological refugees&#8221;. One civil society respondent from India 
described the negative effects of the continuous reallocation of a significant number of 
Adivasi and other tribal peoples as a result of large-scale developments projects, 
particularly dams. Many of these projects provided very little or no compensation for those 
forced to relocate. This problem was reported to have an especially negative effect on 
Adivasi women, who have apparently experienced loss of social, economic and decision-
making power when removed from their traditional territorial- and forestry-based 
occupations.  
</p>
<p>36. According to respondents, non-indigenous migration into indigenous territories and 
its related consequences also have a negative effect on indigenous social structures. 
Examples identified by respondents of non-indigenous migration into indigenous lands 
include illegal settlement by loggers or miners, the influx of non-indigenous workers and 
industry personnel brought in to work on specific projects, and the increased traffic into 
indigenous lands owing to the construction of roads and other infrastructure in previously 
isolated areas. For its part, the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
expressed concern regarding the alarming rates of alcoholism and prostitution previously 
unheard of among the indigenous peoples. In Colombia, the arrival of extractive industries 
in indigenous areas has reportedly triggered the infiltration of indigenous territories by drug 
traffickers and guerrillas, together with the militarization of those territories.  
</p>
<p>37. Indigenous organizations and leaders reported a significant deterioration in 
communal social cohesion and the erosion of traditional authority structures with the 
increase of extractive operations. Community members often take opposing positions </p>


<p>regarding the perceived benefits of resource extraction, resulting in conflict that, at times, 
erupted into violence. Social conflict appears to be particularly prevalent when economic 
benefits are transferred directly to individuals or limited jobs are available. Several 
Governments and companies also cited cases of bribery and corruption of indigenous 
leaders as areas of concern, although no in-depth reflection on the root causes of these 
patterns were included in their responses. 
</p>
<p>38. Submissions by indigenous peoples and non-governmental organizations also 
reported an escalation of violence by Government and private security forces as a 
consequence of extractive operations in indigenous territories, especially against indigenous 
leaders. Furthermore, a general repression of human rights was reported in situations where 
entire communities had voiced their opposition to extractive operations. In this connection, 
political instability, violent upheavals and the rise of extremist groups in indigenous areas 
have also reportedly resulted from the presence of extractive industries in indigenous 
territories.  
</p>
<p>39. Numerous questionnaire respondents highlighted the adverse effects that natural 
resource extraction projects operating in indigenous territories had on important aspects of 
indigenous culture, such as language and moral values. Additionally, respondents noted that 
projects had led to the destruction of places of culture and spiritual significance for 
indigenous peoples, including sacred sites and archaeological ruins. 
</p>
<p>40. Various respondents, including companies, recognized the need for a &#8220;different 
approach&#8221; when dealing with indigenous communities and extractive activities. This could 
include, for example, the evaluation of community-specific social and cultural effects and 
the development of community-specific mitigation measures. It was also suggested that 
cultural awareness training for company employees and subcontractors may be helpful in 
countering the negative impact on the social and cultural aspects of indigenous 
communities.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Lack of consultation and participation 
</b></p>
<p>41. An important cross-section of indigenous peoples, Governments and companies 
noted that affected indigenous peoples needed to be consulted about and be involved in the 
operation of natural resource extraction projects that affect them. This need was identified, 
depending on the identity of the respondent, as both a right affirmed in international and 
domestic law and a matter of pragmatism: a preventative measure to avoid project 
opposition and social conflicts that could result in the disruption of project operations.  
</p>
<p>42. Governments and business respondents provided considerable examples of social 
conflicts that had resulted from a lack of consultation with indigenous communities, and 
noted that solutions to these conflicts had invariably entailed opening a dialogue with 
indigenous peoples and arriving at agreements that addressed, among other issues, 
reparation for environmental damages and benefit-sharing.  
</p>
<p>43. Government and private-sector respondents also reported that past negative 
experiences often frustrated present consultations with indigenous peoples. According to 
the Mexican National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples, as a result 
of past experiences, indigenous communities now fear that companies &#8220;may enter at any 
moment&#8221;. Lack of prior involvement, labour conflicts, unmitigated environmental damage 
and unfulfilled promises were identified as reasons why many indigenous communities fear 
or outright reject current proposals for extractive projects in their territories, even before 
receiving information on potential new projects or engaging in discussions about possible 
arrangements in this connection.  
</p>
<p>44. Several Governments provided the Special Rapporteur with information describing 
recent domestic legal and policy reforms that specifically relate to the regulation of the 
State&#8217;s duty to consult indigenous peoples regarding extractive industry activities. These 
reforms have entailed both the drafting of general consultation laws and policies, and </p>


<p>relevant revisions to &#8220;sectorial&#8221; legislation, namely, legislation relating to the use of 
specific resources such as minerals, forests or water resources. Some already existing 
mechanisms for consultation with indigenous peoples were also identified. Notably, 
Norway and Finland highlighted relevant domestic laws and policies that require 
consultations with the respective Saami Parliaments in those countries, in relation to 
extractive industry projects and other development plans in Saami-populated areas.  
</p>
<p>45. Although some progress is being made domestically, several responses from private 
business entities expressed concern over the significant level of uncertainty surrounding 
consultation procedures. A survey of business responses suggest that questions remain 
regarding the scope and implications of consultations, as well as the specific circumstances 
that may trigger the duty to consult. Uncertainty also remains for Governments and 
businesses regarding the identification of communities with whom it is necessary to 
consult, in particular indigenous communities whose lands have not been demarcated by the 
State and communities in which both indigenous and non-indigenous peoples live. The 
Government of Peru also observed that restricting the consultation process to communities 
found in direct impact areas fails to account for communities found outside those areas but 
that are nevertheless affected by extractive projects.   
</p>
<p>46. Various indigenous peoples&#8217; submissions spoke to the challenges involved in 
obtaining accurate information about the potential impact of proposed extractive industry 
projects on indigenous peoples&#8217; environment and daily lives. The Sucker Creek First Nation 
of Canada reported the difficulties of their communities when attempting to navigate 
complex information in consultation and negotiation phases. The information it provided 
suggested that indigenous communities may lack the technical expertise necessary to 
engage as equals in consultation and negotiations, which leaves them reliant on impact 
assessments provided by extraction companies, which reportedly do not always assess 
accurately the full extent of potential impact on indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>47. A considerable number of indigenous respondents maintain that extractive 
companies carry out consultations as a mere formality in order to expedite their activities 
within indigenous territories. In that connection, the Lubicon Lake Indian Nation in Canada 
indicated that the statutory duty to consult indigenous peoples had not been adequately 
implemented in practice to the extent that &#8220;good faith-consultations&#8221; undertaken by 
companies do not require the indigenous peoples&#8217; consent or accommodation of their 
viewpoints. It also reported that indigenous peoples&#8217; input does not substantively affect pre-
established Government or industry plans.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Lack of clear regulatory frameworks and other institutional weakness 
</b></p>
<p>48. Representatives of business enterprises reported that deficient domestic regulatory 
frameworks create barriers to carrying out their operations in a way that respects indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights and interests. Several businesses contended that this lack of clarity 
constituted a major obstacle to their ability to undertake their operations in a manner 
consistent with international expectations regarding the rights of indigenous peoples. In 
turn, this lack of legal certainty is perceived by corporate actors as a cause of costly 
conflicts with local indigenous communities. 
</p>
<p>49. Corporate responses point out three particular areas in which a clear regulatory 
framework is often lacking: the content and scope of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights over their 
lands, territories and natural resources, particularly in those instances in which traditional 
land tenure has not been officially recognized through titling or otherwise; consultation 
procedures with indigenous peoples; and benefit-sharing schemes. With regard to these 
issues, the examples of best practices shared by companies related more to their voluntary 
practices and initiatives than to the meeting of the legal requirements of the countries in 
which they operate.  </p>


<p>50. Business respondents and indigenous peoples noted that difficulties can arise even 
when domestic legal and policy standards exist, because Governments often lack the 
political will to implement those standards, and rather pass the responsibility on to 
companies and indigenous peoples. From a business perspective, this creates uncertainty 
and leads to additional business costs, beyond securing official permits and other 
administrative requirements. A number of business respondents observed the need to enter 
into agreements with local indigenous communities prior to launching their operations as a 
means of preventing future problems.  
</p>
<p>51. Additionally, information provided suggested that a lack of coordination and 
institutional capacity leads to insufficient operational oversight of extractive industries by 
States. Respondents, including Governments, observed that State institutions responsible 
for indigenous affairs or other relevant State institutions often worked with limited 
institutional and budgetary resources, resulting in limited or no oversight of extractive 
operations. 
</p>
<p><b> 5.  The question of tangible benefits  
</b></p>
<p>52. Contrasting perspectives exist with regard to the benefits of extractive operations. 
Various Governments and companies identified benefits to indigenous peoples resulting 
from natural resource extraction projects, while, in general, indigenous peoples and 
organizations reported that benefits were limited in scope and did not make up for the 
problems associated with these projects.  
</p>
<p>53. Several Governments highlighted the key importance of natural resource extraction 
projects for their domestic economies that, in a number of countries, reportedly account for 
up to 60 to 70 per cent of GNP. Governments also indicated that extractive projects have 
positive benefits for indigenous peoples and others in the regions where they operate. 
Responses highlighted the fact that significant proportions of State royalties and other 
revenues from extractive operations are assigned to regional or local government structures 
(as indicated in the response from Peru), to regional development funds (for example, in the 
Ecuadorian Amazon region) or, more exceptionally, to indigenous organizations (for 
example, in Bolivia (Plurinational State of)). In particular, the Government of Bolivia 
(Plurinational State of) highlighted a scheme intended to benefit indigenous peoples by 
allocating a significant percentage of hydrocarbon taxes either directly to the country&#8217;s 
main indigenous organizations or to the Fondo de Desarrollo para los Pueblos Ind&#237;genas 
Originarios y Comunidades Campesinas (a development fund for indigenous peoples and 
farm worker communities). Job opportunities were also commonly cited as a direct benefit 
derived from extractive operations in indigenous territories. 
</p>
<p>54. A number of mining companies noted that indigenous peoples had been direct 
beneficiaries of basic infrastructure construction required for their operations in remote 
areas, including the construction of roads, improvements in communications and the 
delivery of electricity and water services. They also cited social benefits derived from 
resource extraction projects, such as health and educational opportunities in underserved 
areas or capacity-building programmes that support indigenous organizations and local 
governments. At times, these initiatives are part of broader social corporate responsibility 
policies aimed at attaining a &#8220;social license&#8221; to operate.  
</p>
<p>55. Yet contrasting perspectives with regard to benefits reflect different cultural 
orientations within the development context. Most indigenous peoples and organization 
responses underscored the adverse effects on their environment, culture and societies, 
which they said outweighed the minimal or short-term benefits arising out of extractive 
operations. In this connection, a member of the Pemon people of Venezuela (Bolivarian 
Republic of) reported that benefits from extractive industries were not a top priority within 
the community; rather, the group sought &#8220;healthy communities, with no infections, in a 
pollution-free environment&#8221;. Similarly, an organization representing the traditional 
authorities of the Cofan people of Colombia concluded that, in present circumstances, </p>


<p>&#8220;indigenous peoples are left with no option other than to try to find something positive for 
their communities out of the disaster left behind by the extraction of oil, mineral, and other 
resources&#8221; in their traditional territories.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Preliminary assessment 
</b></p>
<p>56. The various points of view communicated by indigenous peoples, Governments, 
business enterprises and other relevant stakeholders concerning natural resource and energy 
extractive development projects in indigenous territories reveal that, despite a growing 
awareness of the need to respect the rights of indigenous peoples as an integral part of those 
projects, many problems remain.  
</p>
<p>57. The responses to the questionnaire confirm the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s perception, 
derived from the various activities carried out during the first three years of his mandate, 
that the implementation of natural resource extraction and other development projects on or 
near indigenous territories has become one of the foremost concerns of indigenous peoples 
worldwide, and possibly also the most pervasive source of the challenges to the full 
exercise of their rights. Together with those of indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations and 
representatives, the responses of many Governments and corporations reflect a clear 
understanding of the negative and even catastrophic effects on the economic, social and 
cultural rights of indigenous peoples due to irresponsible or negligent projects that have 
been or are being implemented in indigenous territories without proper guarantees or the 
involvement of the peoples concerned.  
</p>
<p>58. The growing awareness of the actual or potential negative impact of industry 
operations on the rights of indigenous peoples is further marked by an increasing number of 
legal regulations and other Government initiatives, as well as by enhanced action by 
domestic courts and human rights institutions, which were cited in the responses to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire. Furthermore, this growing awareness is evident in the 
development or strengthening by business enterprises of internal human rights safeguards 
and even of specific indigenous rights policies. 
</p>
<p>59. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the 
worldwide endorsement of its principles and directives, the growing empowerment of 
indigenous peoples to defend their internationally affirmed human rights and denounce the 
violations of these rights, and the lessons learned from the many negative experiences, 
within the context of the wider interest of the international community about the impact of 
business enterprises on human rights are factors that have surely contributed to this 
enhanced state of awareness.  
</p>
<p>60. Despite this growing level of awareness, however, the responses to the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire also show the lack of a minimum shared understanding about 
the basic implications of accepted international standards or about the institutional 
arrangements and methodologies required to give them full effect in the context of 
extractive or development operations that may affect indigenous peoples. In this 
connection, differing or vague understandings persist about the scope and content of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and about the degree and nature of the responsibility of the State 
to ensure the protection of these rights in the context of extractive industries.  
</p>
<p>61. The current global discussion about the impact of business activities on human 
rights has reaffirmed that the State has the ultimate international legal responsibility to 
respect, protect and fulfil human rights. As much is made clear in the &#8220;Protect, Respect and 
Remedy&#8221; framework proposed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on 
human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises,10 which was 
</p>
<p>  
  10 A/HRC/17/31. </p>


<p>adopted by the Human Rights Council as the basic normative structure for advancing in the 
protection of human rights in the context of business activities (see paragraph 25 above).  
</p>
<p>62. While an awareness and express commitment by States to the protection of the rights 
of indigenous peoples are evident in the many Government responses received to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire, these responses, coupled with those received from 
other sources, also reflect a lack of operative consensus about the extent and means of 
realization of the State&#8217;s duties with regard to resource extraction and development 
projects.  
</p>
<p>63. As noted above, several responses, particularly those received from business actors, 
pointed out that Governments tend to detach from the implementation of consultation 
procedures and other procedural safeguards for indigenous peoples rights in the context of 
extractive operations and act as mere regulators. The delegation of the State&#8217;s protective 
role to business enterprises was repeatedly pointed out as a matter of concern, particularly 
with when there are insufficient or non-existent State regulatory frameworks regarding 
indigenous rights, including in relation to the protection of lands and resources, 
consultation and benefit-sharing schemes. The lack of clarity or consensus about the role of 
the State in protecting the rights of indigenous peoples in this context compounds the 
uncertainties arising from the differing views about the scope and content of those rights.  
</p>
<p>64. An additional, significant area of divergent perspectives concerns the balance 
between costs and benefits of extractive development projects. Even though there is a 
shared awareness of the past negative effects of extractive activities for indigenous peoples, 
there are widely divergent perspectives about the incidence and value of benefits from 
extractive industries, especially into the future. As noted above, many of the Governments&#8217; 
responses to the questionnaire underscored the key importance of extractive industries for 
their domestic economies. Many of the responses by business actors shared the view that 
indigenous peoples could stand to benefit from extractive industries.  
</p>
<p>65. For their part, indigenous peoples&#8217; responses to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
questionnaire were dominated by a great deal of scepticism and, in many cases, outright 
rejection, of the possibility of benefiting from extractive or development projects in their 
traditional territories. The vast majority of indigenous peoples&#8217; responses, many of which 
stemmed from the direct experience of specific projects affecting their territories and 
communities, rather emphasized a common perception of disenfranchisement, ignorance of 
their rights and concerns on the part of States and businesses enterprises, and constant life 
insecurity in the face of encroaching extractive activities. Such a perception suggests that 
no apparent positive impact is to be had from these operations, which are seen more as a 
top-down imposition of decisions taken in a collusion of State and corporate interests than 
the result of negotiated decisions in which their communities are not directly involved. 
</p>
<p>66. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the lack of a minimum common ground for 
understanding the key issues by all actors concerned entails a major barrier for the effective 
protection and realization of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in the context of extractive 
development projects. The lack of a common understanding among the actors concerned, 
including States, corporate actors and indigenous peoples themselves, coupled with the 
existence of numerous grey conceptual and legal areas has invariably proved to be a source 
of social conflict. Comparative experience, including specific country situations in which 
the Special Rapporteur has intervened within the framework of his mandate, provide ample 
examples of the eruption and escalation of these conflicts and the ensuing radicalization of 
positions. Where social conflicts erupt in connection with extractive or development plans 
in indigenous territories, everybody loses.  
</p>
<p>67. The responses to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire manifest the need for 
change in the currents state of affairs if indigenous rights standards are to have a 
meaningful effect on State and corporate policies and action as they relate to indigenous 
peoples. An initial step towards such a change is establishing a common ground of </p>


<p>understanding among indigenous peoples, governmental actors, businesses enterprises and 
other relevant actors. The Special Rapporteur is conscious of the complexities inherent to 
any effort to harmonize the various interests involved in context of extractive industries and 
indigenous peoples, as well as of the difficulties in bridging the contrasting viewpoints that 
currently exist among the actors concerned.  
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur is, however, persuaded of the need to advance towards a 
minimum common understanding of the content and scope of the rights of indigenous 
peoples and of the implications of those rights for the future desirability or viability of 
extractive industries on or near indigenous territories, the nature of the responsibility of 
States to protect indigenous peoples&#8217; rights in this context, the actual or potential impact of 
extractive industries &#8211; both positive and negative &#8211;and related matters. Without a minimum 
level of common understanding, the application of indigenous rights standards will 
continue to be contested, indigenous peoples will continue to be vulnerable to serious 
abuses of their individual and collective human rights, and extractive activities that affect 
indigenous peoples will continue to face serious social and economic problems. 
</p>
<p><b> C.  Plan of work 
</b></p>
<p>69. In implementing his mandate since his appointment in 2008, the Special Rapporteur 
has actively pursued his core tasks of monitoring the human rights conditions of indigenous 
peoples worldwide and of promoting the improvement of those conditions in a spirit of 
cooperation and responsiveness. In doing so, the Special Rapporteur has been mindful of 
the directive of the Human Rights Council, namely, that he should place a particular 
emphasis on the promotion of good practices and technical assistance. 
</p>
<p>70. The reports submitted by the Special Rapporteur over the past three years tell of the 
situations in which he has intervened in particular countries in order to promote a clearer 
understanding of existing problems, as well as to make concrete recommendations to 
address those problems based on the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of 
Indigenous Peoples and other relevant international instruments. In the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s view, the numerous instances in which he has contributed actively to the 
process of developing new policies, legislation and constitutional reforms concerning 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, at the request of Governments, international organizations and 
indigenous peoples are also significant. 
</p>
<p>71. The effects of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work has been clearly dependent on the 
capacity of the actors involved to enter into a principled dialogue in which the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s recommendations and proposals may serve as the basis for finding solutions 
to the identified problems within the framework of the protection of indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights. In a number of cases, his recommendations have been at least partially taken into 
account in the definition of State policies and legislation. The impact of the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s thematic analysis of key areas is also discernable in comparative practice, and 
particularly in a number of recent decisions by domestic courts.11 
</p>
<p>72. In defining his plan of work for the remainder of his mandate, the Special 
Rapporteur is guided by a pragmatic approach that seeks to increase the practical effect of 
his activities within the limitations in which he operates. His experience over the past three 
years indicates that this can be best achieved by identifying and promoting shared 
understandings of the basic contents of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights, as well as to provide 
practical guidance on how to operationalize them.  
</p>
<p>  
   11 See for example decisions 2878-2007 (21 December 2009) and T-2451120 (3 March 2011) of the     
</p>
<p>  Constitutional Court of Colombia. </p>


<p>73. As pointed out above, the question of the rights of indigenous peoples in the context 
of natural resource extraction and development projects has invariably emerged during his 
activities as a major area of concern and potential human rights abuse. The responses to the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire, significant both in number and in quality, have 
provided the Special Rapporteur with a clear indication of the need to continue working in 
this area.  
</p>
<p>74. In this respect, the Special Rapporteur believes that an effective way to advance in 
the fulfilment of his mandate during the years ahead is to focus on the elaboration of a set 
of guidelines or principles that will provide specific orientation to Governments, indigenous 
peoples and corporations regarding the protection of indigenous rights in the context of 
resource extraction or development projects. The need for specific guidelines was 
underlined in several of the responses to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire, 
particularly those from Governments and several business corporations and associations.  
</p>
<p>75. The elaboration of a set of guidelines or principles that operationalize the scope and 
content of the rights of indigenous peoples in the context of development or extractive 
projects affecting their territories, as well as of the kind of institutional measures required to 
guarantee the enjoyment of those rights in this context, is fully consistent with the particular 
emphasis that the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s mandate places on the promotion of best practices 
and the provision of technical assistance to Governments.  
</p>
<p>76. Moreover, this line of action is directly connected to the kind of operational 
measures required by the guiding principles on business and human rights within the 
&#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; framework recently endorsed by the Human Rights Council 
in its resolution 17/4. The guiding principles specify that States, as part of their duty to 
protect human rights in the context of business enterprises, should &#8220;enforce laws that are 
aimed at, or have the effect of, requiring business enterprises to respect human rights&#8221; 
while also providing &#8220;effective guidance to corporate actors&#8221; on how to respect human 
rights throughout their operations.12 
</p>
<p>77. In his commentaries to these principles, the Special Representative of the Secretary- 
General emphasized that the fulfilment of State&#8217;s duties in this context requires greater 
clarity in some areas of law and policy, such as those governing access to land, including 
entitlements in relation to ownership or use of land.13 Furthermore, he noted the need for 
States to provide &#8220;clear guidance to business enterprises on respecting human rights&#8221;, 
including methods to enhance human rights due diligence that recognize the &#8220;specific 
challenges that may be faced by indigenous peoples&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>78. Working towards the operationalization of indigenous peoples rights and of the 
institutional safeguard required to make them effective in the context of natural resource 
extraction or development projects could constitute, in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s view, a 
useful tool in the hands of indigenous peoples and Governments when they define more 
effective legal frameworks and policies in this area, and also to provide guidance to 
corporate actors in this regard.  
</p>
<p>79. While continuing to work in the fulfilment of all the areas of work defined by his 
mandate, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s work towards the operationalization of indigenous 
peoples&#8217; rights in the context of extractive projects will require a rerouting of significant 
efforts and of human and material resources. As stated above, the Special Rapporteur 
considers of utmost importance the bridging of the divergent viewpoints of States, 
indigenous peoples and corporate actors in this regard, which necessarily entails the 
opening of a process of wide consultations and dialogue with all the actors concerned. 
Expert consultations and studies on specific areas will also be required to promote an 
</p>
<p>  
   12 A/HRC/17/31, annex, principles 3(a)-(c). 
  13 Ibid., principle 8. </p>


<p>understanding of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights that is effective and practicable within the 
domestic policy frameworks and business practices in which these projects are 
implemented.   
</p>
<p>80. Many debates will ensue, and are surely required, concerning the existing extractive 
model and its broader social and environmental impact. In the meantime, indigenous 
peoples will continue to be vulnerable to human rights abuse, which erodes the basis of 
their self-determination and, in some cases, endangers their very existence as distinct 
peoples. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur fully adheres to the kind of &#8220;principled 
pragmatism&#8221; assumed by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human 
rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises: &#8220;an unflinching 
commitment to the principle of strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights 
as it relates to business, coupled with a pragmatic attachment to what works best in creating 
change where it matters most &#8211; in the daily lives of people.&#8221;14  
</p>
<p><b>  IV.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p><b>81. The Special Rapporteur gratefully acknowledges the continuous support of 
States, indigenous peoples, international organizations and bodies, business 
enterprises and other civil society actors in fulfilling his mandate. In particular, he 
expresses his gratitude to the reaffirmation of the trust vested in him by the Human 
Rights Council, as shown by the renewal of his mandate in May 2011 for an additional 
period of three years. 
</b></p>
<p><b>82. On the basis of the experience gained during the first term of his mandate, the 
Special Rapporteur has come to identity natural resource extraction and other major 
development projects in or near indigenous territories as one of the most significant 
sources of abuse of the rights of indigenous peoples worldwide. In its prevailing form, 
the model for advancing with natural resource extraction within the territories of 
indigenous peoples appears to run counter to the self-determination of indigenous 
peoples in the political, social and economic spheres. 
</b></p>
<p><b>83. The many responses received from Governments, indigenous peoples and 
organizations, business corporations and other actors to the questionnaire distributed 
by the Special Rapporteur in 2011 point to a state of shared awareness and concern 
about the past negative effects of extractive operations for indigenous peoples in many 
situations, in the light of the particular attachment of indigenous peoples to their 
traditional lands, territories and natural resources. However, the responses to the 
questionnaire also provide a strong indication of the existence of conflicting points of 
view concerning the potential adverse impact and benefits of extractive or 
development projects in indigenous territories; the practical implications in this 
context of international standards affirming the rights of indigenous peoples, and the 
kind of measures required to fulfil the responsibilities of States, corporate actors and 
indigenous peoples themselves.  
</b></p>
<p><b>84. In this connection, while the existing problems and challenges ahead are 
significant and complex, the Special Rapporteur is encouraged by what he perceives 
to be a growing degree of awareness and assumption of responsibility on the part of 
States and corporate actors. This growing awareness opens a historical opportunity 
for advancing towards a common normative understanding and the 
operationalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and related institutional safeguards in 
the context of natural resource extraction and development projects in indigenous 
territories. This process would not only contribute to enhanced implementation of the 
</b></p>
<p>  
             14 E/CN.4/2006/97, para. 81. </p>


<p><b>standards affirmed in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples and other international instruments, but also to operationalizing and realizing 
the &#8220;Protect, Respect and Remedy&#8221; framework.  
</b></p>
<p><b>85. The responses received to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s questionnaire reveal a 
number of State legal and institutional frameworks, domestic court decisions, business 
internal policies and pilot projects that address or are relevant to indigenous peoples&#8217; 
rights in the context of extractive industries. In the opinion of the Special Rapporteur, 
these various initiatives deserve careful consideration and may provide useful 
guidance when devising effective models for securing the rights of indigenous peoples 
in the extractive projects affecting them.   
</b></p>
<p><b>86. The Special Rapporteur considers that his mandate is well placed within the 
wider United Nations human rights system to promote the operationalization of 
indigenous peoples&#8217; rights and related institutional guarantees in the context of 
resource extraction and development operations, in a manner that builds on the work 
of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights and 
transnational corporations and other business enterprises. This effort could be 
pursued through the development of specific guidelines or principles aimed at helping 
States, corporate actors and indigenous peoples in fulfilling the responsibilities that 
arise from international indigenous rights standards. In the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
view, this task is entirely within and will significantly contribute to the fulfilment of 
his mandate to examine ways and means of overcoming existing obstacles to the full 
and effective protection of the rights of indigenous peoples and to identify, exchange 
and promote best practices.15 
</b></p>
<p><b>87. Advancing in the development of such guidelines requires a broadly 
encompassing dialogue with Governments, indigenous peoples&#8217; organizations, 
corporate actors, international institutions and other relevant stakeholders, in which 
consensus-building is a key element. In order to advance towards this goal, the Special 
Rapporteur has incorporated as a top priority for the second term of his mandate the 
realization of consultations with stakeholders, the exchange of best practices and the 
undertaking of specific expert studies in relation to indigenous peoples and extractive 
industries.  
</b></p>
<p><b>88. In undertaking this course of action, the Special Rapporteur expects to count 
on, as he has done in the past, the active support of all actors concerns. Furthermore, 
his work towards the operationalization of indigenous peoples&#8217; rights can benefit from 
and contribute to ongoing initiatives of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues 
and the Expert Mechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, with which the 
Special Rapporteur has established relations of cooperation in fulfilment of his 
mandate. 
</b></p>
<p><b>89. In view of the above, when considering the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s future action, 
the Human Rights Council may wish to entrust him with the specific task of working 
towards the operationalization of the rights of indigenous peoples and related 
institutional guarantees in the context of natural resource extraction and development 
projects affecting indigenous territories, with the aim of his presenting to the Council 
a set of specific guidelines or principles in 2013. The Council may further consider the 
necessity of affording additional support to the Special Rapporteur in performing this 
task.
