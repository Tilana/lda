Thirteenth session 
</b>Agenda item 3 
<b>Promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, 
social and cultural rights, including the right to development 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Report of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or 
belief, Asma Jahangir 
</b></p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In the present report, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief gives 
an overview of her mandate activities with regard to communications sent to States 
concerning individual cases, her participation in recent conferences and meetings, country 
visits undertaken by the Special Rapporteur and further follow-up activities of the mandate. 
</p>
<p> In addition, the Special Rapporteur discusses early warning signs of discrimination 
and violence on the grounds or in the name of religion or belief. These early warning signs 
relate to action, or inaction, by State actors, non-State actors and international or external 
factors. 
</p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur also provides an overview of some general patterns and 
issues of concern related to her mandate. In this regard, she distinguishes between 
discrimination and violence on the grounds of religion or belief (i.e. based on the religious 
affiliation of the victim) and discrimination and violence in the name of religion or belief 
(i.e. based on or arrogated to religious tenets of the perpetrator). 
 In her conclusions and recommendations, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes that 
prevention is key for creating an atmosphere of religious tolerance. The structure of the 
State, its method of governance, educational policies and the commitment of Governments 
and societies to fundamental human rights are the central ingredients that can act as 
precautionary factors in creating religious harmony or contributing factors to religious 
friction. The Special Rapporteur identifies some appropriate responses by various actors, 
including recommendations with regard to the role of the State, the role of religious leaders 
and civil society, and the role of the international community and human rights 
mechanisms. She stresses that States have the primary responsibility for implementing 
international human rights standards, including freedom of religion or belief. Politicians 
from different political parties should undertake brainstorming sessions on how to address 
new challenges in an increasingly globalized world. Religious leaders and civil society as a 
whole may also play an important role in supporting and encouraging religious tolerance. 
Emerging tensions in a given society may be defused, for example, if religious leaders 
</p>

<p><b>2</b> GE.09-17648 
</p>
<p>clearly affirm the importance of the right to freedom of religion or belief for all and in all 
its dimensions. Finally, the international community and human rights mechanisms should 
continue monitoring freedom of religion or belief worldwide and detecting early warning 
signs of intolerance that may ultimately lead to discrimination on the grounds or in the 
name of religion or belief. Treaty bodies and special procedures can take the opportunity to 
follow up on the recommendations from the universal periodic review and continue to 
address the underlying human rights issues in their concluding observations, allegation 
letters and mission reports.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In December 2007, the Human Rights Council decided to extend the mandate of the 
Special Rapporteur for a further period of three years. In this context, the Human Rights 
Council, in its resolution 6/37, invited the mandate holder to: (a) promote the adoption of 
measures at the national, regional and international levels to ensure the promotion and 
protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief; (b) identify existing and emerging 
obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief and present 
recommendations on ways and means to overcome such obstacles; (c) continue her/his 
efforts to examine incidents and governmental actions that are incompatible with the 
provisions of the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief and to recommend remedial 
measures as appropriate; and (d) continue to apply a gender perspective, inter alia, through 
the identification of gender-specific abuses, in the reporting process, including in 
information collection and in recommendations. 
</p>
<p>2. Since taking up her mandate in July 2004, the current Special Rapporteur has 
devoted her reports to a number of thematic issues associated with the mandate. These 
thematic analyses related to the question of conversion;1 the freedom of religion or belief of 
detainees;2 religious symbols;3 incitement to racial and religious hatred and the promotion 
of tolerance;4 religious intolerance and the rights of women;5 the adverse effects of some 
counter-terrorism measures on the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief;6 religious 
minorities and new religious movements;7 the situation of refugees, asylum-seekers and 
internally displaced persons;8 the situation of persons with atheistic or non-theistic beliefs;9 
citizenship issues and religious discrimination in administrative procedures;10 
discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the enjoyment of economic, 
social and cultural rights;11 and the situation of persons in vulnerable situations as regards 
their ability to freely exercise their right to freedom of religion or belief.12 
</p>
<p>3. As the term of the current mandate holder will expire in July 2010, this will be her 
last general report to the Human Rights Council.13 The Special Rapporteur would like to 
take this opportunity to thank all the Member States for their cooperation and to particularly 
acknowledge the support of those Governments who invited her for an in situ visit. The 
work of the Special Rapporteur could not have been conducted without the constant support 
provided by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR). Above all, 
the Special Rapporteur would like to acknowledge the excellent services rendered by the

<p>staff members assisting the mandate, who often worked under huge pressure from all sides 
and yet continued to respect deadlines and the quality of work entrusted to them.  
</p>
<p>4. In the present report, the Special Rapporteur first gives an overview of her mandate 
activities. She then discusses early warning signs of discrimination and violence on the 
grounds or in the name of religion or belief. In this context, she also provides an overview 
of some general patterns and issues of concern related to her mandate. In her conclusions 
and recommendations, she identifies some appropriate responses by various actors, 
including recommendations with regard to the role of the State, religious leaders and civil 
society, and the international community and human rights mechanisms.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Overview of mandate activities 
</b>5. The Special Rapporteur wishes to provide a brief overview of her activities with 
regard to: (a) communications sent to States concerning individual cases; (b) her 
participation in recent conferences and meetings; (c) country visits undertaken; and (d) 
further follow-up activities of the mandate. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Communications 
</b></p>
<p>6. The communications sent to States and the replies received have been indispensable 
tools for the Special Rapporteur in monitoring and verifying allegations of human rights 
violations falling within her mandate. They open up the possibility of constructively 
engaging with States in examining incidents and State actions as follow-up to these 
communications. The information received from all sides has also proven useful for the 
identification of existing and emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of 
religion or belief. This information has also enabled the identification of good practices put 
in place by States in this regard. 
</p>
<p>7. Since the establishment of the mandate in 1986, the Special Rapporteur has sent 
more than 1,200 allegation letters and urgent appeals to a total of 130 States. Summaries of 
these communications are reflected in the various reports of the Special Rapporteur and 
represent important documentation of individual cases and issues of concern for the 
mandate. The Special Rapporteur regularly updates the online digest of her framework for 
communications, which illustrates the international human rights standards pertaining to 
freedom of religion or belief with relevant excerpts of the reports since the inception of the 
mandate.14  
</p>
<p>8. The communications sent by the Special Rapporteur between 1 December 2008 and 
30 November 2009, as well as the replies received from States as of 30 January 2010, are 
summarized in an addendum to the present report (A/HRC/13/40/Add.1). She welcomes the 
decision taken during the sixteenth meeting of special rapporteurs, special representatives, 
independent experts and chairpersons of working groups to produce a joint communications 
report in future.15 Consequently, all mandate holders&#8217; communications will be compiled by 
country in alphabetical and chronological order in common reports, to be presented at each 
regular session of the Human Rights Council. In comparison to the current annual cycle of 
separate communication reports by each individual mandate, the future practice &#8212; with a 
more frequent reporting cycle of joint reports &#8212; will also ensure that the content of

<p>communications and any follow-up given to them can feed into the universal periodic 
review process more effectively. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Participation in conferences and meetings 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur attended numerous meetings with representatives of States, 
religious and belief communities and civil society organizations in order to consider the 
situation of freedom of religion or belief at the national and international levels. These 
meetings were mainly held during country visits or at United Nations offices in New York 
and Geneva. The Special Rapporteur also participated in conferences related to the 
mandate, delivering, for example, a public lecture on religions and religious freedom on 19 
February 2009 in Bamberg, Germany. 
</p>
<p>10. Furthermore, she contributed to the preparatory process leading up to the Durban 
Review Conference16 and addressed its main committee on 23 April 2009 in Geneva, 
Switzerland. During the Durban Review Conference, she also participated in a side event 
on freedom of expression and incitement to racial or religious hatred, organized by 
OHCHR.17 
</p>
<p>11. In addition, she participated in a round-table discussion on &#8220;Special procedures: 
Early warning and emerging issues&#8221;, held on 23 October 2009 in New York.18 She also 
delivered a keynote speech on the role and significance of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s 
special procedures, organized on 1 December 2009 by the OHCHR Regional Office for 
South-East Asia in Bangkok. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Country visits 
</b></p>
<p>12. Country visits are an essential part of the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s activities. Such fact-
finding missions offer an important opportunity for the Special Rapporteur to interact with 
various State officials as well as to meet representatives of religious or belief communities 
and other members of civil society. In her country reports, the Special Rapporteur tries to 
identify existing and emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of 
religion or belief and present practical recommendations on ways and means to overcome 
such obstacles. She also seeks to encourage the adoption of measures at the national level to 
ensure the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of religion or belief. In this 
regard, she welcomes the willingness of several States to re-examine draft laws and take 
into account the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur in her country reports.

</p>
<p><b> D. Follow-up activities 
</b></p>
<p>14. Follow-up is considered a crucial element in ensuring that appropriate measures are 
taken in response to the work of the special procedures. Follow-up includes the full range 
of measures taken to encourage, facilitate and monitor the implementation of 
recommendations contained in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s country reports, communication 
reports and thematic reports. In addition to States &#8212; which have the main responsibility for 
implementing the recommendations &#8212; key partners at the national level who might be 
involved in follow-up activities include national human rights institutions, civil society 
organizations and United Nations country teams. 
</p>
<p>15. As indicated in her previous report to the Human Rights Council,19 the Special 
Rapporteur has re-established the initial approach20 of sending follow-up letters after 
country visits in order to receive updated information about the implementation of her 
recommendations at the national level. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur transmitted in 
November 2009 follow-up tables to the Governments of the eight countries which she had 
visited from 2005 to 2007. These tables contain the conclusions and recommendations from 
her mission report and follow-up information from relevant United Nations documents, 
including from the universal periodic review, special procedures and treaty bodies. A third 
column includes information provided by the State on the consideration given to these 
recommendations, the steps taken to implement them and any constraints which may 
prevent their implementation. These follow-up tables will also be uploaded onto the Special 
Rapporteur&#8217;s website.21 
</p>
<p>16. The communications reports provide an opportunity for the Special Rapporteur to 
follow up on allegation letters and urgent appeals, in particular through her observations on 
the communications sent and the replies received from States. In some instances, the 
Special Rapporteur has also sent follow-up communications to request further clarification 
or information from the State concerned. While the Special Rapporteur has taken up some 
individual cases for a second time, in particular in the absence of a State reply and when 
new developments warrant sending another allegation letter or urgent appeal, the main 
follow-up to communications is carried out by local, national or international civil society 
organizations. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the importance of being 
kept informed of any positive or negative developments in the relevant cases, including 
from the victims or the sources of the allegations. 
</p>
<p>17. The universal periodic review is another avenue for follow-up to country visits and 
special procedure communications. In addition, the Special Rapporteur can take up 
recommendations from the universal periodic review with regard to freedom of religion or 
belief when she subsequently visits the country concerned. During the five sessions of the 
universal periodic review which had been completed at the time of writing, religious issues 
were discussed with regard to 60 of the 80 countries reviewed so far. This fact illustrates 
that matters of freedom of religion or belief are of concern in a large number of countries in

<p>different regions of the world and that the international community is actively engaged in 
pursuing these issues. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Early warning signs of discrimination and violence on the 
grounds or in the name of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>18. As the Special Rapporteur has noted in previous reports, it is of utmost importance 
that due attention be given to early warning signs associated with her mandate. In this 
chapter, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s preliminary analysis of early warning signs of 
discrimination and violence on the grounds or in the name of religion also draws on the 
work which has already been undertaken by various human rights mechanisms as part of 
their respective mandates.22 
</p>
<p>19. According to Human Rights Council resolution 6/37, the Special Rapporteur on 
freedom of religion or belief is mandated to identify existing and emerging obstacles to the 
enjoyment of the right to freedom of religion or belief. Consequently, the mandate is not 
only limited to monitoring human rights violations, but also has a role to play in the 
detection of early warning signs of discrimination and violence. 
</p>
<p>20. For example, the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s predecessor warned in one of his country 
reports about the likelihood of the recurrence of extensive killings in the event of political 
exploitation of a certain situation.23 Unfortunately, his warning was prophetic, because six 
years later related communal violence again claimed more than one thousand lives. In her 
follow-up mission report another six years later, the current mandate holder also expressed 
concerns about the degree of polarization in some pockets of different faith groups and 
about the danger of chain reactions that can be triggered by communal tensions.24 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur is convinced that early action is required at the first warning 
signs of discrimination and violence on the grounds or in the name of religion or belief. 
Since assuming her mandate in July 2004, the Special Rapporteur has indeed noted a 
number of acts or behaviour of different stakeholders that can be regarded as early warning 
signs of discrimination and violence and therefore requires determined measures to counter 
them. 
</p>
<p>22. Early warning signs refer to action, or indeed inaction, by: (a) State actors, (b) non-
State actors and (c) international or external factors. 
</p>
<p><b> A. State actors 
</b></p>
<p>23. One early warning sign with regard to State actors is the lack of adequate legislation 
ensuring freedom of religion or belief in all its dimensions and prohibiting discrimination 
based on religion or belief.25 Provisions in some domestic laws, or even in constitutions,

<p>which accord privileged treatment to a particular religion, resulting in adverse effects on the 
members of other religions or beliefs, are of particular concern in this regard. 
Discriminatory laws that, for example, restrict citizenship to people with certain religious 
beliefs or that deny official documents on the grounds of the applicant&#8217;s religious affiliation 
may also lead to a lack of religious diversity in a given country. An additional indicator is 
the adoption of discriminatory legislation, in particular if State officials overtly justify such 
new laws. 
</p>
<p>24. A second early warning sign would be the lack of accountability for crimes and 
patterns of impunity following a human rights violation targeting members of a specific 
religious or belief community. It might be an indicator if members of several religious 
minorities are subject to persecution, violence and harassment. It is alarming if, in practice, 
victims of religious discrimination have no access to legal redress or if the existing 
domestic laws to protect them are not adequately implemented. In this regard, the inaction 
of the relevant State institutions or discriminatory acts of police officers, prosecutors and 
judges may be crucial indicators. 
</p><p>25. A third early warning sign is the existence of significant patterns of religious 
discrimination in State practices and policies. Such patterns are usually manifested in 
negative social, educational and economic indicators. For example, some domestic 
procedures for registration of religious communities are applied by the relevant authorities 
in a discriminatory manner; sometimes, the authorities even make the recognition of the 
legal status of a community applying for registration conditional on the agreement of 
another religious community. In addition, compulsory identification of a person&#8217;s religious 
affiliation on official identity documents carries a serious risk of abuse or subsequent 
discrimination based on religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>26. A fourth early warning sign is persistent negative stereotyping in public speeches by 
elected or other officials targeting members of specific religious or belief communities. 
Furthermore, it is disturbing if a Government uses State-controlled media to spread 
fabrications about targeted groups in order to condone or justify violence against members 
of these religious communities. Unfortunately, irrational fears about members of specific 
religious or belief communities may be easily exploited for political purposes. It may also 
be a negative indicator if members of certain religious communities cannot make their 
voices adequately heard by decision makers and the relevant State authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Non-State actors 
</b></p>
<p>27. Certain acts and behaviour of non-State actors may also constitute early warning 
signs of discrimination and violence on the grounds or in the name of religion or belief. 
Violent attacks on and harassment of persons based on their religious affiliation &#8212; real or 
presumed &#8212; may be pertinent indicators that warrant State intervention. In addition, the 
deliberate destruction of and attacks on places or worship and other religious sites of a 
specific community by non-State actors are worrying trends which need to be tackled at an 
early stage. 
</p>
<p>28. Furthermore, patterns of advocacy of religious hatred that could constitute 
incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence should be watched closely. In this regard, 
one early warning sign is if religious leaders, opinion-makers in the mass media or 
individuals spread messages of religious hatred, including using new information 
technologies such as blogs or online discussion sites. A further indicator is the preaching of 
hatred by religious leaders. Teaching at educational institutions that encourages religious 
bigotry and exploitation of children in a systematic and organized fashion is also a 
troubling sign. </p>


<p>GE.09-17648 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>29. Another early warning sign at the societal level would be the degree and persistence 
of religious tensions. Such tensions may exist either between different religions or among 
branches of the same religious or belief community. In this regard, a rise in militant 
extremism and a refusal to engage in any debate about religious issues may suggest further 
polarization along religious lines in the future. Another indicator for such polarization 
would be a situation where some non-State actors deliberately exclude members of other 
religious or belief communities from certain economic and social activities or employment 
opportunities. In addition, the ghettoization of certain religious communities or 
compartmentalization of various groups into distinct zones may perpetuate a lack of 
understanding and fear of others, thus creating a potential source of conflict between 
communities. 
</p>
<p><b> C. International or external factors 
</b></p>
<p>30. International or external factors may also contribute, either directly or indirectly, to 
discrimination and violence on the grounds or in the name of religion or belief. One early 
warning sign would be the adverse impact of actors who are based outside the country 
concerned, for example, foreign Governments, armed groups based in neighbouring 
countries, refugee groups or diasporas with vested interests.  
</p>
<p>31. Such foreign actors may have a motivation to create divisions between religious 
groups in the country concerned or even to perpetrate genocidal violence. According to 
article II of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 
the term &#8220;genocide&#8221; means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in 
whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, such as: (a) killing members of 
the group; (b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) 
deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical 
destruction in whole or in part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the 
group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group. It is the 
obligation of the international community to remain vigilant, particularly in detecting any 
early warning signs of intent to commit genocide or acts of genocide. 
</p>
<p>32. There are also a number of external factors that might further aggravate the situation 
in a given country and adversely affect the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief. Such 
external factors could be related to upcoming elections, for example, discriminatory voter 
registration, hate campaigning on religious lines and divisive vote-bank politics. A coup 
d&#8217;&#233;tat or any other change of the Government outside of a constitutionally sanctioned 
process may also spark a deterioration in the situation of religious minorities. Tensions that 
subsist over a long period of time may be another early warning sign, in particular if they 
are linked to past conflicts over places of worship, land, power or religious identity. In 
addition, natural disasters may trigger demands from some religious groups to curb so-
called &#8220;unethical conversions&#8221;, as was the case in some countries following the tsunami of 
December 2004 in the Indian Ocean. Other external factors might be significant flows of 
refugees or displaced persons resulting from a pattern of religious discrimination and 
encroachment on the traditional lands of minority communities, or enforced removal of 
these members from their lands. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. General patterns and issues of concern 
</b>33. The Special Rapporteur would also like to provide an overview of some general 
patterns and issues of concern related to her mandate. In this context, she wishes to 
distinguish between: (a) discrimination and violence &#8220;on the grounds of religion or belief&#8221;, 
i.e., based on the religious affiliation of the victim; and (b) discrimination and violence &#8220;in </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.09-17648 
</p>
<p>the name of religion or belief&#8221;, i.e., based on or arrogated to religious tenets of the 
perpetrator. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Discrimination and violence on the grounds of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>34. The most prominent example of a general, worrying pattern all over the world is the 
discrimination and violence suffered by members of religious minorities. Many religious 
minorities are in a vulnerable situation, which is further aggravated when States specifically 
target them by registering their members&#8217; names and scrutinizing these individuals. Worse 
still are laws that openly discriminate against individuals on the basis of religion or belief or 
the perceived lack of religious fervour. Indeed, dissenting or dispassionate believers are 
being marginalized and face interreligious or intra-religious problems. Admission to 
schools and employment in Government and private enterprises are denied to people 
because of their religious or belief affiliations. Many violent acts or threats against 
members of religious minorities are also perpetrated by non-State actors, all too often with 
impunity. 
</p>
<p>35. Another worrying general pattern is the targeting of places of worship and other 
religious buildings or properties. The Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about 
frequent attacks on places of worship and the desecration of cemeteries. Such attacks 
violate the rights of not only a single believer, but also the group of individuals forming the 
community attached to the place in question. In this regard, the General Assembly has 
adopted resolution 55/254 on protection of religious sites, calling upon all States to exert 
their utmost efforts to ensure that religious sites are fully respected and protected. 
</p>
<p>36. National policies, legislation and practices which are designed to combat terrorism 
have had and continue to have adverse effects on the enjoyment of freedom of religion or 
belief worldwide. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the worsening situation of 
minority communities in the wake of the events of 11 September 2001 and the 
estrangement of communities who earlier lived together without suspicion. While States are 
obliged to take effective measures to counter terrorism, the Special Rapporteur would like 
to underline that States must also ensure that counter-terrorism measures comply with their 
obligations under international law, including international human rights, refugee and 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>37. There are also further issues of concern in relation to her mandate, which seem to be 
more prevalent in particular regions or countries. For example, some domestic registration 
procedures for religious communities are applied in a discriminatory manner by the 
authorities, often curbing the freedom of religion or belief of minority communities such as 
new religious movements or indigenous peoples. In addition, she is concerned about undue 
State interference in religious teaching and dissemination of related publications, for 
example when the authorities censor, monitor and write sermons or persecute religious 
leaders. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur has noticed a number of restrictions imposed 
on different forms of religious expression, for example, on the wearing of distinctive 
clothing or head coverings. At the same time, she is concerned about reports of women who 
are forced to wear religious dress in public in certain countries.  
</p>
<p>38. A number of societies are facing obstacles to ending all forms of discrimination on 
religious grounds and creating informed public opinion that can effectively challenge 
religious bigotry. The Special Rapporteur has noticed with regret that, as far as her mandate 
is concerned, denunciation of human rights abuses is often selective; the religion of the 
victim and of the perpetrator, rather than the act itself, seems to be a determining factor as 
to who feels obliged to publicly condemn the incident. Where the victim belongs to one 
religion, but the perpetrator to another, public outrage from the victims&#8217; community 
unfortunately seems to be greater than if the perpetrator and the victim had the same </p>


<p>GE.09-17648 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>religion or belief. However, in addition to interreligious conflicts, intra-religious violence 
also warrants close monitoring and condemnation. All perpetrators, regardless of their or 
the victims&#8217; religious affiliation, should be brought to justice. 
</p><p>39. Similarly, the Special Rapporteur has noticed that, while criticism of major religions 
attracts a lot of attention at the national, regional and international levels, more attention 
should be focused on addressing the numerous cases of incitement to violence against 
smaller religions. Article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights obliges States to prohibit by law any advocacy of religious hatred that 
constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. However, the right to 
freedom of religion or belief does not include the right to have a religion or belief that is 
free from criticism or ridicule.26 The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the 
important role of an independent judiciary, which needs to adjudicate in each particular 
case according to its own circumstances and taking into account the specific context. There 
also have been cases of mob violence as a reaction to expressions of perceived criticism of 
religions and religious personalities. In this context, several special rapporteurs urged all 
actors to refrain from any form of violence and avoid fuelling hatred. In addition, States 
should promote the interrelated and indivisible nature of human rights and freedoms and 
advocate the use of legal remedies and the pursuance of a peaceful dialogue on matters 
which go to the heart of all multicultural societies.27 
</p>
<p>40. Religious education is another contentious issue which has sparked controversy in 
many societies. A number of countries have religious instruction in public schools in a 
particular religion, while other countries provide for school classes about the history of 
different religions. From a human rights perspective, the latter is less problematic provided 
that classes on the history of religions are given in a neutral and objective way. However, 
public education which includes instruction in a particular religion or belief is consistent 
with article 18, paragraph 4, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
only if provision is made for non-discriminatory exemptions or alternatives that would 
accommodate the wishes of parents and legal guardians.<b> </b>In some countries, religious 
instruction is mandatory, a situation which poses the problem of how to provide the same 
level of teaching to children belonging to religious minority groups. They are, in some 
instances, given no option but to receive instruction in the religion of the majority 
community. Only in a few cases are schools able to provide religious instruction to students 
of all the different religious or belief communities. During her interaction with 
Governments and school authorities, the Special Rapporteur has been made aware of the 
fact that some parents, who demanded that religious instruction be given in schools, often 
queried the contents of such religious instruction. This has invariably placed school 
authorities in a difficult situation, particularly where a religious community is itself divided 
and has no official spokesperson.<b> </b>The Toledo Guiding Principles on Teaching about 
Religions and Beliefs in Public Schools28 provide practical guidance for preparing curricula 
for teaching about religions and beliefs, as well as preferred procedures for ensuring 
fairness in the development of such curricula.

<p><b>14</b> GE.09-17648 
</p>
<p><b> B. Discrimination and violence in the name of religion or belief 
</b></p>
<p>41. Another worrying pattern is discrimination and violence in the name of religion or 
belief. As emphasized in the preamble of the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, 
it is essential to promote understanding, tolerance and respect in matters relating to freedom 
of religion and belief and to ensure that the use of religion or belief for ends inconsistent 
with the Charter of the United Nations, other relevant instruments of the United Nations 
and the purposes and principles of the 1981 Declaration is inadmissible. 
</p>
<p>42. Discrimination and violence in the name of religion or belief is at the heart of many 
conflicts which are &#8212; or are at least perceived to be &#8212; based on religious issues, often 
intertwined with particular ethnic, national, political or historical backgrounds. Since the 
creation of the mandate in 1986, various instances of discrimination and violence in the 
name of religion or belief have come to light both in thematic reports and during country 
visits or in the exchange of communications with States. The following examples from the 
exercise of mandate are designed to illustrate some forms of militant extremism and 
religious polarization, as well as the negative consequences that these phenomena may 
ultimately have for the enjoyment of human rights, including freedom of religion or belief. 
</p><p>43. In his annual report submitted to the Commission on Human Rights in 1993, the first 
mandate holder, Angelo Vidal d&#8217;Almeida Ribeiro, noted &#8220;how difficult it is to curb or 
eradicate the propagation of extremist and fanatical opinions and overcome the distrust 
opposing members of certain denominations. Although the phenomena of religious 
discrimination and intolerance are often caused by a variety of economic, social, political or 
cultural factors deriving from complex historical processes, they are frequently the result of 
sectarian or dogmatic intransigence. In view of their adverse effect on the stability of 
international relations, the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that States should be 
vigilant in this regard and make determined efforts to combat religious discrimination and 
intolerance at all levels&#8221;.29 
</p>
<p>44. The second mandate holder, Abdelfattah Amor, emphasized that the nature of 
religious extremism is such as to jeopardize the right of individuals and of peoples to peace 
and to prejudice human rights as a whole.30 He noted that religious extremism acts as a 
cancer in a religious group of any denomination and that it affects the members of that 
religious group just as much as those of other religious groups.31 He added that extremism 
in any religion, wherever it appears, openly or latently, covertly or overtly, and potentially 
or explicitly violent, merits a hard look at the causes &#8212; including economic and social 
causes &#8212; and at its immediate and longer-term effects.32 Additional aspects of extremism 
include such phenomena as collective suicides by followers of certain groups, terrorist acts 
by new religious movements and the impact of suicide attacks with an alleged religious 
motivation.33 
</p>
<p>45. Recent examples of discrimination and violence in the name of religion or belief can 
be found in the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s two latest reports on communications.34<b> </b>One of the 
examples given in those reports, which are obviously not exhaustive, refers to riots and 
attacks on places of worship perpetrated by members of a group who sought to impose their

<p>interpretation of religious law on all other individuals in that region. Another case involved 
an alleged instance of blasphemy where certain political and religious groups threatened to 
seal off a whole city and attack a religious minority unless the police arrested five members 
of this religious minority. In another incident, two members of a religious minority were 
killed after the perpetrator had requested to see the victims&#8217; identity cards, which state the 
religious affiliation of the bearer. Just before holding national elections in one country, a 
personal status law for one religious community was passed, which further entrenched 
discrimination and violence against women, girls and members of religious minorities. In a 
particular province of another country, a new criminal code was adopted for one religious 
community, effectively legalizing marital rape. Further examples of sectarian violence, 
religious persecution and atrocities committed in the name of religion are mentioned in the 
Special Rapporteur&#8217;s recent mission reports.35  
</p>
<p>46. In many cases, persons in a vulnerable situation, including children, women and 
converts, are targeted by discrimination or violence in the name of religion or belief. 
Children have been indoctrinated with religious intolerance and, unfortunately, continue to 
be used by certain non-State actors to perpetrate violence on others or themselves in the 
name of religion. Women also remain a constant target of religious intolerance. Their rights 
are violated in the name of religion or belief in the most self-righteous manner. Laws 
continue to discriminate against women particularly, for example in the field of personal 
law, on the insistence that only those laws conform to the religious beliefs of the woman&#8217;s 
religious community. 
</p>
<p>47. Non-State actors, and sometimes even State authorities, continue to threaten or 
discriminate against individuals who have changed their religion. This problem remains an 
alarming one in a number of countries, despite the fact that article 18 of the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights explicitly provides that freedom of thought, 
conscience and religion includes freedom to change religion or belief. Religious leaders and 
opinion makers should become aware that not only is conversion to their own religion or 
belief protected, but the decision to replace one&#8217;s current religion or belief with a different 
one is too. The possibility of changing, choosing, replacing and retaining one&#8217;s religion or 
belief is fundamental to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. No person ought to 
face intolerance, discrimination or persecution because of his or her decision to change 
religion or belief or not to have one. In addition, obliging individuals to disclose their 
religion or belief in official documents might increase their risk of being persecuted. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that theistic, non-theistic and atheistic 
believers and those who do not profess any religion or belief are equally protected. All of 
them have important roles to play in building pluralistic societies for the twenty-first 
century. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>48. <b>As long as discrimination and violence on the grounds or in the name of 
religion or belief persist at the national or global levels, tensions will continue and 
indeed also be exploited by various religious, political or militant forces. The reports 
over the years indicate that religious intolerance is not a natural outcome of diverse 
societies but is all too often manipulated by a few groups or individuals for various 
reasons. Issues of religion and belief are highly emotive and, once the germs of 
religious intolerance spread, it is hard to contain them. Intolerance breeds intolerance

<p><b>and curing it takes far longer than instigating it. The struggle against discrimination 
must be intensified and given higher priority by all societies and at all levels as a key 
human rights objective. 
</b>49. <b>Prevention is therefore key to creating an atmosphere of religious tolerance. 
The structure of the State, its method of governance and educational policies, and the 
commitment of Governments and societies to fundamental human rights are the 
central ingredients that can act as precautionary factors in creating religious harmony 
or contributing factors to religious friction. These principles also apply at the global 
level. Religious bigotry is not confined to any one region, nor does it recognize 
national boundaries. Denial &#8212; or perceived denial &#8212; of freedom of religion or belief 
in one region or country can trigger reactions in another part of the world. The basic 
principles of freedom of religion or belief must find equal respect in all societies. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that all human rights are universal, 
indivisible and interdependent and interrelated. 
</b></p>
<p>50. <b>Through research, the information received by the Special Rapporteur, 
exchange with experts, country visits and communications with States, some general 
patterns and issues of concern can be identified (see paragraphs 33&#8211;47 above). There 
are indeed several contentious issues that societies are trying to resolve. While some of 
these religious issues are dealt with in a careful and well thought-out manner, other 
issues have unfortunately been allowed to fester until the controversy erupts into 
violence. However, there are also some good practices and innovative approaches with 
regard to freedom of religion or belief that the Special Rapporteur continues to share, 
inter alia, through her country mission reports. 
</b></p>
<p>51. <b>With a view to promoting the adoption of measures at the national, regional 
and international levels to ensure the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of religion or belief, the Special Rapporteur would like to present some ideas 
for appropriate responses by various actors. Consequently, the Special Rapporteur 
identifies the following measures and recommendations with regard to: (a) the role of 
the State; (b) the role of religious leaders and civil society; and (c) the role of the 
international community and human rights mechanisms. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Role of the State 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>States have the main responsibility for implementing international human 
rights standards, including on the promotion and protection of freedom of religion or 
belief. On the one hand, States must refrain from violating freedom of religion or 
belief and, on the other hand, they also have the obligation to protect persons under 
their jurisdiction from violations of their rights, including abuses committed by non-
State actors. Measures should not only consist in prosecuting the perpetrators of such 
acts and providing compensation to the victims, but also in devising specific 
preventive action to avoid the recurrence of such acts in future. 
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The legislative and executive branches should adopt non-discriminatory laws 
and policies which aim at achieving equality. Domestic legislation must also be in 
conformity with article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. Indeed, incitement to religious hatred can be an indicator of emerging 
tensions and the relevant authorities should find the most effective ways to protect 
individuals against others&#8217; advocacy of hatred and violence. In this regard, an 
independent and impartial judiciary, which examines each case on its own merits, is 
vital to ensuring that neither religious freedom nor freedom of expression is unduly 
restricted.  </b></p>


<p>GE.09-17648 <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>With regard to preventive approaches, the Special Rapporteur would like to 
emphasize that members of religious minorities need to have their voices heard by 
being given adequate access to decision makers and State authorities. The executive 
power, the administration and political leaders should develop human rights-based 
policies and communication strategies. They should also raise awareness and educate 
people about religious diversity, thus enabling societies to adopt a progressive attitude 
towards the beliefs of other communities. Doing so will help to eliminate the cause of 
irrational fears about some religious groups and prevent those fears being exploited 
for political purposes. 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>Politicians from different political parties should undertake brainstorming 
sessions on how to address new challenges in an increasingly globalized world. Such 
joint brainstorming could eventually lead to practical actions to mainstream diversity 
and implement inclusive approaches, for example, in housing projects, school 
curricula and nominations to statutory bodies. The Special Rapporteur has noted that 
religious minorities in many countries have less opportunity to participate effectively 
in decision-making, including in political and economic fields. Yet, their effective 
participation and consultation at all levels of decision-making is crucial to ensuring 
that their issues of concern are given adequate attention and enabling informed policy 
decisions.  
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>In addition, children from religious minorities seem to suffer 
disproportionately from unequal access to good-quality education. Consequently, the 
relevant authorities need to ensure equal opportunities and equal access to education 
in order to prevent adverse economic and social consequences for new generations. 
Special temporary measures in this regard may be envisaged to empower members of 
those religious communities that have suffered on account of historic discriminatory 
practices. However, the effectiveness of such affirmative action should be measured 
and its progress monitored. 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>It is of utmost importance that States and educational institutions find more 
creative strategies for ensuring that freedom of religion or belief is fully extended to 
all children and providing them with good-quality education that promotes tolerance, 
mutual understanding and respect. In this regard, teacher-training programmes may 
help to ensure that teachers have a non-biased attitude to different religious or belief 
communities. There is also significant scope for voluntary school exchanges with other 
countries. In this regard, the 2001 International Consultative Conference on School 
Education in relation to Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tolerance and Non-
discrimination recommended that teachers and students are provided with voluntary 
opportunities for meetings and exchanges with their counterparts of different 
religions or beliefs. Members of the local authorities should also visit schools and talk 
to youth representatives as a way to determine the actual level of tolerance in society. 
Regarding the recruitment and indoctrination of children for the purposes of militant 
groups, the Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need to monitor State institutions such 
as orphanages, prisons or schools.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>In addition, States should not allow activities which contravene human rights, 
even if such activities are seemingly based on religious or traditional practices. In this 
regard, the Special Rapporteur and her predecessor have referred to female genital 
mutilation as an example of a practice that is harmful to women&#8217;s health.</b>36<b> Since 
female genital mutilation is often wrongly associated with religion, the Special 
Rapporteur has welcomed statements which clarify religious views on this harmful

<p><b>practice and prohibit the abuse of the female body.</b>37<b> The General Assembly also 
referred, in its resolution 63/181, to the need to address the situations of violence and 
discrimination that affect many women as well as other individuals on the grounds or 
in the name of religion or belief or in accordance with cultural and traditional 
practices, and the misuse of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of 
the United Nations, as well as other relevant instruments of the United Nations. 
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>The State may also envisage providing a forum for interreligious and intra-
religious dialogue. However, such a dialogue should neither be formulated in a 
compulsory or condescending manner nor imposed by the State. The States&#8217; policies 
in this regard should give room and space for the variety of religions and beliefs, thus 
encouraging opportunities for interaction and understanding. The best approach to 
interreligious and intra-religious dialogue is when the initiative for such activities 
comes from the religious communities themselves, for which the State may then 
provide facilities or some funding. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Role of religious leaders and civil society 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Religious leaders and civil society as a whole may play an important role in 
supporting and encouraging religious tolerance. For example, it may be useful in 
defusing emerging tensions in a given society if religious leaders clearly affirm the 
importance of the right to freedom of religion or belief for everybody and in all its 
dimensions. This includes a reaffirmation of the right to convert to a different religion 
or express views on other religions or beliefs, even if such views are considered 
contentious. At the same time, all actors have to abide by the prohibition of advocacy 
of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, 
pursuant to article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
Political Rights. 
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>Members and leaders of different religious communities should envisage 
participating in interreligious and intra-religious dialogues at various levels and with 
a wide selection of participants. While joint declarations and statements by religious 
leaders are important, the Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize the vital role 
of initiatives, meetings and joint actions at the grass-roots level. It is evident that 
interreligious dialogue alone does not solve underlying problems; however, it may be a 
first step in the right direction. Interreligious dialogue should not only be an 
intellectual and theological exercise, but should also prompt the silent majority to look 
for a common strategy on how to reduce tensions and promote tolerance. Exchanges 
of views should also include believers who are dispassionate about their faith as well 
as atheistic and non-theistic believers and members of religious minorities. Any 
dialogue would also greatly benefit from the views of women, who tend to be 
marginalized in major interreligious and intra-religious dialogue events. Women are 
among those who suffer the most from religious intolerance, yet the Special 
Rapporteur has noticed that groups of women from different religions or beliefs have 
been very effective human rights advocates in situations of communal tensions. 
</b></p>
<p>62. <b>Artists may also play an important role in educating the public about religious 
tolerance and building bridges between different communities. Journalists, lawyers 
and human rights defenders can also make a difference, especially when their 
statements and actions transcend religious boundaries. There are a number of

</b></p>
<p><b>examples where individuals &#8212; crossing all religious boundaries &#8212; have come to each 
other&#8217;s rescue in situations of communal violence.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Members of religious communities, civil society organizations and national 
human rights institutions and academics should also be involved in human rights-
based teaching efforts. The Toledo Guiding Principles on Teaching about Religions 
and Beliefs in Public Schools encourage the establishment, at different levels, of 
advisory bodies that take an inclusive approach to involving different stakeholders in 
the preparation and implementation of curricula and the training of teachers. Those 
bodies should be chosen in ways that are inclusive, ensure openness and competence 
with respect to issues that may arise, and create input channels for major 
stakeholders. This involves taking into account the opinions, interests and sensitivities 
not only of the pupils, their parents or guardians, the teacher and school 
administrators, but also a variety of other stakeholders, including representatives of 
various religion and belief communities, parent and teacher organizations and other 
civil society organizations. Interreligious councils may play a useful role in this 
process, provided that they are structured in ways that ensure broad representation, 
or provided that those not represented on such councils have alternative channels for 
communicating their concerns. 
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>Furthermore, the traditional print or audio-visual media, as well as actors in 
new information technologies, have an important role in the promotion of religious 
tolerance. The media can serve as a watchdog for discriminatory government policies 
and a lively, multifaceted public-interest debate can give voice to different viewpoints. 
Consequently, mass media should take steps to: (a) ensure that their workforces are 
diverse and representative of society as a whole; (b) address as far as possible issues of 
concern to all groups in society; (c) seek a multiplicity of sources and voices within 
different communities, rather than representing communities as monolithic blocs; and 
(d) adhere to high standards of information provision that meet recognized 
professional and ethical standards.</b>38<b> In this regard, self-regulation, where effective, 
appears to be the most appropriate way to address professional issues relating to the 
media. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Role of the international community and human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>The international community and human rights mechanisms should continue 
monitoring freedom of religion or belief worldwide. The General Assembly, the 
Human Rights Council &#8212; including through the universal periodic review process &#8212; 
and the system of special procedures and treaty bodies also have important roles in 
detecting early warning signs of discrimination and violence on the grounds or in the 
name of religion or belief. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>The General Assembly, in its resolution 62/90, declared 2010 the International 
Year for the Rapprochement of Cultures, and recommended that, during the course 
of the year, appropriate events be organized on interreligious and intercultural 
dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace, inter alia, a high-level dialogue 
and/or informal interactive hearings with civil society. In its resolution 63/181, the 
General Assembly expressed concern over the persistence of institutionalized social 
intolerance and discrimination practised against many in the name of religion or

<p><b>belief. Furthermore, the General Assembly invited all actors to address, in the context 
of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, inter alia, the following issues within the 
framework of international human rights: (a) the rise of religious extremism affecting 
religions in all parts of the world; (b) the situations of violence and discrimination that 
affect many women as well as other individuals on the grounds or in the name of 
religion or belief or in accordance with cultural and traditional practices; (c) the 
misuse of religion or belief for ends inconsistent with the Charter of the United 
Nations, as well as other relevant instruments of the United Nations. 
</b></p>
<p>67. <b>The Human Rights Council and its working group on the universal periodic 
review have also discussed a number of general or country-specific issues related to 
freedom of religion or belief. The universal periodic review process offers a unique 
possibility to assess the human rights records of all United Nations Member States on 
a regular basis, i.e., every four years. One of the reports that are submitted to the 
working group on the universal periodic review for each State under review is a 
compilation of the information contained in the reports of treaty bodies, special 
procedures (including observations and comments by the State concerned) and other 
relevant official United Nations documents. Thus, the recommendations by the treaty 
bodies and special procedures, including on freedom of religion or belief, feed into the 
universal periodic review process. In addition, many of the recommendations which 
emanate from the peer review refer to issues of freedom of religion or belief. While 
most of these recommendations made during the interactive dialogue are supported 
by the State under review, some recommendations pertinent to freedom of religion or 
belief have subsequently been rejected by the Government concerned. Treaty bodies 
and special procedures can take the opportunity to follow up the recommendations 
from the universal periodic review &#8212; including those rejected &#8212; and continue to 
address human rights issues in the treaty bodies&#8217; concluding observations or in the 
special procedures&#8217; allegation letters and mission reports. 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>Early warning signs identified by the different human rights mechanisms also 
need to reach the political and conflict-prevention bodies of the United Nations. 
Effective channels of communication are needed between different parts of the United 
Nations system in order to allow decision makers to take action with full knowledge of 
the facts on the ground. Member States have the main responsibility for facilitating 
the work of the special procedures, cooperating with them and following up their 
recommendations. Stakeholders in the field could also benefit more from specific 
recommendations from the special procedures in the aftermath of violence, in order to 
address the root causes of such violence and prevent its recurrence.
