<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Context and definition of human rights education 
</b></p>
<p>1. The international community has increasingly demonstrated consensus regarding the 
fundamental contribution of human rights education to the realization of human rights. 
Human rights education is aimed at developing an understanding of our common 
responsibility to make human rights a reality in every community and in society at large. In 
that sense, it contributes to the long-term prevention of human rights abuses and violent 
conflicts, the promotion of equality and sustainable development and the enhancement of 
participation in decision-making processes within a democratic system.  
</p>
<p>2. Provisions on human rights education have been incorporated into many 
international instruments and documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights (art. 26); the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination (art. 7); the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 
(art. 13); the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading 
Treatment or Punishment (art. 10); the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against Women (art. 10); the Convention on the Rights of the Child 
(art. 29); the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant 
Workers and Members of Their Families (art. 33); the Convention on the Rights of Persons 
with Disabilities (arts. 4 and 8); the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action (Part I, 
paras. 33&#8211;34; Part II, paras. 78&#8211;82); the Programme of Action of the International 
Conference on Population and Development (paras. 7.3 and 7.37); the Durban Declaration 
and Programme of Action (Declaration, paras. 95&#8211;97; Programme of Action, paras. 129&#8211;
139) and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference (paras. 22 and 107); and 
the 2005 World Summit Outcome (para. 131). 
3. In December 2011, the General Assembly adopted, without a vote, the United 
Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training. The Declaration states that 
human rights education provides persons with knowledge and skills and develops their 
attitudes and behaviours so as to empower them to enjoy and exercise their rights, and to 
respect and uphold the rights of others (art. 2). It affirms that States, and where applicable 
relevant governmental authorities, have the primary responsibility to promote and ensure 
human rights education and training, and that States should create a safe and enabling 
environment for the engagement of civil society and other relevant stakeholders in those 
processes (art. 7). 
4. In accordance with those instruments, which contain elements of a definition of 
human rights education agreed upon by the international community, human rights 
education can be defined as any learning, education, training or information efforts aimed at 
building a universal culture of human rights, including: 
</p>
<p>(a) Strengthening respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms;  
(b) Fully developing the human personality and sense of dignity;  
(c) Promoting understanding, tolerance, respect for diversity, gender equality 
</p>
<p>and friendship among all nations, indigenous peoples and minorities;  
</p>
<p>(d) Enabling all persons to participate effectively in a free and democratic society 
governed by the rule of law;  
</p>
<p>(e) Building and maintaining peace;  
(f) Promoting people-centred sustainable development and social justice. </p>


<p>5. Human rights education encompasses: 
</p>
<p>(a) Knowledge and skills &#8212; learning about human rights and human rights 
mechanisms and acquiring skills to apply them in a practical way in daily life;  
</p>
<p>(b) Values, attitudes and behaviour &#8212; developing values and reinforcing 
attitudes and behaviour which uphold human rights;  
</p>
<p>(c) Action &#8212; taking action to defend and promote human rights. 
6. With a view to encouraging human rights education initiatives, Member States have 
adopted various specific international frameworks for action, such as the World Public 
Information Campaign on Human Rights (1988, ongoing), focusing on the development 
and dissemination of human rights information materials; the United Nations Decade for 
Human Rights Education (1995&#8211;2004) and its plan of action, encouraging the elaboration 
and implementation of comprehensive, effective and sustainable strategies for human rights 
education at the national level; the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-
Violence for the Children of the World (2001&#8211;2010); the United Nations Decade of 
Education for Sustainable Development (2005&#8211;2014); and the International Year of Human 
Rights Learning (2008&#8211;2009). Other international frameworks which promote, inter alia, 
human rights education include the International Decade for the Rapprochement of Cultures 
2013&#8211;2022; the Education for All (2000&#8211;2015) movement; the Global Education First 
Initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General; and the post-2015 development agenda. 
</p>
<p>7. On 10 December 2004, the General Assembly proclaimed the World Programme for 
Human Rights Education. The World Programme, which began on 1 January 2005, is 
aimed at advancing the implementation of human rights education programmes in all 
sectors.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Objectives of the World Programme for Human Rights Education  
</b>8. The objectives of the World Programme for Human Rights Education are: 
</p>
<p>(a) To promote the development of a culture of human rights;  
(b) To promote a common understanding, based on international instruments, of 
</p>
<p>basic principles and methodologies for human rights education;  
</p>
<p>(c) To ensure a focus on human rights education at the national, regional and 
international levels;  
</p>
<p>(d) To provide a common collective framework for action by all relevant actors;  
(e) To enhance partnership and cooperation at all levels;  
(f) To survey, evaluate and support existing human rights education 
</p>
<p>programmes, to highlight successful practices and to provide an incentive to continue 
and/or expand them and to develop new ones; 
</p>
<p>(g) To promote implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Human 
Rights Education and Training. </p>


<p><b> C. Principles for human rights education activities 
</b></p>
<p>9. Educational activities within the World Programme shall:  
</p>
<p>(a) Promote the interdependence, interrelatedness, indivisibility and universality 
of human rights, including civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and the right 
to development;  
</p>
<p>(b) Foster respect for and appreciation of diversity, and opposition to 
discrimination on the basis of race, sex, gender, language, religion, political or other 
opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, disability or sexual orientation and on other bases;  
</p>
<p>(c) Encourage analysis of chronic and emerging human rights problems, 
including poverty, violent conflicts and discrimination, in the light of rapidly changing 
developments in the political, social, economic, technological and environmental fields, 
which would lead to responses and solutions consistent with human rights standards;  
</p>
<p>(d) Empower communities and individuals to identify their human rights 
entitlements and to claim them effectively;  
</p>
<p>(e) Develop the capacity of duty-bearers, in particular governmental officials, to 
meet their obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the human rights of those under their 
jurisdiction;  
</p>
<p>(f)  Build on the human rights principles embedded within the differing cultural 
contexts and take into account historical and social developments in each country;  
</p>
<p>(g) Foster knowledge of, and the acquisition of skills to use, local, national, 
regional and international human rights instruments and mechanisms for the protection of 
human rights;  
</p>
<p>(h) Make use of participatory pedagogies that include knowledge, critical 
analysis and skills for action furthering human rights and that take into consideration the 
age and the cultural specificities of the learners;  
</p>
<p>(i) Foster teaching and learning environments free from want and fear that 
encourage participation, the enjoyment of human rights and the full development of the 
human personality;  
</p>
<p>(j) Be relevant to the daily life of the learners, engaging them in a dialogue about 
ways and means of transposing human rights from the expression of abstract norms to the 
reality of their social, economic, cultural and political conditions. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Third phase (2015&#8211;2019) of the World Programme for 
Human Rights Education: a plan of action to strengthen 
implementation of the first two phases and promote human 
rights training for media professionals and journalists  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Scope 
</b></p>

<p>11. The second phase (2010&#8211;2014) of the World Programme was focused on human 
rights education in higher education and human rights training for teachers and educators, 
civil servants, law enforcement officials and military personnel at all levels. The plan of 
action for its implementation (A/HRC/15/28) was adopted by the Human Rights Council in 
September 2010.  
</p>
<p>12. In its resolution 24/15, the Council requested the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to prepare the present plan of action for the 
third phase (2015&#8211;2019) of the World Programme, devoted to strengthening the 
implementation of the first two phases and promoting human rights training for media 
professionals and journalists. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Specific objectives 
</b>13. In view of the overall objectives of the World Programme (see sect. I.B above), the 
present Plan of Action is aimed at achieving the following specific objectives: 
</p>
<p>(a) To strengthen implementation of human rights education in the primary and 
secondary school systems and in higher education, and human rights training for teachers 
and educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military; 
</p>
<p>(b) With regard to media professionals and journalists: 
(i) To highlight their role in the promotion and the protection of human rights; 
(ii) To provide guidance on effective human rights training programming for 
media professionals and journalists; 
(iii) To support the development, adoption and implementation of relevant 
sustainable training strategies; 
</p>
<p>(iv) To highlight the importance of enabling environments guaranteeing the 
protection and safety of media professionals and journalists; 
(v) To facilitate support for human rights training for media professionals and 
journalists by local, national, regional and international organizations; 
(vi) To support networking and cooperation among local, national, regional and 
international governmental and non-governmental institutions and organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Action to strengthen implementation of human rights education in the 
primary and secondary school systems and in higher education, and 
human rights training for teachers and educators, civil servants, law 
enforcement officials and the military 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Strategies 
</b></p>
<p>14. The present section examines strategies to strengthen implementation of human 
rights education in the target sectors highlighted during the first and second phases of the 
World Programme, which were the primary and secondary school systems, higher 
education, teachers and educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military. 
The strategies identified by the Human Rights Council in resolution 24/15 are listed below. 
</p>
<p><i>  Advancing implementation and consolidating the work done 
</i></p>

<p>evaluation processes carried out during the first two phases and any related national 
implementation plan(s). Section III below offers guidance on how to undertake such an 
analysis, which can be compared with any baseline data collected in the first two phases in 
order to determine progress made.  
</p>
<p>16. Depending on the results of the analysis, strategies for advancing and consolidating 
current efforts can be developed and incorporated into the implementation plan for the third 
phase of the World Programme, including, but not restricted to, strategies concerning:  
</p>
<p>(a) New or revised laws and policies; 
(b) Increased coherence between various human rights education components, 
</p>
<p>such as training curricula, and teaching and learning content, practice and policies; 
</p>
<p>(c) Expansion of the presence of human rights education in curricula and related 
training; 
</p>
<p>(d) Improvements in the quality and impact of existing human rights education 
programming; 
</p>
<p>(e) Increased human and financial support; 
(f) Putting in place effective and inclusive monitoring and assessment processes 
</p>
<p>with regard to human rights education efforts that rely on appropriate indicators and data 
collection mechanisms and provide information for the ongoing improvement of 
programming; 
</p>
<p>(g) Increased coherence between human rights education efforts and other related 
efforts, for instance efforts to promote respect for diversity, a culture of peace and non-
violence, civic education and global and citizenship education;  
</p>
<p>(h) High-quality and sustained human rights education and training through the 
fulfilment of the above tasks. 
</p>
<p>17. Strategies for advancing implementation and consolidating the work done should 
continue to incorporate a human rights-based approach to education and learning, as 
follows: 
</p>
<p>(a) &#8220;Human rights through education&#8221;: ensuring that all the education 
components and processes, including curricula, materials, methods and training are 
conducive to learning about human rights; 
</p>
<p>(b) &#8220;Human rights in education&#8221;: ensuring respect for the human rights of all 
actors, and the practice of rights, in the learning and working environment. 
</p>
<p><i>  Providing human rights education and training for educators in formal and non-formal 
education and training, in particular those working with children and youth 
</i></p>
<p>18. Both the first and second phases of the World Programme highlighted the 
importance of human rights education and training for educators, meaning those who 
design, develop, implement and evaluate education activities in formal, informal and non-
formal settings.1 The plans of action for the first and second phases highlighted the fact that 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 See the Plan of Action for the second phase (A/HRC/15/28), para. 14. In general, &#8220;formal education&#8221; 
</p>
<p>refers to school, vocational training and university education; &#8220;non-formal education&#8221; refers to adult 
learning and forms of education that complement formal education, such as community service and 
extra-curricular activities; and &#8220;informal education&#8221; refers to activities developed outside the 
education system, such as those carried out by non-governmental organizations (Plan of Action for 
the first phase, Appendix, footnote 3). </p>


<p>teachers, higher education teaching personnel and other education staff have a major role 
and responsibility to transmit human rights values, skills, attitudes, motivation and 
practices, both in the performance of their professional responsibilities and in their function 
as role models. Accordingly, human rights education for those professional groups, aimed 
at fostering their knowledge about, commitment to and motivation concerning human 
rights, is a priority strategy of any human rights education programming in the formal 
education system. The same priority strategy applies, by analogy, to those performing the 
function of educators in other settings, in particular those working with out-of-school 
children and youth, as well as parents.  
</p>
<p>19. Strategies for the human rights education and training of educators may include the 
adoption of a comprehensive human rights training policy, the introduction of human rights 
and human rights education principles and standards into the training curriculum, the use 
and fostering of appropriate methodologies and assessment methods and the development 
of related resources. 
</p>
<p>20. Adopting a comprehensive human rights training policy for educators may include 
the following elements: 
</p>
<p>(a) Spelling out and adopting the internationally-agreed definition of human 
rights education and training as an empowering process transferring knowledge and 
developing skills, attitudes and behaviour which promote and protect human rights; 
</p>
<p>(b) Pre-service and in-service training, available to all educators, adapted to their 
particular culture, education and experience and based on training needs assessment; 
</p>
<p>(c) The training of trainers, in particular those delivering pre-service and in-
service training, who should be qualified and experienced human rights education 
practitioners and should reflect the diversity of the learners; 
</p>
<p>(d) Considering human rights education as a criterion for the qualification, 
accreditation and career development of educational staff; 
</p>
<p>(e) Recognizing, accrediting and supporting non-governmental organizations and 
other sectors of civil society carrying out training activities in human rights education; 
</p>
<p>(f) Improving criteria and standards to evaluate training programmes and their 
implementation; 
</p>
<p>(g) Tackling the issue of creating enabling learning and working environments 
for educators, as human rights learning can take place effectively only where human rights 
are practised. 
</p>
<p>21. A human rights training curriculum for educators should include the following 
elements:  
</p>
<p>(a) Learning objectives that encompass knowledge, skills, attitudes and 
behaviour with respect to human rights and human rights education; 
</p>
<p>(b) Human rights principles and standards, as well as protection mechanisms in 
place in and beyond the communities where the educators are active; 
</p>
<p>(c) Rights and contribution of educators and learners in addressing human rights 
issues in the community where they live, including security issues;  
</p>
<p>(d) The principles for human rights education activities outlined in section I.C 
above;  
</p>
<p>(e) Appropriate methodology for human rights education which is participatory, 
learner-centred, experiential and action-oriented, and takes into account cultural 
considerations;  </p>


<p>(f) Educators&#8217; social skills and leadership styles that are democratic and coherent 
with human rights principles; 
</p>
<p>(g) Information on existing teaching and learning resources for human rights 
education, including information and communication technologies, to build capacity to 
review and choose from among them as well as to develop new resources; 
</p>
<p>(h) Regular and motivating learner assessment, both formal and informal. 
22. Training methodologies for training educators include participatory, learner-centred, 
experiential and action-oriented approaches and should address motivation, self-esteem and 
emotional development leading to human rights sensitization and action. Evaluation should 
be infused throughout the training process.2 
</p>
<p><i>  Undertaking related research and mapping, sharing good practices and lessons learned, 
and sharing information among all actors 
</i>23. Research on existing materials, programmes and methodologies, and evaluation of 
related results should be undertaken or increased. Information gathered should be regularly 
shared with a view to improving and inspiring further programming. 
</p>
<p>24. Education and training resources and materials, lessons learned and examples of 
methodologically-sound practice should be shared locally, nationally and internationally. 
Dissemination channels include electronic and online channels, resource centres, databases 
and the organization of gatherings. 
</p>
<p><i>  Applying and strengthening sound educational methodologies based on good practices and 
assessed through continued evaluation 
</i></p>
<p>25. Sound methodology is key to the success or failure of any educational effort. 
Effective human rights education is participatory, experiential, learner-centred, action-
oriented and takes into account cultural contexts.  
</p>
<p>26. Evaluation is an essential component of any human rights education and training 
activity. In the context of human rights education, it represents a systematic undertaking 
aimed at gathering information about the impact, that is the extent of changes at the level of 
the learners, their organizations and their communities leading to greater respect for human 
rights, that can be reasonably connected with the education activity. Evaluation is an 
ongoing improvement process that takes place throughout human rights education 
programmes, and supports decisions about how to improve their effectiveness. For instance, 
evaluation of a human rights training course is not a matter of simply asking participants to 
fill out an evaluation questionnaire at the end; it has to start during the training planning 
phase, with a thorough needs assessment, and continue well after the end of the training 
course itself.3 
</p>
<p><i>  Fostering dialogue, cooperation, networking and information-sharing among relevant 
stakeholders 
</i></p>
<p>27. Human rights education requires close cooperation and partnership within and 
among governmental agencies, national human rights institutions and civil society. It can be

<p>reinforced by a variety of actions aimed at connecting human rights education stakeholders: 
awareness-raising campaigns, national and local gatherings, &#8220;communities of practice&#8221;, 
newsletters, websites and other electronic platforms, such as online discussion groups, as 
well as staff exchanges, in order to support mutual sharing of knowledge, lessons learned 
and good practices. Professional groups and the production of journals may be 
institutionalized in order to foster sustained scientific exchanges.  
</p>
<p><i>  Furthering the integration of human rights education and training into school and training 
curricula 
</i></p>
<p>28. Strategies for integrating human rights education into the school curricula were 
presented in the appendix to the Plan of Action for the first phase of the World Programme 
(para. 5 (e)). During the third phase, depending on progress made in that area, further 
efforts should be made to increase the presence of human rights education in:  
</p>
<p>(a) The overall national curricula and educational standards; 
(b) All curriculum subjects, including by identifying whether human rights 
</p>
<p>education is subject-based and/or cross-curricular and whether it is obligatory or optional;  
(c) Teaching and learning processes; 
(d) Textbooks and teaching and learning materials;  
(e) The learning environment; 
(f) Vocational education and training. 
</p>
<p>29. Strategies for integrating human rights education into curricula for the training of 
educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military were presented in the 
Plan of Action for the second phase of the World Programme (para. 33 (a)). During the 
third phase, depending on progress made in that area, further efforts could be made to 
increase the presence of human rights education in:  
</p>
<p>(a) Training standards; 
(b) All curriculum subjects, including by identifying whether human rights 
</p>
<p>education is subject-based and/or cross-curricular and whether it is obligatory or optional; 
(c) Training and learning processes; 
(d) Training and learning materials; 
(e) The overall learning and working environment. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Actors 
</b></p>
<p>30. The main responsibility for advancing the implementation of human rights education 
during the third phase rests with: 
</p>
<p>(a) For primary and secondary education, ministries of education or equivalent 
institutions; 
</p>
<p>(b) For higher education, ministries of education or higher education or 
equivalent institutions, as well as higher education institutions and relevant training 
colleges, with varying levels of responsibility depending upon the degree of institutional 
autonomy; 
</p>
<p>(c) For the training of civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military, 
the ministries responsible for the civil service, law enforcement officials and the military; 
depending on arrangements in specific countries, they may be the ministry of public </p>


<p>administration, the ministry of the interior, the ministry of justice or the ministry of 
defence. 
</p>
<p>31. All actors should work together with other relevant government departments, such 
as finance ministries, and local government, and in close cooperation with national human 
rights institutions and civil society. Specific actors which should be involved in each sector 
covered by the first two phases of the World Programme are enumerated respectively in the 
plans of action for the first phase (sect. D, paras. 28&#8211;30) and second phase (sect. C.3, 
paras. 34&#8211;36 and sect. D.3, paras. 46&#8211;48). 
</p>
<p><b> D. Action to promote human rights training for media professionals and 
journalists 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Background 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Human Rights Committee has defined journalism as &#8220;a function shared by a 
wide range of actors, including professional full-time reporters and analysts, as well as 
bloggers and others who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the internet or 
elsewhere&#8221;.4 According to the General Assembly, &#8220;journalism is continuously evolving to 
include inputs from media institutions, private individuals and a range of organizations that 
seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, online as well as offline, in the 
exercise of freedom of opinion and expression&#8221;.5 That includes information shared through 
traditional channels or through the Internet and Internet communication technologies or 
social media, diffused by public and private media outlets, as well as by individuals who 
are engaged in journalism activities not formally employed by a media outlet.  
33. For the purpose of the present Plan of Action, the term &#8220;media professionals&#8221; refers 
to persons supporting the work of media organizations, including reporters and analysts, but 
also other staff, such as technicians and administrators. &#8220;Journalist&#8221; refers to media workers 
and social media producers who produce significant amounts of journalistic material, as 
defined in paragraph 32 above.  
</p>
<p>34. With regard to human rights training for media professionals and journalists, the 
present Plan of Action draws on the principles and frameworks established by international 
human rights instruments and documents, including the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights; the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and general 
comment No. 34 (2011) of the Human Rights Committee on article 19: Freedoms of 
opinion and expression; the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural 
Rights; the Convention on the Rights of the Child; the Vienna Declaration and Programme 
of Action; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; the United Nations 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples; the United Nations Declaration on Human 
Rights Education and Training; the UNESCO Declaration on Fundamental Principles 
concerning the Contribution of the Mass Media to Strengthening Peace and International 
Understanding, to the Promotion of Human Rights and to Countering Racialism, Apartheid 
and Incitement to War (hereafter &#8220;the UNESCO Declaration&#8221;); the UNESCO 
Recommendation on participation by the people at large in cultural life and their 
contribution to it; and other UNESCO documents. The present Plan of Action also draws on 
a number of relevant General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions. The 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>4
 See general comment No. 34 (2011) of the Human Rights Committee on article 19: Freedoms of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression, para. 44. 
 
</p>

<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and 
expression also prepares regular reports, thematic or country specific, that include analysis 
and interpretation of relevant human rights standards. Beyond the United Nations system, 
regional instruments and mechanisms also provide relevant guidance.  
</p>
<p>35. Taken together, international instruments and documents highlight several issues 
related to journalism which States Members of the United Nations have emphasized. A first 
issue is the role of the media in democratic societies and, in particular, in promoting human 
rights, peace, democracy and development. Freedom of expression, including freedom to 
seek, receive and impart information through any media, as provided for in the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (art. 19), is a necessary condition for the realization 
of participation, transparency and accountability, which are, in turn, essential for the 
promotion and protection of human rights; and a free, uncensored and unhindered press or 
other media is essential in any society to ensure freedom of expression.6 The Convention on 
the Rights of the Child highlights the role and responsibility of the mass media in 
disseminating information and material of social and cultural benefit to children, with due 
regard to the linguistic needs of children belonging to minority or indigenous communities 
(art. 17). The UNESCO Declaration states that mass media have an essential part to play in 
human rights education, particularly of young people, and can contribute effectively to 
counter &#8220;aggressive war, racialism, apartheid and other violations of human rights which 
are inter alia spawned by prejudice and ignorance&#8221; (art. III (2)). The International 
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination recognizes that 
effective measures in the fields of education, teaching, culture and information can combat 
prejudices that lead to racial discrimination (art. 7). 
36. States Members of the United Nations also recognize the role of diverse media in the 
realization of cultural rights. The UNESCO Recommendation on participation by the 
people at large in cultural life and their contribution to it highlights the role of the mass 
media as &#8220;instruments of cultural enrichment&#8221; owing in part to their role in the preservation 
and popularization of traditional forms of culture, and &#8220;by turning themselves into media 
for group communication and promoting direct participation by the people&#8221;. The United 
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples recognizes the right of indigenous 
groups to establish their own media in their own languages; State-owned media should 
reflect indigenous cultural diversity and States should encourage privately owned media to 
adequately reflect it (art. 16).  
37. United Nations instruments also specify the responsibility of media professionals 
and journalists to respect human rights in performing their functions. International human 
rights law recognizes that the exercise of freedom of expression carries with it special 
duties and responsibilities and may be subject to certain restrictions, for example on 
security and defamation grounds, following strict tests of legality, necessity and 
proportionality, as well as in relation to other standards, such as the right to privacy or the 
prohibition of hate speech. The Human Rights Committee, among other mechanisms, has 
provided extensive jurisprudence and authoritative guidance on those issues. 
38. A major issue of concern to the international community is the protection and safety 
of journalists. Both the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to 
freedom of opinion and expression have highlighted the many challenges faced by 
journalists in carrying out their work, for instance when covering street protests and 
demonstrations or reporting on politically sensitive issues, such as human rights violations. 
The Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders has also provided 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p>analysis and recommendations relative to selected groups of defenders at risk, including 
journalists and media workers. The Security Council has expressed deep concern and 
condemned the acts of violence and attacks in many parts of the world against journalists, 
media professionals and associated personnel in armed conflict. In numerous resolutions, 
the Security Council, the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council have 
condemned violence against journalists and called on Member States to ensure their 
protection, end impunity and prosecute those responsible. In conflict areas, journalists and 
media professionals enjoy specific protection under international humanitarian law.7 
</p>
<p><b>2. Strategies 
</b></p>
<p>39. As highlighted above, media professionals and journalists play a fundamental role in 
the promotion and protection of human rights. Effective human rights education fosters 
their knowledge about, commitment to and motivation concerning human rights. Human 
rights principles provide essential guidance for their professional performance and the work 
of media outlets, which can only take place in an enabling environment in which access to 
information, freedom of expression and safety are protected. 
</p>
<p>40. All journalists should be given equal human rights training opportunities. Human 
rights-related content and values, with an emphasis on contextual specificities, should be 
part of any formal training and/or certification and should also be made available through 
opportunities for ongoing professional development. Whereas all journalists should have 
basic human rights literacy, specialized courses, such as on human rights reporting, should 
also be made available to them. 
</p>
<p>41. A comprehensive approach to human rights training for media professionals and 
journalists would include action in the three areas listed below.  
</p>
<p><i>  Policies and related implementation measures 
</i></p>
<p>42. If training is to produce the desired impact on professional performance, it must be 
clearly supported by and linked to corresponding policies and rules concerning not only 
training, but also the work of the profession in general. To that end, with regard to media 
professionals and journalists, the following strategies could be adopted: 
</p>
<p>(a) Reviewing existing education and training policies to make sure that they 
incorporate human rights training;  
</p>
<p>(b) Adopting policies that strengthen human rights education for media 
professionals, including policies on: 
</p>
<p>(i) Pre-service and in-service training of media professionals, including editors 
and others in decision-making positions within media outlets, through the inclusion 
of human rights curricula in formal educational institutions and in online and/or 
community-based education for working journalists;  
(ii) Human rights education as a criterion for qualification, mentoring and career 
development; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Recognition and support to civil society, in particular media associations, 
carrying out human rights training activities; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Criteria and mechanisms for the evaluation of human rights training 
programmes; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 See the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of 
</p>
<p>opinion and expression (A/HRC/14/23). </p>


<p>(c)  Training media professionals and journalists as trainers capable of sharing 
knowledge and skills with their colleagues, in order to ensure the broadest possible impact 
within the media professionals&#8217; community, with a focus on selecting those especially 
suited to cover issues related to groups in situations of vulnerability. Training-of-trainers 
programmes should include sessions on training methodology, outlined in paragraph 44 
below, and the design of both training materials and training sessions;  
</p>
<p>(d) Introducing incentives for media professionals and journalists, especially 
those coming from groups in situations of vulnerability, to encourage their voluntary 
participation in human rights training programmes, and promoting their stories to a wide 
audience;  
</p>
<p>(e) Supporting the adoption of self-regulatory frameworks, such as codes of 
ethical conduct, and the establishment of bodies, such as media councils, to deliberate inter 
alia on training issues and standards;  
</p>
<p>(f) Reviewing regulations concerning the work of the media and journalists to 
make sure that they are not inconsistent with human rights standards and that they 
specifically promote the contribution of the profession to human rights. 
</p>
<p><i>  Training processes and tools 
</i></p>
<p>43. Human rights education curricula for media professionals and journalists could 
include the following modules: 
</p>
<p>(a) A basic introduction to human rights, with information on: 
(i) The role of media professionals and journalists in the promotion and 
protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p>(ii) International, regional and national human rights instruments and standards, 
including those protecting groups in situations of vulnerability; 
</p>
<p>(iii) International, regional and national governmental and other bodies, such as 
national human rights institutions, responsible for protecting and promoting human 
rights; 
</p>
<p>(iv) Human rights defenders and civil society organizations at the international, 
regional and national levels; 
</p>
<p>(b) Human rights of media professionals and journalists, with information on: 
(i) International, regional and national instruments and standards relating to 
freedom of expression and the safety of media professionals and journalists; 
(ii) International, regional and national mechanisms and procedures relating to 
freedom of expression and the safety of media professionals and journalists; 
(c) Respect of human rights in journalistic practice, including: 
(i) Human rights principles in journalism, including equality and non-
discrimination, respect for dignity, participation, transparency and accountability;  
</p>
<p>(ii) International, regional and national instruments and standards on legitimate 
restrictions to freedom of expression; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Gender sensitivity; 
(iv) Representative sourcing, including the use of information from a variety of 
sources to ensure a balanced approach; 
</p>
<p>(v) Human rights principles relevant to gathering and sharing information and 
reporting on human rights issues, concerns and violations, especially the &#8220;do no </p>


<p>harm&#8221; principle, confidentiality and protection of sources, victims and witnesses of 
violations;  
</p>
<p>(vi) Human rights standards and related skills with regard to dealing with and 
interviewing individuals who may be in situations of vulnerability and/or have 
experienced trauma, including respect for their dignity, privacy and safety, and how 
to ensure that informed consent has been obtained before publicizing identifying 
information; 
</p>
<p>(vii) Human rights standards and related skills involved in the use of &#8220;fixers&#8221;, 
stringers, freelancers, interpreters and assistants in journalistic contexts, including 
ensuring their safety; 
</p>
<p>(viii) Human rights issues relating to the protection of journalistic sources and 
whistle-blowers, including how to protect sensitive data; 
</p>
<p>(d) Promotion of human rights by media professionals and journalists, addressing 
the selection and assessment of stories on the basis of their contribution and impact in 
relation to the protection and promotion of human rights, particularly with regard to 
&#8220;equality and non-discrimination, with a view to combating stereotypes and violence, 
fostering respect for diversity, promoting tolerance, intercultural and interreligious dialogue 
and social inclusion, and raising awareness of the universality, indivisibility and 
interrelatedness of all human rights among the general public&#8221;;8 
</p>
<p>(e) Useful resources, including: 
(i) Information on existing resources for human rights training related to the 
above-mentioned modules, to build the capacity of trainers to review and choose 
from among them as well as to develop new ones; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Information on resource materials for self-education, including handbooks, 
guides, guidelines, online platforms and human rights glossaries. 
</p>
<p>44. From a methodological perspective, strategies to ensure the effectiveness of human 
rights training programmes and courses for media professionals and journalists include the 
following:9 
</p>
<p>(a) Audience-specificity: training must be directly targeted and appropriately 
addressed to media professionals. A consultative training needs assessment should be 
organized in order to undertake an analysis of the professional duties, experiences, 
expectations, personal backgrounds and aspirations of learners, as well as their level of 
human rights knowledge and skills; to set up specific learning objectives, including desired 
post-training changes in participant knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviour; to design an 
evaluation strategy, and in particular how the achievement of the learning objectives will be 
measured; and to assess other activities that should be implemented;  
</p>
<p>(b) Peer learning: much more can be accomplished through an approach that 
features journalists being trained by their peers as opposed to a teacher-student training 
model. The peer approach ensures trainers&#8217; access to the distinctive professional culture 
that surrounds a professional audience. Also, trainers should represent the diversity of 
learners, both in terms of journalists using different media, including online and 
multimedia, and belonging to different groups. Media practitioner trainers should be 
accompanied and supported by human rights experts, thus ensuring that human rights 
standards are fully and consistently reflected in the training process;

 Human Rights Council resolution 24/15, para. 3. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>9
 See OHCHR, <i>Human Rights Training: A Manual on Human Rights Training Methodology</i>. </p>


<p>(c) Adult learning methodologies, in particular participatory and learner-centred 
approaches addressing motivation, self-esteem and emotional development leading to 
human rights awareness and action to protect and promote human rights; 
</p>
<p>(d) Experiential methods specifically for the training of journalists, such as the 
creation/use of media outlets during training, and the use of examples of good and of 
inappropriate reporting as a reference. 
</p>
<p>45. Education and training resources and materials, including online tools, should reflect 
the methodological principles highlighted above. Together with examples of 
methodologically sound training practice and lessons learned, they should be shared locally, 
nationally, regionally and internationally. Dissemination channels comprise electronic 
channels, resource centres, databases, the organization of gatherings and other means. 
</p>
<p>46. Carrying out research and evaluation, and sharing results, contribute to learning 
from practice and experience and would support improvement of human rights training 
programming. 
</p>
<p>47. International training activities and exchanges could be promoted among media 
professionals. 
</p>
<p><i>  An enabling environment 
</i></p>
<p>48. Human rights learning can take place effectively only in an enabling environment 
where human rights are practised. Accordingly, ensuring that media professionals and 
journalists can carry out their professional roles safely and effectively is of the utmost 
importance.  
</p>
<p>49. In that regard, the following strategies could be implemented: 
</p>
<p>(a) Enact and implement laws and policies ensuring freedom of information and 
protecting freedom of expression and opinion; 
</p>
<p>(b) Put in place laws and enforcement mechanisms to counteract hate speech and 
incitement to hatred; 
</p>
<p>(c) Train civil servants, in particular military and law enforcement personnel, on 
human rights standards regarding freedom of information, transparency, whistle-blower 
protection and the protection of journalistic sources, and the protection of journalists in all 
situations, including situations of armed conflict; 
</p>
<p>(d) Enact measures to ensure that marginalized and minority groups are able to 
enter and be retained in the journalistic field, with financial and organizational incentives 
for qualified journalists to assume leadership and management positions; 
</p>
<p>(e) Make funding for infrastructure and personnel available to community and 
public service broadcasting entities, to ensure their outreach, in particular to rural areas, 
minorities and indigenous populations; 
</p>
<p>(f) Organize competitions, awards, scholarships and prizes to encourage the 
recognition and celebration of human rights achievements in journalism. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Actors 
</b></p>
<p>50. Responsibility for the design and delivery of appropriate human rights education 
strategies and activities for media professionals and journalists is shared among multiple 
actors, owing to the complex training systems and to the different contexts, including: 
</p>
<p>(a) Undergraduate or graduate institutes or universities, as well as human rights 
institutes and UNESCO Chairs for human rights education;  </p>


<p>(b) Unions and professional and accrediting organizations of media professionals 
and journalists;  
</p>
<p>(c) Public and private media enterprises and their leadership, in particular 
company board members and editors-in-chief;  
</p>
<p>(d) Relevant legislative bodies, including human rights and other parliamentary 
committees and advisory groups; 
</p>
<p>(e) National human rights institutions, such as ombudspersons and human rights 
commissions;  
</p>
<p>(f) National, regional and international media networks; 
(g) Research institutions addressing journalism; 
(h) National and local human rights resource and training centres;  
(i) Non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors;  
(j) International and regional intergovernmental organizations. 
</p>
<p>51. The implementation of the present Plan of Action will require the close 
collaboration of the above-mentioned actors. 
</p>
<p>52. Other stakeholders include relevant ministries, such as ministries of information, 
welfare, labour, justice, women and youth; the judiciary and the legislative branch of 
government; cultural, social, religious and community leaders; youth organizations; 
indigenous peoples and minority groups; and the business community. 
</p>
<p>53. Governments have the primary responsibility for ensuring that media professionals 
and journalists are protected through legislation and that norms relating to freedom of 
opinion and expression, the protection and safety of media professionals and journalists, 
access to information and the media, and non-discrimination and diversity within mass 
media outlets are implemented and enforced. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Process for national implementation 
</b></p>
<p>54. Infusing human rights education into the primary and secondary school systems and 
in higher education, and the human rights training of educators, civil servants, law 
enforcement officials and the military, as well as media professionals and journalists, 
require a comprehensive strategy which builds on the national context, priorities, capacity 
and existing efforts. Member States will need to cooperate closely with a range of 
stakeholders in fulfilling the strategy; the creation of a national coalition within 
governmental structures and beyond could facilitate the maximization of resources and 
avoid duplication of efforts.  
</p>
<p>55. Three steps are proposed for the national process of planning, implementing and 
evaluating action in relation to the Plan of Action, consistent with the strategy proposed in 
the plans of action for the first and second phases of the World Programme for Human 
Rights Education. 
</p>
<p><b>  Steps for implementation 
</b></p>

<p>57. Step 1: Undertake an assessment study on progress made during the first10 and 
second phases of the World Programme and a national baseline study on human rights 
training for media professionals<b> </b>and journalists. The studies could be conducted by a 
governmental coordinating department, or separate studies could be undertaken in each 
target area by the most relevant actor(s). The studies should be widely disseminated 
nationally. Relevant actions include: 
</p>
<p>(a) Analysis of the current status of implementation of the first and second 
phases of the World Programme: 
</p>
<p>(i) Keeping in mind the strategies mentioned in section II.C above concerning 
human rights education in the primary and secondary school systems, in higher 
education and in the training of educators, civil servants, law enforcement officials 
and the military, collect information on and analyse the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Current situation of human rights education in the primary and secondary school 
systems and in higher education, as well as human rights training for educators, 
civil servants, law enforcement officials and the military, in particular initiatives 
undertaken during the first and second phases of the World Programme and their 
shortcomings and obstacles to their implementation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Actors involved; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Existing policies and legislation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Resources and tools used; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Lessons learned from the first and second phases. 
</p>
<p>The information collected and analysed can be contrasted with any baseline data 
collected during the first and second phases in order to determine progress made. 
</p>
<p>(ii) Assess the adequacy and effectiveness of existing human rights education 
initiatives and identify good practice; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Consider how to build on good practice and lessons learned, and also 
measures that are necessary to deal with shortcomings and obstacles. 
</p>
<p>(b) Analysis of the current situation of human rights training for media 
professionals and journalists: 
</p>
<p>(i) Keeping in mind the strategies mentioned in section II.D above, collect 
information on and analyse the following: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Current situation of human rights training for media professionals and journalists, 
including existing initiatives, their shortcomings and obstacles to their 
implementation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Historical and cultural contexts that may influence such training; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Existing policies and legislation; 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Experience, resources and tools existing at the local, national, regional and 
international levels; 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>10
 With regard to the first phase, see OHCHR/UNESCO, <i>Human Rights Education in Primary and 
</i></p>
<p><i>Secondary School Systems: A Self-assessment Guide for Governments</i> (HR/PUB/12/8) (New York 
and Geneva, United Nations, 2012). </p>


<p>&#8226; Actors currently involved, including media associations, higher education 
institutions, governmental entities, national human rights institutions, research 
institutes, non-governmental organizations and other civil society actors;  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Complementary efforts, such as training programmes and university education on 
journalism ethics and work in conflict areas. 
</p>
<p>The information collected and analysed can be used as national baseline data.  
</p>
<p>(ii) Identify good practice and lessons learned; 
(iii) Determine opportunities and limitations; 
(iv) Consider how to build on advantages and lessons learned, and how to use 
opportunities, considering also measures that are necessary to deal with 
shortcomings and obstacles. 
</p>
<p>58. Step 2: Develop a national strategy to enhance the implementation of the first and 
second phases of the World Programme and to promote human rights training for media 
professionals<b> </b>and journalists. Building on step 1, relevant actions to be taken in close 
consultation with, and seeking the participation of relevant stakeholders, include: 
</p>
<p>(a) Defining the basic goals for implementation; 
(b) Fixing objectives using the Plan of Action as a reference; 
(c) Setting priorities on the basis of the findings of the studies, taking into 
</p>
<p>account the most pressing needs and/or available opportunities; 
</p>
<p>(d) Focusing on interventions leading to impact, giving priority to measures that 
will secure sustainable change vis-&#224;-vis ad hoc activities;  
</p>
<p>(e) Encouraging the building of alliances and synergies among different actors;  
(f) Identifying: 
(i) Inputs &#8211; allocation of available human, financial and time resources; 
(ii) Activities &#8211; tasks, responsibilities, time frame and indicators;  
(iii) Mechanisms for coordination of the national strategy;  
(iv) Outputs, such as legislation, codes of conduct, educational materials, training 
programmes and non-discriminatory policies;  
</p>
<p>(v) Results to be achieved. 
59. Step 3: Implement, monitor and evaluate the national strategy. Relevant actions 
include: 
</p>
<p>(a) Disseminating the national strategy among concerned institutions and 
stakeholders and implementing the planned activities in cooperation with them;  
</p>
<p>(b) Monitoring implementation with regard to the identified indicators, and 
issuing progress reports; 
</p>
<p>(c) Adopting self-evaluation and participatory independent evaluation methods 
and mechanisms to review implementation, and as a means to improve and strengthen 
activities; 
</p>
<p>(d) Acknowledging, disseminating and noting the achievement of results. </p>


<p><b> IV. National coordination and evaluation 
</b></p>
<p>60. At the national level, governments should identify a relevant department as a focal 
point for coordinating the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the 
national strategy, working closely with the relevant ministries and all other national actors, 
in particular national human rights institutions and civil society. If governments have 
created or designated a unit within their structure responsible for coordinating 
implementation of human rights education initiatives under the first and/or second phase of 
the World Programme, that should be taken into consideration while planning for the third 
phase. Every country that has not already done so is also encouraged to identify and support 
a resource centre for human rights education, which will be responsible for research and for 
collecting and disseminating related initiatives and information, such as on good practice, 
materials and resources, and the training of trainers. 
</p>
<p>61. The national focal point should also cooperate with the national agencies responsible 
for drawing up country reports for submission to the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms, including the treaty bodies, special procedures and the universal periodic 
review mechanism, and to other international or regional intergovernmental bodies11 to 
ensure that progress in human rights education under the present Plan of Action is included 
in those reports. It should also liaise with OHCHR and share information on national 
progress.  
</p>
<p>62. OHCHR will undertake a midterm evaluation in 2017, for which Member States will 
evaluate progress under the Plan of Action and submit related information to OHCHR. At 
the conclusion of the third phase, in early 2020, each country will evaluate its actions and 
submit a final national evaluation report to OHCHR. On the basis of those reports, OHCHR 
will prepare a final report for the Human Rights Council in 2020. 
</p>
<p><b> V. International cooperation and support 
</b></p>
<p>63. International cooperation and assistance is to be directed towards strengthening 
national capacities for human rights education and training in support of the national 
strategy. Owing to the cross-border nature of some journalism, such collaboration might 
also be directed towards efforts carried out at the regional and international levels.  
</p>
<p>64. United Nations human rights mechanisms, within their specific mandates, may 
support national human rights education efforts under the Plan of Action. United Nations 
treaty bodies, when examining State party reports, may review and advise on 
implementation of treaty provisions relating to human rights education. Thematic and 
country special procedures of the Human Rights Council may review and advise on human 
rights education progress within their specific mandates. National human rights education 
efforts may also be regularly reviewed in the context of the universal periodic review 
mechanism. 
</p>
<p>65. International cooperation and assistance may be provided by: 
</p>
<p>(a) The United Nations system, including its specialized agencies and the United 
Nations University;  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>11
 For instance, a specific UNESCO mechanism monitors implementation of the 1974 UNESCO 
</p>
<p>Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Co-operation and Peace and 
Education relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. </p>


<p>(b) Professional training institutions affiliated to the United Nations, such as 
those concerned with social welfare; medical and health services; drugs and trafficking 
prevention; refugees, migration and border security; conflict prevention and peacebuilding; 
and criminal procedure;  
</p>
<p>(c) The United Nations-mandated University for Peace;  
(d) Other international intergovernmental organizations;  
(e) Regional intergovernmental organizations;  
(f) Relevant international and regional professional networks, associations and 
</p>
<p>trade unions; 
</p>
<p>(g) International and regional networks of higher education institutions;  
(h) International and regional non-governmental organizations; 
(i) International and regional human rights resource and documentation centres;  
(j) International and regional financial institutions, as well as bilateral funding 
</p>
<p>agencies;  
</p>
<p>(k) Multilateral and bilateral development agencies. 
66. It is essential that those actors collaborate closely in order to maximize resources, 
avoid duplication and ensure coherence for the implementation of the Plan of Action.
