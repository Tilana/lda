<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 18/5, requested the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights to convene in 2012, prior to the twenty-first session 
of the Human Rights Council, a workshop for an exchange of views on, inter alia, the 
gender implications of international solidarity, the impact of a right to international 
solidarity, the role of international solidarity in achieving the Millennium Development 
Goals and the realization of the right to development, with the participation of 
representatives from all interested States, the Independent Expert, the members of the 
Advisory Committee dealing with that issue, and civil society. 
</p>
<p>2. The Council also requested the Independent Expert to present a summary of the 
discussions held at the workshop, in conformity with the programme of the work of the 
Council. The present report is submitted in response to that request. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening of the workshop and organization of work 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Opening remarks 
</b></p>
<p>3. The expert workshop on human rights and international solidarity was held in 
Geneva on 7 and 8 June 2012. It was convened under the auspices of the Independent 
Expert on human rights and international solidarity, Virginia Dandan, and brought together 
26 experts from all regions. Representatives of Governments, United Nations agencies and 
non-governmental organizations attended the public segments of the workshop as 
observers.1 
</p>
<p>4. The Chief of the Development and Economic and Social Issues Branch, Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), welcomed the 
participants on behalf of OHCHR. He pointed out that, throughout the history of the 
modern human rights movement, international solidarity had been among the most 
powerful and essential tools of advocates and activists seeking to advance the vision of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The human rights movement had demonstrated 
repeatedly that the mobilization of international solidarity had the capacity to wrest control 
of the public narrative away from powerful forces that defended and reinforced an abusive 
status quo, and to return it to the hands of the people and those who defended their rights.  
</p>
<p>5. He said that, in response to current global challenges, international solidarity could 
equally build bridges to support good governance, both nationally and globally. It could 
help to strengthen accountability for human rights, promote democracy and the rule of law, 
foster sustainable development, expose inequalities within and between nations, and 
advance the empowered participation of people, including women, young people, older 
persons, minorities and marginalized groups. It could also help to build a global 
constituency for a more just regulation of globalization and more equitable arrangements 
for trade, investment, finance, aid, debt, technology transfer, intellectual property, 
migration, labour, environment and the global partnership for development.  
</p>
<p>6. He stressed that evidence abounded that an age of solidarity had been entered. 
Dramatic failures in financial governance in recent years had heightened calls for social

<p>justice, unified movements across borders and sparked calls for greater equity and 
accountability in economic affairs. He concluded by saying that OHCHR remained strongly 
committed to supporting the initiative, and to advancing international solidarity for the 
realization of all human rights &#8211; civil, political, economic, social and cultural, including the 
right to development.2 
</p>
<p>7. In her opening remarks, the Independent Expert thanked the Human Rights Council 
for the important initiative, which afforded an opportunity for experts to exchange views on 
human rights and international solidarity. She recognized the work of the previous mandate 
holder, Rudi Muhammed Rizki, who had laid the groundwork for the workshop. She 
reiterated the three stages of her mandate&#8217;s primary task: the elaboration of a draft 
declaration on the right to international solidarity. The past work was to be understood as 
the first stage, where international solidarity had been affirmed in various ways, including 
as a fundamental conception of mutually reinforcing relations among persons, groups and 
nations, as an essential binding element that underpinned global partnerships, as a key 
approach to poverty eradication and as an indispensable component of the efforts to realize 
all human rights, including the right to development, and the Millennium Development 
Goals. During stage two, she would set out to develop standards, norms and principles to 
guide the draft declaration. Stage three would be devoted to elaborating the draft 
declaration, and would culminate in its submission to the Human Rights Council by 2014. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Organization of work 
</b></p>
<p>8. The workshop comprised a plenary session and group sessions. The participants 
were divided into three groups. Rapporteurs were chosen for each group and reported back 
in plenary session on the discussions.  
</p>
<p>9. The three groups were each presented with two questions to consider as a starting 
point and could also cover broader ground. The questions posed were as follows: 
</p>
<p>For Group A: &#8220;(i) What is the value of a right to international solidarity in 
addressing power asymmetries within and between States?&#8221; 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(ii) What is the relationship between international solidarity and 
international cooperation?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>For Group B: &#8220;(i) In a post-MDG world, what is the value of a right to 
international solidarity in attaining the goals of sustainable 
development?&#8221; 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(ii) What is the significance of a right to international solidarity in 
the inclusive growth paradigm?&#8221;  
</p>
<p>For Group C: &#8220;(i) What is the role of the right to take part in cultural life in 
shaping a right to international solidarity?&#8221; 
</p>
<p> &#8220;(ii) How does a right to international solidarity work at the local, 
national and international levels?&#8221; 
</p>
<p>10. The thematic areas below were distilled from the discussions and used to organize 
and capture the main messages, also reflecting, where possible, divergent views.

</b></p>
<p><b> III. Summary of discussions 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Content, nature and added value of international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>11. It was said that analysing whether international solidarity (currently a moral 
principle) could be viewed as a human right was a change of paradigm. Many participants 
said that the concept of international solidarity was based on ethical and moral values, 
asking how that concept could be translated into a rights framework. It was suggested that, 
although consideration of the concept&#8217;s legal background and basis in international norms 
was the best way to begin the process of translation, there was a need to ask whether 
international solidarity was fundamentally a principle, an imperative, a general obligation 
or a human right with entitlements. Participants&#8217; opinions varied, with some suggesting that 
international solidarity was simply a principle that served as a basis for the realization of all 
existing human rights. Others affirmed that the concept included two levels or dimensions: 
on the one hand, it had obligatory (claimable) content, and, on the other, it had a principle 
component that informed international policy and/or States&#8217; behaviour, but could not be 
defined as an entitlement. 
</p>
<p>12. One of the challenges most commonly identified during the workshop was how to 
define the legal content of the right, the duty bearers and the means of establishing 
accountability and monitoring mechanisms, especially at the local level. According to 
several participants, the added value of a right to international solidarity would be that the 
right would serve to prevent and offer redress in cases of violations of human rights in an 
effective and coordinated manner, that it would be a right of peoples and individuals, that it 
would serve as a framework for extraterritorial obligations of States and that it would imply 
coordination between States in human rights implementation. It could also serve as criteria 
for interpretation and decision when fragments of international public law were in 
contradiction, according priority to human rights and human dignity. It would allow for 
other human rights to be enjoyed, clear the way for claims for just, fair and human rights 
based on global governance, change the approach to cooperation from being driven by 
profit to being based on solidarity and contribute to peace and security.  
</p>
<p>13. Some participants said that the right to international solidarity went beyond 
international aid and cooperation, involved both developing and developed countries and 
was closely related to the right to development. It would be important to meaningfully 
explore how international solidarity could link individuals and peoples together, for 
example, by taking account of, and carefully listening to, what people expected, while 
stressing the interdependent value of the concept. 
</p>
<p>14. The right to international solidarity would also bring added value because it would 
elaborate on the obligations of States; push forward transparency in, for example, national 
budgets; help to shape political participation; and include traditionally excluded and 
discriminated individuals and groups, ranging from minorities and migrants to trafficking 
victims, especially the women and girls among them. Many of those issues transcended 
national boundaries. Addressing those issues would be one way to frame international 
solidarity in relation to the rights to peace and to development. In addition, at a time of 
weakening State power, the right to international solidarity could play a significant role in 
bringing people together.  
</p>
<p>15. In terms of justifying the right to international solidarity, there was no need to look 
beyond the various crises facing the world. If the right were in place, better tools would be 
available with which to tackle issues. The right could also be justified by exploring existing 
good practice in terms of international solidarity and by bringing in human rights standards, 
including non-discrimination, equality, transparency, participation and accountability of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>national and international institutions and State and non-State actors. The participants 
stressed the importance of the concept of &#8220;preventive solidarity&#8221; as a normative framework, 
in particular to minimize the negative effects of crises. It could take the form of safeguards 
against financial recessions or of early warning systems for natural disasters, for example. 
The work of the International Labour Organization on the social protection floor was cited 
as a good example of preventive solidarity.  
</p>
<p>16. The view was expressed that it might not be useful to refer to international solidarity 
as a superior right, given that all rights were equally important and that there should be no 
hierarchy of rights. Other alternatives were to refer to it as an inherent, immanent, intrinsic 
or enabling right.     
</p>
<p>17. In the view of some participants, a right to international solidarity could strengthen 
space for participation and increase the accountability of national and international 
stakeholders by creating duties and obligations, including to respect cultural diversity and 
the right to peace. Participants stressed that the right should not be interpreted as replacing 
the primary responsibilities of national Governments to guarantee the rights of people 
within their territories. The right to international solidarity should support national policy 
choices, but, at the international level, could take the form of supporting participation by 
making data available to all via technology transfer, ensuring respect for indigenous 
communities and sharing research and development (e.g. in relation to access to essential 
medicines). Also requiring consideration in that regard was the value of solidarity and its 
attendant duties and responsibilities for future generations. 
</p>
<p>18. Some participants said that international solidarity was a means to an end, such as 
peace or sustainable development. As that implied that there were other means, they 
wondered what a right to international solidarity would add to the mix. One way of 
approaching the issue was to recognize the current global context, such as the economic 
power shifts and the rise of financial elites, which might entail a shift from looking at the 
global public good to global public &#8220;bads&#8221;. In the view of one participant, work should 
begin by examining the critical and compelling international issues that required 
multilateral solutions, especially to deal with public bads. There was a need, however, to 
consider the value of solidarity, to identify those stakeholders for whom it would hold value 
and to obtain a critical mass of support. Focus on compelling issues was required.  
</p>
<p>19.  One participant questioned the purpose of having a more tangible entitlement 
regarding international solidarity. The right could be seen as all-encompassing and there 
was insufficiently clarity as to what it actually covered. An assertion that the world was 
unfair and that the right to international solidarity was needed to change that state of affairs 
would be far too ambitious, rendering the right merely aspirational and impossible to 
achieve. Nevertheless, while the right to international solidarity might be viewed as 
meaningless in normal circumstances, at the current juncture it was topical. The 
acknowledgement of various crises would be the trigger point at which solidarity would be 
required. The second point raised in that regard was that the right to solidarity would be 
meaningful only if it were focused on people. Countries were inward-looking and the right 
needed to be linked to interdependency. A focus on States would undermine the solidarity 
fostered by the current crises and run counter to interdependency. Reference was made to 
the experience of the right to development being viewed as a right of States to assistance. 
</p>
<p>20. Some participants referred to the dualism of international solidarity in that it had 
instrumental value but was also an end in itself. It was instrumental in that it drew attention 
to interdependency and the need for collective action. It also provided the means to measure 
the ultimate outcome (the full realization of all human rights) and was a way to guide 
collective action by States towards a desirable outcome. Reference was made in that regard 
to the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the area of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, specifically principle 30, on coordination and 
allocation of responsibilities. 
</p>
<p>21. In terms of added value, participants said that it would be useful to think about how 
the right to international solidarity could be invoked and the consequences of the denial of 
the right. It was also necessary to ask whether the right could actually be established. One 
way to tackle the issue would be to point out international obstacles to, for example, food 
security, such as lack of market access, in which case the added value of the right would be 
that people would not be harmed or prevented from realizing their human rights and that the 
actors responsible would be required to fulfil their obligations. When negotiating trade 
agreements, it would make a difference by drawing the attention of policymakers to the 
human rights impacts on and implications for agricultural policies or health. The right 
would be grounded in human rights obligations and would require, for example, human 
rights impact assessments and claims mechanisms. The right to international solidarity 
would also take care of protection gaps in relation to issues arising out of globalization, 
environmental problems and social determinants of health, among others.  
</p>
<p>22. One view expressed was that it might prove uncomfortable to use solidarity as an 
instrument to attain development goals. People did not have to be taught about solidarity as 
they already practised it, meaning that it was more important to recognize how it was used. 
The right to international solidarity would capture the ways in which solidarity was used by 
the public to achieve development and to push for a more revolutionary definition of the 
concept. Another participant cautioned, however, that imposing a right to solidarity and 
turning it into a State obligation might actually undermine the right because it could 
weaken community solidarity and make the Government solely responsible. 
</p>
<p>23. Several participants said that, in drafting a declaration, it was important to strike the 
correct note, tone and balance so as to be forward-looking but also to focus on what was 
palatable at a time of crises and what would have both strength and content. The added 
value of the right to international solidarity in the form of a declaration would be that the 
declaration would set forth interpretive principles and forward-looking text. It would also 
be important at some stage to look at how to muster sufficient support among Member 
States and civil society for the declaration. One way to build consensus was to base the 
declaration on the Charter of the United Nations and existing human rights obligations. It 
was also said, however, that no matter how the right was characterized the difference would 
be seen only at the level of operationalization. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Defining international solidarity and a right to international solidarity 
</b></p>
<p>24. International solidarity, according to the previous mandate holder, was &#8220;the union of 
interests, purpose and actions among States and social cohesion between them, based on the 
interdependence of States and other actors to preserve the order and very survival of 
international society, and to achieve common goals that require international cooperation 
and collective action&#8221; (A/HRC/15/32, para. 57). It was clarified that the definition was open 
to reformulation by the current mandate holder. The point was made that the definition 
suggested a focus on States, rather than on peoples, individuals and groups. The question 
was whether it was the right to international solidarity of States, of groups of States, of the 
private sector or of civil society that should be promoted. In response to one participant&#8217;s 
suggestion that States could not be circumvented because they represented the people, 
others pointed out that that view was State-centric in nature and would constrain the way in 
which international solidarity should be discussed.  
</p>
<p>25.  The right to solidarity was defined by the Human Rights Council Advisory 
Committee as &#8220;a human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are 
entitled to equally enjoy the benefit from a harmonious international society with just and </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>fair international political and economic order in which all human rights and fundamental 
freedoms can be fully realized in a spirit of international solidarity and harmony&#8221; 
(A/HRC/AC/8/CRP.1, para. 2). The draft definition was inspired by article 28 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations. 
Some participants, however, were of the opinion that, while the draft definition was a 
helpful chapeau, it was difficult to formulate the right on the basis of article 28 of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and that the added value was unclear.  
</p>
<p>26. In response to a question as to whether the objective was to define international 
solidarity or a right to international solidarity, it was remarked that what was required was 
an understanding of international solidarity in human rights terms. There was also some 
discussion as to whether the right existed. One suggestion was that focusing on a right to 
international solidarity would give greater visibility to existing concepts, especially by 
calling it international solidarity. Rejecting the right entirely would be a retrogressive step, 
given that the objective was to remind States of their obligations and to ensure that they 
remained responsible for adopting a rights-based approach.  
</p>
<p>27. On the elements of the right to international solidarity, existing definitions referred 
to unity of agreement, mutual support within a group, ties binding people together and 
kinship or shared values. One participant said that the right should be tangible and not only 
an assertion of existing rights.  
</p>
<p>28. One participant pointed out that, to develop the norm, there should be agreement on 
its elements, suggesting a focus on its four basic elements: subject, object, scope (including 
coverage and extent) and modality of enforcement (how the rights holder would exercise 
it). Another related aspect was the normative regime that would be created (i.e. guidelines 
or a declaration). 
</p>
<p>29. In any revision of the definition of international solidarity, it would be important to 
assess its significance and to see how various actors, including international organizations 
and transnational corporations, could be covered. The behavioural patterns of actors would 
have to be addressed, in particular the transboundary impacts of environmental, trade and 
migration policies. 
</p>
<p>30. Although international solidarity was often defined in terms of mutual interest, it 
would be useful to go further by restating that human rights were of mutual interest, 
focusing on the commitments made and reiterating the transcendent value of human rights. 
It was also essential to look for normative and accountability gaps and build on existing 
standards, keeping in mind the instrumental and pragmatic value of that approach.  
</p>
<p>31. There was discussion as to whether the right would have elements that did not exist 
in other legal documents. Many participants emphasized that the right would withstand 
scrutiny only if it were founded on existing legal bases. Its normative content should 
emanate from underlying human rights standards.  
</p>
<p>32. Participants said that, in elaborating principles related to international solidarity, it 
was crucial for links to be made to binding human rights standards and for key elements to 
be identified. One participant said that there was a need to go beyond that approach, 
however.  
</p>
<p>33. Many participants pointed to the existing legal provisions in the Charter of the 
United Nations as the foundations of the right to international solidarity, in particular the 
Preamble and Articles 1, 55 and 56. Several provisions of the International Bill of Human 
Rights and other human rights conventions also provided the legal bases for a right to 
international solidarity and specified elements of the right. In that regard, the right was 
linked to the right to self-determination in human rights instruments and the right to 
development elaborated in the Declaration on the Right to Development. Regional human </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>rights instruments would be of note in that respect. It was essential to keep in mind that 
international solidarity should be related to civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights.  
</p>
<p>34. One effective way forward would be to build on areas in which progress had been 
made and to use the fragments to move towards an analytical framework. Three areas were 
identified as a starting point. First, there was a need to consider work on common but 
differentiated responsibilities for climate change, where the notion of historical 
responsibility was acknowledged. Second, while there were multiple regimes operating in 
various spheres at the international level, there were no bridges between them and some 
were better protected than others. That was symptomatic of a larger fragmentation of 
international law and global governance. The work of the International Law Commission 
on draft articles on the responsibility of international organizations was referenced in that 
regard, in particular draft article 61.3 While voting in international financial institutions, 
States should not forget their human rights obligations and should be reminded of them 
when concluding treaties. Third, international solidarity should not be linked with negative 
obligations, and should go in tandem with systemic change. There must be an effective 
transition towards a global strategic framework to overcome systemic inertia.  
</p>
<p>35. The view was expressed that the right could be defined as a right to policies being 
adopted, or a &#8220;metaright&#8221;, which would be effected through impact assessments. Another 
suggestion was to couch the definition in the language of the right of people to have States 
act in solidarity to tackle common challenges.  
</p>
<p>36. In terms of legal instruments, one participant spoke of how forms of solidarity were 
created, describing, for example, how contracts, tax regimes, social security and welfare 
systems were built up. That entailed studying relationships at the global level. It was noted 
that many actors were struggling with ideas around global governance regimes, with 
multiple actors, such as transnational corporations and civil society, often promoting 
distinct and potentially contradictory interests. That was where international solidarity 
became critical, but less clear were the processes and steps that needed to be put in place to 
deal with those conflicts. 
</p>
<p>37. One group defined international solidarity as &#8220;the expression of unity of peoples 
and/or States around a shared goal and/or means, irrespective of/transcending sovereign 
boundaries&#8221; and &#8220;an instrument in support of the existing imperative to establish the 
conditions under which all individuals and peoples can enjoy and realize their human rights 
and under which international assistance and cooperation as well as sustainable 
development are guaranteed&#8221;. The group sought to capture various elements of the right to 
international solidarity, including linkages with sustainability, conditions for effective 
global governance, respect for international legal obligations and, essentially, combining 
both proactive and reactive elements. In addition, some participants suggested that the 
elements of the right should include redress in cases of human rights violations and 
emphasize shared responsibilities, as articulated in the United Nations Millennium 
Declaration and the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for 
Development. One participant, however, pointed out that the fundamental problem of the 
definition was that it did not go sufficiently far because economic and political asymmetries 
were not covered.  
</p>
<p>38. A suggestion was made to look at the problem from a shared perspective and assess 
the obstacles to the realization of international solidarity. In that light, one participant noted 
that vested interests often transcended the idea of international solidarity, given the need for 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>a competitive advantage where trade and finance were concerned. Another wondered where 
international solidarity would find its natural home, asking whether it would be at the level 
of international agencies or at the bilateral level. It was also asked who the stakeholders 
would be.  
</p>
<p>39. In terms of elements of a right to international solidarity, one view was that the 
focus should be on the principle of non-discrimination. It was pointed out that, under the 
World Trade Organization agreements, the most-favoured-nation principle meant that 
countries could not normally discriminate between their trading partners. In human rights 
terms, however, if people in an unequal situation were treated equally, the discrimination 
would be perpetuated. There was therefore a need to take proactive affirmative action to 
ensure equal outcomes. Through that approach, non-discrimination could be taken as a 
foundational principle of international solidarity. 
</p>
<p>40. In terms of conceptualization, the right to international solidarity could be seen as a 
right of individuals. Alternatively, the focus could be on the obligations of States, allowing 
individuals to challenge States if they were not fulfilling their obligations. The latter idea 
could, however, be intellectually indefensible, except as a working hypothesis, given that 
the paradox was that it was not one individual State but many States that were jointly 
responsible in conspiring to create a situation. One way to overcome that paradox could be 
through the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, which, once in force, might envisage such an individual complaint. 
</p>
<p>41. International solidarity appealed at two levels. First, it was a value similar to other 
values, such as that of freedom. As a value it should be protected and the content of the 
right should be explicit. Second, if international solidarity was a vehicle for the protection 
of other rights, it was better to focus on responsibilities than on rights. It was clear that both 
dimensions were interconnected. In that sense, the concept of international solidarity was 
close to the Declaration on the Right to Development, which covered similar territory, 
focusing on development as a value to be protected and also protecting all other human 
rights. The same track could be followed. The entire body of human rights should be 
permeated by the primary values recognized in that field, but it was important and helpful 
to be specific and to clearly delineate the arguments.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Exploring the relationship between international solidarity and 
</b></p>
<p><b>international cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>42. It was generally accepted that there was a strong link between international 
solidarity and international cooperation. There were, however, differences and often 
divergences when it came to how the relationship was viewed and defined.  
</p>
<p>43. One view was that the rationale for solidarity or international cooperation was that 
the actions of one country affected others, both negatively and positively, such as in the 
areas of financial derivatives, technology transfer, war, weapons, media and information 
and communications technology. Solidarity went beyond simple international cooperation, 
especially in terms of the way in which it was used. One participant suggested that 
solidarity meant empathy with or sympathy for weaker and poorer countries, individuals 
and groups. It therefore carried more weight than cooperation because the rationale was 
beyond mutual benefit. What was implied in international solidarity was emphasis on one 
State, which might affect other States, both in terms of negative and positive obligations 
and the need for positive discrimination. Solidarity could be required when two partners 
were unequal, with the international system coming to the defence of the weak and the 
poor. Building the human rights case in that regard would rely on a focus on power 
asymmetries and richer countries being required to assist through aid or charity and by </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>building on common but differentiated responsibilities in environmental matters and special 
and differential treatment in trade, among others. Another view was that solidarity went 
beyond cooperation and encompassed assisting the weak, vulnerable and marginalized 
groups that were oppressed and exploited.  
</p>
<p>44. The legal basis for international cooperation was strong and included the 
responsibility of all States not to take actions violating rights in other countries. Participants 
suggested referring to, among other things, the Maastricht Principles.  
</p>
<p>45. International assistance and cooperation encompassed useful aspects of solidarity 
that were not being articulated. Solidarity went beyond international cooperation and 
involved issues of structure and process. Examples were provided from the work of the 
Advisory Committee on enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human 
rights (see A/HRC/AC/8/3). The distinction was made that international cooperation was 
not legally a right, but a means with strong links to solidarity.  
</p>
<p>46. One view was that, although cooperation derived from solidarity, solidarity did not 
derive from cooperation. Some participants posited that international solidarity qualified 
international cooperation, and moved it away from being driven by profit. The right to 
international solidarity would thus serve as a corrective principle for international 
cooperation.  
</p>
<p>47. In terms of identifying obligations that could fall under the rubric of international 
solidarity, and which could be derived from the right to international cooperation, however, 
a number of positive obligations, modalities for supporting international solidarity and 
negative obligations were discussed. Positive obligations would include establishing 
mechanisms at the international level for the distribution of resources, such as solidarity 
funds; providing assistance to countries unable to cope with debts; minimizing the negative 
impact of globalization; cooperating to regulate financial markets; cooperating to regulate 
migration on the basis of solidarity; guaranteeing access to information and 
communications technology, especially to the marginalized and disadvantaged; 
guaranteeing participation in decision-making; cooperating to establish accountability 
mechanisms; enforcing humanitarian law; countering systemic violations of human rights, 
including prevention, protection, remedies and compensation to victims; and protecting and 
respecting the human dignity of all societal groups. Negative obligations would include not 
adopting free trade agreements that would undermine peoples&#8217; livelihoods or other rights; 
not increasing or contributing to global warming; not causing the depletion of or irreparable 
damage to natural resources; not engaging in irregular weapons trading; and not impeding 
access to information and communications technology.  
</p>
<p><b> D. International solidarity and looking beyond the Millennium 
</b></p>
<p><b>Development Goals  
</b></p>
<p>48. Participants discussed whether it was even necessary to consider international 
solidarity beyond the Millennium Development Goals, suggesting that there were sufficient 
other issues to be considered and not wishing to imply that the implementation of the Goals 
should be abandoned. It was also said, however, that because human rights did not feature 
in the Goals, discussions could include issues such as gender equality and how the current 
framework put in place by the Goals could be better attuned to human rights standards. It 
was pointed out that the Goals, in particular Goal 8, provided international commitments on 
international cooperation and development targets and that it was important to discuss the 
role of international solidarity in those terms.  
</p>
<p>49. Some participants raised the concept of sustainable development goals, which were 
to be discussed at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, to be held </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/21/44/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>later in June 2012 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They asked whether the new framework would 
provide something different or better and whether the sustainable development goals would 
reflect human rights. The participants focused on how the proposed declaration on the right 
to international solidarity could inform the evolution of sustainable development goals, 
suggesting that it could provide a framework in which international commitments, such as 
that to further Goal 8, could be pushed forward. The concept of sustainable development 
goals could also bring new elements to enrich the declaration because it would touch on 
elements critical for poverty eradication and gender equality. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Other areas 
</b></p>
<p>50. On the issue of inclusive growth, participants said that the word &#8220;inclusive&#8221; might 
not be the most accurate term, suggesting alternative wording such as &#8220;fair&#8221; or &#8220;critical&#8221;. 
Examples of non-inclusive growth, such as land-grabbing, were given. 
</p>
<p>51. Participants said that there was a need to speak of cultural diversity and cultural 
heritage within the framework of international solidarity. One, however, stressed that 
cultural diversity was not the same as cultural rights, with the former an extremely broad 
concept. Respecting cultural rights within and across communities was important. There 
were intra-cultural differences that should not be overlooked through cultural respect in 
intercultural differences. In that sense, there was a need to go beyond the concept of social 
identities and support a concept ensuring the promotion and protection of human dignity.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Concluding remarks 
</b></p>
<p>52. The Independent Expert emphasized that work needed to begin by looking at 
commonalities. The idea of the workshop had not been to find a solution to all issues.  
</p>
<p>53. The participants expressed thanks to the Independent Expert for convening the 
workshop. Although most had found it valuable and some creative and constructive, others 
stressed that there had been divergent views on all the topics discussed.  
</p>
<p>54. The Independent Expert concluded by expressing her gratitude to the participants. 
She said that she had not intended to seek consensus, but rather had hoped that the 
participants would freely express themselves and exchange views to provide a rich source 
of knowledge. The workshop was only the beginning, and more stakeholders would be 
sought out and consulted. One possibility would be a civil society discussion during a 
forthcoming session of the Human Rights Council. She would use her time at the United 
Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to ascertain thoughts and feelings about 
international solidarity. At the sessions of the Council, she hoped to hold informal 
consultations with regional groups to listen and exchange views. She wished to listen to as 
many people as possible, including those who did not share the same convictions. She 
expressed regret that the present report, no matter how well it was written, could not 
capture the richness of the discussions and the learning, sharing and solidarity that was 
experienced.
