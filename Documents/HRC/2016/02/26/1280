<p><b>  26/&#8230;  Promotion and protection of the human rights of peasants and

</b></p>
<p> <i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> Human Rights Council resolutions 13/4 of 24 March 2010, 16/27 of 25 
March 2011 and 19/7 of 22 March 2012 on the right to food, and in particular Council 
resolution 21/19 of 27 September 2012 on the promotion and protection of the human rights 
of peasants and other people working in rural areas, 
</p>
<p><i>Determined</i> to foster strict respect for the purposes and principles enshrined in the 
Charter of the United Nations and other relevant international human rights instruments, 
</p>
<p><i>Underlining</i> the imperative need to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 
2015 in order to contribute to making the right to development a reality for everyone, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> General Assembly resolution 66/222, in which the Assembly declared 
2014 the International Year of Family Farming, 
</p>
<p><i>Gravely concerned</i> that hunger, like poverty, is still predominantly a rural problem, 
and that in the rural population it is those who produce food who suffer disproportionately, 
and alarmed that 80 per cent of people suffering from hunger live in rural areas, particularly 
in developing countries, and 50 per cent are small-scale and traditional farm holders, as 
well as subsistence farmers, and that these people are especially vulnerable to food 
insecurity, malnutrition, discrimination and exploitation, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing</i> that livelihoods in rural areas are disproportionately affected by 
poverty, climate change, lack of development and lack of access to scientific progress, 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

<p><i>Taking note</i> of the draft declaration on the rights of peasants and people working in 
rural areas prepared by the Advisory Committee, contained in its study submitted to the 
Human Rights Council,1 
</p>
<p><i>Convinced</i> of the need to strengthen the protection and realization of the human 
rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas, 
</p>
<p><i>Welcoming</i> the report of the open-ended intergovernmental working group on its 
first session,<footnote name="2">A/HRC/26/48. </footnote> held from 15 to 19 July 2013, pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 
21/19, and in particular the inputs from Governments, regional groups, civil society and 
relevant stakeholders, 
</p>
<p><i>Taking note</i> of the expert seminar on the rights of peasants and other people working 
in rural areas held on 8 and 9 April 2014 at the Geneva Academy of International 
Humanitarian Law and Human Rights, with the participation of experts from academia, 
international organizations, civil society, States as observers, and other relevant 
stakeholders, 
</p>
<p><i>Bearing in mind</i> the development of this issue,  
</p>
<p>1. <i>Decides</i> that the working group with the mandate of negotiating, finalizing 
and submitting to the Human Rights Council a draft United Nations declaration on the 
rights of peasants and other people working in rural areas shall hold its second session for 
five working days before the twenty-ninth session of the Council;  
</p>
<p>2. <i>Requests</i> the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group to conduct 
informal consultations with Governments, relevant special procedures of the Human Rights 
Council, regional groups, intergovernmental organizations, United Nations mechanisms, 
civil society and representatives of peasants and other people working in rural areas, as well 
as other relevant stakeholders and other relevant specialized agencies of the United Nations 
system before the second session of the working group; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Also requests</i> the Chairperson-Rapporteur of the working group to prepare a 
new text on the basis of the draft declaration presented by the Advisory Committee, the 
discussions held during the first session of the working group and the informal 
consultations to be held, and to present it to the working group at its second session for 
consideration and further discussion; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Invites</i> States, civil society and all relevant stakeholders to contribute actively 
and constructively to the work of the working group; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Requests</i> the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights to provide the working group with the human, technical and financial assistance 
necessary for it to fulfil its mandate; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Requests</i> the working group to submit to the Human Rights Council for 
consideration at its thirtieth session a report on progress made, which should be published 
as an official document in all the official languages of the United Nations.
