Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)
1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Basis of Presentation
These consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared from the books and records of Park
Place Energy Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Park Place”, the “Company”, “we”, or “our”). In our opinion, all
normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the Company as of June
30, 2016, and the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, have been made in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. These interim financial
statements and notes are condensed as permitted by the instructions to Form 10-Q and should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company included in its Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015.
(b) Loss Per Share
The Company computes loss per share of Company stock in accordance with ASC 260 (“Earnings per Share”), which
requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) on the face of the income statement. Basic
EPS is computed by dividing the loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number
of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted
method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares
assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes dilutive potential
shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had
15,268,001 and 15,893,940, respectively, and 14,527,116 and 14,450,563, respectively, in potentially dilutive shares
outstanding that were excluded for the diluted EPS calculation.
2.) Going Concern
As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has no revenues and has incurred
continued losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of $14,679,777 at June 30, 2016. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management is actively pursuing new
ventures to increase revenues. In addition, the Company is currently seeking additional sources of capital to fund short
term operations. The Company, however, is dependent upon its ability to secure equity and/or debt financing and there
are no assurances that the Company will be successful, therefore, without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for
the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.

$2,815,366     $
The Company holds a 98,205 acre oil and gas exploration claim in the Dobrudja Basin located in northeast Bulgaria.
The Company intends to conduct exploration for natural gas and test production activities over a five year period in
accordance with or exceeding its minimum work program obligation. The Company intends to commence its work
program efforts once it receives all regular regulatory approvals of its work programs.
4.) Note Receivable
In April 2015, the Company loaned $38,570 to a Bulgarian company pursuant to a revolving credit facility, enabling
such Bulgarian company to buy and manage land in Bulgaria to be leased by the Company for future well sites. The
credit facility has a maximum loan obligation of BGN 1,000,000 ($564,800 at June 30, 2016), bears interest at 6.32%,
has a five-year term and is secured by the land the Bulgarian company buys. Payment on the facility is due the earlier
of the end of the five-year term (April 6, 2020) or demand by the Company. As of June 30, 2016 the outstanding
balance on the loan obligation was $40,203.
5.) Tiway Acquisition
The Company entered into a share purchase agreement on December 22, 2015 to acquire the three subsidiaries of
Tiway Oil B.V. (“Tiway”), a company currently in bankruptcy in the Netherlands. These Tiway subsidiaries are oil and
gas exploration and production companies operating in the Republic of Turkey. They own interests in three producing
oil and gas fields, one offshore and two onshore, as well as a number of exploration licenses and operate one of the
onshore fields. Current production for the Tiway subsidiaries is about 395 Boe/d (barrels per day equivalent). The
purchase price is $2.1 million USD and the Company paid at signing a $500,000 deposit toward the purchase price.
Prior to submitting the winning bid in the bankruptcy auction, the Company spent the prior 6 months actively gathering
and evaluating a large amount of data derived from earlier exploration and production activities on Tiway properties.
The transaction is subject to obtaining the approval of two regulatory agencies in Turkey, the GDPA which regulates
the oil and gas licenses and EMRA which regulates gas marketing. The approval from EMRA has been received; the
approval from GDPA is still pending. During the period prior to closing, in consultation with the Tiway staff and
partners in the various fields, the Company has prepared work programs for 2016 and into the future.
The transaction was originally scheduled to close March 31, 2016. However, the transaction is conditioned on
receiving the EMRA and GDPA regulatory approvals. Accordingly, the closing date has been extended a number of
times to allow sufficient time to secure the approvals from the respective regulatory agencies. Currently, the transaction
has been extended to August 23, 2016. To facilitate closing, the Company has formed a new wholly owned subsidiary,
Park Place Energy (Bermuda) Ltd. which will become the acquirer of the shares of the Tiway subsidiaries at closing.
6.) Stockholder Loan Payable
One of the Company’s major shareholders provided a loan to the Company totaling $17,500 during the second quarter
of 2016. The loan is repayable upon demand.
7.) Common Stock
In March 2016, the Company received subscriptions for 250,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 per share for total
proceeds of $25,000 which is included in stock subscriptions received. In April 2016, the Company received
subscriptions for 500,000 shares of common stock at $0.10 per share for total proceeds of $50,000. The Company
subsequently issued 4,250,000 shares of common stock for the stock subscriptions received during the six months
ended June 30, 2016.

Executive Summary
Park Place is an energy company engaged in oil and gas exploration in Bulgaria.
On November 12, 2015, Park Place became the successor registrant to Park Place Energy Corp, a Nevada
corporation (“PPEC Nevada”), following a reincorporation merger, approved by the stockholders of PPEC Nevada to
provide a better organizational structure for future acquisitions and management of operations. See Park Place’s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information on the reincorporation.
The Company holds a 98,205 acre oil and gas exploration claim in the Dobrudja Basin located in northeast Bulgaria.
The Company intends to conduct exploration for natural gas and test production activities in accordance with or
exceeding its minimum work program obligation. The Company intends to commence its work program efforts once it
receives all regulatory approvals of its work programs and the five year license term commences.
On August 26, 2014, the Bulgarian environmental agency approved the Company’s overall work program and first
year annual work program. A number of parties appealed the decision of the environmental agency and an appeal
proceeding was commenced before an administrative judge panel. Since then, there have been several hearings
resulting in a number of appellants being dismissed and empaneling a panel of experts to confirm the correctness of
the approval by the environmental agency. The Company is participating in that proceeding as an interested party.
The Company is continuing its data gathering, evaluation and planning, has acquired the land for a future well site and
has commissioned an environmental baseline survey of the license area. The initial term of the License Agreement
will not begin until (i) the appeal proceeding is completed and the decision upheld, (ii) the Bulgarian energy agency
has approved the Company’s work programs and (iii) the license term commences.
The Company entered into a share purchase agreement on December 22, 2015 to acquire the three subsidiaries of
Tiway Oil B.V. (“Tiway”), a company currently in bankruptcy in the Netherlands. These Tiway subsidiaries are oil and
gas exploration and production companies operating in the Republic of Turkey. They own interests in three producing
oil and gas fields, one offshore and two onshore, as well as a number of exploration licenses and operate one of the
onshore fields. Current production for the Tiway subsidiaries is about 395 Boe/d (barrels per day equivalent). The
purchase price is $2.1 million USD and the Company paid at signing a $500,000 deposit toward the purchase price.

The transaction is subject to obtaining the approval of two regulatory agencies in Turkey, the GDPA (which regulates
the oil and gas licenses) and EMRA (which regulates gas marketing). The approval from EMRA has been received;
the approval from GDPA is still pending. During the period prior to closing, in consultation with the Tiway staff and
partners in the various fields, the Company has prepared work programs for 2016 and into the future.
The transaction was originally scheduled to close March 31, 2016. However, the transaction is conditioned on
receiving certain regulatory approvals. Accordingly, the closing date has been extended a number of times to allow
sufficient time to secure the approvals from the respective regulatory agencies. Currently, the transaction has been
extended to August 23, 2016. To facilitate closing, the Company has formed a new wholly owned subsidiary, Park
Place Energy (Bermuda) Ltd. which will become the acquirer of the shares of the Tiway subsidiaries.
Results of Operations
The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated
financial statements for the periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, which are included herein.
Revenue
We are a pre-revenue stage company, and our future revenues depend upon successful exploration of oil and gas
assets.
Expenses
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, our general and administrative expenses decreased over the comparable
prior year period. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our general and administrative expenses decreased to
$282,567 from $411,019 for the same period in 2015. Our overhead decreased from last year primary because the
Company has been in a holding pattern waiting for the Tiway transaction to close and waiting for clearance of all
regulatory hurdles in Bulgaria to commence work on the Vranino 1-11 license.
Other Income/Expense
Foreign exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $3,082 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
a gain of $11,017 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, other
income was $1,899 and other expenses were $38,072, respectively, due to a foreign exchange loss.
Loss
Our net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $108,123 compared to a loss of $183,571 for the three
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was primarily due lower expenses for the period. Our net loss
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $280,668 compared to a loss of $449,091 for the six months ended June
30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was a result of the decrease in expenses described above.

We used net cash of $104,869 in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $520,421
for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease was due to decreased activities in all areas of operations.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $32,079 compared to $227,361 for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily due to decreased expenditures on both the
Bulgarian project and the Tiway acquisition.
Cash Provided by Financing Activities
We have funded our business to date primarily from sales of our common stock through private placements. During the
six months ended June 30, 2016, we received cash of $75,000 for stock subscriptions. We did not have any common
stock sales during the six months ended June 30, 2015. One of the Company’s major shareholders provided a loan to
the Company totaling $17,500 during the second quarter of 2016. The loan is repayable upon demand.
Future Operating Requirements
Based on our current plan of operations, we estimate that we will require approximately $3.6 million to pursue our plan
of operations over the next 12 months: $1.6 million to close the acquisition of the Tiway companies, $1.1 million for
planned work programs on assets owned by the Tiway companies post-acquisition and $900,000 for ongoing
operating costs and corporate expenditures.
The Company has no revenues and has incurred continuous losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of
$14,679,777 at June 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
going concern. Management is actively pursuing new ventures to increase revenues. In addition, the Company is
currently seeking additional sources of capital to fund short term operations and fund the Tiway acquisition. The
Company, however, is dependent upon its ability to secure equity and/or debt financing and there are no assurances
that the Company will be successful, therefore, without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to
continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the
outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements also
do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts
and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

Forward-Looking Information
Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of
applicable U.S. securities legislation. Additionally, forward-looking statements may be made orally or in press
releases, conferences, reports, on our website or otherwise, in the future, by us or on our behalf. Such statements are
generally identifiable by the terminology used such as “plans,” “expects,” “estimates,” “budgets,” “intends,”
“anticipates,” “believes,” “projects,” “indicates,” “targets,” “objective,” “could,” “should,” “may” or other similar words.
By their very nature, forward-looking statements require us to make assumptions that may not materialize or that may
not be accurate. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other
factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or
implied by such statements, including the factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: fluctuations in and volatility of the
market prices for oil and natural gas products; the ability to produce and transport oil and natural gas; the results of
exploration and development drilling and related activities; global economic conditions, particularly in the countries in
which we carry on business, especially economic slowdowns; actions by governmental authorities including increases
in taxes, legislative and regulatory initiatives related to fracture stimulation activities, changes in environmental and
other regulations, and renegotiations of contracts; political uncertainty, including actions by insurgent groups or other
conflicts; the negotiation and closing of material contracts; future capital requirements and the availability of financing;
estimates and economic assumptions used in connection with our acquisitions; risks associated with drilling,
operating and decommissioning wells; actions of third-party co-owners of interests in properties in which we also own
an interest; our ability to effectively integrate companies and properties that we acquire; our limited operating history;
our history of operating losses; our lack of insurance coverage; and the other factors discussed in other documents that
we file with or furnish to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The impact of any one factor on a particular
forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as such factors are interdependent upon other factors and
our course of action would depend upon our assessment of the future, considering all information then available. In
that regard, any statements as to: future oil or natural gas production levels; capital expenditures; the allocation of
capital expenditures to exploration and development activities; sources of funding for our capital expenditure
programs; drilling of new wells; demand for oil and natural gas products; expenditures and allowances relating to
environmental matters; dates by which certain areas will be developed or will come on-stream; expected finding and
development costs; future production rates; ultimate recoverability of reserves, including the ability to convert probable
and possible reserves to proved reserves; dates by which transactions are expected to close; future cash flows, uses
of cash flows, collectability of receivables and availability of trade credit; expected operating costs; changes in any of
the foregoing and other statements using forward-looking terminology are forward-looking statements, and there can
be no assurance that the expectations conveyed by such forward-looking statements will, in fact, be realized.
Although we believe that the expectations conveyed by the forward-looking statements are reasonable based on
information available to us on the date such forward-looking statements were made, no assurances can be given as to
future results, levels of activity, achievements or financial condition.
Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement and should recognize that the statements
are predictions of future results, which may not occur as anticipated. Actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in the forward-looking statements and from historical results, due to the risks and uncertainties described
above, as well as others not now anticipated. The foregoing statements are not exclusive and further information
concerning us, including factors that potentially could materially affect our financial results, may emerge from time to
time. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or
assumptions affecting such forward-looking statements.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure of Controls and Procedures

have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
