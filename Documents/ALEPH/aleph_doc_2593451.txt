ATLAS AMERICA PUBLIC #9 LTD.
CONDENSED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
June 30, 2016
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Atlas America Public #9 LTD. (the “Partnership”) is a Pennsylvania limited partnership, formed
on July 27, 2000 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and
Operator (“Atlas Resources” or the “MGP”). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas
Resource Partners, L.P. (“ARP”) (OTC: ARPJ). Unless the context otherwise requires, references
to “the Partnership,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Atlas America Public #9 LTD.
Atlas Energy Group, LLC (“Atlas Energy Group”; OTC: ATLS) manages ARP’s operations and
activities through its ownership of ARP’s general partner interest.
The Partnership has drilled and currently operates wells located in Pennsylvania and Ohio. The
Partnership has no employees and relies on the MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its
parent company, Atlas Energy Group, for administrative services.
The Partnership’s operating cash flows are generated from its wells, which produce natural gas
and oil. Produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-
party gas gathering systems. The Partnership intends to produce its wells until they are depleted
or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold.
The Partnership does not expect to drill additional wells and expects no additional funds will be
required for drilling.
The condensed financial statements, which are unaudited, except for the balance sheet at
December 31, 2015, which is derived from audited financial statements, have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) for
interim reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant
to those rules and regulations, although we believe that the disclosures made are adequate to
make the information not misleading. These interim financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto presented in the
Partnership’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of
the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.
The economic viability of the Partnership’s production is based on a variety of factors including
proved developed reserves that it can expect to recover through existing wells with existing
equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of additional required extraction
equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and through currently installed
extraction equipment and related infrastructure which is operational at the time of the reserves
estimate (if the extraction is by means not involving drilling, completing or reworking a well).
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven reserves and in
projecting future net revenues.
The prices at which the Partnership’s natural gas and oil will be sold are uncertain and the
Partnership is not guaranteed a specific price for the sale of its production. Changes in natural
gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the Partnership’s cash flow and the value of its
reserves. Lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease the Partnership’s revenues, but
also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the Partnership can produce
economically.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from its
operations to fund its obligations and make distributions, if any, to its partners. Prices for oil and
natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014 and have continued to
decline and remain low in 2016. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted the
Partnership’s revenues, earnings and cash flows. Sustained low commodity prices will have a
material and adverse effect on the Partnership’s liquidity position. In addition, the Partnership has
experienced significant downward revisions of its natural gas and oil reserves volumes and
values due to the declines in commodity prices. The MGP continues to implement various cost
saving measures to reduce the Partnership’s operating and general and administrative costs,
including renegotiating contracts with contractors, suppliers and service providers, reducing the
number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating discretionary costs. The MGP will
continue to be strategic in managing the Partnership’s cost structure and, in turn, liquidity to meet
its operating needs. To the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further, or the
Partnership experiences other disruptions in the industry, the Partnership’s ability to fund its
operations and make distributions may be further impacted, and could result in the MGP’s
decision to liquidate the Partnership’s operations.
8
If, however, the MGP were to decide to liquidate our operations, the liquidation valuation of the
Partnership’s assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert. It is possible
that based on such determination, we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to
our limited partners. A liquidation could result in the transfer of the post-liquidation assets and
liabilities of the Partnership to the MGP and would occur without any further contributions from or
distributions to the limited partners.
Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the
cash flow from the Partnership’s operations have been adequate to fund its obligations and
distributions to its partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have
challenged the Partnership’s ability to fund its operations and may make it uneconomical for the
Partnership to produce its wells until they are depleted as the Partnership originally intended.
Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about the Partnership’s ability to
continue as a going concern. The MGP intends, as necessary, to continue the Partnership’s
operations and to fund the Partnership’s obligations for at least the next twelve months. To the
extent commodity prices remain low or decline further or ARP is unsuccessful in completing its
Restructuring (as defined below) or the Plan (as defined below), the MGP’s ability to continue the
Partnership’s operations and to fund the Partnership’s obligations for at least the next twelve
months, as necessary, may be further impacted.
ARP Restructuring and Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings
On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, including the MGP, and Atlas Energy
Group, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, entered into a restructuring support
agreement with ARP’s lenders (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) to support ARP’s
restructuring that will reduce debt on its balance sheet (the “Restructuring”) pursuant to a pre-
packaged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”).  The Plan will position ARP for the future and is
expected to be completed before the end of the third quarter of 2016, after which ARP should
emerge from Chapter 11 (as defined below), backed by its stakeholders, committed to investing
capital to develop its exploration and production assets, as well as its tax-advantaged drilling
partnership program.
On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, including the MGP, filed voluntary petitions
for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The
cases commenced thereby are being jointly administered under the caption “In re: ATLAS
RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.” Interested parties should refer to the information and the
limitations and qualifications discussed in the disclosure statement related to the Restructuring
which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to ARP’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on July 25, 2016.
The MGP intends to continue to operate the Partnership’s businesses as “debtors in possession”
under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, it is contemplated that all
suppliers, vendors, employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords will be unimpaired
and will be satisfied in full in the ordinary course of business, and the MGP’s existing trade
contracts and terms will be maintained. To assure ordinary course operations, the MGP obtained
interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions
seeking authority to use cash collateral on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for
individuals who provide services to the Partnership, and pay vendors, oil and gas obligations
and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
The Partnership is not a party to the Restructuring Support Agreement. The ARP Restructuring is
not expected to materially impact the MGP or its ability to perform as the managing general
partner and operator of the Partnership’s operations. On July 26, 2016, the MGP adopted certain
amendments to our partnership agreement, in accordance with the MGP’s ability to amend our
partnership agreement to cure an ambiguity in or correct or supplement any provision of our
partnership agreement as may be inconsistent with any other provision, to provide that
bankruptcy and insolvency events, such as the MGP’s Chapter 11 filing, with respect to the
managing general partner will not cause the managing general partner to cease to serve as the
managing general partner of the Partnership nor cause the termination of the Partnership.
Atlas Energy Group is not a party to the ARP Restructuring. Atlas Energy Group remains
controlled by the same ownership group and management team and thus, the ARP Restructuring
is not expected to have a material impact on the ability of Atlas Energy Group management to
operate ARP or the other Atlas Energy Group businesses.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the Partnership’s condensed financial statements in conformity with U.S.
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities that exist
at the date of the Partnership’s condensed financial statements, as well as the reported amounts
of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting periods. The Partnership’s condensed
financial statements are based on a number of significant estimates, including the revenue and
expense accruals, depletion, impairments, fair value of derivative instruments and the probability
of forecasted transactions. The natural gas industry principally conducts its business by
processing actual transactions as many as 60 days after the month of delivery. Consequently, the
most recent two months’ financial results were recorded using estimated volumes and contract
market prices. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Gas and Oil Properties
The following is a summary of gas and oil properties at the dates indicated:

Gas and oil properties, net
$254,600
$537,000
$537,000
As a result of the recent significant declines in commodity prices and associated recorded
impairment charges, remaining net book value of gas and oil properties on our condensed
balance sheets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the estimated
salvage value of such properties.  The estimated salvage values were based on the MGP’s
historical experience in determining such values.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In August 2014, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to the evaluation of whether
there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The updated
accounting guidance requires an entity’s management to evaluate whether there are conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one
year from the date the financial statements are issued and provide footnote disclosures, if
necessary. The updated guidance is effective as of January 1, 2017 and the Partnership is
currently in the process of determining the impact of providing the enhanced disclosures, as
applicable, within its condensed financial statements.
In May 2014, the FASB updated the accounting guidance related to revenue recognition. The
updated accounting guidance provides a single, contract-based revenue recognition model to
help improve financial reporting by providing clearer guidance on when an entity should
recognize revenue, and by reducing the number of standards to which an entity has to refer. In
July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date by one year to December 15, 2017 for
annual reporting periods beginning after that date. The updated accounting guidance provides
companies with alternative methods of adoption. The Partnership is currently in the process of
determining the impact that the updated accounting guidance will have on its condensed
financial statements and its method of adoption.
NOTE 3 - DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
The MGP, on behalf of the Partnership, uses a number of different derivative instruments,
principally put contracts, in connection with the Partnership’s commodity price risk management
activities. The Partnership does not apply hedge accounting to any of its derivative instruments.
As a result, gains and losses associated with derivative instruments are recognized in earnings.
The Partnership enters into commodity put contracts to achieve more predictable cash flows by
hedging the Partnership’s exposure to changes in commodity prices. At any point in time, such
contracts may include regulated New York Mercantile Stock Exchange (“NYMEX”) futures and
options contracts and non-regulated over-the-counter futures contracts with qualified
counterparties. NYMEX contracts are generally settled with offsetting positions, but may be
settled by the physical delivery of the commodity. These contracts have been recorded at their
fair values.

The Partnership reflected net derivative assets on its condensed balance sheets of $5,200 and
$13,400 at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The following table summarizes the commodity derivative activity and presentation in the
condensed statements of operations for the periods indicated:

(3)The production volumes for 2016 includes the remaining six months of 2016 beginning July 1,
2016.
As the underlying prices and terms in the Partnership’s derivative contracts were consistent with
the indices used to sell its natural gas and oil, there were no gains or losses recognized during
the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 for hedge ineffectiveness.
NOTE 4 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Partnership uses a market approach fair value methodology to value for its outstanding
derivative contracts. The fair value of a financial instrument depends on a number of factors,
including the availability of observable market data over the contractual term of the underlying
instrument. The Partnership separates the fair value of its financial instruments into three levels
(Levels 1, 2 and 3) based on its assessment of the availability of observable market data and the
significance of non-observable data used to determine fair value.  As of June 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, all derivative financial instruments were classified as Level 2.
Information for assets measured at fair value at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was as

The Partnership has entered into the following significant transactions with the MGP and its
affiliates as provided under its Partnership Agreement. Administrative costs, which are included
in general and administrative expenses in the Partnership’s condensed statements of operations,
are payable at $75 per well per month. Monthly well supervision fees, which are included in
production expense in the Partnership’s condensed statements of operations, are payable at
$337 per well per month for operating and maintaining the wells. Well supervision fees are
proportionately reduced to the extent the Partnership does not acquire 100% of the working
interest in a well. Transportation fees are included in production expenses in the Partnership’s
condensed statements of operations and are generally payable at 13% of the natural gas sales
price. Direct costs, which are included in production and general administrative expenses in the
Partnership’s condensed statements of operations, are payable to the MGP and its affiliates as
reimbursement for all costs expended on the Partnership’s behalf.
The following table provides information with respect to these costs and the periods incurred:

Partnership, including billing revenues and paying expenses. Accounts payable trade-affiliate on
the Partnership’s condensed balance sheets includes the net production expenses due to the
MGP.
NOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
General Commitments
Subject to certain conditions, investor partners may present their interests for purchase by the
MGP. The purchase price is calculated by the MGP in accordance with the terms of the
partnership agreement. The MGP is not obligated to purchase more than 5% of the total
outstanding units in any calendar year. In the event that the MGP is unable to obtain the
necessary funds, it may suspend its purchase obligation.
Beginning one year after each of the Partnership’s wells has been placed into production, the
MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month per well to cover estimated future plugging and
abandonment costs. As of June 30, 2016, the MGP has withheld $285,200 of net production
revenue for future plugging and abandonment costs.
Legal Proceedings
The Partnership and affiliates of the MGP and their subsidiaries are a party to various routine
legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of its business. Management and the MGP’s
management believe that none of these actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on the Partnership’s or the MGP’s financial condition or results of
operations.

General
Atlas America Public #9 LTD. (“we”, “us” or the “Partnership”) is a Pennsylvania limited
partnership, formed on July 27, 2000 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General
Partner and Operator (“Atlas Resources” or the “MGP”). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary
of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. (“ARP”) (OTCQX: ARPJ). Unless the context otherwise requires,
references to “the Partnership,” “we,” “us” and “our”, refer to Atlas America Public #9 LTD.
Atlas Energy Group, LLC (“Atlas Energy Group”) manages ARP’s operations and activities
through its ownership of the ARP’s general partner interest.
We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania and Ohio. We have no
employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company,
Atlas Energy Group, for administrative services.
We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to
produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other
wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.
Overview
The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition
and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce
primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to
market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and
maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of
our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee,
which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of
natural gas and oil such as:
●well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;
 ●reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records;
and
●preparation of reports for us and government agencies.
The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase
of certain equipment, materials and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost
for third-party services, materials and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our
MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into
production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well, to cover the estimated
future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of June 30, 2016, our MGP has withheld
$285,200 of net production revenues for this purpose.
Markets and Competition
The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained,
depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production,
imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing
countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of
federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental
regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity,
availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for
selling our production. During 2016 and 2015, we experienced no problems in selling our natural
gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural
gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in
the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.

Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $43,700 and $47,400 for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $3,700 (8%). The $3,700
decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
prior year similar period was attributable to a $2,700 decrease in our natural gas sales prices
after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $1,000
decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 348 mcf per day for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 from 356 mcf per day for the three months ended June 30,
2015, a decrease of 8 mcf per day (2%). The decrease in production volumes is mostly due to
normal decline inherent in the life of the wells and a decrease in the number of producing wells
was a result of wells being shut-in due to it being uneconomical to continue production in the
current pricing environment.
Our natural gas revenues were $85,300 and $136,400 for the six months ended June 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $51,100 (37%). The $51,100 decrease in natural gas
revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year similar period
was attributable to a $34,100 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial
hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $17,000 decrease in production volumes.
Our production volumes decreased to 332 mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2016
from 382 mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of 50 mcf per day
(13%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the six months ended
June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal
decline inherent in the life of a well and a decrease in the number of producing wells as a result
of wells being shut-in due to it being uneconomical to continue production in the current pricing
environment.
Oil Revenues. We drilled wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells
have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $8,500 and $7,800 for the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $700 (9%). The $700 increase in oil
revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year similar period
was attributable to a $4,500 increase in production volumes and a $3,800 decrease in oil prices.
Our production volumes increased to 2.46 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2016
from 1.57 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of 0.89 bbls per
day (57%).
Our oil revenues were $8,500 and $19,800 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, a decrease of $11,300 (57%). The $11,300 decrease in oil revenues for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a
$2,300 decrease in oil prices and a $9,000 decrease in production volumes. Our production
volumes decreased to 1.23 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 2.26 bbls
per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of 1.03 bbls per day (46%).
14
(Loss) Gain on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. We recognize changes in fair value of our derivatives
immediately within (loss) gain on mark-to-market derivatives on our condensed statements of
operations.
We recognized a loss on mark-to-market derivatives of $2,400 and $1,900 for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $100 for the six months ended June 30, 2016,
and a gain of $100 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. These changes were due to changes
in mark-to-market values primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the periods.
Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $104,900 and $83,900 for the three months
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $21,000 (25%). This increase was
primarily due to an increase in repair work done during the three months ended June 30,
2016.  Production expenses were $180,000 and $183,000 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $3,000 (2%). This decrease was primarily due to a
combination of a decrease in transportation charges and supervision fees.
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were
$26,800 and $26,800, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, these
expenses were $52,400 and $55,200, respectively, a decrease of $2,800 (5%). These expenses
include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our
MGP.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, there was no depletion recorded due to the
recent significant declines in commodity prices and associated previously recorded impairment
charges. Therefore, the remaining net book value of gas and oil properties on our condensed
balance sheet at December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the estimated salvage value of
such properties. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, depletion of gas and oil
properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was 16% and 12%, respectively.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations to
fund our obligations and make distributions, if any, to our partners. Prices for oil and natural gas
began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014 and have continued to decline and
remain low in 2016. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted our revenues,
earnings and cash flows. Sustained low commodity prices will have a material and adverse effect
on our liquidity position. In addition, we have experienced significant downward revisions of its
natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values due to the declines in commodity prices. The
MGP continues to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our operating and general
and administrative costs, including renegotiating contracts with contractors, suppliers and service
providers, reducing the number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating
discretionary costs. The MGP will continue to be strategic in managing our cost structure and, in
turn, liquidity to meet our operating needs. To the extent commodity prices remain low or decline
further, or we experience other disruptions in the industry, our ability to fund our operations and
make distributions may be further impacted, and could result in the MGP’s decision to liquidate
our operations.
If, however, the MGP were to decide to liquidate our operations, the liquidation valuation of our
assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert. It is possible that based on
such determination, we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to our limited
partners. A liquidation could result in the transfer of the post-liquidation assets and liabilities of
the Partnership to the MGP and would occur without any further contributions from or distributions
to the limited partners.
Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the
cash flow from our operations have been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our
partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our
ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical for us to produce our wells until they
are depleted as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends, as necessary, to
continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. To the
extent commodity prices remain low or decline further or ARP is unsuccessful in completing its
Restructuring (as defined below) or the Plan (as defined below), the MGP’s ability to continue our
operations may be further impacted.
ARP Restructuring and Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Proceedings
On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, including the MGP, and Atlas Energy
Group, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, entered into a restructuring support
agreement with ARP’s lenders (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) to support ARP’s
restructuring that will reduce debt on its balance sheet (the “Restructuring”) pursuant to a pre-
packaged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”).  The Plan will position ARP for the future and is
expected to be completed before the end of the third quarter of 2016, after which ARP should
emerge from Chapter 11 (as defined below), backed by its stakeholders, committed to investing
capital to develop its exploration and production assets, as well as its tax-advantaged drilling
partnership program.
15
On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, including the MGP, filed voluntary petitions
for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The
cases commenced thereby are being jointly administered under the caption “In re: ATLAS
RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.” Interested parties should refer to the information and the
limitations and qualifications discussed in the disclosure statement related to the Restructuring
which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to ARP’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission on July 25, 2016.
The MGP intends to continue to operate the Partnership’s businesses as “debtors in possession”
under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of
Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, it is contemplated that all
suppliers, vendors, employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords will be unimpaired
and will be satisfied in full in the ordinary course of business, and the MGP’s existing trade
contracts and terms will be maintained. To assure ordinary course operations, the MGP obtained
interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions
seeking authority to use cash collateral on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for
individuals who provide services to the Partnership, and pay vendors, oil and gas obligations
and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
The Partnership is not a party to the Restructuring Support Agreement. The ARP Restructuring is
not expected to materially impact the MGP or its ability to perform as the managing general
partner and operator of the Partnership’s operations. On July 26, 2016, the MGP adopted certain
amendments to our partnership agreement, in accordance with the MGP’s ability to amend our
partnership agreement to cure an ambiguity in or correct or supplement any provision of our
partnership agreement as may be inconsistent with any other provision, to provide that
bankruptcy and insolvency events, such as the MGP’s Chapter 11 filing, with respect to the
managing general partner will not cause the managing general partner to cease to serve as the
managing general partner of the Partnership nor cause the termination of the Partnership.
Atlas Energy Group is not a party to the ARP Restructuring. Atlas Energy Group remains
controlled by the same ownership group and management team and thus, the ARP Restructuring
is not expected to have a material impact on the ability of Atlas Energy Group management to
operate ARP or the other Atlas Energy Group businesses
There was $0 provided by operating activities for six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.
This was mostly due to a decrease in net earnings before depletion, accretion, and non-cash
gain on derivative value of $50,100, a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-
affiliate of $56,800 and a decrease in the asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $16,100. The
decrease was offset by an increase in the change in accrued liabilities of $5,100 and an increase
in the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $117,900 for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the period ended June 30, 2015.
There was no cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 or
2015.
There was no cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.
Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through June 30,
2016, our MGP has withheld $285,200 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required,
will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are
not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time
may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-
parties.
