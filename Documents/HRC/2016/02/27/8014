<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food undertook an official visit to Canada 
from 6 to 16 May 2012, at the invitation of the Government. The purpose of the mission 
was to examine the way in which the human right to adequate food is being realized in 
Canada. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
Canada for coordinating the visit. Additionally, he is grateful to the representatives of the 
following federal government departments who met with him: Aboriginal Affairs and 
Northern Development Canada; Agriculture and Agri-Foods Canada; Fisheries and Oceans 
Canada; Health Canada; Human Resources and Skills Development Canada; Justice 
Canada; and the Canadian International Development Agency. He also met with the 
Minister of Health, Leona Aglukkaq. 
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur also had the opportunity to meet with provincial and 
municipal authorities, including the Nunavut Department of Health and Social Services; the 
Ontario Ministries of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, Children and Youth Services, 
and Health and Long-Term Care; the Ontario Human Rights Commission and the Human 
Rights Legal Support Centre; the City of Toronto (Food Strategy Team and Food Policy 
Council); and the Manitoba Ministry of Aboriginal and Northern Affairs, Ministry of 
Agriculture, Food and Rural Initiatives, Ministry of Family Services and Labour, and 
Ministry of Healthy Living, Seniors and Consumer Affairs. The Special Rapporteur also 
met with political party officials, including Thomas Mulcair, leader of the New Democratic 
Party, and Bob Rae, interim leader of the Liberal Party.  
</p>
<p>3. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur travelled to Montreal, Qu&#233;bec; Ottawa and 
Toronto, Ontario; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and Edmonton, Alberta. In these locations, he 
convened eight civil society meetings in which he met with farmers&#8217; organizations, food 
security groups, human rights organizations, academics, researchers and community 
members. He received submissions from across Canada, both at these meetings and in 
writing.  
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur also had the occasion to meet with aboriginal groups and 
communities in Qu&#233;bec, Ontario, Manitoba and Alberta, including the Inuit Tapiriit 
Kanatami, Inuit Circumpolar Council-Canada and the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples. In 
particular, the Special Rapporteur would like to warmly thank the Assembly of Manitoba 
Chiefs, Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak and Southern Chiefs Organization for 
facilitating his visits within Manitoba to the Sagkeeng First Nation (where he met with 
chiefs, council and community members from Chemawawin Cree Nation, 
Pukatawagan/Mathias Cree Nation, Lake Manitoba, Peguis, Swan Lake and Treaty 3 First 
Nations) and to God&#8217;s River, Manto Sipi Cree and Wasagamack First Nations around the 
</p>
<p>Island Lakes area. The Special Rapporteur also extends his gratitude to the Confederacy of 
Treaty 6 First Nations, the Alexis Nakota Sioux First Nation and the International Indian 
Treaty Council for facilitating his visits in Alberta (where he met with chiefs, council 
members and communities from Treaties 6, 7, 8, the Enoch Cree First Nation and the 
Northwest Territories). He is grateful for the hospitality of the First Nations communities, 
and he thanks them for their time and engagement with him.  </p>

<p><b> II. The situation of food insecurity 
</b></p>
<p>5. Canada is ranked sixth in the Human Development Index1 and has an average GDP 
per capita of $39,070.2 While the recent financial and economic crises have impacted 
Canada, with rising unemployment rates and a drop in income per capita, Canada has fared 
reasonably well compared to its peers.3 Meanwhile, however, the gaps between those living 
in poverty and the middle- and high-income segments of the population are widening. In 
2008, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated 
that the average income of the top 10 per cent (Can$103,500) was 10 times higher than that 
of the bottom 10 per cent (Can$10,260) and noted widening disparities in labour earnings 
and a lack of redistributional mechanisms. Statistics Canada indicates that the ratio of after-
tax income of the top 20 per cent of families to the bottom 20 per cent of families rose from 
4.6 in the early 1990s to about 5.5 in 2000, remaining fairly stable since. Canada, however, 
ranks very high in the OECD 2010 Intergenerational Social Mobility Index. </p>
<p>6. A growing number of people across Canada remain unable to meet their basic food 
needs. In 2007/2008, 7.7 per cent of households reported experiencing moderate or severe 
food insecurity,4 approximately 1.92 million people, aged 12 or older, lived in food-
insecure households and a staggering one in 10 families, with at least one child under the 
age of six, were food insecure.5 Preliminary household data from the Canadian Community 
Health Survey (CCHS) 2011 indicates that 8.2 per cent (1.1 million) households now may 
be food insecure, some estimates putting the figure at 4.3 million people.6 Furthermore, in 
2007/2008, 55 per cent of households in which the main source of income was social 
assistance were food insecure, the result of a pronounced discrepancy between social 
assistance levels and the rising costs of living.7 
</p>
<p>7. The inadequacy of social protection schemes to meet the basic needs of households 
has precipitated the proliferation of private and charity-based food aid. In 2011, Food 
Banks Canada calculated that nearly 900,000 Canadians were accessing food banks for 
assistance monthly, slightly over half of whom were receiving social assistance.8 However, 
without access to food banks, vulnerable households in remote and northern communities 
also depend on private and charitable food support, although no figures are available on 
this.  
</p>
<p>8. Certain segments of the population remain particularly vulnerable to food insecurity. 
Households with low incomes, those relying on social assistance as their main source of 
income, those who do not own their own dwelling, women single-headed households,

</p>
<p>Aboriginal populations living off-reserve and new immigrant households9 confront 
increased food insecurity in comparison to the average Canadian household. The Special 
Rapporteur was disconcerted by the deep and severe food insecurity faced by Aboriginal 
peoples living both on- and off-reserve in remote and urban areas. In the Yukon, the 
Northwest Territories and Nunavut, where the greatest concentration of Inuit populations 
resides, food insecurity in 2007/2008 was 11.6 per cent, 12.4 per cent and 32.6 per cent 
respectively.10 First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey (RHS 2008/10) indicates 
that 17.8 per cent of First Nations adults (age 25&#8211;39) and 16.1 per cent of First Nations 
adults (age 40&#8211;54) reported being hungry, but did not eat due to lack of money for food in 
2007/2008. Though the situation of food insecurity is monitored through surveys such as 
the Canadian Community Health Survey, the Inuit Health Survey and the First Nations 
Food, Nutrition and Environment Study, data on food insecurity in M&#233;tis populations was 
not found. 
</p>
<p><b> III. The legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. Canada's record on civil and political rights has been impressive. Its protection of 
economic and social rights, including the right to food, has been less exemplary.  
</p>
<p>10. As a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 
the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, and the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child, Canada has a duty to respect, protect and fulfil the right to food. 
Yet, Canada does not currently afford constitutional or legal protection of the right to food. 
The 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects a number of civil and political 
rights, but has no substantive provisions protecting social and economic rights, broadly, and 
the right to food, more specifically. While section 7 (protecting the right to life, liberty and 
security of the person) and section 15 (guaranteeing the right to equality before and under 
the law ) provide avenues for the protection of the right to food, and the judiciary has 
repeatedly affirmed that international human rights norms constitute persuasive sources for 
constitutional and statutory interpretation,11 case law has yet to recognize explicitly the 
right to food.  
</p>
<p>11. The Canadian Human Rights Act also does not protect economic and social rights. 
Similarly, while each province has human rights legislation, in many cases, listing &quot;social 
condition&quot; or &quot;source of income&quot; as a protected class under the law, none codifies the right 
to food or economic and social rights more broadly. At the federal level, however, poverty 
and socio-economic status are not recognized as a prohibited ground for discrimination, 
though a panel appointed by the Minister of Justice to review the Canadian Human Rights 
Act found, in 2000, &#8220;ample evidence of widespread discrimination based on characteristics 
</p>
<p>related to social conditions, such as poverty, low education, homelessness and illiteracy,&#8221; 
and recommended that &#8220;social condition&quot; be included as a prohibited ground for 
</p>
<p>  
 9  In 2007/2008, 12.6 per cent of recent immigrant households were food insecure, in comparison to 7.5 
</p>
<p>per cent of non-immigrant households, and 7.8 per cent in non-recent immigrant households, see 
Health Canada, &#8220;Household Food Insecurity in Canada in 2007-2008&#8221; (see footnote 5).

</p>
<p>discrimination.12 This is also recommended by the Committee on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights.  
</p>
<p>12. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the growing gap between Canada&#8217;s 
international human rights commitments and their implementation domestically. The 
Government has affirmed that the Charter can be interpreted as guaranteeing the right to the 
means necessary for an adequate standard of living.13 For example, in its submission to the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights during its second periodic review, the 
Government averred that &#8220;[w]hile the guarantee of security of the person under section 7 of 
</p>
<p>the Charter might not lead to a right to a certain type of social assistance, it ensured that 
persons were not deprived of the basic necessities of life.&#8221;14  It is thus perplexing that when 
the issue arose before the courts, successive governments opposed interpretations of 
Charter provisions that would provide remedies to homelessness, hunger or other violations 
of the right to an adequate standard of living. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that 
although the Continuing Committee of Officials on Human Rights (comprised of officials 
at the federal, provincial and territory levels) has been established to ensure follow-up of 
recommendations from the United Nations human rights mechanisms, such follow-up is in 
practice uneven (E/C.12/CAN/CO/4, E/C.12/CAN/CO/5, para. 12).  
</p>
<p><b> B. The policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>13. A growing number of provinces are implementing or developing poverty reduction 
strategies, some of which have been enshrined in legislation, such as An Act to Combat 
Poverty and Social Exclusion in Qu&#233;bec, the Poverty Reduction Act, 2009 in Ontario, or 
Manitoba&#8217;s 2011 Poverty Reduction Strategy Act. Provinces have taken steps to develop 
rural economies, encourage the production and consumption of local foods and adopt 
policies seeking to improve food security and promote healthy diets, including British 
Columbia&#8217;s Community Food Action Initiative, the Yukon&#8217;s Nutrition Framework, 
</p>
<p>Alberta&#8217;s Nutrition Guidelines for Children and Youth, Manitoba&#8217;s Northern Healthy Foods 
</p>
<p>Initiative, Ontario&#8217;s Student Nutrition Program and Nunavut&#8217;s Framework for Action on 
</p>
<p>Nutrition. In addition, some provinces have adopted legislation to protect agricultural land 
from urban development, such as Qu&#233;bec, British Columbia and Ontario. These are all 
important steps toward ensuring the right to food. But no province has adopted a food 
strategy as such, combining different objectives in a holistic approach cutting across 
sectors.  
</p>
<p>14. Food policies are emerging at the municipal level. A large number of food policy 
councils have been formed across Canada, establishing a forum for dialogue among the 
diverse actors working on food issues, and working from a food systems perspective in an 
effort to integrate issues of food, agriculture, health, transportation, economy and social 
protection. The Special Rapporteur met representatives of the Toronto Food Policy Council, 
established in 1991 under the auspices of the Toronto Board of Health. The Food Policy 
Council, comprised of 30 members from the community, the Board of Health, the City 
Council, local farming communities and the Toronto Youth Food Policy Council, advocates 
for innovative community food security programmes and works on various city initiatives 
concerned with food security. Such participatory models of food system management 
deserve support from the provincial, territorial and federal levels, in order to integrate them 
into a national level framework.

</p>
<p>15. In the course of the visit, it became clear to the Special Rapporteur that Canada 
would benefit from a national right to food strategy, as recommended both by the 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights15 and under the <i>Voluntary Guidelines 
to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food in the Context of 
</i></p>
<p><i>National Food Security,</i> adopted unanimously by the members of the Council of the Food 
and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), including Canada, in 2004. 
This is important for two reasons. First, in order to effectively combat hunger, food 
insecurity and malnutrition, it is necessary to have a comprehensive understanding of who 
is hungry, food insecure and malnourished. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that 
changes in the current budget will make the collection and analysis of data more 
complicated, particularly by changes to data collection through the elimination of the 
requirement for individuals to complete the long-form census. Concerns were also raised 
regarding the dismantling of the National Council of Welfare, which provided a forum for 
data collection and comparison of, inter alia, social assistance rates across the country. By 
moving towards a national strategy for the realization of the right to food, Canada could 
decide which data are required to support evidence-based policies that move towards the 
eradication of hunger and malnutrition, including obesity, and to monitor progress. 
</p>
<p>16. Second, an integrated national strategy for the realization of the right to food should 
allow a clear allocation of responsibilities across different levels of government. Canada 
has a complex system of power-sharing between three levels of government &#8211; federal 
(national), provincial/territorial, and municipal or local &#8211; with varying degrees of 
responsibility for policy areas that affect the food system and the enjoyment of the right to 
adequate food.  Improved coordination across these levels will allow the country to more 
effectively meet the challenges it is facing, creating synergies and ensuring that efforts 
made at each level are supported by other levels. 
</p>
<p>17. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to see that in the 2011 federal election all 
major parties included a national food security strategy as a part of their platform. A 
number of initiatives by various stakeholders, including the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, the Canadian-Agri Food Policy Institute, the Conference Board of Canada, and 
the Peoples Food Policy Project, aim to develop a national food strategy. The initiatives of 
stakeholders point to the desire of farmers, industry and people all across Canada for a 
national food strategy.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Food availability: agricultural policies 
</b></p>
<p>18. Agriculture and the agrifood sector (including foodservice; food retail/wholesale; 
food, beverage and tobacco processing; primary agriculture; and input and service 
suppliers) account for 8.1 per cent of national GDP and employ 2.1 million Canadians, 
roughly 13 per cent of all employment in the country.16  Canada is home to 229,377 farms. 
The food and beverage processing industry is the largest manufacturing industry and an 
important employer in many rural areas.  
</p>
<p>19. Yet, the Special Rapporteur heard many concerns about the general direction of 
agricultural policies. Since the 1950s, Canada has been moving to large-scale, input-
intensive modes of production, leading to increasingly unsustainable farming practices and 
higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions, soil contamination, and erosion of biodiversity. 
Trade liberalization in agriculture was encouraged following the free-trade agreement with

</p>
<p>the United States in 1989 and the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. Export-
led policies in agriculture have resulted in increased concentration, vertical integration and 
buyer consolidation in the agrifood sector. Between 1988 and 2007, the number of farms 
decreased by 25 per cent.  
</p>
<p>20. Trade liberalization has been detrimental to many of Canada&#8217;s agricultural 
producers, whose net incomes have decreased and whose debt has increased dramatically 
over the past decades. While Canada&#8217;s exports tripled in value between 1988 and 2010 and 
while the total value of agriculture and agrifood exports increased 420 per cent during that 
period, realized net farm income remained stable until the recent surge in farm prices (from 
Can$3.8 billion in 1988 to Can$3.7 billion in 2010, to Can$5.7 billion in 2011), although 
taxpayer-funded farm support payments may mask a net income loss: in 2007 for instance, 
farm support payments totalled Can$3.7 billion, concealing a net income loss from the 
markets of Can$2.2 billion. Canada&#8217;s biggest farms capture a disproportionate amount of 
farm support payments due to the design of support programmes and to the high cap 
(Can$3 million per farm) on maximum payments. Since the implementation of the Canada-
US free trade agreement, total farm debt has tripled from Can$22.5 billion to over Can$65 
billion in 2007.17  
</p>
<p>21. The long-term depression of farm-gate prices in relation to input prices and the cost 
of living means that margins are constantly tightening, forcing farmers to raise production 
levels simply to maintain income levels. To produce more, farmers have to purchase more 
land and chemicals, buy bigger equipment, increase herd size, and take on more debt. 
Family farmers are also facing increasing levels of input financing by agribusiness, and are 
confronted with growing commercial pressures on farmland as competition for land 
increases.18  In this context, the obstacles to farmer renewal are considerable: the number of 
farmers under the age of 35 has decreased by over 60 per cent from 77,910 in 1991 to just 
under 30,000 in 2006.  
</p>
<p>22. As concentration increased in the farming sector, it has become heavily reliant on 
temporary foreign farm workers: approximately 30,000 migrant farm workers come to 
Canada annually under the federal Temporary Foreign Worker Programs.19  These workers 
are in an extremely precarious position as the restrictions attached to their employer-
specific permit and the permanent fear of being removed from Canada following a contract 
breach makes it impossible in practice for them to contest working conditions. Unlike other 
classes of temporary foreign workers, migrant farm workers, though they may have been 
working in Canada annually for years or even decades, are denied pathways to permanent 
residency or immigration. Services targeted to other newcomers, such as new immigrants 
and refugees, are generally not available to migrant farm workers, and despite migrant 
workers&#8217; contribution to the Canadian economy, they face a number of obstacles to access 
</p>
<p>health care and social protection schemes. While they are eligible for health care in Canada, 
this coverage does not extend to their countries of origin once they are repatriated: in 
practice therefore, workers with serious illnesses or injuries are often left without any 
income, care or support, even after working and contributing to taxes in Canada for years. 
Although in principle they have access to employment insurance, the requirement under the 
Employment Insurance Act that claimants must be available for work in Canada in order to

<p>be eligible for benefits makes it virtually impossible for Mexican or Caribbean workers 
under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Program (SAWP) to receive regular 
unemployment benefits. In short, a marginalized category has been created essentially in 
order to compensate for the increased concentration in the farming sector and for the failure 
to ensure that farming remains attractive to Canadians. 
</p>
<p>23. A thriving small-scale farming sector is essential to local food systems, which food 
policy councils and localities throughout Canada now seek to strengthen. Local food 
systems can deliver considerable health and ecological benefits by increasing access to 
fresh and nutritious foods to children in schools, underserved urban and Northern remote 
communities, and older persons living in long-term care homes, among others. Local food 
systems benefit local farmers,20 with strong multiplier effects on the local economy.

<p>24. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur witnessed a number of initiatives that seek 
to improve food and nutrition security and foster local markets at the municipal and 
provincial levels, in particular through local procurement schemes and &#8220;buy local&#8221; labelling 
</p>
<p>(such as Local Food Plus, Foodland Ontario, Buy Manitoba). However, the ability of all 
levels of government to use institutional sourcing as a way to encourage the transition 
towards a more sustainable food system may be restricted by legal requirements of non-
discrimination imposed on public procurement.21 They may also be undermined by the 
Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with the European Union, currently in 
draft form, which would prohibit municipal governments from using procurement of goods 
and services valued over Can$340,000 in a way that favours local or Canadian goods, 
services or labour. Numerous municipalities across the country have opposed this 
restriction on the ability of local authorities to promote urban-rural linkages and local 
economic development through institutional purchasing, and have requested exemptions.22  
</p>
<p>25. Canada faces other significant obstacles in transitioning to more sustainable and 
decentralized food systems. In the meat-packing industry, highly capital-intensive measures 
have been adopted in compliance with food safety requirements, making it uneconomic for 
smaller abattoirs to operate due to the high overhead and debt-servicing costs these 
investments entail.23  
</p>
<p>26. In addition, the Government has moved to gradually dismantle existing orderly 
marketing systems. In 2011, the federal Government passed Bill C-18, putting an end to 
monopoly of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB), and making it permissible for any party, 
as of August 1, 2012, to market western wheat and barley for export and domestic human 
consumption.24 The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, as a result, the CWB will lose its

</p>
<p>marketing through farmers&#8217; markets (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Sectoral Policy Directorate, 
<i>Local and Regional Food Economies in Canada: Status Report</i>, March 2007, p. 30).

<p> 22 On 6 March 2012, the Toronto City Council voted for a permanent exemption from the Canada-
European Union Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA),  and requested the 
Province of Ontario to issue a permanent exemption for the City from CETA and that it otherwise 
protect the powers of municipalities, hospitals, school boards, utilities, universities and other sub-
federal agencies to use public procurement, services and investment as tools to create local jobs and 
otherwise support local economic development. An additional 50 municipalities have requested 
similar exemptions.

<p>stabilizing function and no longer meet the specific requirements of small producers, 
leading to further concentration in the grains sector.  
</p>
<p>27. In contrast, the various supply management schemes in dairy, poultry and eggs, 
present advantages both for food producers and taxpayers. These legislated marketing tools 
have been designed to impose disciplines on sellers at a commodity-specific level and to 
replace a farmer-against-farmer competitiveness with a united and concerted effort by 
farmers to sell collectively for mutual advantage. Orderly marketing has helped ensure that 
a fair amount of market power remains in the hands of farmers, ensuring the viability of a 
number of food sectors. It has also enabled remote areas to keep farm production and 
processing facilities, mitigating the distribution costs to consumers living in those areas. At 
the same time, supply management schemes allow quotas to be traded without controls 
along the lines of highest bidders among licensed producers. Values may therefore go up 
dramatically and capitalization costs for farmers rise accordingly, limiting new entry in the 
sector. The system should be strengthened for its advantages, but reformed with a view to a 
greater equity and to facilitate entry of new farmers. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur believes that far greater attention should be paid to the need 
to allow local food systems to develop. The 2007 Status Report by Agriculture and Agri-
Food Canada noted that &#8220;the increasing consumer interest in local food around the globe 
</p>
<p>could shut Canadian producers out of the export markets we have come to rely upon,&#8221; 
</p>
<p>making it imperative for Canada to create its own markets for locally-grown food. It further 
noted that &#8220;Canada&#8217;s historical focus on an export food system has impeded efforts to build 
a healthy domestic food system;&#8221; and that the policy framework &#8220;is a significant barrier to 
</p>
<p>local food systems.&#8221;25  
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur concurs. He expresses the hope that these concerns will be 
considered in the elaboration of Canada&#8217;s next five-year agricultural policy agreement, 
Growing Forward 2 (2013-2018). This initiative presents an opportunity for the 
Government to meet the country&#8217;s considerable environmental, public health and food 
</p>
<p>insecurity challenges, and to respond to the expectations expressed by the food movement 
by ensuring active and meaningful participation in the process of shaping the new policy. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Food accessibility: protecting access to food for the poorest 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Social protection 
</b></p>
<p>30. Poverty affects some 3 million Canadians. In 2010, 550,000 children lived in food-
insecure households. In First Nations families, one in four children lives in poverty. Poverty 
is one of the leading factors that impede access to adequate food, as acknowledged by the 
Government in its Fifth Progress Report on Food Security: In Response to the World Food 
Summit Plan of Action (2008). Social protection plays an important role in improving food 
security. As such, establishing a comprehensive social protection system is one policy 
measure to enable the poorest and most disadvantaged to realize their right to adequate 
food, among other rights. In the absence of a national poverty reduction strategy, the 
Special Rapporteur is encouraged to learn that out of the 13 provinces and territories, 11 
have adopted or are committed to adopting poverty reduction strategies.  
</p>
<p>  
Act in force at the time. 
</p>
<p> 25 Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Sectoral Policy Directorate, <i>Local and Regional Food Economies 
in Canada: Status Report,</i> March 31, 2007. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/22/50/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>31. While the great majority of the Canadian population enjoys the right to adequate 
food and is afforded the right to social security, a significant segment of society does not. 
Recognizing that the right to food is indivisible with other human rights, the provincial, 
territorial, and municipal governments developed a solid social protection system to protect 
people living in poverty, comprised of measures such as income security, education 
benefits, employment support, and affordable housing. Yet the evidence of those suffering 
from hunger and poverty has been growing in recent years.  
</p>
<p>32. While the provinces and territories have jurisdiction over social policy, including 
social assistance, they have in the past agreed to the establishment by the federal 
government of national programs for employment insurance (1940), old age pensions 
(1951) and supplemental pension benefits (1964). 
</p>
<p>33. The social protection system in Canada was strengthened with the 1966 Canada 
Assistance Plan (CAP), which provided a cost-sharing arrangement between the federal and 
provincial and territorial governments. CAP recognized food, shelter and clothing as basic 
human needs and sought to ensure that the provinces and territories provided sufficient 
benefits to enable people to meet these needs. It was repealed in 1996 and replaced by the 
Canada Health Transfer and Canada Social Transfer, which provide block-funding 
arrangements that permit provinces and territories to allocate health, education and social 
programme funding according to their own priorities. While the intent of the Canada Health 
Transfer and Canada Social Transfer are similar to the Canada Assistance Plan, they reduce 
federal conditions on how provinces and territories spend federal funds, allowing them to 
make significant cuts to social assistance rates at their own discretion.26 
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur regrets the absence of accountability provisions in the 
Canada Social Transfer to ensure the protection of the right to food and other human rights. 
Indeed, despite the existence of social assistance schemes throughout the provinces and 
territories, many people living in poverty are still unable to enjoy an adequate standard of 
living. Fifty-nine per cent of those living on social assistance are food insecure, 
demonstrating that social assistance benefits are insufficient.27 In Nova Scotia, the monthly 
deficit faced by households on social assistance in 2010 was Can$523 for a single man and 
Can$473 for a family of five (with three children under the age of 15).28 In Ontario, Ontario 
Works rates for a single person are $599 per month for basic needs and shelter, yet the 
average rent for a single apartment is $715, leaving a deficit and no money for food, let 
alone a nutritious diet.29   
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that social assistance levels are insufficient to 
access the basic goods and services required for an adequate standard of living, including 
the right to food. The cost of housing is a key reason people suffer from hunger and are 
compelled to food bank use. Unlike expenses for food, paying the rent or mortgage is non-
negotiable. Even people in subsidized housing regularly go hungry due to lack of money for 
food.30  For example, within the Greater Toronto Area, among those in subsidized housing,

</p>
<p>the average amount remaining per person per day after rent and utilities are paid is $5.67, 
and 46 per cent of people living in subsidized housing have reported not eating for an entire 
day because of lack of money for food.31  
</p>
<p>36. The direct and indirect costs of securing adequate housing must not compromise the 
ability of people to pay for food and other essential needs guaranteed by human rights law. 
In the case of housing, a threshold of 30 per cent of income has been widely adopted as a 
measure for assessing affordability. Spending more than 30 per cent of household income 
on shelter can jeopardize the amount of money available for food, health care, education, 
transportation and other basic necessities, particularly for people living in poverty. Though 
the Government of Canada invests about CAN$1.7 billion annually to provide low income 
households with affordable and suitable housing, benefiting some 605,000 low income 
households across Canada, the issue of housing affordability remains a source of concern 
for many families. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the 
recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of 
the right to an adequate standard of living in his 2009 report, including the need for a 
comprehensive and coordinated national housing policy.32  
</p>
<p>37. Despite the best efforts of provinces and territories, social protection schemes and 
minimum wages fail to meet peoples&#8217; basic daily needs. An increasing number are turning 
to food banks in Canada. The reliance on food banks serves as a moral release valve for the 
State. But it is symptomatic of the need to step up social protection systems to align them 
with the increased costs of living.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Minimum wage legislation 
</b></p>
<p>38. Canada seeks to promote labour market participation as a long-term strategy to 
overcome poverty. The Special Rapporteur commends this approach, however he would 
recall that the minimum wage set in legislation should be, at least, a &#8220;living wage,&#8221; that 
&#8220;provides an income allowing workers to support themselves and their families,&#8221; as 
</p>
<p>required under articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights.33  
</p>
<p><b> C. Maximum available resources 
</b></p>
<p>39. Under the Covenant (art. 2, para. 1), Canada has a duty to dedicate the maximum 
amount of available resources to progressively achieve the full realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights, including the right to food, and to prioritize the needs of the most 
marginalized. The concept of progressive realization recognizes the obstacles faced by 
countries, even developed countries like Canada. Like others, Canada has experienced an 
increase in its public debt in recent years. Nevertheless, the current situation does not 
justify refraining from taking action that could guarantee the right to food.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that the 2012 federal budget reportedly 
envisages a reduction of public spending of CAN$5 billion annually, with total reduction in 
spending of CAN$37 billion over five years, without the implications for the realization of

</p>
<p>the right to food having been given explicit consideration.34 Canada has one of the lowest 
deficit-to-GDP ratios and debt-to-GDP ratios among industrialized countries, and it is 
precisely in times of economic and financial crisis that guaranteeing robust social 
protection measures is most required. Furthermore, the &#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; 
</p>
<p>include resources that could be mobilized by the Government, including through fiscal 
reform. According to the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, since 2000, cuts to 
personal, sales and corporate taxes have been such that the 2011-2012 tax revenues would 
have been CAN$48 billion higher than the actual revenues collected if the tax regime of a 
decade ago was still in place. The tax-to-GDP ratio of Canada has fallen to 31 per cent of 
GDP and it is now in the lowest third of OECD countries. Consequently, Canada has the 
fiscal space to address the basic human needs of its most marginalized and disempowered.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Food adequacy 
</b></p>
<p>41. Over 25 per cent of Canadian adults are obese as are 8.6 per cent of children 
between the ages of 6-17, according to a joint report by the Public Health Agency of 
Canada and the Canadian Institute for Health Information based on 2007-2009 data.35  
Overweight and obesity combined affect 62.1 per cent of the population. Obesity rates have 
increased significantly since the early 1980s,36  and it is becoming more severe. On-reserve 
First Nations have particularly high obesity rates (36 per cent in 2002-2003). The risk of 
dying from diabetes and its complications is five times higher among First Nations women 
than among women in the general population.37 This has led to the adoption of the 
Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative which supports a variety of activities to help improve healthy 
food access and availability in First Nations and Inuit communities.  
</p>
<p>42. The health impacts are considerable. In 2008, obesity alone cost the Canadian 
economy at least Can$4.6 billion in direct (health care) and indirect (lost productivity) 
costs, when factoring in the eight non-communicable diseases most frequently associated 
with obesity; the costs for 2008 amount to $7.1 billion taking into account a larger range of 
diseases associated with obesity.38 Within remote Aboriginal communities, the 
consequences of high diabetes rates are particularly disturbing since specialized services 
may be inaccessible.39  
</p>
<p>43. Initiatives have been taken to address this public health and economic challenge. 
They include nutrition labeling on prepackaged foods, as well as nutrition guidelines and 
policies such as Eating Well with Canada&#8217;s Food Guide, infant feeding guidelines and 
</p>
<p>prenatal nutrition guidelines. Some of the most interesting initiatives are adopted at the 
municipal level. For example, Toronto has adopted a food strategy that focuses on health

</p>
<p>using a food systems approach, which seeks to integrate considerations linked to economic 
accessibility, disease prevention, food literacy, environmental sustainability and economic 
development.  
</p>
<p>44. Provinces have also been adopting initiatives in this area. Ontario&#8217;s Action Plan for 
Health Care includes a Child Obesity Strategy and is supported by outside partners such as 
the Nutrition Resource Centre and the Healthy Communities Fund. Since 2006, Ontario has 
benefited from the Northern Fruit and Vegetable Program that provides fruit and vegetable 
snacks twice a week to 18,000 northern children in 106 schools. In Manitoba, the Healthy 
Together Now programme supports 83 community projects that promote healthy eating, 
and the Healthy Schools initiatives improves the quality of food served in schools (School 
Nutrition Policy), supports breakfast and snack programmes (School Nourishment 
Programs), and links local farmers to schools to ensure adequate provision of fruits and 
vegetables to school children (Vegetable and Fruit Pilot Program).  
</p>
<p>45. At the national level,40 the 2010 Pan-Canadian Healthy Living Strategy includes a 
Declaration on Prevention and Promotion and a Framework for Action to Promote Healthy 
Weights (Curbing Childhood Obesity). The objective of the framework is to coordinate 
across the federal, provincial and territorial governments to ensure that combating 
childhood obesity is a priority for the respective ministers of health; to create environments 
that support physical activity and healthy eating by children; to identify, at an early stage. 
the risk of overweight and obesity in children; and to increase the availability and 
accessibility of nutritious foods, among others.  
</p>
<p>46. The Special Rapporteur commends the initiatives that have been adopted to date. 
They fall short, however, from what the urgency of the situation requires. Health 
professionals in Canada lament that no action is being taken to ban trans-fatty acids from 
diets, and that too little is done to discourage the consumption of foods high in saturated 
fats, sugar and/or sodium.41 Qu&#233;bec is the only province to have banned advertising 
directed towards children under 13 years of age,42 an initiative that may be largely symbolic 
until all provinces follow suit. This is not a minor issue in a broader right to food strategy: 
young children are particularly susceptible to advertising, and advertisers spend Can$2.9 
billion annually to influence Can$20 billion worth of household purchases. The industry 
has taken some initiatives to pre-empt regulation (e.g., Advertising Standards Canada). But 
experts note that self-regulation attempts are &#8220;founded upon a fundamental conflict of 
interest,&#8221; as they seek to &#8220;advance the profitability of advertisers, while also protecting 
children&#8217;s health and well-being,&#8221; making it &#8220;unlikely that significant improvements could 
be implemented by industry itself or that they would be effective over the long term.&#8221;43 
They conclude that a ban on advertising directed towards children is the most effective way 
of addressing the challenge.  
</p>
<p>47. There also appears to be a misalignment between the policies adopted in the health 
sector and other sectoral policies that could help curb obesity, particularly child obesity. 
This could include land zoning: people living in low-income communities often depend on 
grocery stores that provide a limited range of fresh foods or only sell such foods at high 
prices, squeezing the poorest households to purchase processed foods high in saturated fats,

implement the Federal, Provincial and Territorial Curbing Childhood Obesity Strategy, as 
recommended by public health specialists.45 The Weight Coalition of Qu&#233;bec estimates that 
a Can$0.01 tax per litre on sugary drinks could raise Can$8 million annually in Qu&#233;bec and 
Can$35 million nationwide. These sums could be reinvested in preventive health care and 
in supporting access to fresh and nutritious foods in underserved, low-income 
communities.46  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Food aid and development cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur applauds the contribution of Canada to global food security. 
Canada has substantially exceeded its minimum food aid commitments under the Food Aid 
Convention in the past few years. It has led by example by ruling out monetization and 
untying its food aid. Canada also played a major role in the negotiation of the Food 
Assistance Convention in 2010-2012. 
</p>
<p>49. In October 2009, the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) launched 
its Food Security Strategy, focusing on food aid and nutrition, sustainable agricultural 
development (including agroecological approaches) and research and development. The 
strategy focuses on small-scale farmers living in rural areas, in particular the role that 
women farmers play in agricultural production. In Canada&#8217;s development cooperation 
</p>
<p>programmes, contributions towards agriculture have grown. As of April 2011, Canada had 
fully disbursed its Can$1.18 billion commitment to sustainable agricultural development 
under the L&#8217;Aquila Food Security Initiative, the first G8 country to do so; this includes 
</p>
<p>Can$600 million in additional resources. 
</p>
<p>50. However, the Special Rapporteur has concerns about recent developments in this 
area. Canada made substantial cuts in its 2012 budget to official development assistance 
(ODA). The funding envelope will reportedly decrease by 7.6 per cent by the 2014-15 
financial year. It appears that the cuts will disproportionately affect CIDA and the 
International Development Research Centre, as well as negatively impact several country 
programmes. It is troubling that 10 of the 13 countries to be affected lie in the bottom 
quartile of the Human Development Index. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned that 
the criteria for selecting recipient countries might not comply with the ODA Accountability 
Act.47  
</p>
<p>51. In accordance with Canada's international obligations, the 2008 ODA Accountability 
Act specifies that ODA should be consistent with international human rights, consider the 
perspectives of the poor and contribute to poverty reduction, among others. Government 
ministers responsible for administering ODA are required to report annually on compliance 
with the Act. Nevertheless, the Government reportedly has failed to apply human rights 
criteria in its reports as required by the Act.48

<p>52. While CIDA seeks to ensure that its projects will not result in human rights 
violations, it does not apply human rights norms and standards in determining aid priorities 
and implementing programmes. The contribution of Canadian development cooperation to 
the realization of the right to food could be improved by grounding its duties under the 
ODA Accountability Act on well-established international human rights norms and 
standards. In this context, the Special Rapporteur recalls the Maastricht Principles on the 
extraterritorial obligations of States in the area of economic, social and cultural rights, 
which clearly describe the duties international human rights law imposes on States, to 
ensure not only that they respect human rights outside their national territory, but also that 
they protect human rights and contribute to fulfilling human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> VIII. Indigenous peoples 
</b></p>
<p>53. In Canada, indigenous peoples (the term used in international law) are referred to as 
Aboriginal peoples, and include all original inhabitants of Canada as recognized by section 
35 of the Constitution Act (1982) and comprise First Nations,49 Inuit and M&#233;tis. The 2006 
Census numbers indicate that there are about 1.1 million Aboriginal people in Canada:  
750,000 First Nations, of which over 600,000 are Registered Indians, about 50,000 Inuit 
across 53 communities, and over 350,000 M&#233;tis. In this context, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls that in human rights terms, indigenous existence and identity do not depend on State 
recognition or acknowledgment.  
</p>
<p>54. Like others, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the decision by Canada in November 
201050 to support the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The 
Declaration affirms fundamental human rights in relation to the particular historical and 
contemporary circumstances of indigenous peoples.  
</p>
<p>55. A long history of political and economic marginalization has left many indigenous 
peoples living in poverty with considerably lower levels of access to adequate food relative 
to the general population. Though the percentage of low income among Aboriginals living 
off-reserve declined in recent years, 21.7 per cent of Aboriginals fall below the low income 
cut-off after tax as defined by Statistics Canada, compared to 11.1 per cent for the non-
Aboriginal population.51 Despite programmes such as the Canada Prenatal Nutrition 
Program (including a First Nations and Inuit component); Aboriginal Head Start (includes 
on-reserve and urban and northern component); the Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative; and 
Nutrition North Canada, discussed in greater detail below, research conducted by the 
University of Manitoba noted that in 2008-2009, nearly 60 per cent of First Nations 
children in northern Manitoba households were food insecure.52 The Inuit Health Survey 
reported that 70 per cent of adults living in Nunavut were food insecure. This is six times 
higher than the national average and represents the highest documented food insecurity rate 
for any aboriginal population in a developed country.53 Among off-reserve aboriginal

<p>households, approximately one in five households was food insecure, including 8.4 per cent 
severely food insecure.54 These rates are three times higher than among non-aboriginal 
households, where 7.7 per cent were food insecure, including 2.5 per cent with severe food 
insecurity.55 In March 2011, one in ten of the 851,014 who relied on food banks across 
Canada self-identified as an aboriginal person.56 
</p>
<p><b> A. Nutrition North Canada 
</b></p>
<p>56. Families in remote and isolated indigenous communities frequently lack access to 
affordable nutritious foods, particularly perishables such as fruits, vegetables and meats, 
due to limited food selections, high food prices and poor quality of fresh produce. 
Expensive transport costs and difficult logistics (e.g. airfreight charges, and uncertainty of 
travel on winter roads, where they exist, or air travel subject to weather conditions), high 
poverty rates and a continuing decline in the use of traditional foods result in few healthy 
food choices.  
</p>
<p>57. Recognizing the importance of access to nutritious food in isolated communities in 
the North, the Government launched the Food Mail Program in the 1960s, providing federal 
subsidies to Canada Post for its direct costs of supplying food and other necessities through 
the mail service to Northern communities without year-round surface transportation. 
Concerns regarding the escalating costs of the Food Mail Program, as well as the 
programme&#8217;s lack of transparency and the absence of any incentive for efficiency and 
innovation along the supply chain in the North, led to a series of reviews that resulted in its 
replacement with a programme called Nutrition North Canada in April 2011. 
</p>
<p>58. The objective of Nutrition North Canada is to improve access to perishable healthy 
foods in isolated Northern communities, which the Special Rapporteur welcomes. Yet, 
based on his observation of and information received about the programme, the Special 
Rapporteur also has concerns about its design and implementation. The Special Rapporteur 
visited God&#8217;s River, Manto Sipi Cree and Wasagamack First Nations in Manitoba. He had 
</p>
<p>the opportunity to visit a Northern Store (operated by the North West Company) to see 
first-hand the Nutrition North Canada programme in action. 
</p>
<p>59. Nutrition North Canada provides subsidies to retailers operating in NNC-eligible 
communities and to food suppliers operating in southern Canada. The subsidies are 
intended to be passed on to consumers through lower retail prices for eligible items. 
However, in the absence of adequate monitoring by those it is intended to benefit, it is 
unclear whether the programme is achieving its desired outcome.57 The Government of 
Nunavut is currently taking measures to address this deficiency by designing a monitoring 
programme that should be operational in 2013, and involving Nunavummiut. The Special 
Rapporteur welcomes this development, as he considers the current arrangements 
inadequate. Nutrition North Canada currently publishes the subsidy per kilogram for each 
eligible community, but it does not require retailers to inform Aboriginal Affairs and

<p>Northern Development Canada or the public of their airfreight costs. As such, the federal 
Government has no way of verifying if the subsidy is being passed on, despite the 
obligation imposed on subsidy recipients to attest that they have complied with this 
requirement every time that they submit a subsidy claim, and the compliance reviews 
performed by independent auditors.  
</p>
<p>60. Questions were also raised regarding the eligibility criteria on which communities 
fall within the scope of the programme and which items are subsidized. Under Nutrition 
North Canada, 31 isolated northern communities that had been eligible under the Food Mail 
Program, allegedly became ineligible though they had not been relying on the programme 
in recent years. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that Nutrition North Canada was 
designed and is being implemented without an inclusive and transparent process that 
provides Northern communities with an opportunity to exercise their right to active and 
meaningful participation. 
</p>
<p>61. The Special Rapporteur recognizes that neither Nutrition North Canada nor the Food 
Mail Program could address other factors responsible for the high food costs in northern 
communities, such as the high cost of energy for heating and refrigeration, electricity 
generation, building construction, equipment maintenance, etc. Food costs remain higher in 
the North than elsewhere in Canada for legitimate reasons, but more needs to be done to 
improve the effectiveness of Nutrition North Canada. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
progress made in this direction. Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada 
recently released information showing that, on average, in communities eligible for a full 
subsidy, the cost of a healthy diet for a family of four was 8 percent lower in March 2012 
under NNC than one year prior to the launch of the programme; on average, in 
communities eligible for the partial subsidy, the cost decreased by 2 per cent (in 
comparison, food prices elsewhere in Canada increased 2.2 per cent between March 2011 
and March 2012).  
</p>
<p><b> B. Access to traditional/country foods 
</b></p>
<p>62. Indigenous peoples are also uniquely positioned with respect to food by virtue of 
their relationship with traditional lands and the natural resources therein, which is a central 
component of their identity. Accordingly, indigenous peoples are generally recognized as 
having broader rights to natural resources under international human rights law. They have 
the right to use natural resources as a means of supporting their cultural integrity through 
traditional economic activities, such as subsistence agriculture, hunting and fishing, as well 
as religious or spiritual activities.58 
</p>
<p>63. Historically, indigenous peoples have had their own food systems, relying on 
traditional knowledge of hunting, fishing, trapping and gathering. According to the 
Manitoba First Nations Regional Health Survey (2008), approximately 85 per cent of First 
Nations adults sometimes or often had someone who shared traditional food (also known as 
&#8220;country&#8221; food) with their household. In 2006, 65 per cent of Inuit residing in Northern 
Canada were reported to live in households where at least half of the meat and fish 
consumed was country foods. A study involving Inuit adults found that diets contained 
significantly more vitamins A, D, E and B6, riboflavin, iron zinc, potassium and selenium,

</b></p>
<p><b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>among others, on days when country food was consumed. These findings highlight the 
important relationship between access to country foods and health.  
</p>
<p>64. Although communities can, and often do, pursue a diet based on traditional/country 
foods, obtaining this is not without cost. Issues with accessing traditional foods include the 
impacts of climate change on migratory patterns of animals and on the mobility of those 
hunting them; limited availability of food flora and fauna; environmental contamination of 
species; flooding and development of traditional hunting and trapping territories; lack of 
equipment and resourcing to purchase equipment or inputs necessary for hunting, fishing  
and harvesting; and lack of requisite skills and time.  
</p>
<p>65. Many Aboriginal communities expressed concerns regarding federal government 
policies that have disrupted and, in some cases, devastated the traditional practices of 
indigenous people, including through removing control over land and natural resources. 
Access to country foods represents more than increased nutrition and physical accessibility; 
it also has significant cultural importance.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Access to land 
</b></p>
<p>66. Aboriginal and treaty rights are protected by section 35 of the Constitution Act 
(1982). The expression of those rights is outlined in various treaties and other agreements 
so as to clarify rights and responsibilities. But concerns have been expressed that the 
Government has sought to extinguish existing titles through negotiations and terms of 
modern land claims and self-government agreements, as well as through a narrow and 
reductionist reading of historical treaties, agreements and other constructive arrangements. 
Ongoing land claims across the country have implications for the right to food and access to 
country foods among aboriginal Canadians. Yet, under international law, indigenous 
peoples have the right to possess and control their traditional lands and resources. The 
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples affirms that indigenous peoples have the 
right to the lands, territories and resources that they have traditionally owned, occupied or 
otherwise used or acquired (art. 26, para. 1); the right to develop priorities and strategies for 
the development or use of their lands or territories and other resources (art. 31, para. 1); the 
right to maintain and strengthen their distinctive spiritual relationship with their 
traditionally owned lands, territories, water and coastal seas (art. 25).59 It also provides for 
States to provide effective mechanisms &#8220;for prevention of, and redress for&#8230;[a]ny action 
which has the aim or effect of dispossessing them of their lands, territories or resources&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(art.8, para. 2 (b)).  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur notes the existence of the Aboriginal Consultation and 
Accommodation: Updated Guidelines for Federal Officials to Fulfill the Duty to Consult, a 
Government policy document on aboriginal consultation and accommodation. In this 
context, he recalls that the Declaration establishes that, in general, consultations with 
indigenous peoples are to be carried out in &#8220;good faith &#8230; in order to obtain their free, prior 
</p>
<p>and informed consent&#8221; (art. 19). He believes that continued and concerted measures are 
needed to develop new initiatives and reform existing ones, in consultation and in real 
partnership with indigenous peoples with the goal towards strengthening indigenous 
peoples&#8217; own self-determination and decision-making over their affairs at all levels. 
</p>
<p>68. The broad range of indigenous rights to possess and use natural resources as stated 
in the Declaration, extend beyond the scope of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
Nevertheless, these rights do provide a point of reference for evaluating questions related to

</p>
<p>the availability, accessibility and adequacy (including cultural appropriateness) of food as 
well as non-discrimination.60 
</p>
<p><b> IX. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>69.<b> By recognizing access to sufficient and adequate food as a legal entitlement, the 
right to food provides an important tool for combating hunger and malnutrition. It 
</b></p>
<p><b>protects the rights of people to live with dignity and ensures that all have either the 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources required to produce enough food for themselves or a purchasing power 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient to procure food from the market. It imposes obligations on the State, 
</b></p>
<p><b>requiring that individuals and communities have access to recourse mechanisms when 
</b></p>
<p><b>these obligations are not met. The right to food also requires that States identify the 
</b></p>
<p><b>hungry and malnourished by adequate food insecurity and vulnerability mapping, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and that they adopt policies that remove the obstacles to its enjoyment by each 
</b></p>
<p><b>individual. Consistent with this understanding of the right to food as a human right, 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Special Rapporteur offers the following recommendations: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Formulate a comprehensive rights-based national food strategy clearly 
</b></p>
<p><b>delineating the responsibilities of public officials at the federal, provincial/territorial, 
</b></p>
<p><b>and municipal/local levels, identifying the measures to be adopted and the associated 
</b></p>
<p><b>time frames, and ensuring that initiatives adopted at municipal and provincial levels, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly for the rebuilding of local food systems, are adequately supported; as 
</b></p>
<p><b>part of this strategy, create a nationally funded children and food strategy (including 
</b></p>
<p><b>school-feeding food literacy and school garden programmes) to ensure that all 
</b></p>
<p><b>children, at all times, have access to healthy and nutritious food; launch the process of 
</b></p>
<p><b>adoption of a framework law on the right to food, for the regular updating of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Canadian food strategy;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Revise social assistance levels to correspond to the costs of basic 
</b></p>
<p><b>necessities required to enjoy the human right to an adequate standard of living, 
</b></p>
<p><b>establishing the market basket measure (MBM) as a federal guideline for provincial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and territorial social assistance schemes; revise the system of housing benefits to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that the poorest families are not obliged to sacrifice food in order to pay for the 
</b></p>
<p><b>non-compressible and non-divisible costs of housing; re-establish a national 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme with specific cash transfers for social assistance and social services that 
</b></p>
<p><b>includes universal entitlements and national standards and lays down a legally 
</b></p>
<p><b>enforceable right to adequate assistance for all persons in need,
</b>61
</p>
<p><b> seeking inspiration 
</b></p>
<p><b>from the success of the Old Age Security programme;   
</b></p>
<p><b> (c) Set the minimum wage as a living wage, as required under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and consistent with 
</b></p>
<p><b>ILO Conventions No. 99 (1951) and No. 131 (1970), particularly as regards the
