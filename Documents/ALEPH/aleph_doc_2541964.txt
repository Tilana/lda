NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1. GENERAL
Key Energy Services, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Key,” the “Company,”
“we,” “us,” “its,” and “our”) provide a full range of well services to major oil companies, foreign
national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. Our services
include rig-based and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well
completion and recompletion services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services,
and other ancillary oilfield services. Additionally, certain rigs are capable of specialty drilling
applications. We operate in most major oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental
United States and have operations in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, the Middle East and Russia. In
addition, we have a technology development and control systems business based in Canada.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared using
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) for interim
financial information and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The condensed December 31, 2013 balance sheet was
prepared from audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2013 (the “2013 Form 10-K”). Certain information relating to our
organization and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2013 Form 10-K.
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this report include all
normal and recurring material adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a
fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods presented herein. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2014 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year or any other interim
period, due to fluctuations in demand for our services, timing of maintenance and other
expenditures, and other factors.
We have evaluated events occurring after the balance sheet date included in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q and through the date on which the unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements were issued, for possible disclosure of a subsequent event.
NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to
develop estimates and to make assumptions that affect our financial position, results of operations
and cash flows. These estimates may also impact the nature and extent of our disclosure, if any,
of our contingent liabilities. Among other things, we use estimates to (i) analyze assets for
possible impairment, (ii) determine depreciable lives for our assets, (iii) assess future tax
exposure and realization of deferred tax assets, (iv) determine amounts to accrue for
contingencies, (v) value tangible and intangible assets, (vi) assess workers’ compensation,
vehicular liability, self-insured risk accruals and other insurance reserves, (vii) provide allowances
for our uncollectible accounts receivable, (viii) value our asset retirement obligations, and
(ix) value our equity-based compensation. We review all significant estimates on a recurring basis
and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to publication of our financial statements.
Adjustments made with respect to the use of estimates relate to improved information not
previously available. Because of the limitations inherent in this process, our actual results may
differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the estimates used in the preparation of
these interim financial statements are reasonable.
There have been no material changes or developments in our evaluation of accounting estimates
and underlying assumptions or methodologies that we believe to be a “Critical Accounting Policy
or Estimate” as disclosed in our 2013 Form 10-K.
Accounting Standards Adopted or Not Yet Adopted in this Report
There are no new accounting standards that have been adopted in this report.
ASU 2014-09. In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contract with
Customers (Topic 606). The objective of this ASU is to establish the principles to report useful
information to users of financial statements about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of
revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle is to recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and must be
adopted using either a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method. We are
currently evaluating the standard to determine the impact of its adoption on the consolidated
financial statements.

NOTE 3. ACQUISITION OF NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
Geostream. On October 31, 2008, we acquired a 26% interest in OOO Geostream Services Group
(“Geostream”) for $17.4 million. Geostream is a limited liability company incorporated in the
Russian Federation that provides a wide range of drilling, workover and reservoir engineering
services. On September 1, 2009, we acquired an additional 24% interest for $16.4 million, which
brought our total investment in Geostream to 50% and provided us a controlling interest with
representation on Geostream's board of directors. We accounted for the second investment as a
business combination achieved in stages. The results of Geostream have been included in our
consolidated financial statements since the initial acquisition date, with the portion outside of our
control forming a noncontrolling interest. On April 9, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the
50% noncontrolling interest in Geostream for $14.6 million. Geostream is now our wholly owned
subsidiary. This acquisition of the 50% noncontrolling interest in Geostream was accounted for as
an equity transaction. Therefore, our acquisition of the non-controlling interest in Geostream in the
second quarter of 2013 did not result in a gain or loss.
AlMansoori Key Energy Services, LLC. On March 7, 2010, we entered into an agreement with
AlMansoori Petroleum Services, LLC (“AlMansoori”) to form the joint venture AlMansoori Key
Energy Services, LLC, a joint venture under the laws of Abu Dhabi, UAE. The purpose of the joint
venture was to engage in conventional workover and drilling services, coiled tubing services,
fishing and rental services, rig monitoring services, pipe handling services and fluids, waste
treatment and handling services. Although AlMansoori held a 51% interest in the joint venture and
we held a 49% interest, we held three of the five board of directors seats and a controlling
financial interest. In addition, profits and losses of the joint venture were shared on equal terms
and in equal amounts with AlMansoori. Because the joint venture did not have sufficient
resources to carry on its activities without our financial support, we determined it to be a variable
interest entity of which we were the primary beneficiary. We consolidated the entity in our financial
statements. On August 5, 2013, we agreed to the dissolution of AlMansoori Key Energy Services,
LLC and the acquisition of the underlying business for $5.1 million. The $5.1 million is expected
to be paid in 2014 and is recorded in “Other current liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheet.
The acquisition of the 51% noncontrolling interest in AlMansoori Key Energy Services, LLC was
accounted for as an equity transaction and therefore did not result in a gain or loss.

Certain of our goodwill and other intangible assets are denominated in Russian Rubles and, as
such, the values of these assets are subject to fluctuations associated with changes in exchange
rates. Amortization expense for our intangible assets was $2.6 million and $4.8 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $7.8 million and $14.5

We perform an analysis of goodwill impairment on an annual basis unless an event occurs that
triggers additional interim testing. Deterioration in the capital investment climate in Russia as a
result of geopolitical events occurring during the second quarter of 2014 was determined to be a
triggering event. This triggering event required us to perform testing for possible goodwill
impairment of our Russian business reporting unit which is included in our International reporting
segment. Our analysis concluded that Russia's $22.4 million of goodwill is fully impaired, and that
$6.3 million of Russia's tradename intangible assets is impaired as well. We concluded that there
is no impairment to Russia's other long-lived assets.
In addition, the decline in market value of our common stock in comparison to the carrying value
of our assets during the third quarter of 2014 was determined to be a triggering event. This
triggering event required us to perform testing for possible goodwill impairment in our U.S.
Segment, and our step one testing indicated there may be an impairment in our U.S. fishing and
rental business reporting unit. No impairment was indicated in our other U.S. business reporting
units. Step two of the goodwill impairment testing for the fishing and rental business reporting unit
was performed preliminarily during the third quarter of 2014 and, while our preliminary analysis
concluded that that there was no impairment of goodwill, it did indicate that there was an
impairment of fixed assets. Step two testing will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and
any adjustment to the amount recorded, which could differ materially, will be recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2014. See “Note 7. Impairment of Fixed Assets” for further discussion.
NOTE 7. IMPAIRMENT OF FIXED ASSETS
The decline in market value of our common stock in comparison to the carrying value of our
assets during the third quarter of 2014 was determined to be a triggering event. This triggering
event required us to perform step one of the goodwill impairment test to identify potential
impairment. Our step one testing indicated potential impairment in our fishing and rental services
business reporting unit which required us to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test to
determine the amount of impairment, if any. Our preliminary step two testing performed during the
third quarter of 2014, using a discounted cash flow model to determine fair value, concluded that
certain assets, primarily frac stack and well testing assets, were impaired. As a result, we
recorded an estimated pre-tax charge of $60.8 million in the third quarter of 2014. Our preliminary
step two testing also indicated no impairment of goodwill in our fishing and rental services
business reporting unit. Step two testing will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 and any
adjustment to the amount recorded, which may be material, will be recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2014.

million accrued interest of 8.375% Senior Notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”) pursuant to the
indenture dated as of November 29, 2007 (as supplemented, the “Indenture”). The 2014 Notes
were general unsecured senior obligations and were subordinate to all of our existing and future
secured indebtedness. The 2014 Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior
unsecured basis by certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the 2014
Notes was payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year.

Table of Contents
6.75% Senior Notes due 2021
We issued $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Initial
2021 Notes”) on March 4, 2011 and issued an additional $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount of the 2021 Notes (the “Additional 2021 Notes” and together with the Initial 2021 Notes,
the “2021 Notes”) in a private placement on March 8, 2012 under an indenture dated March 4,
2011 (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated March 4,
2011 and amended by a further supplemental indenture dated March 8, 2012 (the “Supplemental
Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”). We used the net proceeds to
repay senior secured indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility. We capitalized $4.6
million of financing costs associated with the issuance of the 2021 Notes that will be amortized
over the term of the notes.
On March 5, 2013, we completed an offer to exchange the $200.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of unregistered Additional 2021 Notes for an equal principal amount of such notes
registered under the Securities Act of 1933. All of the 2021 Notes are treated as a single class
under the Indenture and as of the closing of the exchange offers bear the same CUSIP and ISIN
numbers.
The 2021 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all
of our existing and future secured indebtedness. The 2021 Notes are or will be jointly and
severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our existing and future domestic
subsidiaries. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year.
The 2021 Notes mature on March 1, 2021.
On or after March 1, 2016, the 2021 Notes will be subject to redemption at any time and from time
to time at our option, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices below (expressed as
percentages of the principal amount redeemed), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 1 of
the years indicated below:
Year
2016
2017
2018
2019 and thereafter
At any time and from time to time prior to March 1, 2016, we may, at our option, redeem all or a
portion of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a
premium with respect to the 2021 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
The premium is the excess of (i) the present value of the redemption price of 103.375% of the
principal amount, plus all remaining scheduled interest payments due through March 1, 2016
discounted at the treasury rate plus 0.5% over (ii) the principal amount of the note. If we
experience a change of control, subject to certain exceptions, we must give holders of the 2021

Notes the opportunity to sell to us their 2021 Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
purchase.
We are subject to certain negative covenants under the Indenture. The Indenture limits our ability
to, among other things:
•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred equity interests;
•pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem equity interests;
•make loans and investments;
•enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
•sell, transfer or otherwise convey assets;
•create liens;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•enter into agreements restricting subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;
•designate future subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and
•consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the applicable entities’ assets.
These covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, and contain cross-default
provisions relating to the covenants of our 2011 Credit Facility discussed below. Substantially all
of the covenants will terminate before the 2021 Notes mature if one of two specified ratings
agencies assigns the 2021 Notes an investment grade rating in the future and no events of default
exist under the Indenture. As of September 30, 2014, the 2021 Notes were rated below
investment grade. Any covenants that cease to apply to us as a result of achieving an investment
grade rating will not be restored, even if the investment rating assigned to the 2021 Notes later
falls below investment grade. We were in compliance with these covenants as of September 30,
2014.

Senior Secured Credit Facility
We are party to a $550.0 million senior secured revolving bank credit facility with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and
Capital One, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and
DnB NOR Bank ASA, as Co-Documentation Agent (as amended, the “2011 Credit Facility”),
which is an important source of liquidity for us. The 2011 Credit Facility consists of a revolving
credit facility, letter of credit sub-facility and swing line facility, all of which will mature no later than
March 31, 2016.
The maximum amount that we may borrow under the facility may be subject to limitation due to
the operation of the covenants contained in the facility. The 2011 Credit Facility allows us to
request increases in the total commitments under the facility by up to $100.0 million in the
aggregate in part or in full anytime during the term of the 2011 Credit Facility, with any such
increases being subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in the 2011 Credit Facility
and in the Indenture governing our 2021 Senior Notes, as well as lender approval.
We capitalized $4.9 million of financing costs in connection with the execution of the 2011 Credit
Facility and an additional $1.4 million related to a subsequent amendment that will be amortized
over the term of the debt.
The interest rate per annum applicable to the 2011 Credit Facility is, at our option, (i) adjusted
LIBOR plus the applicable margin or (ii) the higher of (x) JPMorgan’s prime rate, (y) the Federal
Funds rate plus 0.5% and (z) one-month adjusted LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus in each case the
•
•
•
•
applicable margin for all other loans. The applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 225 to
300 basis points, and the applicable margin for all other loans ranges from 125 to 200 basis
points, depending upon our consolidated total leverage ratio as defined in the 2011 Credit
Facility. Unused commitment fees on the facility equal 0.5%.
The 2011 Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, which, among other things, limit our
annual capital expenditures, restrict our ability to repurchase shares and require us to maintain
certain financial ratios. The financial ratios require that:
•our ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to total capitalization be no greater than 45%;
our senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured funded debt to trailing four quarters of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as calculated pursuant to the
terms of the 2011 Credit Facility, “EBITDA”) be no greater than 2.00 to 1.00;
we maintain a collateral coverage ratio, the ratio of the aggregate book value of the collateral to
the amount of the total commitments, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of at least 2:00 to
1:00;
we maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of trailing four quarters EBITDA to interest
expense of at least 3.00 to 1.00; and
we limit our capital expenditures and investments in foreign subsidiaries to $250.0 million per
fiscal year, if the consolidated total leverage ratio exceeds 3.00 to 1.00.
In addition, the 2011 Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including,
without limitation, restrictions on (i) liens; (ii) debt, guarantees and other contingent obligations;
(iii) mergers and consolidations; (iv) sales, transfers and other dispositions of property or assets;
(v) loans, acquisitions, joint ventures and other investments (with acquisitions permitted so long
as, after giving pro forma effect thereto, no default or event of default exists under the 2011 Credit
Facility, the pro forma consolidated total leverage ratio does not exceed 4.00 to 1.00, we are in
compliance with other financial covenants and we have at least $25.0 million of availability under
the 2011 Credit Facility); (vi) dividends and other distributions to, and redemptions and
repurchases from, equity holders; (vii) making investments, loans or advances; (viii) selling
properties; (ix) prepaying, redeeming or repurchasing subordinated (contractually or structurally)
debt; (x) engaging in transactions with affiliates; (xi) entering into hedging arrangements; (xii)
entering into sale and leaseback transactions; (xiii) granting negative pledges other than to the
lenders; (xiv) changes in the nature of business; (xv) amending organizational documents; and
(xvi) changes in accounting policies or reporting practices; in each of the foregoing cases, with
certain exceptions.
We were in compliance with covenants of the 2011 Credit Facility as of September 30, 2014. We
may prepay the 2011 Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty,
subject to certain reimbursements to the lenders for breakage and redeployment costs. As of
September 30, 2014, we had borrowings of $80.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit
facility, $49.1 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $162.2 million
available considering covenant constraints under our 2011 Credit Facility. The weighted average
interest rates on the outstanding borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility were 3.01% and
2.81% for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013,
respectively, and the weighted average interest rates on the outstanding borrowings under the
2011 Credit Facility were 2.92% and 2.72% for nine months ended September 30, 2014 and
September 30, 2013, respectively.

Table of Contents
Letter of Credit Facility
On November 7, 2013, we entered into an uncommitted, unsecured $15.0 million letter of credit
facility to be used solely for the issuances of performance letters of credit. As of September 30,
2014, $3.0 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the facility.

NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES
We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income taxes in multiple state and foreign
jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013
were 35.9% and 137.2%, respectively, and 29.2% and 1.7% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excluding the impact of non-deductible goodwill and
tradename impairment expense, our effective tax rates for the three month and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2014, were 35.9% and 34.8%, respectively. Our effective tax rate varies due
to the mix of pre-tax profit between the U.S. and international taxing jurisdictions with varying
statutory rates, the impact of permanent differences, including goodwill impairment expense, and
discrete tax adjustments, such as tax expense or benefit recognized for uncertain tax positions.
The variance between our effective rate and the U.S. statutory rate reflects international profits
and losses subject to varying statutory rates, the impact of permanent items, mainly non-
deductible expenses such as fines and penalties, and expenses subject to statutorily imposed
limitations such as meals and entertainment expenses, plus the impact of state income taxes.
As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we had $0.9 million of unrecognized tax
benefits, net of federal tax benefit, which, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. We
recognized a tax expense of less than $0.1 million and a tax benefit of $0.1 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, related to these items. We have
substantially concluded all U.S. federal and state tax matters through the year ended
December 31, 2009.
We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. We
have accrued a liability of $0.1 million and $0.4 million for the payment of interest and penalties
as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We believe that it is reasonably
possible that $0.4 million of our currently remaining unrecognized tax positions, each of which is
individually insignificant, may be recognized in the next twelve months as a result of a lapse of
statute of limitations and settlement of ongoing audits. No release of our deferred tax asset
valuation allowance was made during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2014 and
2013.
NOTE 11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Litigation
Various suits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business are pending against us. We
conduct business throughout the continental United States and may be subject to jury verdicts or
arbitrations that result in outcomes in favor of the plaintiffs. We are also exposed to various claims
abroad. We continually assess our contingent liabilities, including potential litigation liabilities, as
well as the adequacy of our accruals and our need for the disclosure of these items, if any. We
establish a provision for a contingent liability when it is probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount is reasonably estimable. We have $0.1 million of other liabilities related to
litigation that is deemed probable and reasonably estimated as of September 30, 2014. We do not
believe that the disposition of any of these matters will result in an additional loss materially in
excess of amounts that have been recorded.
Between May of 2013 and June of 2014, five lawsuits (four class actions and one enforcement
action) were filed in California involving alleged violations of California's wage and hour laws. In
general, the lawsuits allege failure to pay wages, including overtime and minimum wages, failure
to pay final wages upon employment terminations in a timely manner, failure
15
Table of Contents
to reimburse reasonable and necessary business expenses, failure to provide wage statements
consistent with California law, and violations of the California meal and break period laws, among
other claims. We intend to vigorously investigate and defend these actions. Because these cases
are in relatively early stages, and we have not yet briefed class certification issues, we cannot
predict the outcome of these lawsuits at this time. Accordingly, we cannot estimate any possible
loss or range of loss.
As previously disclosed, a special committee of our Board of Directors is investigating possible
violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) involving business activities of our
operations in Russia and an allegation involving our Mexico operations that, if true, could
potentially constitute a violation of certain of our policies, including our Code of Business
Conduct, the FCPA and other applicable laws. The special committee’s investigations, which
also include a review of certain aspects of the Company’s operations in Colombia, as well as our
other international locations, are ongoing. We are fully cooperating with investigations by the SEC
and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”). At this time we are unable to predict the ultimate resolution
of these matters with these agencies and, accordingly, cannot estimate any possible loss or range
of loss.
In August 2014, two class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court Southern District of
Texas Houston Division, individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated against
the Company and certain officers of the Company, alleging violations of federal securities laws,
specifically, violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)-5, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The
lawsuits are as follows: Sean Cady, Individually and on Behalf of All Other Persons Similarly
Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall Dodson, No. 4:14-cv-
2368, filed on August 15, 2014; and Ian W. Davidson, Individually and on Behalf of All Other
Persons Similarly Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall
Dodson, No. 4.14-cv-2403, filed on August 21, 2014. Both lawsuits allege that, during the period
July 25, 2013 to July 17, 2014, the defendants failed to disclose (1) that the Company’s
production for Petróleos Mexicanos (“Pemex”) was in decline; (2) that the Company engaged in
improper conduct related to its operations in Russia; and (3) that the Company’s business
practices in Russia were in violation of the FCPA. Because these cases are in early stages, we
cannot predict the outcome of these lawsuits at this time. Accordingly, we cannot estimate any
possible loss or range of loss.
In addition, in a letter dated September 4, 2014, a purported shareholder of the Company
demanded that the Board commence an independent internal investigation into and legal
proceedings against each member of the Board, a former member of the Board and certain
officers of the Company for alleged violations of Maryland and/or federal law. The letter alleges
that the Board and senior officers breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, including the
duty of loyalty and due care, by (i) improperly accounting for goodwill, (ii) causing the Company to
potentially violate the FCPA, resulting in an investigation by the SEC, (iii) causing the Company
to engage in improper conduct related to the Company’s Russia operations; and (iv) making false
statements regarding, and failing to properly account for, certain contracts with Pemex. As
described in the letter, the purported shareholder believes that the legal proceedings should seek
recovery of damages in an unspecified amount allegedly sustained by the Company. The Board
of Directors is reviewing the demand letter. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
Self-Insurance Reserves
We maintain reserves for workers’ compensation and vehicle liability on our balance sheet based
on our judgment and estimates using an actuarial method based on claims incurred. We estimate
general liability claims on a case-by-case basis. We maintain insurance policies for workers’
compensation, vehicle liability and general liability claims. These insurance policies carry self-
insured retention limits or deductibles on a per occurrence basis. The retention limits or
deductibles are accounted for in our accrual process for all workers’ compensation, vehicular
liability and general liability claims. As of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we have
recorded $63.1 million and $62.1 million, respectively, of self-insurance reserves related to
workers’ compensation, vehicular liabilities and general liability claims. Partially offsetting these
liabilities, we had $19.5 million and $18.5 million of insurance receivables as of September 30,
2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We believe that the liabilities we have recorded are
appropriate based on the known facts and circumstances and do not expect further losses
materially in excess of the amounts already accrued for existing claims.
Environmental Remediation Liabilities
For environmental reserve matters, including remediation efforts for current locations and those
relating to previously disposed properties, we record liabilities when our remediation efforts are
probable and the costs to conduct such remediation efforts can be reasonably estimated. As of
September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we have recorded $5.9 million and $6.2 million,
respectively, for our environmental remediation liabilities. We believe that the liabilities we have
recorded are appropriate based on the known facts and circumstances and do not expect further

NOTE 12. LOSS PER SHARE
Basic loss per share is determined by dividing net loss attributable to Key by the weighted
average number of common shares actually outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per
common share is based on the increased number of shares that would be outstanding assuming
conversion of potentially dilutive outstanding securities using the treasury stock and “as if
converted” methods.
The components of our loss per share are as follows:

Stock options, warrants and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) are included in the computation of
diluted loss per share using the treasury stock method. Restricted stock awards are legally
considered issued and outstanding when granted and are included in basic weighted average
shares outstanding. The diluted earnings per share calculations for the three months ended
September 30, 2014 exclude the potential exercise of 1.3 million stock options and 0.3 million
SARs and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 exclude the potential exercise of 1.4
million stock options and 0.3 million SARs as they would be anti-dilutive given the net loss
attributable to Key. The diluted earnings per share calculations for the three months ended
September 30, 2013 exclude the potential exercise of 1.6 million stock options and 0.3 million
SARs and for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 exclude the potential exercise of 1.7
million stock options and 0.3 million SARs as they would be anti-dilutive given the net loss
attributable to Key. No events occurred after September 30, 2014 that would materially affect the
number of weighted average shares outstanding.
NOTE 13. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
We recognized employee share-based compensation expense of less than $0.1 million and $3.0
million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the
related income tax expense recognized was less than $0.1 million and $1.1 million for the same
periods. We recognized employee share-based compensation expense of $7.1 million and $11.2
million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and the related
income tax expense recognized was $2.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively, for the same
period. We did not capitalize any share-based compensation during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.
The unrecognized compensation cost related to our unvested restricted stock as of September 30,
2014 is estimated to be $11.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average
period of 1.1 years. We do not have unrecognized cost related to our unvested stock options as of
September 30, 2014. No phantom stock was outstanding as of September 30, 2014.
During May 2014, we issued 197,865 shares of common stock to our outside directors under the
Key Energy Services, Inc. 2014 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan that was approved by our
stockholders on May 15, 2014. These shares vested immediately and we recognized $1.6 million
of expense related to these awards. Additionally, during May 2013, we recognized $1.8 million of
expense related to similar awards.
On January 30, 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted the 2014
Performance Unit Plan (the “2014 PU Plan”) and granted performance units pursuant to the
Performance Award Agreement (“2012 PU Award Agreement”) under the Key Energy Services,
Inc. 2012 Equity and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2012 Plan”). We believe that the 2014 PU Plan
and 2012 PU Award Agreement will enable us to obtain and retain employees who will contribute
to our long term success by aligning the interests of our executives with the interests of our
stockholders by providing compensation that is linked directly to increases in share value.
In January 2014, we issued 0.5 million performance units to our executive officers under the 2012
Plan with such material terms as set forth in the 2012 PU Award Agreement. In February 2014, we
issued 0.1 million performance units to certain other employees under the 2014 PU Plan. The
performance units are measured based on two performance periods from January 1, 2014 to
December 31, 2014 and from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. One half of the performance
units are

measured based on the first performance period, and the other half are measured based on the
second performance period. The number of performance units that may be earned by a participant
is determined at the end of each performance period based on the relative placement of Key’s
total stockholder return for that period within the peer group, as follows:

If any performance units vest for a given performance period, the award holder will be paid a cash
amount equal to the vested percentage of the performance units multiplied by the closing stock
price of our common stock on the last trading day of the performance period. We account for the
performance units as a liability-type award as they are settled in cash. As of September 30, 2014,
the fair value of outstanding performance units was $1.4 million, and is being accreted to
compensation expense over the vesting terms of the awards. As of September 30, 2014, the
unrecognized compensation cost related to our unvested performance units is estimated to be
$0.9 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years.

items approximate their fair values due to the maturity dates rapidly approaching, thus giving way
to discount rates that are similar.
6.75% Senior Notes due 2021. The fair value of these notes are based upon the quoted market
prices for those securities as of the dates indicated. The carrying value of these notes as of
September 30, 2014 was $675.0 million, and the fair value was $658.1 million (97.5% of carrying
value).
8.375% Senior Notes due 2014. At December 31, 2013 the fair value of our 2014 Notes was
based upon the quoted market prices for those securities as of the dates indicated. These notes
were redeemed in February 2014.
Credit Facility Revolving Loans. Because of their variable interest rates, the fair values of the
revolving loans borrowed under our 2011 Credit Facility approximate their carrying values. The
carrying and fair values of these loans as of September 30, 2014 were $80.0 million.
NOTE 16. SEGMENT INFORMATION
Our operating segments are U.S. and International. We also have a “Functional Support” segment
associated with managing each of our reportable operating segments. Our domestic rig services,
fluid management services, fishing and rental services, and coiled tubing services are aggregated
within our U.S. reportable segment. Our international rig services business and our Canadian
technology development group are aggregated within our International reportable segment. We
evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on revenue and income measures. All
inter-segment sales pricing is based on current market conditions. The following is a description
of the segments:
U.S. Segment
Rig-Based Services
Our rig-based services include the completion of newly drilled wells, workover and recompletion
of existing oil and natural gas wells, well maintenance, and the plugging and abandonment of
wells at the end of their useful lives. We also provide specialty drilling services to oil and natural
gas producers with certain of our larger rigs that are capable of providing conventional and
horizontal drilling services. Our rigs encompass various sizes and capabilities, allowing us to
service all types of wells with depths up to 20,000 feet. Many of our rigs are outfitted with our
proprietary KeyView® technology, which captures and reports well site operating data and
provides safety control systems. We believe that this technology allows our customers and our
crews to better monitor well site operations, improves efficiency and safety, and adds value to the
services that we offer.
The completion and recompletion services provided by our rigs prepare wells for production,
whether newly drilled, or recently extended through a workover operation. The completion
process may involve selectively perforating the well casing to access production zones,
stimulating and testing these zones, and installing tubular and downhole equipment. We typically
provide a well service rig and may also provide other equipment to assist in the completion
process. Completion services vary by well and our work may take a few days to several weeks to
perform, depending on the nature of the completion.
The workover services that we provide are designed to enhance the production of existing wells
and generally are more complex and time consuming than normal maintenance services.
Workover services can include deepening or extending wellbores into new formations by drilling
horizontal or lateral wellbores, sealing off depleted production zones and accessing previously
bypassed production zones, converting former production wells into injection wells for enhanced
recovery operations and conducting major subsurface repairs due to equipment failures.
Workover services may last from a few days to several weeks, depending on the complexity of the
workover.
Maintenance services provided with our rig fleet are generally required throughout the life cycle of
an oil or natural gas well. Examples of these maintenance services include routine mechanical
repairs to the pumps, tubing and other equipment, removing debris and formation material from
wellbores, and pulling rods and other downhole equipment from wellbores to identify and resolve
production problems. Maintenance services are generally less complicated than completion and
workover related services and require less time to perform.
Our rig fleet is also used in the process of permanently shutting-in oil or natural gas wells that are
at the end of their productive lives. These plugging and abandonment services generally require
auxiliary equipment in addition to a well servicing rig. The demand for plugging and abandonment
services is not significantly impacted by the demand for oil and natural gas because well
operators are required by state regulations to plug wells that are no longer productive.

Table of Contents
Fluid Management Services
We provide transportation and well-site storage services for various fluids utilized in connection
with drilling, completions, workover and maintenance activities. We also provide disposal
services for fluids produced subsequent to well completion.  These fluids are removed from the
well site and transported for disposal in saltwater disposal wells owned by us or a third party. In
addition, we operate a fleet of hot oilers capable of pumping heated fluids used to clear soluble
restrictions in a wellbore. Demand and pricing for these services generally correspond to demand
for our well service rigs.
Coiled Tubing Services
Coiled tubing services involve the use of a continuous metal pipe spooled onto a large reel which
is then deployed into oil and natural gas wells to perform various applications, such as wellbore
clean-outs, nitrogen jet lifts, through-tubing fishing, and formation stimulations utilizing acid and
chemical treatments. Coiled tubing is also used for a number of horizontal well applications such
as milling temporary isolation plugs that separate frac zones, and various other pre- and post-
hydraulic fracturing well preparation services.
Fishing and Rental Services
We offer a full line of services and rental equipment designed for use in providing both onshore
and offshore drilling and workover services. Fishing services involve recovering lost or stuck
equipment in the wellbore utilizing a broad array of “fishing tools.” Our rental tool inventory
consists of drill pipe, tubulars, handling tools (including our patented Hydra-Walk® pipe-handling
units and services), pressure-control equipment, pumps, power swivels, reversing units, foam air
units, frac stack equipment used to support hydraulic fracturing operations and the associated
flowback of frac fluids, proppants, oil and natural gas. We also provide well testing services.
Demand for our fishing and rental services is closely related to capital spending by oil and natural
gas producers, which is generally a function of oil and natural gas prices.
International Segment
Our International segment includes operations in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, the Middle East
and Russia. We provide rig-based services such as the maintenance, workover, recompletion of
existing oil wells, completion of newly-drilled wells and plugging and abandonment of wells at the
end of their useful lives in each of our international markets. In addition, we have a technology
development and control systems business based in Canada.
In addition, in Mexico we provide drilling, coiled tubing, wireline, project management and
consulting services. Our work in Mexico also requires us to provide third party services that vary in
scope by project.
In the Middle East, we operate in the Kingdom of Bahrain and Oman. On August 5, 2013, we
agreed to the dissolution of AlMansoori Key Energy Services, LLC, a joint venture formed under
the laws of Abu Dhabi, UAE, and the acquisition of the underlying business for $5.1 million. See
“Note 3. Acquisition of Noncontrolling Interests” for further discussion.
Our Russian operations provide drilling, workover, and reservoir engineering services. On April 9,
2013, we completed the acquisition of the 50% noncontrolling interest in Geostream, a limited
liability company incorporated in the Russian Federation, for $14.6 million. We now own 100% of
Geostream. See “Note 3. Acquisition of Noncontrolling Interests” for further discussion.
Our technology development and control systems business based in Canada is focused on the
development of hardware and software related to oilfield service equipment controls, data
acquisition and digital information flow.
Functional Support Segment
Our Functional Support segment includes unallocated overhead costs associated with
administrative support for our U.S. and International reporting segments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
ITEM
2.
OVERVIEW    
Key Energy Services, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Key,” the “Company,”
“we,” “us,” “its,” and “our”) provide a full range of well services to major oil companies, foreign
national oil companies and independent oil and natural gas production companies. Our services
include rig-based and coiled tubing-based well maintenance and workover services, well
completion and recompletion services, fluid management services, fishing and rental services,
and other ancillary oilfield services. Additionally, certain rigs are capable of specialty drilling
applications. We operate in most major oil and natural gas producing regions of the continental
United States and have operations in Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, the Middle East and Russia. In
addition, we have a technology development and control systems business based in Canada.
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes as of and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, included elsewhere herein, and the
audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2013 Form 10-K.
We operate in two business segments; U.S. and International. We also have a “Functional
Support” segment associated with managing our U.S. and International business segments. See
“Note 16. Segment Information” in “Item 1. Financial Statements” of Part I of this report for a
summary of our business segments.
PERFORMANCE MEASURES
The Baker Hughes U.S. rig count data, which is publicly available on a weekly basis, is often
used as an indicator of overall Exploration and Production (“E&P”) company spending and
broader oilfield activity. In assessing overall activity in the U.S. onshore oilfield service industry in
which we operate, we believe that the Baker Hughes U.S. land drilling rig count is the best
available barometer of E&P companies' capital spending and resulting activity levels. Historically,
our activity levels have been highly correlated to U.S. onshore capital spending by our E&P
company customers as a group.

Internally, we measure activity levels for our well servicing operations primarily through our rig
and trucking hours. Generally, as capital spending by E&P companies increases, demand for our
services also rises, resulting in increased rig and trucking services and more hours worked.
Conversely, when activity levels decline due to lower spending by E&P companies, we generally
provide fewer rig and trucking services, which results in lower hours worked.

Table of Contents
In the U.S., our rig activity occurs primarily on weekdays during daylight hours. Accordingly, we
track U.S. rig activity on a “per U.S. working day” basis. Key's U.S. working days per quarter,
which exclude national holidays, are indicated in the table below. Our international rig activity and
domestic trucking activity tend to occur on a 24/7 basis. Accordingly, we track our international rig
activity and our domestic trucking activity on a “per calendar day” basis. The following table
presents our quarterly rig and trucking hours from 2013 through the third quarter of 2014:

MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUTLOOK
Market Conditions — Quarter Ended September 30, 2014
Our core businesses depend on our customers' willingness to make expenditures to produce,
develop and explore for oil and natural gas. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous
factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide
economic conditions, and political instability in oil producing countries.
Third quarter 2014 U.S. revenues increased approximately 5% compared to the second quarter of
2014 primarily related to increased rig hours compared to the prior quarter. While activity in
California continued to decline due to customer spending decisions, increased activity in our
other markets helped offset this decline. Operating income margins improved as the increase in
rig activity helped overall U.S. margins, though this segment continued to be burdened by costs
associated with rig mobilization, primarily from Mexico to the U.S., and expenses incurred in
connection with the FCPA investigations.
Internationally, third quarter revenues were effectively flat compared to the second of quarter
2014. Excluding second quarter impairment of goodwill and other assets, operating income
margins were also flat for the same periods.
Market Outlook    
We continue to position Key to benefit from improving activity in many of our core markets through
balanced service offerings across the wells’ life, giving Key exposure to unconventional
horizontal well and legacy vertical well activities. We believe that the high value service we
provide across the well life cycle yields many opportunities for Key.
We expect our U.S. businesses to experience normal levels of seasonality, consistent with what
we have experienced in the past, which will likely result in a decrease in revenue in the fourth
quarter. Extended holiday slowdowns, fewer daylight hours and inclement weather will have a
negative impact on our activity levels, particularly in our production-driven businesses. We
continue to focus on our completion-driven businesses to enact changes and drive improvements,
though we will likely see end-of-year slowdowns in these businesses as well.
Internationally, we have now begun work under the new well services contract with Pemex. Work
under the contract commenced during October 2014 and has an initial value of approximately $48
million over a two year period with a potential extension of one year and a maximum increase of
25% of contract value. The contract scope includes rigs, coil, nitrogen, wireline and additional
third party services. We are encouraged by this development and are focused on execution under
this contract and pursuing additional opportunities in Mexico.

Consolidated Results of Operations — Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013
Revenues
Our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $23.9 million, or 6.1%,
to $365.8 million from $389.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, due to
overall lower activity in the U.S. as a result of competitive pressure and reduced customer activity.
Internationally, we had lower revenue as a result of reduced customer activity in Mexico. See

more detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.
Direct Operating Expenses
Our direct operating expenses increased $3.8 million, to $272.1 million (74.4% of revenues), for
the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $268.3 million (68.9% of revenues) for
the three months ended September 30, 2013. The increase is primarily related an increase in
employee benefit costs and repair and maintenance expense.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $6.0 million, or 10.6%, to $50.9 million during
the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $57.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2013. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in capital
expenditures and amortization of intangible assets.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased $12.6 million, to $65.2 million (17.8% of
revenues), for the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $52.7 million (13.5% of
revenues) for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The increase is primarily due to
higher legal expense related to FCPA investigations, which totaled $16.1 million for the quarter.
We expect costs to continue over the course of the investigations. The FCPA investigation
expense was partially offset by lower employee compensation costs due to reduced staffing
levels.
Impairment Expense
During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded a $60.8 million impairment of
fixed assets at our fishing and rental services business reporting unit which is included in our U.S.
reporting segment. No impairments were recorded in 2013.

Table of Contents
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense decreased $0.4 million, or 2.9%, to $13.4 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2014, compared to $13.8 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease is
primarily related to reduced borrowings under the revolving credit facility for the three months
ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.

During the quarter ended September 30, 2014, we recognized other loss, net, of $0.3 million,
compared to other income, net, of $0.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2013. Our
foreign exchange (gain) loss relates to U.S. dollar-denominated transactions in our foreign
businesses and fluctuations in exchange rates between local currencies and the U.S. dollar.

We recorded an income tax benefit of $34.8 million on a pre-tax loss of $97.0 million in the three
months ended September 30, 2014, compared to an income tax expense of $2.7 million on a pre-
tax loss of $2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013. Our effective tax rate was
35.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to 137.2% for the three months
ended September 30, 2013. Our effective tax rates for such periods differ from the U.S. statutory
rate of 35% due to a number of factors, including the mix of profit and loss between domestic and
international taxing jurisdictions and the impact of permanent items, such as goodwill impairment
expense, that affect book income but do not affect taxable income.
Noncontrolling Interests
We have no noncontrolling interest holders in 2014. For the three months ended September 30,
2013, we allocated $0.2 million associated with the income incurred by our joint ventures to the
noncontrolling interests holders of these ventures.

Table of Contents
Operating expenses for our U.S. segment were $367.3 million during the three months ended
September 30, 2014, which represented a increase of $74.1 million, or 25.3%, compared to
$293.1 million for the same period in 2013. These expenses increased primarily as a result of the
impairment of fixed assets in our fishing and rental services business reporting unit and an
increase in employee compensation and benefit costs and repair and maintenance expense.
International
Revenues for our International segment decreased $18.6 million, or 41.8%, to $26.0 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $44.6 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower customer activity in Mexico.
Operating expenses for our International segment decreased $16.7 million, or 32.1%, to $35.2
million for the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $51.9 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2013. These expenses decreased as a direct result of lower
customer activity in Mexico.
Functional Support
Operating expenses for Functional Support, which represent expenses associated with managing
our U.S. and International reporting segments, increased $13.7 million, or 41.5%, to $46.6 million
(12.7% of consolidated revenues) for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to
$32.9 million (8.5% of consolidated revenues) for the same period in 2013. The increase is
primarily due to increased legal expense related to the FCPA investigations, partially offset by
lower employee compensation and benefit costs.
Consolidated Results of Operations — Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 and 2013
Revenues
Our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $157.0 million, or
12.8%, to $1.1 billion from $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily
due to overall lower activity in the U.S. as a result of competitive pressure and reduced customer
activity. Reduced customer activity in Mexico resulted in reduced revenue in our International
segment. See “Segment Operating Results — Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 and
2013” below for a more detailed discussion of the change in our revenues.
Direct Operating Expenses
Our direct operating expenses decreased $61.3 million, to $793.3 million (74.0% of revenues), for
the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $854.6 million (69.5% of revenues) for
the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as a result of lower variable costs such as cost
attributable to direct labor and fuel due to reduced activity levels.
Depreciation and Amortization Expense
Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $15.2 million, or 9.0%, to $154.2 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $169.4 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2013. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in capital
expenditures and amortization of intangible assets.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses increased $2.3 million, to $176.0 million (16.4% of
revenues), for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $173.6 million (14.1% of
revenues) for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The increase is primarily due to higher
legal expense related to FCPA investigations, which totaled $21.5 million year to date. We expect
costs to continue over the course of the investigations. The FCPA investigation expense was
largely offset by lower compensation costs due to reduced staffing levels.
Impairment Expense
During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we recorded a $28.7 million impairment of
goodwill and tradenames in our Russian business unit which is included in our International
reporting segment and a $60.8 million impairment of fixed assets at our fishing and rental services
business reporting unit which is included in our U.S. reporting segment. No impairments were
recorded in 2013.
Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized
Interest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 2.9%, to $40.4 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014, compared to $41.6 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease is
primarily related to reduced borrowings under the revolving credit facility for the nine months
ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.

Other Income, Net
During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we recognized other income, net, of $2.5
million, compared to other income, net, of $0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2013. Our foreign exchange loss relates to U.S. dollar-denominated transactions in our foreign
locations and fluctuations in exchange rates between local currencies and the U.S. dollar.

Income Tax Benefit
We recorded an income tax benefit of $52.0 million on a pre-tax loss of $178.4 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2014, compared to an income tax benefit of $0.1 million on a pre-
tax loss of $8.8 million for the same period in 2013. Our effective tax rate was 29.2% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2014, compared to 1.7% for the nine months ended September 30,
2013. Excluding the impact of non-deductible goodwill and tradename impairment expense, our
effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was 34.8%. Our effective tax
rates for such periods differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% due to a number of factors,
including the mix of profit and loss between domestic and international taxing jurisdictions and the
impact of permanent items, such as goodwill impairment expense, that affect book income but do
not affect taxable income.
Noncontrolling Interest
We have no noncontrolling interest holders in 2014. For the nine months ended September 30,
2013, we allocated $0.6 million associated with the income incurred by our joint ventures to the
noncontrolling interest holders of these ventures.

September 30, 2013. The decrease for this segment was due to lower activity in our fishing and

increased primarily as a result of the impairment of fixed assets in our fishing and rental services
business reporting unit partially offset by reduced labor cost as a result of lower activity.
International
Revenues for our International segment decreased $92.5 million, or 52.4%, to $84.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $176.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower customer activity in Mexico.
Operating expenses for our International segment decreased $42.4 million, or 23.1%, to $140.7
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $183.1 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2013. These expenses decreased as a direct result of lower
customer activity and severance costs in Mexico, partially offset by impairment of goodwill and
tradenames in our Russian business reporting unit.
Functional Support
Operating expenses for Functional Support, which represent expenses associated with managing
our U.S. and International reporting segments, increased $9.2 million, or 8.6%, to $116.2 million
(10.8% of consolidated revenues) for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to
$107.0 million (8.7% of consolidated revenues) for the same period in 2013. The increase is
primarily due to increased legal expense related to the FCPA investigations, partially offset by
lower employee compensation and benefit costs.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Current Financial Condition and Liquidity
As of September 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.4 million. Our adjusted
working capital (working capital excluding the current portion of long-term debt) was $264.7
million as of September 30, 2014, compared to $277.4 million as of December 31, 2013. Our
adjusted working capital decreased from the prior year end primarily as a result of a decrease in
accounts receivable partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents and inventories.
We incurred $21.5 million of costs associated with FCPA investigations and expect costs to
continue in future periods until the investigation is complete. Our total outstanding debt was
$758.6 million, and we have no significant debt maturities until 2016. As of September 30, 2014,
we have $80.0 million in borrowings, $49.1 million in committed letters of credit outstanding with
borrowing capacity of $162.2 million available considering covenant constraints under our 2011
Credit Facility (defined below).

Cash used in investing activities was $91.8 million and $118.1 million for nine months ended
September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Investing cash outflows during these periods
consisted primarily of capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures through September 30, 2014
primarily relate to our replacement assets for our existing fleet and equipment. Additionally, during
the first quarter of 2013, as previously disclosed, we funded into escrow $14.6 million for the
acquisition of the 50% noncontrolling interest in Geostream, our joint venture in Russia.
Cash used in financing activities was $12.1 million and $20.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Overall financing cash outflows for 2014 primarily
relate to net payments on the revolving credit facility and repayments of long-term debt. Overall
financing cash outflows for 2013 primarily relate to net payments on the revolving credit facility.
Sources of Liquidity and Capital Resources
Our sources of liquidity include our current cash and cash equivalents, availability under our 2011
Credit Facility, and internally generated cash flows from operations.
Debt Service
We do not have any maturities of debt until 2016. Interest on our 2011 Credit Facility is due each
quarter. There are no interest payments for the remainder of 2014 related to our 2021 Notes
(defined below). We expect to fund interest payments from cash generated by operations. At
September 30, 2014, our annual debt maturities for our 2021 Notes and borrowings under our

At September 30, 2014, we were in compliance with all the covenants under the 2011 Credit
Facility and the indenture governing the 2021 Notes.
8.375% Senior Notes due 2014
On February 25, 2014, we redeemed the $3.6 million aggregate principal amount and paid $0.1
million accrued interest of 8.375% Senior Notes due 2014 (the “2014 Notes”) pursuant to the
indenture dated as of November 29, 2007 (as supplemented, the “Indenture”). The 2014 Notes
were general unsecured senior obligations were subordinate to all of our existing and future
secured indebtedness. The 2014 Notes were jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior
unsecured basis by certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the 2014
Notes was payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year.
6.75% Senior Notes due 2021
We issued $475.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “Initial
2021 Notes”) on March 4, 2011 and issued an additional $200.0 million aggregate principal
amount of the 2021 Notes (the “Additional 2021 Notes” and, together with the Initial 2021 Notes,
the “2021 Notes”) in a private placement on March 8, 2012 under an indenture dated March 4,
2011 (the “Base Indenture”), as supplemented by a first supplemental indenture dated March 4,
2011 and amended by a further supplemental indenture dated March 8, 2012 (the “Supplemental
Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”). We used the net proceeds to
repay senior secured indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility. We capitalized $4.6
million of financing costs associated with the issuance of the 2021 Notes that will be amortized
over the term of the notes.
On March 5, 2013, we completed an offer to exchange the $200.0 million in aggregate principal
amount of unregistered Additional 2021 Notes for an equal principal amount of such notes
registered under the Securities Act of 1933. All of the 2021 Notes are treated as a single class
under the Indenture and as of the closing of the exchange offer, bear the same CUSIP and ISIN
numbers.
The 2021 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all
of our existing and future secured indebtedness. The 2021 Notes are or will be jointly and
severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by
34
Table of Contents
certain of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable on
March 1 and September 1 of each year. The 2021 Notes mature on March 1, 2021.
On or after March 1, 2016, the 2021 Notes will be subject to redemption at any time and from time
to time at our option, in whole or in part, at the redemption prices below (expressed as
percentages of the principal amount redeemed), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on March 1 of
the years indicated below:

2019 and thereafter
At any time and from time to time prior to March 1, 2016, we may, at our option, redeem all or a
portion of the 2021 Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a
premium with respect to the 2021 Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.
The premium is the excess of (i) the present value of the redemption price of 103.375 of the
principal amount, plus all remaining scheduled interest payments due through March 1, 2016
discounted at the treasury rate plus 0.50% over (ii) the principal amount of the note. If we
experience a change of control, subject to certain exceptions, we must give holders of the 2021
Notes the opportunity to sell to us their 2021 Notes, in whole or in part, at a purchase price equal
to 101% of the aggregate principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
purchase.
We are subject to certain negative covenants under the Indenture. The Indenture limits our ability
to, among other things:
•incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred equity interests;
•pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem equity interests;
•make loans and investments;
•enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
•sell, transfer or otherwise convey assets;
•create liens;
•enter into transactions with affiliates;
•enter into agreements restricting subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends;
•designate future subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and
•consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of the applicable entities’ assets.
These covenants are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, and contain cross-default
provisions relating to the covenants of our 2011 Credit Facility discussed below. Substantially all
of the covenants will terminate before the 2021 Notes mature if one of two specified ratings
agencies assigns the 2021 Notes an investment grade rating in the future and no events of default
exist under the Indenture. As of September 30, 2014, the 2021 Notes were rated below
investment grade. Any covenants that cease to apply to us as a result of achieving an investment
grade rating will not be restored, even if the investment rating assigned to the 2021 Notes later
falls below investment grade. We were in compliance with covenants of the 2011 Credit Facility at
September 30, 2014.
Senior Secured Credit Facility
We are party to a $550.0 million senior secured revolving bank credit facility with JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Bank of America, N.A., as Syndication Agent, and
Capital One, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank and
DnB NOR Bank ASA, as Co-Documentation Agent (as amended, the “2011 Credit Facility”),
which is an important source of liquidity for us. The 2011 Credit Facility consists of a revolving
credit facility, letter of credit sub-facility and swing line facility, all of which will mature no later than
March 31, 2016.
The maximum amount that we may borrow under the facility may be subject to limitation due to
the operation of the covenants contained in the facility. The 2011 Credit Facility allows us to
request increases in the total commitments under the facility by up to $100.0 million in the
aggregate in part or in full anytime during the term of the 2011 Credit Facility, with any such
increases being subject to compliance with the restrictive covenants in the 2011 Credit Facility
and in the Indenture governing our 2021 Senior Notes, as well as lender approval.
We capitalized $4.9 million of financing costs in connection with the execution of the 2011 Credit
Facility and an additional $1.4 million related to a subsequent amendment that will be amortized
over the term of the debt.
The interest rate per annum applicable to the 2011 Credit Facility is, at our option, (i) adjusted
LIBOR plus the applicable margin or (ii) the higher of (x) JPMorgan’s prime rate, (y) the Federal
Funds rate plus 0.5% and (z) one-month
35
Table of Contents
•
•
•
•
adjusted LIBOR plus 1.0%, plus in each case the applicable margin for all other loans. The
applicable margin for LIBOR loans ranges from 225 to 300 basis points, and the applicable
margin for all other loans ranges from 125 to 200 basis points, depending upon our consolidated
total leverage ratio as defined in the 2011 Credit Facility. Unused commitment fees on the facility
equal 0.50%.
The 2011 Credit Facility contains certain financial covenants, which, among other things, limit our
annual capital expenditures, restrict our ability to repurchase shares and require us to maintain
certain financial ratios. The financial ratios require that:
•our ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to total capitalization be no greater than 45%;
our senior secured leverage ratio of senior secured funded debt to trailing four quarters of
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as calculated pursuant to the
terms of the 2011 Credit Facility, “EBITDA”) be no greater than 2.00 to 1.00;
we maintain a collateral coverage ratio, the ratio of the aggregate book value of the collateral to
the amount of the total commitments, as of the last day of any fiscal quarter of at least 2:00 to
1:00;
we maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of trailing four quarters EBITDA to interest
expense of at least 3.00 to 1.00; and
we limit our capital expenditures and investments in foreign subsidiaries to $250.0 million per
fiscal year, if the consolidated total leverage ratio exceeds 3.00 to 1.00.
In addition, the 2011 Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including,
without limitation, restrictions on (i) liens; (ii) debt, guarantees and other contingent obligations;
(iii) mergers and consolidations; (iv) sales, transfers and other dispositions of property or assets;
(v) loans, acquisitions, joint ventures and other investments (with acquisitions permitted so long
as, after giving pro forma effect thereto, no default or event of default exists under the 2011 Credit
Facility, the pro forma consolidated total leverage ratio does not exceed 4.00 to 1.00, we are in
compliance with other financial covenants and we have at least $25.0 million of availability under
the 2011 Credit Facility); (vi) dividends and other distributions to, and redemptions and
repurchases from, equity holders; (vii) making investments, loans or advances; (viii) selling
properties; (ix) prepaying, redeeming or repurchasing subordinated (contractually or structurally)
debt; (x) engaging in transactions with affiliates; (xi) entering into hedging arrangements; (xii)
entering into sale and leaseback transactions; (xiii) granting negative pledges other than to the
lenders; (xiv) changes in the nature of business; (xv) amending organizational documents; and
(xvi) changes in accounting policies or reporting practices; in each of the foregoing cases, with
certain exceptions. We were in compliance with these covenants at September 30, 2014. We may
prepay the 2011 Credit Facility in whole or in part at any time without premium or penalty, subject
to certain reimbursements to the lenders for breakage and redeployment costs. As of
September 30, 2014, we had borrowings of $80.0 million outstanding under the revolving credit
facility, $49.1 million of letters of credit outstanding with borrowing capacity of $162.2 million
available considering covenant constraints under our 2011 Credit Facility. The weighted average
interest rates on the outstanding borrowings under the 2011 Credit Facility were 3.01% and
2.81% for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013,
respectively, and the weighted average interest rates on the outstanding borrowing under the
2011 Credit Facility were 2.92% and 2.72% for nine months ended September 30, 2014 and
September 30, 2013, respectively.
Letter of Credit Facility
On November 7, 2013, we entered into an uncommitted, unsecured $15.0 million letter of credit
facility to be used solely for the issuances of performance letters of credit. As of September 30,
2014, $3.0 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the facility.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
At September 30, 2014 we did not, and we currently do not, have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources.
Liquidity Outlook and Future Capital Requirements
As of September 30, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $57.4 million, borrowing
capacity of $162.2 million, available considering covenant constraints under the 2011 Credit
Facility, and no significant debt maturities until 2016. We believe that our internally generated
cash flows from operations and current reserves of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to
finance the majority of our cash requirements for operations, budgeted capital expenditures, and
debt service for the next twelve months. Also, as we have historically done, we may, from time to
time, access available funds under our 2011 Credit Facility to supplement our liquidity to meet
cash requirements for day-to-day operations and times of peak needs throughout the year. Our
planned capital expenditures, as well as any acquisitions we choose to pursue, could be financed
through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our 2011 Credit Facility and, in the
case of acquisitions, equity.

Capital Expenditures
During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, our capital expenditures totaled $108.1
million, primarily related to the ongoing replacement to our rig service fleet, coiled tubing units,
fluid transportation equipment and rental equipment. Our capital expenditure plan for 2014 of
approximately $150 million to $160 million is primarily related to equipment replacement needs,
including ongoing replacement to our rig services fleet. Our capital expenditure program for 2014
is subject to market conditions, including activity levels, commodity prices, industry capacity and
specific customer needs. Our focus for 2014 has been and continues to be the maximization of
our current equipment fleet, but we may choose to increase our capital expenditures in 2014 to
increase market share or expand our presence into a new market. We may also incur capital
expenditures for strategic investments and acquisitions. We currently anticipate funding our 2014
capital expenditures through a combination of cash on hand, operating cash flow, and borrowings
under our 2011 Credit Facility. Should our operating cash flows or activity levels prove to be
insufficient to fund our currently planned capital spending levels, management expects it will
adjust our capital spending plans accordingly. We may also incur capital expenditures for
strategic investments and acquisitions.
ITEM 3.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
There have been no material changes in our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market
risk from those disclosed in our 2013 Form 10-K. More detailed information concerning market
risk can be found in “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk“ in our
2013 Form 10-K.
ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, management
performed, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, an
evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of
2014 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We are subject to various suits and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. We
do not believe that the disposition of any of our ordinary course litigation will result in a material
adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For
additional information on legal proceedings, see “Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies” in
“Item 1. Financial Statements” of Part I of this report, which is incorporated herein by reference.
As previously disclosed, a special committee of our Board of Directors is investigating possible
violations of the FCPA involving business activities of our operations in Russia and an allegation
involving our Mexico operations that, if true, could potentially constitute a violation of certain of our
policies, including our Code of Business Conduct, the FCPA and other applicable laws. The
special committee’s investigations, which also include a review of certain aspects of the
Company’s operations in Colombia, as well as our other international locations, are ongoing. We
are fully cooperating with investigations by the SEC and DOJ. At this time we are unable to
predict the ultimate resolution of these matters with these agencies and, accordingly, cannot
estimate any possible loss or range of loss. See Part II, Item 1. Legal Proceedings of the Form 10-
Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014 for more information regarding these investigations.
In August 2014, two class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court Southern District of
Texas Houston Division, individually and on behalf of all other persons similarly situated against
the Company and certain officers of the Company, alleging violations of federal securities laws,
specifically, violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10(b)-5, Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The
lawsuits are as follows: Sean Cady, Individually and on Behalf of All Other Persons Similarly
Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall Dodson, No. 4:14-cv-
2368, filed on August 15, 2014; and Ian W. Davidson, Individually and on Behalf of All Other
Persons Similarly Situated v. Key Energy Services, Inc., Richard J. Alario, and J. Marshall
Dodson, No. 4.14-cv-2403, filed on August 21, 2014. Both lawsuits allege that, during the period
July 25, 2013 to July 17, 2014, the defendants failed to disclose (1) that the Company’s
production for Pemex was in decline; (2) that the Company engaged in improper conduct related
to its operations in Russia; and (3) that the Company’s business practices in Russia were in
violation of the FCPA. Because these cases are in early stages, we cannot predict the outcome of
these lawsuits at this time. Accordingly, we cannot estimate any possible loss or range of loss.
In addition, in a letter dated September 4, 2014, a purported shareholder of the Company
demanded that the Board commence an independent internal investigation into and legal
proceedings against each member of the Board, a former member of the Board and certain
officers of the Company for alleged violations of Maryland and/or federal law. The letter alleges
that the Board and senior officers breached their fiduciary duties to the Company, including the
duty of loyalty and due care, by (i) improperly accounting for goodwill, (ii) causing the Company to
potentially violate the FCPA, resulting in an investigation by the SEC, (iii) causing the Company
to engage in improper conduct related to the Company’s Russia operations; and (iv) making false
statements regarding, and failing to properly account for, certain contracts with Pemex. As
described in the letter, the purported shareholder believes that the legal proceedings should seek
recovery of damages in an unspecified amount allegedly sustained by the Company. The Board
of Directors is reviewing the demand letter. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter.
