</p>
<p> &#8220;<i>The Human Rights Council</i> 
</p>
<p>1. <i>Reaffirms</i> its solidarity with the Haitian people in the wake of the 
devastating earthquake which struck Haiti on 12 January 2010, and underscores the 
particular circumstances created by this natural disaster, which resulted in nearly 
300,000 casualties, the displacement of more than 2 million people and the 
destruction of a significant proportion of the country&#8217;s infrastructure, with serious 
consequences for the enjoyment by Haitians of their human rights; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Recalls</i> the special session on Haiti convened on 27 January 2010 and 
resolution S/13-1, which it adopted on that occasion, and welcomes the report 
prepared pursuant to that resolution by the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights1 and the recommendations contained therein; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Recognizes</i> that the crisis caused by the earthquake has had a real 
impact on the health and security of Haitian women and men, and emphasizes that 
sufficient resources must be mobilized to facilitate access to basic services in order 
to improve the quality of life of the population; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Welcomes</i> the mobilization and contributions of the international 
community in support of reconstruction, applauds the priorities defined by the 
Government in its national recovery and development action plan, which focuses on 
reviving economic, government and social activity, as well as on reducing the 
country&#8217;s vulnerability and placing it back on the path to development, and urges 
donors to honour their commitments without delay; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Also welcomes</i> the strengthening of the United Nations Stabilization 
Mission in Haiti, as requested by the Security Council in its resolution 1927 (2010)

<p>of 4 June 2010 with a view to, in particular, helping the Haitian Government to 
provide adequate protection to the population while devoting special attention to the 
needs of displaced persons and other vulnerable groups, especially women and 
children; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Stresses</i> the need to tackle obstacles that are preventing the people 
from fully exercising their human rights, including access to food, decent housing, 
health care, drinking water, sanitation, education and employment; 
</p>

may fully exercise their rights;

preparations for the elections scheduled for November 2010, and stresses the 
importance of ensuring that these elections are carried out under the proper 
conditions; 
</p>
<p>9. <i>Applauds</i> the fact that the Haitian authorities have reaffirmed their 
commitment and determination to improve the quality of life of Haitian women and 
men by, in particular, ensuring greater respect for human rights and promoting 
cooperation between the Haitian National Police and the United Nations 
Stabilization Mission in Haiti in curbing violence, including sexual violence against 
women, crime and banditry; 
</p>
<p>10. <i>Is aware of</i> the many obstacles to development in Haiti and the 
difficulties encountered by its leaders in daily governance, recognizes that the full 
enjoyment of civil and political, economic, social and cultural human rights is a 
factor of peace, stability and progress in Haiti, and encourages the Government to 
continue to reform the judicial and prison system and to strengthen the rule of law 
and efforts to combat impunity; 
</p>
<p>11. <i>Strongly encourages</i> the international community as a whole, and in 
particular international donors, the group of countries known as the Friends of Haiti, 
United Nations specialized agencies, and regional and international organizations, to 
step up their cooperation with the constituted authorities of Haiti for the full 
realization of human rights; 
</p>
<p>12. <i>Invites</i> the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, the Interim 
Haiti Recovery Commission and other competent international bodies to take full 
account of the recommendations made by the High Commissioner concerning 
greater protection of the human rights of displaced persons, women, children, 
persons with disabilities and migrants; 
</p>
<p>13. <i>Underscores</i> the need for heightened awareness of human rights 
during the reconstruction process through, inter alia, the integration of a human 
rights-based approach in reconstruction projects, including private and bilateral 
projects and associated calls for tender; 
</p>
<p>14. <i>Welcomes</i> the request of the Haitian authorities to have the mission of 
the independent expert on the situation of human rights in Haiti extended until 
September 2011, and decides to approve that request; 
</p>
<p>15. <i>Emphasizes</i> that the independent expert&#8217;s mandate falls within the 
framework of technical assistance and capacity-building and, in the light of that fact, 
encourages him to collaborate with international institutions, donors and the 
international community in bringing their expertise to bear and furnishing sufficient 
resources to support the authorities&#8217; efforts to rebuild the country following the </p>

<p>earthquake of 12 January 2010, and encourages him to continue the work begun in 
2008 and to accomplish his mission by drawing upon his experience to further the 
cause of human rights in Haiti, with particular emphasis on economic, social and 
cultural rights, the rights of persons with disabilities, women&#8217;s and children&#8217;s rights, 
and access to justice; 
</p>
<p>16. <i>Invites</i> the expert to undertake a mission to Haiti in the near future and
