 <p> 
</p><p> 
1. On 6 July 2006 the Human Rights Council adopted resolution S-1/1 in which it decided 
to &#8220;dispatch an urgent fact-finding mission [to the Occupied Palestinian Territory] headed by the 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 
1967&#8221;.  The resolution failed to provide details of the mandate.  In particular, it failed to indicate 
which facts were to be investigated.  The preamble, however, suggests that the purpose was to 
examine the humanitarian consequences of the Israel Defence Forces&#8217; (IDF) &#8220;Operation Summer 
Rains&#8221; in Gaza and the arrest of Palestinian legislators in the West Bank.  Also, the resolution 
contained no reporting obligation  (unlike Human Rights Council resolution S-3/1, entitled 
&quot;Human rights violations emanating from Israeli military incursions in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, including the recent one in northern Gaza and the assault on Beit Hanoun&quot;.) 
 
2. At the time that the resolution was being debated, I communicated with the proposers of 
the resolution and suggested to them that someone other than myself be mandated to carry out 
the mission, as it was unlikely that Israel would consent to such a mission under my direction in 
the light of my critical reports on Israel&#8217;s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory (OPT). The proposers of the resolution did not heed my suggestion and instead 
continued with their resolution, directing me to carry out the fact-finding mission. 
 
3. Unperturbed by the flaws in resolution S-1/1, and the likelihood that Israel would refuse 
to consent to the mission, I went ahead and prepared for the mission, ably assisted by the staff of 
OHCHR.  For this purpose I constituted a mission comprising of myself, a health expert and a 
security expert, together with interpreters and OHCHR staff.  Details of these preparations are 
contained in my report to the Human Rights Council of 20 December 2006 (see A/HRC/4/116, 
entitled &#8220;Report of the Special Rapporteur on the human rights situation in the Palestinian 
territories occupied since 1967 pursuant to resolution 3/1 of the Human Rights Council&#8221;). 
 
4. Under the terms of General Assembly resolution 46/59, no fact-finding mission may be 
undertaken without the consent of the State to be investigated.  The Government of Israel, 
despite representations from the President of the Human Rights Council, failed to respond 
positively to requests for the mission to take place, as I had predicted to the proposers of the 
resolution.  On 8 August 2006, I wrote to the President requesting him to inform the Human 
Rights Council that Israel had failed to consent to the mission and that as far as I was concerned 
the mission could not proceed (see A/HRC/4/116). 
 
5. From 1 to 8 December 2006 I visited Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory in my 
capacity as Special Rapporteur.  As on previous visits, the Government of Israel placed no 
obstacles in the way of my visit and indeed on occasion facilitated my visit by issuing me a &#8220;To 
Whom It May Concern&#8221; letter instructing Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) officers at crossings and 
checkpoints to allow me free passage.  However, as in the past, the Government of Israel refused 
to meet with me, as it does not recognize my mandate.  In writing to the Government of Israel 
about my proposed visit in December, as a matter of courtesy, I assured the Government that I 
intended visiting in my capacity as Special Rapporteur and not in my capacity as head of the 
fact-finding mission mandated by resolution S-1/1.  I am confident that without such an 
assurance I would not have been permitted to enter Israel. 
 
6. During my December visit to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, I visited Gaza and 
examined the consequences of both &#8220;Operation Summer Rains&#8221; and &#8220;Operation Autumn </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
Clouds&#8221;.  I also visited the scene of the killing of 19 persons and the wounding of 55 persons in 
Beit Hanoun on 8 November 2006.  (The Human Rights Council later established a mission 
headed by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to investigate this event.  Again, no consent by Israel was 
forthcoming for such a mission.)  I reported to the Human Rights Council on this visit in my 
report on 22 March 2007 (see A/HRC/4/17).   
 
7. In this report I examined the consequences of Israeli military action in Gaza between 25 
June and the end of November 2006, action that took the names &#8220;Operation Summer Rains&#8221; and 
&#8220;Operation Autumn Clouds&#8221;.  I reported that over 400 Palestinians were killed and some 1,500 
injured in 364 military incursions which were accompanied by persistent artillery shelling and 
air-to-surface missile attacks.  Missiles, shells and bulldozers destroyed homes, schools, 
hospitals, mosques, agricultural land, public buildings, bridges, water pipelines and sewage 
networks.  On 27 June the Israeli Air Force (IAF) destroyed the only domestic power plant in 
Gaza, which deprived half of the population of Gaza of electricity for several months.  
Thousands of Palestinians were displaced from their homes as a result of Israel&#8217;s military 
actions. 
 
8. The report paid particular attention to IDF action in Beit Hanoun in November 2006.  In 
this action 82 Palestinians were killed and more than 260 injured.  I reported on my visit to the 
home of the Al-Athamnah family, which was shelled on 8 November 2006, killing 19 persons 
and wounding 55 persons.  I expressed the view that there were reasons for doubting that this 
shelling was the result of a &#8220;technical failure&#8221;, as maintained by Israel. 
 
9. The report also examined the humanitarian crisis occasioned by the siege of Gaza and 
Israeli military action.  I found that 70 per cent of Gaza&#8217;s potential work force was out of work 
or without pay and that over 80 per cent of the population live below the official poverty line.  I 
considered the effect that the destruction of the Gaza power plant had had on daily life in Gaza 
and the consequences of the siege for health and education. 
 
10. I concluded that Israel had violated a number of rights contained in the two International 
Covenants and that it had, in addition, violated the most fundamental rules of international 
humanitarian law by attacking civilian targets, spreading terror among the civilian population, 
destroying property not justified by military necessity, and using force excessively and 
disproportionately.  In my view such action constituted unlawful collective punishment of the 
people of Gaza. 
 
11. My report on Gaza (A/HRC/4/17) ran to 10 pages and 17 paragraphs.  It presented a full 
picture of the events of June to November 2006 in Gaza and the consequences of these events. 
 
12. I am the Special Rapporteur on the <i>situation</i> of human rights in the occupied Palestinian 
territories.  In this capacity, I report on the overall situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory 
without attempting to investigate or resolve any factual dispute.  I am not a one-person fact-
finding mission.  Consequently, the above report raises questions about Israel&#8217;s justification for 
the shelling of the Beit Hanoun home, in which 19 persons died, and states that &#8220;it seems clear 
that the indiscriminate firing of shells into a civilian neighbourhood with no apparent military 
objective constituted a war crime&#8221;, but it makes no attempt to pronounce definitively upon the 
factual dispute whether the shelling was the result of a &#8220;technical failure&#8221;, as maintained by 
Israel.  The line between situation-reporting and fact-finding is admittedly not absolutely clear.  </p>

 <p> 
Thus there is substance in the statement by the Israeli Ambassador, Itzhak Levanon, on 22 March 
2007 in the Human Rights Council that I have already reported on the subject covered by 
resolution S-1/1 and that the Human Rights Council has already considered it.  It is difficult not 
to agree with the Israeli Ambassador that the purpose of resolution S-1/1 &#8220;has already been 
effectively realized&#8221;. 
</p><p> 
13. Despite my report to the Human Rights Council on 22 March 2007, the Human Rights 
Council on 27 March adopted resolution 4/2 calling for the implementation of resolution S-1/1.  
By the time I received notice of this resolution I had already made plans to visit the Occupied 
Palestinian Territory on 27 May in my capacity as Special Rapporteur.  For the purpose I had 
already written to the Israeli Ambassador informing him of my visit, expressing the expectation 
that no obstacles would be placed in the way of my visit, and assuring him that &#8220;I shall not be 
visiting in pursuance of resolution S-1/1&#8221; but in my capacity as Special Rapporteur.  In the light 
of this assurance I informed the President of the Council that &#8220;as a man of his word, I cannot 
renege on this assurance&#8221; by going to the OPT under the terms of resolution S-1/1.  
(Subsequently, I had to cancel this mission as a result of the fact that I suffered a heart attack on 
29 April and was placed under doctor&#8217;s orders not to travel.) 
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>14. In my view the mission contemplated is obsolete and impractical for the following 
reasons: 
</p>
<p>(a) The events that resolution S-1/1 instructed me to investigate have passed into recent 
history and been overtaken by other events.  For instance, the destruction of the Gaza power 
plant on 27 June was to be a major focus of investigation.  Today the power plant has been 
substantially repaired.  Any investigative mission visiting Gaza at present would therefore 
examine other more pressing problems &#8211; such as recent air strikes on Gaza; 
</p>
<p>(b) The events that I was expected to report on have already been reported on in my 
report on Gaza.  There would be little to add to this report; 
</p>
<p>(c) Resolution S-1/1 was seriously flawed by reason of its failure to contain a reporting 
obligation &#8211; unlike resolution 3/1 establishing the mission to be led by Archbishop Tutu.  
Consequently, opponents of resolution S-1/1 might legitimately argue that any report in terms of 
the resolution was <i>ultra vires</i> the resolution; 
</p>
<p>(d) The present security situation in Gaza precludes the implementation of resolution S-
1/1.  I have been informed by United Nations Security that no visits to Gaza have been permitted 
for some time and that it is unlikely that they will be permitted in the foreseeable future;   
</p>
<p>(e) There is no prospect that the Government of Israel will consent to a mission under 
resolution S-1/1.   
</p>
<p> 
</p><p>15. For the above reasons, I recommend that the Human Rights Council accept that the 
mission contemplated by resolution S-1/1 has not been implemented and cannot be implemented.  
Moreover no purpose would be served by carrying out such a mission a year after the events in 
question and after a full report has already been made by the Special Rapporteur in his capacity 
as Special Rapporteur.   
 
16. I urge the Human Rights Council in future to seriously consider the wisdom of sending 
someone who is already a Special Rapporteur on a fact-finding mission to the State in respect on 
which he or she is Special Rapporteur.  In most circumstances, the Special Rapporteur will have 
a difficult relationship with that State, which will be exacerbated by requiring him or her to lead 
a fact-finding mission to the State in question.  This may lead the State to place obstacles in the </p>

 <p></p>
<p> 
way of future visits by the Special Rapporteur. 
</p><p> 
17. I regret that my health prevents me from reporting to the Human Rights Council in 
person.  I trust, however, that the present report provides a full explanation why resolution S-1/1 
cannot be implemented and why the Human Rights Council should move on and concentrate on 
more pressing violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the Occupied Palestinian 
Territory, such as air strikes in Gaza; military incursions into the West Bank and Gaza; the arrest 
of Palestinian cabinet ministers, mayors and legislators; the continued expansion of settlements; 
the construction of the Wall; the terrorization of Palestinians in Hebron; the de facto annexation 
of the Jordan Valley; and the system of checkpoints.  There is also the question of what action is 
to be taken to promote respect for human rights in the OPT.  As suggested in my report 
(A/HRC/4/17), a request for a further Advisory Opinion from the International Court of Justice 
on the legal consequences for the occupied people, the Occupying Power and third States of 40 
years of occupation might be one method of promoting human rights.  Another is an appeal to 
the Quartet (European Union, Russian Federation, United States of America, and the United 
Nations) to concern itself more with human rights in its quest for a peaceful settlement in the 
region.  Attention to matters of this kind would, in my opinion, best serve the interests and 
advance the human rights of the Palestinian people.
