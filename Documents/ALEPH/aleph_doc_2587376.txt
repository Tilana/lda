Overview
DIAMONDBACK ENERGY, INC.
We are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition, development, exploration
and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. This
basin, which is one of the major producing basins in the United States, is characterized by an extensive production
history, a favorable operating environment, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons,
enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators.
We began operations in December 2007 with our acquisition of 4,134 net acres with production at the time of
acquisition of approximately 800 net barrels of oil equivalent, or BOE, per day from 34 gross (16.8 net) wells in the
Permian Basin. Subsequently, we acquired approximately 26,875 additional net acres, which brought our total net
acreage position in the Permian Basin to 31,009 net acres at June 30, 2012 and, after giving effect to the Transactions,
we had 51,623 net acres. We are the operator of approximately 99% of this acreage. As of June 30, 2012, after giving
effect to the Transactions, we had drilled 159 gross (147 net) wells, and participated in an additional 15 gross (six net)
non-operated wells, in the Permian Basin. Of these 174 gross wells, 160 were completed as producing wells and 14 are
in various stages of completion. In the aggregate, as of June 30, 2012, we held interests in 194 gross (177 net)
producing wells in the Permian Basin.
Our activities are primarily focused on the Clearfork, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Cline, Strawn and Atoka formations, which
we refer to collectively as the Wolfberry play. The Wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural
gas, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production history, long-lived reserves and high drilling
success rates. The Wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the Spraberry play, the majority of which is
designated in the Spraberry trend area field. According to the U.S.
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
1
Energy Information Administration, the Spraberry trend area ranks as the second largest oilfield in the United States,
based on 2009 reserves.
As of December 31, 2011, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves, pro forma for the Transactions, were
39,460 MBOE based on reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott Company L.P., or Ryder Scott, our independent reserve
engineers. Of these reserves, approximately 21.7% are classified as proved developed producing, or PDP. Proved
undeveloped, or PUD, reserves included in this estimate are from 329 gross well locations on 40-acre spacing. As of
December 31, 2011, these proved reserves were approximately 66% oil, 20% natural gas liquids and 14% natural gas.
We have 925 identified potential vertical drilling locations on 40-acre spacing based on our evaluation of applicable
geologic and engineering data and we have an additional 1,122 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on
20-acre downspacing. These identified potential drilling locations do not include any potential horizontal drilling
locations. We intend to grow our reserves and production through development drilling, exploitation and exploration
activities on this multi-year project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that
meet our strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves. Our estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs,
from future PUD wells on 40-acre spacing, as estimated by Ryder Scott, range from 102 MBOE per well, consisting of 46
MBbls of oil, 143 MMcf of natural gas and 32 MBbls of natural gas liquids, to 158 MBOE per well, consisting of 112
MBbls of oil, 113 MMcf of natural gas and 27 MBbls of natural gas liquids, with an average EUR per well of 135 MBOE,
consisting of 93 MBbls of oil, 102 MMcf of natural gas and 25 MBbls of natural gas liquids. We also intend to continue
to refine our drilling pattern and completion techniques in an effort to increase our average EUR per well from vertical
wells drilled on 40-acre spacing. We currently anticipate a reduction of approximately 20% in our EURs from vertical
wells drilled on 20-acre spacing. Our 2012 drilling plan currently contemplates drilling 58 gross (54 net) vertical wells
on 40-acre spacing and two gross (two net) horizontal wells in the Wolfberry play. As of June 30, 2012, we were using
three drilling rigs and, upon completion of this offering, intend to increase our drilling program to six or seven rigs.
We believe the experience gained from our historical drilling programs and the information obtained from the results of
extensive industry drilling activity in the Permian Basin have helped us reduce the risk and uncertainity associated with
drilling vertical wells on our Permian Basin acreage. We intend to supplement our vertical development drilling activity
with horizontal wells targeting various intervals in the Wolfberry play. Our horizontal drilling program is intended to
further capture the upside potential that may exist on our properties and increase our well performance and recoveries
as compared to drilling vertical wells alone.
During 2011, we assembled a new executive team and, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011, this team assumed
management control of our operations and development activities in the Permian Basin. With an average of
approximately 24 years of industry experience per person, this team has extensive experience in the Permian Basin as
well as other resource plays in North America, including significant experience in drilling and completing horizontal
wells. Under the direction of our new executive team, the average drilling time required to reach total depth, or TD, was
shortened by 25% to 15 days during the fourth quarter of 2011 from 20 days during the second quarter of 2011, and our
average gross well cost (including drilling and completion cost) was reduced from $2.6 million during the second
quarter of 2011 to $2.5 million during the first quarter of 2012. We also reduced the time from spud to production from
an average of 68 days during the fourth quarter of 2011 to an average of 50 days during the first quarter of 2012. During
the quarter ended June 30, 2012, our average daily production, pro forma for the Transactions, was 3,637 BOE/d,
consisting of 2,579 Bbls/d of oil, 2,757 Mcf/d of natural gas and 599 Bbls/d of natural gas liquids, an increase of 13%, or
409 BOE/d, from 3,229 BOE/d, consisting of 2,365 Bbls/d of oil, 2,267 Mcf/d of natural gas and 486 Bbls/d of natural gas
liquids, for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. This increase was due primarily to improved strategies and procedures
introduced by our new executive team relating to wellbore configuration, completion, execution, fluid recovery and well
pumping practices that significantly reduced the level of required well remediation and the associated loss of
production. We anticipate further increases in efficiencies as our new executive team executes on our development
strategies across our acreage base.

(3) During June 2012.
We currently anticipate our 2012 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure will be approximately $140.0 million to
$150.0 million after giving effect to the Transactions. Of this amount, we plan to spend approximately $116.0 million on
the drilling and completion of 58 gross (54 net) operated vertical wells and two gross (two net) horizontal wells,
$10.5 million for the drilling and completion of nine gross (three net) non-operated wells, $8.0 million for leasehold
acquisitions and $6.0 million for the construction of infrastructure to support production, including investments in
water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects. During the six months ended June 30, 2012, our aggregate
capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure after giving effect to the Transactions were $70.7 million.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to increase stockholder value through the following:
•
Grow production and reserves by developing our oil-rich resource base. We intend to actively drill and develop
our acreage base in an effort to maximize its value and resource potential. Through the conversion of our undeveloped
reserves to developed reserves, we will seek to increase our production, reserves and cash flow while generating
favorable returns on invested capital. As of June 30, 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had 925
identified potential vertical drilling locations on our acreage in the Permian Basin based on 40-acre spacing and an
additional 1,122 such locations based on 20-acre downspacing. We believe the drilling of these locations will provide
us with the critical subsurface data necessary to target potential horizontal horizons. Our 2012 drilling plan currently
contemplates drilling 58 gross (54 net) vertical wells and two gross (two net) horizontal wells in the Wolfberry play. We
ended 2011 with a two rig drilling program which we increased to four drilling rigs in 2012. As of June 30, 2012, we
were using three drilling rigs. Upon completion of this offering, we intend to increase our drilling program to six or
seven rigs. Subject to market conditions and rig availability, we expect to operate up to eight rigs in the first half of
2013, which we expect will allow us to significantly increase our drilling program in 2013.
•
Focus on increasing hydrocarbon recovery through horizontal drilling and increased well density. We believe
there are opportunities to target various intervals in the Wolfberry play with horizontal wells and we currently plan to
drill two gross (two net) horizontal wells in 2012 to target these producing horizons. Our first horizontal well was
completed in Upton County in June 2012 with a 4,000 foot lateral and a 30-day average initial production rate of 486
BOE/d. Our horizontal drilling program is designed to further capture the upside potential that may exist on our
properties. We also

•
believe our horizontal drilling program may significantly increase our recoveries per section as compared to drilling
vertical wells alone. Horizontal drilling may also be economical in areas where vertical drilling is currently not
economical or logistically viable. In addition, we believe increased well density opportunities may exist across our
acreage base. We closely monitor industry trends with respect to higher well density, which could increase the
recovery factor per section and enhance returns since infrastructure is typically in place.
Leverage our experience operating in the Permian Basin. Our executive team, which has an average of
approximately 24 years of industry experience per person and significant experience in the Permian Basin, intends to
continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by refining and enhancing our drilling and completion
techniques. The time to reach TD for our vertical Wolfberry wells decreased from an average of 20 days during the
second quarter of 2011 to an average of 15 days during the fourth quarter of 2011, resulting in a lower total well cost.
Our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques, and the resulting reduction in time to reach TD, is an
important part of the continuous drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential
drilling locations. In addition, we believe that the experience of our new executive team in deviated and horizontal
drilling and completions should help reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths.
Additionally, our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate hydraulic fracturing practices that may
potentially increase recovery and reduce completion costs. Our executive team regularly evaluates our operating
results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance against the best
performing operators and evaluate and adopt best practices.
Enhance returns through our low cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation and
continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies. In the current commodity price environment, our oil
and liquids rich asset base provides attractive returns. Our acreage position in the Wolfberry play is generally in
contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes
advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities. We are the operator of
approximately 99% of our acreage. This operational control allows us to more efficiently manage the pace of
development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production and control operating costs and technical
applications, including horizontal development. Our average 86.2% working interest in our acreage pro forma for the
Transactions allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these expected improvements and cost efficiencies.
Pursue strategic acquisitions with exceptional resource potential. We have a proven history of acquiring
•
•
Pursue strategic acquisitions with exceptional resource potential. We have a proven history of acquiring
leasehold positions in the Permian Basin that have substantial oil-weighted resource potential and can achieve
attractive returns on invested capital. Our executive team, with its extensive experience in the Permian Basin, has
what we believe is a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets and a proven ability to evaluate resource
potential. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets.
Maintain Financial flexibility. We seek to maintain a conservative financial position. After giving effect to this
offering and the use of proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit
facility, we will have $90.0 million of available borrowing capacity under such facility. We expect that we will fund our
capital development plans for 2012 from our operating cash flow, proceeds from this offering and borrowings under our
revolving credit facility.
Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals:
•
Oil rich resource base in one of North America’s leading resource plays. All of our leasehold acreage is located
in one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Permian Basin in West Texas. As
4
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
of June 15, 2012, the Baker Hughes Rig Count survey reported that there were 453 rigs drilling in the Permian Basin.
The majority of our current properties are well positioned in the core of the Wolfberry play. We believe that our
historical vertical development success will be complemented with horizontal drilling locations that could ultimately
translate into an increased recovery factor on a per section basis. Our production was approximately 74% oil, 15%
natural gas liquids and 11% natural gas for both the six months ended June 30, 2012 and the year ended December
31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, after giving effect to the Transactions, our estimated net proved reserves were
comprised of approximately 66% oil and 20% natural gas liquids. This oil and liquids exposure allows us to benefit
from their currently more favorable prices as compared to natural gas.
•
Multi-year drilling inventory in one of North America’s leading oil resource plays. We have identified a multi-
year inventory of potential drilling locations for our oil-weighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and
return opportunities. As of June 30, 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had 925 identified potential
vertical drilling locations based on 40-acre spacing and an additional 1,122 identified potential vertical drilling locations
based on 20-acre downspacing. In 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we anticipate drilling 58 gross (54 net)
vertical operated wells, which represent only approximately 6.2% of our identified potential vertical drilling locations on
40-acre spacing at June 30, 2012. We also believe that there are a significant number of horizontal locations that
could be drilled on our acreage. We expect to drill two gross (two net) horizontal operated wells during 2012 targeting
three different producing horizons. Management currently estimates that EURs for our horizontal wells will be
approximately 400 MBOE. In addition, the liquids rich natural gas component of our inventory adds value with Btu
content ranging from 1,225 MMBtu to 1,528 MMBtu and our June 2012 natural gas liquids yield was 118 Bbls/MMcf.
In addition, we have approximately 117 square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic data covering our acreage. This data
facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity,
including horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions.
•
Experienced, incentivized and proven management team. Our new executive team has an average of
approximately 24 years of industry experience per person, most of which is focused on resource play development.
This team has a proven track record of executing on multi-rig development drilling programs and extensive experience
in the Permian Basin. In addition, our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing
horizontal wells as well as horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise, which will be of strategic importance as we
expand our future development plans to include horizontal drilling. Prior to joining us, our Chief Executive Officer held
management positions at Apache Corporation, Laredo Petroleum Holdings, Inc. and Burlington Resources.
Favorable and stable operating environment. We have focused our drilling and development operations in the
Permian Basin, one of the oldest hydrocarbon basins in the United States, with a long and well-established production
history and developed infrastructure. With approximately 380,000 wells drilled in the Permian Basin since the 1940s,
we believe that the geological and regulatory environment is more stable and predictable, and that we are faced with
less operational risks, in the Permian Basin as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins.
High degree of operational control. We are the operator of approximately 99% of our Permian Basin acreage. This
operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost
efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques,
completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes. Additionally, as the operator of substantially all of our
acreage, we retain the ability to adjust our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks. This
operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects.

Financial flexibility to fund expansion. Upon the completion of this offering, we will have a conservative balance
sheet. We will seek to maintain financial flexibility to allow us to actively develop our drilling, exploitation and
exploration activities in the Wolfberry play and maximize the present value of our oil-weighted resource potential. After
giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding borrowings under our
revolving credit facility, we will have $90.0 million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.
We expect that our borrowing base will be increased as a result of the Transactions.
Risk Factors
Investing in our common stock involves risks that include the speculative nature of oil and natural gas exploration,
competition, volatile oil and natural gas prices and other material factors. You should read carefully the section of this
prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” beginning on page 17 for an explanation of these risks before investing in our

Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material
inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present
values of our reserves.
Our producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated
with a concentration of operations in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves
attributable to a small number of producing horizons within this area.
We depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. The loss of
one or more of these purchasers could limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural gas we produce.
Our operations are subject to various governmental regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and
expensive.
Any failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to hydraulic
fracturing, could result in governmental authorities taking actions that adversely affect our operations and financial
condition.
•
Our operations are subject to operational hazards for which we may not be adequately insured.
•
•
Our failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate future acquisitions of properties or businesses could
reduce our earnings and slow our growth.
Our largest stockholder controls a significant percentage of our common stock and its interests may conflict with
yours.

The Transactions
On May 7, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Gulfport in which Gulfport agreed to sell to us all of its oil and
natural gas properties in the Permian Basin in exchange for (i)                      shares of our common stock, which will
represent 35% of our outstanding common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering and (ii) approximately
$63.6 million in the form of a non-interest bearing promissory note, which we refer to as the Gulfport transaction note,
that will be repaid in full upon the closing of this offering with a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. We are
the operator of the acreage to be acquired by us from Gulfport. The aggregate consideration payable to Gulfport is
subject to a post-closing cash adjustment and will be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the difference
between $118.1 million and the “final capital amount,” divided by 65% and then multiplied by 35%. For purposes of our
agreement with Gulfport, “final capital amount” means Windsor Permian’s (a) total current assets, consisting of cash,
trade accounts receivable (net of an allowance for doubtful accounts), inventory, prepaid expenses, other current assets
and other assets, less (b) total current liabilities, consisting of trade accounts payable, accounts payable to related
parties, accrued capital and other expenses, long-term debt and asset retirement obligations, in each case as of the
closing date of the transaction. Accordingly, for purposes of illustration only, if the final capital amount is $110.0
million, we would owe Gulfport an additional approximately $4.4 million and if the final capital amount is $125.0
million, Gulfport would owe us approximately $3.7 million. Gulfport’s obligation to complete this transaction is
contingent upon, among other things, the contribution to us of all the outstanding equity interests in Windsor Permian
and Gulfport’s satisfaction with the terms of this offering. In connection with this transaction, we will grant Gulfport the
right, for so long as Gulfport beneficially owns more than 10% of our outstanding common stock, to designate one
individual as a nominee to serve on our board of directors. We will also grant Gulfport certain demand and
“piggyback” registration rights obligating us to register with the SEC the shares of our common stock owned by
Gulfport. For more information regarding the Gulfport transaction, see “Management—Our Board of Directors and
Committees,” “Related Party Transactions—Gulfport Transaction and Investor Rights Agreement” and “Shares Eligible
for Future Sale—Registration Rights” beginning on pages 116, 131 and 142, respectively, of this prospectus.
In addition, our equity sponsor, Wexford, has agreed to cause all of the outstanding equity interests in Windsor UT
LLC, or Windsor UT, to be contributed to Windsor Permian before the completion of the Gulfport transaction described
above. Windsor UT was formed in April 2010 and acquired 4,978 gross (2,489 net) acres in the Permian Basin, of which
we are the operator. The other 2,489 net acres are owned by Gulfport and will be transferred to us in the Gulfport
transaction. Five wells have been drilled on this acreage as of June 30, 2012, which acreage contains 120 of our
identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 40-acre spacing.
We refer to Gulfport’s sale of properties to us as the Gulfport transaction and we refer to the Gulfport transaction
together with the contribution to Windsor Permian of all the equity interests in Windsor UT as the Transactions.
Our Equity Sponsor
We were formed by our equity sponsor, Wexford Capital LP, or Wexford, which is a Greenwich, Connecticut-based
SEC-registered investment advisor with over $5.5 billion under management as of December 31, 2011. Wexford has
made public and private equity investments in many different sectors and has particular expertise in the energy and
natural resources sector. Upon completion of this offering, Wexford will beneficially own approximately     % of our
common stock (approximately     % if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full). As a
result, Wexford will continue to be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of directors, changes to our

organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. Prior to the closing of this offering, we will enter into
an advisory services agreement with Wexford under which Wexford will provide us with financial and strategic advisory
services related to our business. We are also party to certain other agreements with Wexford and its affiliates. For a
description of the advisory services agreement and other agreements with Wexford and its affiliates, see “Related Party
Transactions” beginning on page 131. Although our management believes that the terms of these related party
agreements are reasonable, it is possible that we could have negotiated more favorable terms for such transactions
with unrelated third parties. The existence of these related party agreements may give Wexford the ability to further
influence and maintain control over many matters affecting us.
Our History
Diamondback Energy, Inc. was incorporated on December 30, 2011 in Delaware as a holding company and will not
conduct any material business operations prior to the transaction described below. All of our historical assets,
operations and results described in this prospectus are those of Windsor Permian LLC, or Windsor Permian. Windsor
Permian is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diamondback Energy LLC, which is an entity controlled by our equity
sponsor, Wexford. Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, Wexford
will cause Diamondback Energy LLC to be merged with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Diamondback Energy,
Inc. will continue as the surviving entity. Immediately after the merger and prior to the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part, Gulfport will complete the Gulfport transaction. Upon completion of these
Transactions, Wexford and Gulfport will beneficially own 65% and 35%, respectively, of our outstanding common
stock. Upon completion of the offering, Wexford and Gulfport will beneficially own approximately     % and     %,
respectively, of our common stock (approximately     % and     %, respectively, if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full).
As of April 30, 2012, Windsor Permian held a 22% interest in Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC, or Bison, and a
33% interest in Muskie Holdings LLC, or Muskie. Bison owns drilling rigs and various oil and natural gas well
servicing equipment and performs drilling and field services for us. Muskie owns certain assets, real estate and rights
in a lease for land that is prospective for oil and natural gas fracture grade sand. Windsor Permian’s interests in Bison
and Muskie were distributed to Windsor Permian’s sole member in June 2012 so we may focus our activities on our oil
and natural gas exploration and development activities. We recorded revenues of $0.8 million and $1.5 million
attributable to Bison in our consolidated statements of operations during 2010 and the first quarter of 2011,
respectively. Muskie was formed in 2011, and we recorded a loss from equity method investments of $7,017 for 2011.
The interests in Bison and Muskie are reflected in “Investments-equity method” on our consolidated balance sheets.
For additional information regarding Bison and Muskie, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements” and “Related Party Transactions” beginning on pages 52 and 131, respectively, of this prospectus and
Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.

Emerging Growth Company
We are an ‘‘emerging growth company’’ within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For as long as we are an
emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the requirements that are applicable to other public
companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with
the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations
regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the
requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until
we are no longer an emerging growth company. For a description of the qualifications and other requirements
applicable to emerging growth companies and certain elections that we have made due to our status as an emerging
growth company, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to this Offering and our Common Stock – We are an ‘emerging
growth company’ and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth
companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors” on page 40 of this prospectus.

shares
Option to purchase additional shares
We have granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an
aggregate of              additional shares of our common stock.
Use of proceeds
We expect to receive approximately $         million of net proceeds from the
sale of the common stock offered by us, based upon the assumed initial public
offering price of $         per share (the midpoint of the price range set forth on
the cover page of this prospectus), after deducting underwriting discounts and
estimated offering expenses (or approximately $         million if the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full). At the
closing of this offering, we will use approximately $         million of the net
proceeds to repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit
facility, $63.6 million to repay the Gulfport transaction note and $        
million to repay outstanding borrowings under our subordinated note
with an affiliate of Wexford. The remaining net proceeds of approximately
$         million (or approximately $         million if the underwriters’ option
to purchase additional shares is exercised in full), will be used to fund a
portion of our exploration and development activities and for general
corporate purposes, which may include leasehold interest and property
acquisitions, working capital and the settlement of crude oil swaps. See
“Use of Proceeds” on page 45 of this prospectus.
We currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance
the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash
dividends in the foreseeable future.

(1) Diamondback Energy, Inc. was incorporated on December 30, 2011 in Delaware as a holding company and will not conduct
any material business operations prior to the transaction described below. Our historical consolidated financial statements
and other financial information included in this prospectus pertain to assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Windsor
Permian LLC, which is an entity controlled by our equity sponsor, Wexford. Windsor Permian LLC was treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a result, essentially all of Windsor Permian LLC’s taxable earnings and
losses were passed through to Wexford, and Windsor Permian LLC did not pay federal income taxes at the entity level.
Prior to the completion of this offering, Windsor Permian LLC will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and, because we
are a subchapter C corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, the earnings at Windsor Permian LLC will become
subject to federal income tax. For comparative purposes, we have included pro forma financial data to give effect to
income taxes assuming the earnings at Windsor Permian LLC had been subject to federal income tax as a subchapter C
corporation in all periods presented in the accompanying table. If the earnings at Windsor Permian LLC had been subject to
federal income tax as a subchapter C corporation during the periods presented herein, we would have incurred net
operating losses for income tax purposes in each period presented. We would have been in a net deferred tax asset, or
DTA, position as a result of such tax losses and would have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce each period’s DTA
balance to zero. A valuation allowance to reduce each period’s DTA would have resulted in an equal and offsetting credit
for the respective expenses or an equal and offsetting debit for the respective benefits for income taxes, with the resulting
tax expenses for each of the above periods of zero. The unaudited pro forma data is presented for informational purposes
only, and does not purport to project our results of operations for any future period or our financial position as of any future
date.
(2) Unaudited historical pro forma basic and diluted income (loss) per share will be presented for the latest fiscal year and
interim period on the basis of the aggregate number of shares to be issued to DB Holdings in connection with the merger of
Diamondback Energy LLC with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc., upon determination of the number of those shares.

Summary Historical and Pro Forma Reserve Data
The following table sets forth estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2011 on a
historical basis and on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred as of December
31, 2011. Our historical reserves and the historical reserves attributable to the Windsor UT properties and the properties
subject to the Gulfport transaction have been prepared in each case as of December 31, 2011 by Ryder Scott, an
independent petroleum engineering firm, in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. Copies of these reserve

(1) Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2011 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic
average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the 12-month period
ended December 31, 2011, in accordance with revised SEC guidelines applicable to reserves estimates as of the end of
2011. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any
value for unproved undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, development
expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from
these estimates.

RISK FACTORS
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks
and all of the other information contained in this prospectus before deciding to invest in our common stock. Our
business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.
The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we
currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect us.
Risks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business
Our business is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history.
We were incorporated in Delaware on December 30, 2011. All of our historical oil and natural gas assets, operations
and results described in this prospectus are currently those of Windsor Permian, which is an entity controlled by our
equity sponsor, Wexford. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus
is a part, Windsor Permian will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and we will acquire the oil and gas assets of
Gulfport located in the Permian Basin in the Gulfport transaction. The oil and natural gas properties of Windsor
Permian, Gulfport and Windsor UT described in this prospectus have been acquired by Windsor Permian, Gulfport and
Windsor UT since December 2007. As a result, there is only limited historical financial and operating information
available upon which to base your evaluation of our performance.
We may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and
results of operations.
As a recently-formed company, growth in accordance with our business plan, if achieved, could place a significant
strain on our financial, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities and increase the
number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on our financial,
technical, operational and management resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative,
operating and financial control systems or the occurrences of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure
to recruit and retain experienced managers, geologists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas
industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our
ability to timely execute our business plan.
Approximately 86% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or
become commercially productive, which could cause us to lose rights under our leases as well as have a material
adverse effect on our oil and natural gas reserves and future production and, therefore, our future cash flow and
income.
Approximately 86% of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or
completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas regardless of
whether such acreage contains proved reserves. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill
wells that are commercially productive, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells, we could lose our rights
under such leases. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flow and
income are highly dependent on successfully developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.
Our development and exploration operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital
or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural
gas reserves.
The oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital
expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for and development, production and acquisition of oil
and natural gas reserves. In 2011, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
17
leasehold interest and property acquisitions, drilling, seismic and infrastructure, were approximately $75.4 million. Our
2012 capital budget for drilling, completion and infrastructure, including investments in water disposal infrastructure
and gathering line projects, is estimated to be approximately $140.0 million to $150.0 million after giving effect to the
Transactions. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with funding from Wexford, our equity sponsor,
borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash generated by operations. However, neither Wexford nor any of
its affiliates has made any commitment to provide us additional funding. Notwithstanding prior contributions and loans
to us by Wexford or its affiliates, you should not assume that any of them will provide any debt or equity funding to us
in the future.
In the near term, we intend to finance our capital expenditures with cash flow from operations, proceeds from this
offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital are
subject to a number of variables, including:
•
our proved reserves;
•
the volume of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells;
•
the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold; and
•
our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.
We cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to
maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures. Further, our actual capital expenditures in 2012 could exceed
our capital expenditure budget. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the
amount of capital we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include
traditional reserve base borrowings, debt financing, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, sales
of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain
debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all.
If we are unable to fund our capital requirements, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the
exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline
in our oil and natural gas reserves, or may be otherwise unable to implement our development plan, complete
acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which
could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations. In addition, a delay in or
the failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies and
related cost savings.
Our success depends on finding, developing or acquiring additional reserves.
Our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are
economically recoverable. Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that
we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, or both.
To increase reserves and production, we undertake development, exploration and other replacement activities or use
third parties to accomplish these activities. We have made and expect to make in the future substantial capital
expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production, exploration and acquisition of oil and
natural gas reserves. We may not have sufficient resources to undertake our exploration, development and production
activities or the acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves, our exploratory projects or other replacement activities may
not result in significant additional reserves and we may not have success drilling productive wells at low finding and
development costs. Furthermore, although our revenues may increase if prevailing oil and natural gas prices increase
significantly, our finding costs for additional reserves could also increase.
Our project areas, which are in various stages of development, may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable
quantities.
Our project areas are in various stages of development, ranging from project areas with current drilling or production
activity to project areas that consist of recently acquired leasehold acreage or that have limited drilling or production
history. From inception through June 30, 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we drilled a total of 159 gross
wells and participated in an additional 15 gross non-operated wells, of which 160
18
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
wells were completed as producing wells and 14 wells were in various stages of completion. If the wells in the process
of being completed do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit or if we drill dry holes in the future, our
business may be materially affected.
Our identified potential drilling locations, which are part of our anticipated future drilling plans, are susceptible to
uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.
As of June 30, 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had 925 identified potential vertical drilling locations on
our existing acreage based on 40-acre spacing and an additional 1,122 identified potential vertical drilling locations
based on 20-acre downspacing. Only 309 of these identified potential vertical drilling locations were attributed to
proved reserves. These drilling locations, including those without proved undeveloped reserves, represent a significant
part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties,
including the availability of capital, construction of infrastructure, inclement weather, regulatory changes and
approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs and drilling results. Further, our identified potential drilling locations are in
various stages of evaluation, ranging from locations that are ready to drill to locations that will require substantial
additional interpretation. We cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location
will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable
or whether wells drilled on 20-acre downspacing will produce at the same rates as those on 40-acre spacing. The use of
technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to
drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or, if present, whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient
quantities to be economically viable. Even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist, we may damage the
potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing
the well, possibly resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well. If we drill additional
wells that we identify as dry holes in our current and future drilling locations, our drilling success rate may decline and
materially harm our business. We cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells,
more fully explored locations or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling locations. Further, initial production
rates reported by us or other operators in the Permian Basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production
rates. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be
drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such,
our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our
business.
Our acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, generally within three to five years, in order to hold the acreage by
production. In a highly competitive market for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells to hold acreage may result in a
substantial lease renewal cost, or if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.
Leases on oil and natural gas properties typically have a term of three to five years, after which they expire unless,
prior to expiration, production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres. As of June 30,
2012 after giving effect to the Transactions, we had leases representing 361 net acres expiring in 2012, 222 net acres
expiring in 2013, 2,065 net acres expiring in 2014, 17,846 net acres expiring in 2015 and 7,133 net acres expiring in 2016.
The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on
commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in
capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations.
In addition, in order to hold our current leases expiring in 2014 and 2015, we will need to operate at least a four-rig
program. We cannot assure you that we will have the liquidity to deploy these rigs in this time frame, or that
commodity prices will warrant operating such a drilling program. Any such losses of leases could materially and
adversely affect the growth of our asset basis, cash flows and results of operations.

The volatility of oil and natural gas prices due to factors beyond our control greatly affects our profitability.
Our revenues, operating results, profitability, future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas
properties depend primarily upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. Historically, oil and natural gas prices
have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty
and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, including:
•
the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;
•
the level of prices and expectations about future prices of oil and natural gas;
•
the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production;
•
the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;
•
the price of foreign imports;
•
•
political and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and
Russia;
the ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and
production controls;
•
speculative trading in crude oil and natural gas derivative contracts;
•
the level of consumer product demand;
•
weather conditions and other natural disasters;
•
risks associated with operating drilling rigs;
•
technological advances affecting energy consumption;
•
domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes;
•
the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the
Middle East;
•
proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities;
•
the price and availability of alternative fuels; and
•
overall domestic and global economic conditions.
These factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas
price movements with any certainty. For example, during the past five years, the posted price for West Texas
intermediate light sweet crude oil, which we refer to as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, has ranged from a low of
$30.28 per barrel, or Bbl, in December 2008 to a high of $145.31 per Bbl in July 2008. The Henry Hub spot market price
of natural gas has ranged from a low of $1.82 per million British thermal units, or MMBtu, in April 2012 to a high of
$13.31 per MMBtu in July 2008. During 2011, West Texas Intermediate prices ranged from $75.40 to $113.39 per Bbl and
the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged from $2.84 to $4.92 per MMBtu. On June 29, 2012, the West
Texas Intermediate posted price for crude oil was $89.04 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas
was $2.74 per MMBtu. Any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse
effect on our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas
reserves. In addition, lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can
produce economically. This may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated
proved reserves. If this occurs or if our production estimates change or our exploration or development results
deteriorate, full cost accounting rules may require us to write down, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying
value of our oil and natural gas properties.

We have entered into price swap derivatives and may in the future enter into forward sale contracts or additional price
swap derivatives for a portion of our production, which may result in our making cash payments or prevent us from
receiving the full benefit of increases in prices for oil and gas.
We use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales. Under these swap
contracts, we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty
based on New York Mercantile Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price
payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. For the purpose of locking-in the value of
a swap, we enter into counter-swaps from time to time. Under the counter-swap, we receive a floating price for the
hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter-swap is effective in locking-in the value of a
swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the
market value of the counter-swap.
In December 2007, we placed a swap contract covering 1,680,000 Bbls of crude oil for the period from January 2008 to
December 2012 at various fixed prices. In April 2008, we entered into a series of counter-swaps to lock-in the value of
certain of these swaps settling 1,188,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. In June 2009, we entered into an additional series of
counter-swaps to lock-in the value of the remaining swaps settling 324,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. Locking in the
value of our swaps with counter-swaps, without entering into new swaps, exposes us to commodity price risks on the
originally swapped position. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, all of our swap contracts were locked-in with counter
swaps. In October 2011, we placed a swap contract covering 1,000 Bbls per day of crude oil for the period from
January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2013 at a price of $78.50 per barrel in 2012 and $80.55 per barrel in 2013. Such
contracts and any future hedging arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances,
including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase. In addition, these arrangements may
limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of
changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments.
Our hedging transactions expose us to counterparty credit risk.
Our hedging transactions expose us to risk of financial loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a derivative
contract. Disruptions in the financial markets could lead to sudden decreases in a counterparty’s liquidity, which could
make them unable to perform under the terms of the derivative contract and we may not be able to realize the benefit of
the derivative contract.
The inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.
In addition to credit risk related to receivables from commodity derivative contracts, our principal exposure to credit
risk is through receivables from joint interest owners on properties we operate (approximately $10.4 million at June 30,
2012) and receivables from purchasers of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $4.8 million at June 30,
2012). Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These
entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. We are
generally unable to control which co-owners participate in our wells.
We are also subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant
customers. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, three purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue:
Plains Marketing, L.P. (63%); Andrews Oil Buyers, Inc. (13%); and Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. (12%). For the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, one purchaser, Windsor Midstream LLC, an entity controlled by Wexford, our
equity sponsor, accounted for approximately 78% and 81% of our revenue, respectively. For the year ended
December 31, 2009, two purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Windsor Midstream LLC (68%) and
DCP Midstream, LP (14%). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. This
concentration of customers may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by
changes in economic and other conditions. Current economic
Table of Contents

21
circumstances may further increase these risks. We do not require our customers to post collateral. The inability or
failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency
or liquidation may materially adversely affect our financial results.
Our method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value.
We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. Accordingly, all
costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the
costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. We also
capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment. All
general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to drilling activities are expensed as incurred. Sales or other
dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or
loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change. Income from services provided to
working interest owners of properties in which we also own an interest, to the extent they exceed related costs
incurred, are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties. Depletion of evaluated
oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved reserves. The average
depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was $24.22 and $26.72 for the six months ended June 30, 2012
and 2011, respectively, and $25.40, $17.78 and $11.21 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties for the six months
ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 was $10.0 million and $7.3 million, respectively, and for the years ended December 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009 was $15.2 million, $7.4 million and $3.2 million, respectively.
The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which
the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent
capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization
and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess
capitalized costs are charged to expense. Beginning December 31, 2009, we have used the unweighted arithmetic
average first day of the month price for oil and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in
estimating discounted future net revenues.
No impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009 or for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. We may experience additional ceiling test write downs in the
future. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates—Method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties” beginning of page 81 of
this prospectus for a more detailed description of our method of accounting.
Our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies
in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our
reserves.
Oil and natural gas reserve engineering is not an exact science and requires subjective estimates of underground
accumulations of oil and natural gas and assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices, production levels,
ultimate recoveries and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves,
projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect. Our historical
estimates of proved reserves and related valuations are based on reports prepared by Ryder Scott as of December 31,
2011 and by Pinnacle as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, each an independent petroleum engineering firm. The
estimates of proved reserves and related valuations attributable to the Windsor UT properties and the properties subject
to the Gulfport transaction are based, in each case, on reports prepared by Ryder Scott as of December 31, 2011. Ryder
Scott and Pinnacle, as applicable, conducted a well-by-well review of all our
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
22
properties for the periods covered by their respective reserve reports using information provided by us. Over time, we
may make material changes to reserve estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and
production. Also, certain assumptions regarding future oil and natural gas prices, production levels and operating and
development costs may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could
greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to
any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future
net cash flows. A substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production
history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Numerous changes over time to
the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of
oil and natural gas we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates.
The estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 included in this prospectus were prepared using an
average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on
the first day of each month within the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in
accordance with the revised SEC guidelines applicable to reserves estimates for such periods. Reserve estimates do
not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for unproved
undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
The timing of both our production and our incurrence of costs in connection with the development and production of
oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves.
SEC rules that went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009 could limit our ability to book
additional proved undeveloped reserves in the future.
SEC rules that went into effect for fiscal years ending on or after December 31, 2009 require that, subject to limited
exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five
years after the date of booking. This requirement has limited and may continue to limit our ability to book additional
proved undeveloped reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write down our
proved undeveloped reserves if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year timeframe.
The development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital
expenditures than we currently anticipate.
Approximately 76% of our total estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2011 were proved undeveloped reserves and
may not be ultimately developed or produced. Recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital
expenditures and successful drilling operations. The reserve data included in the reserve engineer reports assumes
that substantial capital expenditures are required to develop such reserves. We cannot be certain that the estimated
costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, that development will occur as scheduled or that the results of
such development will be as estimated. Delays in the development of our reserves or increases in costs to drill and
develop such reserves will reduce future net revenues of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves and may result in
some projects becoming uneconomic. In addition, delays in the development of reserves could cause us to have to
reclassify our proved reserves as unproved reserves.
Our producing properties are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, making us vulnerable to risks associated
with operating in one major geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a
small number of producing horizons within this area.
All of our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Permian Basin of West Texas. As a result of this
concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, delays or
interruptions of production from wells in this area caused by governmental regulation, processing or transportation
capacity constraints, availability of equipment, facilities, personnel or services

23
market limitations or interruption of the processing or transportation of crude oil, natural gas or natural gas liquids. In
addition, the effect of fluctuations on supply and demand may become more pronounced within specific geographic oil
and natural gas producing areas such as the Permian Basin, which may cause these conditions to occur with greater
frequency or magnify the effects of these conditions. Due to the concentrated nature of our portfolio of properties, a
number of our properties could experience any of the same conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater
impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have a more diversified portfolio of
properties. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of
operations.
In addition to the geographic concentration of our producing properties described above, at December 31, 2011, all of
our proved reserves were attributable to the Wolfberry play. This concentration of assets within a small number of
producing horizons exposes us to additional risks, such as changes in field-wide rules and regulations that could
cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field.
We depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. The loss of
one or more of these purchasers could, among other factors, limit our access to suitable markets for the oil and natural
gas we produce.
The availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the
control of our management, including but not limited to the extent of domestic production and imports of oil, the
proximity and capacity of gas pipelines, the availability of skilled labor, materials and equipment, the effect of state and
federal regulation of oil and natural gas production and federal regulation of gas sold in interstate commerce. In
addition, we depend upon several significant purchasers for the sale of most of our oil and natural gas production. For
the six months ended June 30, 2012, three purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Plains Marketing,
L.P. (63%); Andrews Oil Buyers, Inc. (13%); and Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. (12%). For the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010, one purchaser, Windsor Midstream LLC, an entity controlled by Wexford, our equity
sponsor, accounted for approximately 78% and 81% of our revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31,
2009, two purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Windsor Midstream LLC (68%) and DCP Midstream,
LP (14%). No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. We cannot assure you
that we will continue to have ready access to suitable markets for our future oil and natural gas production.
The unavailability, high cost or shortages of rigs, equipment, raw materials, supplies or personnel may restrict our
operations.
The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials
(particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel. When shortages occur, the costs and delivery times of
rigs, equipment and supplies increase and demand for, and wage rates of, qualified drilling rig crews also rise with
increases in demand. In accordance with customary industry practice, we rely on independent third party service
providers to provide most of the services necessary to drill new wells. If we are unable to secure a sufficient number of
drilling rigs at reasonable costs, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer, and we may not be able
to drill all of our acreage before our leases expire. In addition, we do not have long-term contracts securing the use of
our existing rigs, and the operator of those rigs may choose to cease providing services to us. In addition, we intend to
increase the number of rigs we have operating in 2012 and 2013. Shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials
(particularly sand and other proppants), supplies, personnel, trucking services, tubulars, fracking and completion
services and production equipment could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn
could impair our financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain water may
have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Water is an essential component of deep shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic
fracturing processes. Historically, we have been able to purchase water from local land owners for use
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
24
in our operations. According to the Lower Colorado River Authority, during 2011, Texas experienced the lowest inflows
of water of any year in recorded history. As a result of this severe drought, some local water districts have begun
restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply. If we are
unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil and
natural gas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Declining general economic, business or industry conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations, liquidity and financial condition.
Concerns over global economic conditions, energy costs, geopolitical issues, inflation, the availability and cost of
credit, the European debt crisis, the United States mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the United
States have contributed to increased economic uncertainty and diminished expectations for the global economy. These
factors, combined with volatile prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, declining business and consumer
confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and a recession. In addition,
continued hostilities in the Middle East and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other
countries could adversely affect the economies of the United States and other countries. Concerns about global
economic growth have had a significant adverse impact on global financial markets and commodity prices. If the
economic climate in the United States or abroad continues to deteriorate, worldwide demand for petroleum products
could diminish, which could impact the price at which we can sell our oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids, affect
the ability of our vendors, suppliers and customers to continue operations and ultimately adversely impact our results
of operations, liquidity and financial condition.
We have incurred losses from operations during certain periods since our inception and may do so in the future.
We incurred a net loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Our development of and participation in
an increasingly larger number of drilling locations has required and will continue to require substantial capital
expenditures. The uncertainty and risks described in this prospectus may impede our ability to economically find,
develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves. As a result, we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability or
positive cash flows provided by operating activities in the future.
Part of our strategy involves drilling in existing or emerging shale plays using the latest available horizontal drilling
and completion techniques; therefore, the results of our planned exploratory drilling in these plays are subject to
drilling and completion technique risks and drilling results may not meet our expectations for reserves or production.
Our operations involve utilizing the latest drilling and completion techniques as developed by us and our service
providers. Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, landing our well bore in the desired drilling
zone, staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, running our casing the
entire length of the well bore and being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well
bore. Risks that we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, being able to fracture stimulate the
planned number of stages, being able to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations and
successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. The results of our
drilling in new or emerging formations are more uncertain initially than drilling results in areas that are more
developed and have a longer history of established production. Newer or emerging formations and areas have limited
or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results in these areas.
Ultimately, the success of these drilling and completion techniques can only be evaluated over time as more wells are
drilled and production profiles are established over a sufficiently long time period. If our drilling results are less than
anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease

25
expirations, access to gathering systems, and/or natural gas and oil prices decline, the return on our investment in
these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate. Further, as a result of any of these developments we could incur
material write-downs of our oil and gas properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline in the
future.
Conservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.
Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and
natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and
natural gas. The impact of the changing demand for oil and gas services and products may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not
control. When these facilities are unavailable, our operations can be interrupted and our revenues reduced.
The marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part upon the availability, proximity and capacity of
transportation facilities owned by third parties. Our oil production is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries
by our gathering system. Our purchasers then transport the oil by truck to a pipeline for transportation. Our gas
production is generally transported by our gathering lines from the wellhead to an interconnection point with the
purchaser. We do not control these trucks and other third party transportation facilities and our access to them may be
limited or denied. Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our
purchasers or a significant disruption in the availability of our or third party transportation facilities or other production
facilities could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas and thereby cause a
significant interruption in our operations. If, in the future, we are unable, for any sustained period, to implement
acceptable delivery or transportation arrangements or encounter production related difficulties, we may be required to
shut in or curtail production. Any such shut in or curtailment, or an inability to obtain favorable terms for delivery of
the oil and natural gas produced, would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our operations are subject to various governmental regulations which require compliance that can be burdensome and
expensive.
Our oil and natural gas operations are subject to various federal, state and local governmental regulations that may be
changed from time to time in response to economic and political conditions. Matters subject to regulation include
discharge permits for drilling operations, drilling bonds, reports concerning operations, the spacing of wells,
unitization and pooling of properties and taxation. From time to time, regulatory agencies have imposed price controls
and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production
capacity to conserve supplies of oil and gas. In addition, the production, handling, storage, transportation,
remediation, emission and disposal of oil and gas, by-products thereof and other substances and materials produced
or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations are subject to regulation under federal, state and local laws
and regulations primarily relating to protection of human health and the environment. Failure to comply with these
laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties,
permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of
our operations. Moreover, these laws and regulations have continually imposed increasingly strict requirements for
water and air pollution control and solid waste management. Significant expenditures may be required to comply with
governmental laws and regulations applicable to us. We believe the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental
legislation and regulations will continue. See “Business—Regulation—Environmental Matters and Regulation” and
“Business—Regulation—Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry” beginning on pages 104 and 108,
respectively, of this prospectus for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us.

Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs
and additional operating restrictions or delays.
Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons particularly
natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals
under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The federal Safe Drinking
Water Act, or SDWA, regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control, or
UIC, program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic
fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. The EPA, however, has recently taken the
position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program,
specifically as “Class II” UIC wells. At the same time, the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, has commenced a
study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, and a committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives is also conducting an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Moreover, the EPA announced on
October 20, 2011 that it is also launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and
currently plans to propose standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment
plant. As part of these studies, both the EPA and the House committee have requested that certain companies provide
them with information concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These studies, depending on
their results, could spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise.
Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of
“underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as
legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process,
were proposed in recent sessions of Congress. The U.S. Congress continues to consider legislation to amend the Safe
Drinking Water Act.
On April 17, 2012, EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission
controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, EPA’s rule package
includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds,
or VOCs, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil
and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule includes a 95 percent reduction in VOCs emitted by
requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells
constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding
emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. These rules will
require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions
from our wells by January 1, 2015. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased
capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental
aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic
fracturing’s potential impacts, the results of which are expected between later in 2012 and 2014.
These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could
spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory authorities.
Several states, including Texas, and the Department of the Interior, in a May 4, 2012 proposed rule covering federal
lands, have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in
certain circumstances and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. The Texas
Railroad Commission recently adopted rules and regulations requiring that the well operator disclose
the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of federal Occupational Safety and Health Act
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
27
(OSHA) for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas Railroad Commission
with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well must also be disclosed
to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission. We plan to use hydraulic fracturing extensively in
connection with the development and production of certain of our oil and natural gas properties and any increased
federal, state, local, foreign or international regulation of hydraulic fracturing could reduce the volumes of oil and gas
that we can economically recover, which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to use of fracturing fluids,
impacts on drinking water supplies, use of waters and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the
environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country
implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing, such
as the FRAC Act, are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate
production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to
initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely
affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, our fracturing
activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent
construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and
abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative
changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to
comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it
is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation
governing hydraulic fracturing.
Our operations may be exposed to significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of environmental, health and
safety requirements applicable to our business activities.
We may incur significant delays, costs and liabilities as a result of federal, state and local environmental, health and
safety requirements applicable to our exploration, development and production activities. These laws and regulations
may require us to obtain a variety of permits or other authorizations governing our air emissions, water discharges,
waste disposal or other environmental impacts associated with drilling, producing and other operations; regulate the
sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling, fracturing and completion processes; limit or prohibit drilling
activities in certain areas and on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas;
require remedial action to prevent or mitigate pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells or
closing earthen pits; and/or impose substantial liabilities for spills, pollution or failure to comply with regulatory
filings. In addition, these laws and regulations may restrict the rate of oil or natural gas production. These laws and
regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time. Failure to
comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties,
imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens, the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses
and authorizations, the requirement that additional pollution controls be installed and, in some instances, issuance of
orders or injunctions limiting or requiring discontinuation of certain operations.
Under certain environmental laws that impose strict as well as joint and several liability, we may be required to
remediate contaminated properties currently or formerly operated by us or facilities of third parties that received waste
generated by our operations regardless of whether such contamination resulted from the conduct of others or from
consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken.
In addition, claims for damages to persons or property, including natural resources, may result from the
environmental, health and safety impacts of our operations. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases from
our operations could expose us to significant liabilities under environmental laws. Moreover, public interest in the
protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years. The
Table of Contents

trend of more expansive and stringent environmental legislation and regulations applied to the crude oil and natural
gas industry could continue, resulting in increased costs of doing business and consequently affecting profitability. To
the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that restricts drilling or imposes more stringent and
costly operating, waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements, our business, prospects, financial condition or
results of operations could be materially adversely affected.
Restrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to
conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.
Oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions
on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife. Seasonal restrictions may limit our ability to operate in
protected areas and can intensify competition for drilling rigs, oilfield equipment, services, supplies and qualified
personnel, which may lead to periodic shortages when drilling is allowed. These constraints and the resulting
shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs. Permanent
restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the
implementation of expensive mitigation measures. The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where
we operate as threatened or endangered could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection
measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact
on our ability to develop and produce our reserves.
The recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use
derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our
business.
The recent adoption of derivatives legislation by the U.S. Congress could have an adverse effect on our ability to use
derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price, interest rate and other risks associated with our
business. The U.S. Congress recently adopted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (HR
4173), which, among other provisions, establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives
market and entities that participate in that market. The new legislation was signed into law by the President on July 21,
2010, and requires the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, and the SEC to promulgate rules and
regulations implementing the new legislation within 360 days from the date of enactment. In its rulemaking under the
new legislation, the CFTC has proposed regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the
major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents. Certain bona fide hedging transactions or
positions would be exempt from these position limits. Although the CFTC has promulgated numerous final rules based
on its proposals, it is not possible at this time to predict when the CFTC will finalize its proposed regulations or the
effect of such regulations on our business. The financial reform legislation may also require us to comply with margin
requirements and with certain clearing and trade-execution requirements in connection with our existing or future
derivative activities, although the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. The financial reform
legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives
activities to separate entities, which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties. The new legislation and
any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts (including through requirements to
post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivative contracts,
reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure
our derivative contracts in existence at that time, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If we
reduce or change the way we use derivative instruments as a result of the legislation and regulations, our results of
operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our
ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures. Finally, the legislation was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of
oil and natural gas prices, which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity
instruments related to oil and natural gas. Our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the
legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse
effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Proposed changes to U.S. tax laws, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.
The U.S. President’s Fiscal Year 2013 Budget Proposal includes provisions that would, if enacted, make significant
changes to U.S. tax laws. These changes include, but are not limited to, (i) eliminating the immediate deduction for
intangible drilling and development costs, (ii) eliminating the deduction from income for domestic production activities
relating to oil and natural gas exploration and development, (iii) the repeal of the of the percentage depletion allowance
for oil and gas properties, (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical
expenditures and (iv) implementing certain international tax reforms. These proposed changes in the U.S. tax laws, if
adopted, or other similar changes that reduce or eliminate deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural
gas exploration and development, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and
cash flows.
The adoption of climate change legislation by Congress could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand
for the oil and natural gas we produce.
Many nations have agreed to limit emissions of “greenhouse gases” pursuant to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Kyoto Protocol.” Methane, a primary component of natural gas,
and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products, are “greenhouse
gases,” or GHGs, regulated by the Kyoto Protocol. Although the United States is not participating in the Kyoto Protocol
at this time, several states or geographic regions have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases. Additionally, on April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, that
the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles as “air pollutant” under the federal
Clean Air Act. Thereafter, in December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions
of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because,
according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic
changes. These findings by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of
regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Subsequently,
the EPA adopted two sets of related rules, one of which purports to regulate emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles
and the other of which regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power
plants or industrial facilities. The EPA finalized the motor vehicle rule in April 2010 and it became effective January
2011, although it does not require immediate reductions in GHG emissions. The EPA adopted the stationary source
rule, also known as the “Tailoring Rule,” in May 2010, and it also became effective January 2011, although it remains
subject of several pending lawsuits filed by industry groups. Additionally, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final
rule requiring the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including
natural gas liquids fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions
occurring in 2010. In November 2010, the EPA expanded its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore and
offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities,
which may include certain of our facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In addition, the EPA has
continued to adopt GHG regulations of other industries, such as the March 2012 proposed GHG rule restricting future
development of coal-fired power plants. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil
and gas industry remain a possibility.
In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional
greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it
may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most of
these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major
producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances
corresponding with their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each
year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
30
number of GHG emission allowances declines each year, the cost or value of allowances is expected to escalate
significantly.
Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect
the oil and natural gas industry. Currently, while we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting
requirements, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives
and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing
greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business.
In addition, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions
such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels.
Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies
indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their
historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage
resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to
which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.
A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies or a
change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets, which may cause our revenues to
decline and operating expenses to increase.
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act of 1938, or the NGA, exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems
meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline performs a gathering function and therefore is
exempt from FERC’s jurisdiction under the NGA. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission
services and federally unregulated gathering services is a fact-based determination. The classification of facilities as
unregulated gathering is the subject of ongoing litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities
are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress, which could cause our
revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase and may materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition or results of operations. In addition, FERC has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise
non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to FERC annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting
requirements. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by
FERC from time to time. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
We rely on a few key employees whose absence or loss could adversely affect our business.
Many key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their
services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our new
executive team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Travis D. Stice, could disrupt our operations. We have
employment agreements with these executives which contain restrictions on competition with us in the event they
cease to be employed by us. However, as a practical matter, such employment agreements may not assure the
retention of our employees. Further, we do not maintain “key person” life insurance policies on any of our employees.
As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.
A significant reduction by Wexford of its ownership interest in us could adversely affect us.
Prior to the Gulfport transaction, Wexford will beneficially own 100% of our equity interests. Upon completion of this

interest in us provides Wexford with an economic incentive to assist us to be successful. Upon the expiration of the
lock-up restrictions on transfers or sales of our securities by or on behalf of DB Holdings following the completion of
this offering, Wexford will not be subject to any obligation to maintain its ownership interest in us and may elect at any
time thereafter to sell all or a substantial portion of or otherwise reduce its ownership interest in us. If Wexford sells all
or a substantial portion of its ownership interest in us, Wexford may have less incentive to assist in our success and its
affiliate(s) that are expected to serve as members of our board of directors may resign. Such actions could adversely
affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies which could adversely affect our cash flows or
results of operations. We also receive certain services, including drilling services from entities controlled by Wexford.
These service contracts may generally be terminated on 30-days notice. In the event Wexford ceases to own a
significant ownership interest in us, such services may not be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total
loss of investment and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Our drilling activities are subject to many risks. For example, we cannot assure you that new wells drilled by us will be
productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. Drilling for oil and natural gas
often involves unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce
sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs.
The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or
natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. The costs of exploration, exploitation and development
activities are subject to numerous uncertainties beyond our control, and increases in those costs can adversely affect
the economics of a project. Further, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed, canceled or
otherwise negatively impacted as a result of other factors, including:
•
unusual or unexpected geological formations;
•
loss of drilling fluid circulation;
•
title problems;
title problems;
•
facility or equipment malfunctions;
•
unexpected operational events;
•
shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services;
•
compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements; and
•
adverse weather conditions.
Any of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of
property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination or loss of wells and other
regulatory penalties.
Our development and exploratory drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted
returns.
Historically, we have acquired significant amounts of unproved property in order to further our development efforts and
expect to continue to undertake acquisitions in the future. Development and exploratory drilling and production
activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered.
We acquire unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and
increase our earnings over time. However, we cannot assure you that all prospects will be
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
32
economically viable or that we will not abandon our investments. Additionally, we cannot assure you that unproved
property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us
in prospects that we pursue will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such
unproved property or wells.
Operating hazards and uninsured risks may result in substantial losses and could prevent us from realizing profits.
Our operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil
and natural gas, including the risk of fire, explosions, blowouts, surface cratering, uncontrollable flows of natural gas,
oil and formation water, pipe or pipeline failures, abnormally pressured formations, casing collapses and
environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or discharges of toxic gases. In addition, our operations
are subject to risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, including any mishandling, surface spillage or potential
underground migration of fracturing fluids, including chemical additives. The occurrence of any of these events could
result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural
resources and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation
and penalties, suspension of operations and repairs to resume operations.
We endeavor to contractually allocate potential liabilities and risks between us and the parties that provide us with
services and goods, which include pressure pumping and hydraulic fracturing, drilling and cementing services and
tubular goods for surface, intermediate and production casing. Under our agreements with our vendors, to the extent
responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties, (i) our vendors generally assume all
responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land and
is directly associated with such vendors’ equipment while in their control and (ii) we generally assume the
responsibility for control and removal of all other pollution or contamination which may occur during our operations,
including pre-existing pollution and pollution which may result from fire, blowout, cratering, seepage or any other
uncontrolled flow of oil, gas or other substances, as well as the use or disposition of all drilling fluids. In addition, we
generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendor-owned property that occurs in the well hole
(except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage, rather than day work, basis) or as a
result of the use of equipment, certain corrosive fluids, additives, chemicals or proppants. However, despite this
general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen
liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into contractual arrangements with the
terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially
and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.
In accordance with what we believe to be customary industry practice, we historically have maintained insurance
against some, but not all, of our business risks. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover any losses or liabilities
we may suffer. Also, insurance may no longer be available to us or, if it is, its availability may be at premium levels
that do not justify its purchase. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance
coverage limits maintained by us or a claim at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance could have a
material adverse effect on our ability to conduct normal business operations and on our financial condition, results of
operations or cash flow. In addition, we may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that might be
required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might severely impact
our financial position. We may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties
purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance.
Since hydraulic fracturing activities are part of our operations, they are covered by our insurance against claims made
for bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs stemming from a sudden and accidental pollution event.
However, we may not have coverage if we are unaware of the pollution event and unable to report the “occurrence” to
our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. We have no coverage for gradual,
long-term pollution events. In addition, these policies do not provide coverage for
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
33
all liabilities, and we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage will be adequate to cover claims that may arise, or
that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance at rates we consider reasonable. A loss not fully covered by
insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Our failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate future acquisitions of properties or businesses could reduce
our earnings and slow our growth.
There is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase
the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our ability to complete acquisitions is dependent
upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals.
Further, these acquisitions may be in geographic regions in which we do not currently operate, which could result in
unforeseen operating difficulties and difficulties in coordinating geographically dispersed operations, personnel and
facilities. In addition, if we enter into new geographic markets, we may be subject to additional and unfamiliar legal
and regulatory requirements. Compliance with regulatory requirements may impose substantial additional obligations
on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources in compliance activities and increase
our exposure to penalties or fines for non-compliance with such additional legal requirements. Completed acquisitions
could require us to invest further in operational, financial and management information systems and to attract, retain,
motivate and effectively manage additional employees. The inability to effectively manage the integration of
acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations, which, in turn, could
negatively impact our earnings and growth. Our financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly
from period to period, based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods.
Properties we acquire may not produce as projected, and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify
liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against such liabilities.
Acquiring oil and gas properties requires us to assess reservoir and infrastructure characteristics, including
recoverable reserves, development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such
assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain. In connection with the assessments, we perform a review of the
subject properties, but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems. In the course of our due
diligence, we may not inspect every well or pipeline. We cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental
problems, such as pipe corrosion, when an inspection is made. We may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities
from the seller for liabilities created prior to our purchase of the property. We may be required to assume the risk of the
physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our
expectations.
We may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest.
It is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine
the title to the mineral interest. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform
the fieldwork in examining records in the appropriate governmental office before attempting to acquire a lease in a
specific mineral interest.
Prior to the drilling of an oil or gas well, however, it is the normal practice in our industry for the person or company
acting as the operator of the well to obtain a preliminary title review to ensure there are no obvious defects in title to
the well. Frequently, as a result of such examinations, certain curative work must be done to correct defects in the
marketability of the title, and such curative work entails expense. Our failure to cure any title defects may delay or
prevent us from utilizing the associated mineral interest, which may adversely impact our ability in the future to
increase production and reserves. Additionally, undeveloped acreage has greater risk of title defects than developed
acreage. If there are any title defects or defects in assignment of leasehold rights in properties in which we hold an
interest, we will suffer a financial loss.

Competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater
resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream
and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These
companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or define,
evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources
permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low
oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future
federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our
competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be
dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly
competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in
our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas
properties.
Our use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and
natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations.
Even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to
assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter
to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. In addition, the use of 3-D seismic and other
advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies, and we could incur
losses as a result of such expenditures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical.
We will be subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to timely comply
with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price and results of
operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
We will be required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as early as
December 31, 2013. Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and
issue management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This section also requires that our
independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls upon becoming a large accelerated
filer, as defined in the SEC rules, or otherwise ceasing to qualify for an exemption from the requirement to provide
auditors’ attestation on internal controls afforded to emerging growth companies under the “Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act” enacted by the U.S. Congress in April 2012. We are currently evaluating our existing controls against the
standards adopted by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. During the course of
our ongoing evaluation and integration of the internal control over financial reporting, we may identify areas requiring
improvement, and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this
review. For example, we anticipate the need to hire additional administrative and accounting personnel to conduct our
financial reporting.
We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management’s attention from running the day-to-day
operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be significant. If the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current
expectations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.
We cannot be certain at this time that we will be able to successfully complete the procedures, certification and
attestation requirements of Section 404 or that we or our auditors will not identify material weaknesses in internal
control over financial reporting. If we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our auditors
identify and report such material weaknesses, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly
reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our
Table of Contents

35
reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In
addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an
increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional
expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results of operations and financial condition.
Increased costs of capital could adversely affect our business.
Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms and cost of capital,
increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. Changes in any one or more of these factors could cause our
cost of doing business to increase, limit our access to capital, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities,
reduce our cash flows available for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage. Continuing disruptions and
volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability
impacting our ability to finance our operations. We require continued access to capital. A significant reduction in the
availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating
results.
We recorded compensation expense in 2011 and we may incur substantial additional compensation expense related to
our future grants of stock compensation which may have a material negative impact on our operating results for the
foreseeable future.
As a result of outstanding stock-based compensation awards, we recorded $0.5 million of compensation expense in
2011. In addition, our compensation expenses may increase in the future as compared to our historical expenses
because of the costs associated with our existing and anticipated stock-based incentive plans. These additional
expenses will adversely affect our net income. We cannot determine the actual amount of these new stock-related
compensation and benefit expenses at this time because applicable accounting practices generally require that they be
based on the fair market value of the options or shares of common stock at the date of the grant; however, they may be
significant. We will recognize expenses for restricted stock awards and stock options generally over the vesting period
of awards made to recipients.
Our level of indebtedness may increase and reduce our financial flexibility.
In the future, we may incur significant indebtedness in order to make future acquisitions or to develop our properties.
Our level of indebtedness could affect our operations in several ways, including the following:
•
a significant portion of our cash flows could be used to service our indebtedness;
•
a high level of debt would increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;
•
•
•
•
•
the covenants contained in the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness will limit our ability to borrow
additional funds, dispose of assets, pay dividends and make certain investments;
a high level of debt may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged
and therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness would prevent us from pursuing;
our debt covenants may also affect our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the economy and in our
industry;
a high level of debt may make it more likely that a reduction in our borrowing base following a periodic redetermination
could require us to repay a portion of our then-outstanding bank borrowings; and
a high level of debt may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital
expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes.

A high level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations. Our ability to meet our
debt obligations and to reduce our level of indebtedness depends on our future performance. General economic
conditions, oil and natural gas prices and financial, business and other factors affect our operations and our future
performance. Many of these factors are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to pay
the interest on our debt, and future working capital, borrowings or equity financing may not be available to pay or
refinance such debt. Factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock or a
refinancing of our debt include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we
need capital.
Our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to respond to changes in market
conditions or pursue business opportunities.
Our revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:
•
incur additional indebtedness;
•
create additional liens;
•
sell assets;
•
merge or consolidate with another entity;
•
pay dividends or make other distributions;
•
engage in transactions with affiliates; and
•
enter into certain swap agreements.
In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and tests. The requirement that
we comply with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions,
take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital
expenditures or withstand a continuing or future downturn in our business.
If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility, there could be an event of
default under the terms of our revolving credit facility, which could result in an acceleration of repayment.
If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our revolving credit facility, there could be an event of
default under the terms of this facility. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants, including meeting
the financial ratios and tests under our revolving credit facility, may be affected by events beyond our control. As a
result, we cannot assure that we will be able to comply with these restrictions and covenants or meet such financial
ratios and tests. In the event of a default under our revolving credit facility, the lenders could terminate their
commitments to lend or accelerate the loans and declare all amounts borrowed due and payable. If any of these events
occur, our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our outstanding indebtedness and we may be unable to
find alternative financing. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or
acceptable to us. Additionally, we may not be able to amend our revolving credit facility or obtain needed waivers on
satisfactory terms.
Our borrowings under our revolving credit facility expose us to interest rate risk.
Our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bear
interest at a rate elected by us that is based on the prime, LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 1.25%
to 3.50% depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base. As
of June 30, 2012, the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility was
3.75%. If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations and financial condition.

Any significant reduction in our borrowing base under our revolving credit facility as a result of the periodic borrowing
base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our ability to fund our operations.
Under our revolving credit facility, which currently provides for a $100.0 million borrowing base, we are subject to
semi-annual and other elective collateral borrowing base redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves.
Our revolving credit facility currently provides that the borrowing base will remain at $100.0 million through July 15,
2013 or, if earlier, the closing date of this offering, at which time the borrowing base will be reduced to $90.0 million,
subject to the periodic and elective borrowing base redeterminations discussed above, and without consideration of
the impact of the Gulfport transaction and the Windsor UT properties. Any significant reduction in our borrowing base
as a result of such borrowing base redeterminations or otherwise may negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to
fund our operations and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation
and cash flow.
Loss of our information and computer systems could adversely affect our business.
We are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer based programs, including our well operations
information, seismic data, electronic data processing and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to
fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, possible consequences include
our loss of communication links, inability to find, produce, process and sell oil and natural gas and inability to
automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities.
Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.
A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.
Terrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States or other countries may
adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting our financial and other
obligations. If any of these events occur, the resulting political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall
demand for oil and natural gas, potentially putting downward pressure on demand for our services and causing a
reduction in our revenues. Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks, and our
operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to our customers’ operations is destroyed or
damaged. Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance
coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all.
Risks Related to this Offering and Our Common Stock
Our two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock, and their interests may conflict
with those of our other stockholders.
Upon completion of this offering, Wexford and Gulfport will beneficially own approximately     % and     %,
respectively, of our common stock, or     % and     %, respectively, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares in full. See “Principal Stockholders” beginning on page 136 of this prospectus. In addition,
individuals affiliated with Wexford and Gulfport serve on our Board of Directors, and Gulfport has the right to designate
one individual as a nominee for election to our Board of Directors so long as it continues to beneficially own more than
10% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, Wexford and Gulfport, together, will be able to control, and
Wexford alone will continue to be able to exercise significant influence over, matters requiring stockholder approval,
including the election of directors, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions.
This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our common stock will
be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of Wexford and Gulfport with
respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other
corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. This
continued concentrated ownership will make it impossible for another company to acquire us and for you to receive
any related takeover premium for your shares unless Wexford approves the acquisition.

The corporate opportunity provisions in our certificate of incorporation could enable Wexford, our equity sponsor, or
other affiliates of ours to benefit from corporate opportunities that might otherwise be available to us.
Subject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things:
•
•
•
permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or
otherwise interested;
permits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make
investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and
provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes
aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director
or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to
communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such
affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her
fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our
best interests.
These provisions create the possibility that a corporate opportunity that would otherwise be available to us may be
used for the benefit of one of our affiliates.
We have engaged in transactions with our affiliates and expect to do so in the future. The terms of such transactions
and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise may not always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests.
We have engaged in transactions and expect to continue to engage in transactions with affiliated companies. As
described under the caption “Related Party Transactions” beginning on page 131 of this prospectus, these include,
among others, drilling services provided to us to Bison Drilling and Field Services, LLC, real property leased by us
from Fasken Midland, LLC and certain administrative services provided to us by Everest Operations Management LLC.
Each of these entites is either controlled by or affiliated with Wexford, and the resolution of any conflicts that may arise
in connection with such related party transactions, including pricing, duration or other terms of service, may not
always be in our or our stockholders’ best interests because Wexford may have the ability to influence the outcome of
these conflicts. For a discussion of potential conflicts, see “—Risks Related to this Offering and our Common Stock –
Our two largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock, and their interests may conflict
with those of our other stockholders” on page 38 of this prospectus.
We will incur increased costs as a result of being a public company, which may significantly affect our financial
condition.
As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private
company. We will incur costs associated with our public company reporting requirements. We also anticipate that we
will incur costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as well as rules implemented by the SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. We expect these
rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-
consuming and costly, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” We also expect these rules
and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance
and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the
same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve
on our board of directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating these rules, and we cannot predict or
estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.

However, for as long as we remain an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act of 2012, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable
to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure
obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the
requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any
golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until
we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
We will remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five years, although if the market value of our common stock
that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, we would cease to be an
“emerging growth company” as of the following December 31.
After we are no longer an “emerging growth company,” we expect to incur significant additional expenses and devote
substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are
not “emerging growth companies,” including Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. See “—Risks Related to the Oil
and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business—We will be subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act. If we are unable to timely comply with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our
profitability, stock price and results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected” on
page 35 of this prospectus.
We are an “emerging growth company” and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to
emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, and we may
take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public
companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our
periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We
cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some
investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common
stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, “emerging growth companies” can delay adopting new or revised
accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not
to avail ourselves to this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the
same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.”
There has been no public market for our common stock and if the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly,
your investment could lose value.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. Although we have applied to have our
common stock listed on The NASDAQ Global Market, we cannot assure you that an active public market will develop
for our common stock or that our common stock will trade in the public market subsequent to this offering at or above
the initial public offering price. If an active public market for our common stock does not develop, the trading price and
liquidity of our common stock will be materially and adversely affected. If there is a thin trading market or “float” for
our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole.
Without a large float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and,
as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active
public trading market, investors may be unable to

liquidate their investment in us. The initial offering price, which will be negotiated between us and the underwriters,
may not be indicative of the trading price for our common stock after this offering. In addition, the stock market is
subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in
response to several factors, including:
•
our quarterly or annual operating results;
•
changes in our earnings estimates;
•
investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;
•
additions or departures of key personnel;
•
changes in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;
•
our failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts’ projections;
•
changes in industry, general market or economic conditions; and
•
announcements of legislative or regulatory change.
The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years that have significantly affected
the quoted prices of the securities of many companies, including companies in our industry. The changes often appear
to occur without regard to specific operating performance. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon
factors that have little or nothing to do with our company and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock
price.
Future sales of our common stock, or the perception that such future sales may occur, may cause our stock price to
decline.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after this offering, or the perception that these
sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. See “Shares Eligible for Future Sale”
on page 141 of this prospectus. In addition, the sale of these shares could impair our ability to raise capital through the
sale of additional common or preferred stock. After this offering, we will have              shares of common stock
outstanding, excluding stock options. All of the shares sold in this offering, except for any shares purchased by our
affiliates, will be freely tradable.
DB Holdings, Gulfport and our directors and executive officers will be subject to agreements that limit their ability to
sell our common stock held by them. These holders cannot sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common
stock for a period of at least 180 days after the date of this prospectus, which period may be extended under limited
circumstances, without the prior written approval of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC. However, these lock-up
agreements are subject to certain specific exceptions, including transfers of common stock as a bona fide gift or by
will or intestate succession and transfers to such person’s immediate family or to a trust or to an entity controlled by
such holder, provided that the recipient of the shares agrees to be bound by the same restrictions on sales. In the event
that one or more of our stockholders sells a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the
market perceives that such sales may occur, the price of our stock could decline.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their
recommendations regarding our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could
decline.
The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities
analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to
publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock
price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our
stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.

Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate dilution and will experience further dilution with the future
exercise of stock options granted to certain of our executive officers under their respective employment agreements.
The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our
outstanding common stock. As a result, you will experience immediate and substantial dilution of approximately
$         per share, representing the difference between our net tangible book value per share as of June 30, 2012 after
giving effect to this offering and an assumed initial public offering price of $         (which is the midpoint of the range
set forth on the cover of the prospectus). A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$         per share (which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus) would increase
(decrease) our net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering by $        , and increase (decrease)
the dilution to new investors by $        , assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of
this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offered expenses payable by us. If the options granted to certain of our executive officers under their
respective employment agreements are exercised in full, the investors in this offering will experience further dilution.
See “Dilution” beginning on page 47 of this prospectus for a description of dilution.
We may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.
Our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes
or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including
preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine.
The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our
common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors
in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the
repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect
the residual value of the common stock.
Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in
control of the company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.
The existence of some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware corporate law could
delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders. Our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult,
including:
•
provisions regulating the ability of our stockholders to nominate directors for election or to bring matters for action at
annual meetings of our stockholders;
•
limitations on the ability of our stockholders to call a special meeting and act by written consent;
•
•
•
•
the ability of our board of directors to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws, and the requirement that the affirmative vote of
holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock be obtained for
stockholders to amend our bylaws;
the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding
shares of capital stock be obtained to remove directors;
the requirement that the affirmative vote of holders representing at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all outstanding
shares of capital stock be obtained to amend our certificate of incorporation; and
the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock without the approval of
our stockholders.

These provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to
elect directors and take other corporate actions. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third
party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are
willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.
We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and therefore only
appreciation of the price of our common stock will provide a return to our stockholders.
We currently anticipate that we will retain all future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our
business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the
declaration and payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our
financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions capital requirements, business prospects and other
factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. In addition, the terms of our credit facilities prohibit us from paying
dividends and making other distributions. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may
not occur, will provide a return to our stockholders.

CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This prospectus contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, which may include statements about our:
•
business strategy;
•
exploration and development drilling prospects, inventories, projects and programs;
•
oil and natural gas reserves;
•
identified drilling locations;
•
ability to obtain permits and governmental approvals;
•
technology;
•
financial strategy;
•
realized oil and natural gas prices;
•
production;
•
lease operating expenses, general and administrative costs and finding and development costs;
•
future operating results; and
•
plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.
All of these types of statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this prospectus, are forward-
looking statements. These forward-looking statements may be found in the “Prospectus Summary,” “Risk Factors,”
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Business” beginning
on pages 1, 17, 59 and 88, respectively, and other sections of this prospectus. In some cases, you can identify forward-
looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “could,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “project,” “intend,”
“anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “pursue,” “target,” “seek,” “objective” or “continue,” the
negative of such terms or other comparable terminology.
The forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus are largely based on our expectations, which reflect
estimates and assumptions made by our management. These estimates and assumptions reflect our best judgment
based on currently known market conditions and other factors. Although we believe such estimates and assumptions
to be reasonable, they are inherently uncertain and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond our
control. In addition, our management’s assumptions about future events may prove to be inaccurate. Our management
cautions all readers that the forward-looking statements contained in this prospectus are not guarantees of future
performance, and we cannot assure any reader that such statements will be realized or the forward-looking events and
circumstances will occur. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking
statements due to the many factors including those described in the “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this
prospectus. All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this prospectus. We do not intend to publicly
update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These
cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf.

USE OF PROCEEDS
Our net proceeds from the sale of              shares of common stock in this offering, assuming a public offering price of
$         per share (which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of this prospectus), are estimated to be
$         million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The net
proceeds would be $         million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full. At the
closing of this offering, we intend to use approximately $         million of the net proceeds to repay the outstanding
borrowings under our revolving credit facility, $63.6 million to repay the Gulfport transaction note and $         million to
repay the outstanding borrowings under our subordinated note with an affiliate of Wexford and, thereafter, we intend to
use the balance of the proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of our exploration and development activities and
for general corporate purposes, which may include leasehold interest and property acquisitions, working capital and
the settlement of crude oil swaps. Upon repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility,
we will have $90.0 million of borrowing capacity under that facility to further fund our exploration and development
activities and for general corporate purposes.
All borrowings under our revolving credit facility are due and payable on October 15, 2014. As of June 30, 2012, $100.0
million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility and bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.75% per
annum. The amounts initially borrowed under our revolving credit facility were used to repay in full the outstanding
indebtedness under our prior credit facility and for general corporate purposes. The Gulfport transaction note, which
will be issued immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part in
connection with the Gulfport transaction, is due upon completion of this offering and does not bear interest unless it is
not paid when due.
All borrowings under our subordinated note are due and payable on January 31, 2015 or the earlier completion of this
offering. On May 14, 2012, we received an initial advance of $8.1 million under this note which provides for aggregate
outstanding borrowings of up to $25.0 million. On August 13, 2012, $24.5 million was outstanding under this note. The
note bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.28% or 8% per annum, whichever is lower. Our borrowings under the
subordinated note were used to fund our 2012 drilling program and for general corporate purposes.
An increase or decrease in the initial public offering price of $1.00 per share would cause the net proceeds that we will
receive in this offering to increase or decrease by approximately $         million. If our net proceeds are reduced, we will
have less proceeds to fund our exploration and development activities and may not have sufficient funds to repay our
revolving credit facility in full. Any reduction in net proceeds may cause us to need to borrow additional funds under
our revolving credit facility to fund our operations, which would increase our interest expense and decrease our net
income.
DIVIDEND POLICY
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available
funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring
or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the declaration and payment of
dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our
financial condition, results of operations, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other
factors that our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, the terms of our revolving credit facility restrict the
payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock and any other equity holders.

of our common stock and the Gulfport transaction note to Gulfport in connection with the Gulfport transaction; and
on a pro forma basis described above as adjusted to give effect to the sale of shares of our common stock in this
offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $         per share (which is the midpoint of the range set forth on
the cover of this prospectus), our receipt of an estimated $         million of net proceeds from this offering after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses and the use of a portion of those

(1) Diamondback Energy, Inc. was incorporated on December 30, 2011 in Delaware as a holding company and will not conduct
any material business operations prior to the completion of the offering. The data in this table has been derived from the
historical consolidated financial statements and other financial information included in this prospectus which pertain to the
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Windsor Permian LLC. Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration
statement of which this prospectus is a part, Windsor Permian LLC will become our wholly-owned subsidiary.
(2) A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $         per share (which is the midpoint of the
range set forth on the cover of this prospectus) would increase (decrease) each of cash and cash equivalents, additional
paid-in-capital and total capitalization by $         million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
(3) At August 13, 2012, long term debt was $124.9 million, which consists primarily of $24.5 million in borrowings under our
subordinated note with an affiliate of Wexford and $100.0 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
(4) Does not reflect the repayment of an additional $10.4 million in borrowings under our subordinated note with an affiliate of
Wexford borrowed subsequent to June 30, 2012, which repayment will reduce cash and cash equivalents. See “Use of
Proceeds.”
(5) Upon completion of this offering, we will recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for temporary differences between the
historical cost basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Based on estimates of those temporary differences as of
June 30, 2012, a net deferred tax liability of approximately $37.4 million will be recognized with a corresponding charge to
earnings.

DILUTION
Our reported net tangible book value as of June 30, 2012 was $         million, or $         per share, based upon shares
outstanding as of that date after giving pro forma effect to (a) the merger of Diamondback Energy LLC with and into
Diamondback Energy, Inc. and (b) the Gulfport transaction. Net tangible book value per share is determined by dividing
such number of outstanding shares of common stock into our net tangible book value, which is our total tangible
assets less total liabilities. Assuming the sale by us of              shares of common stock offered in this offering at an
estimated initial public offering price of $         per share (which is the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover of
this prospectus) and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us, our net tangible book value as of June 30, 2012 would have been approximately $         million, or $        
per share, after giving pro forma effect to (a) the merger of Diamondback Energy LLC with and into Diamondback
Energy, Inc. and (b) to the Gulfport transaction. This represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of
$         per share to our existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $         per share to new investors
purchasing shares at the initial public offering price.
The following table illustrates the per share dilution:

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $         per share (which is the midpoint of the
range set forth in the cover of this prospectus) would increase (decrease) our net tangible book value after the offering
by $        , and increase (decrease) the dilution to new investors by $        , assuming the number of shares offered by
us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
The following table sets forth, as of June 30, 2012, after giving pro forma effect to the merger of Diamondback Energy
LLC with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc. and the Gulfport transaction, the number of shares of common stock to
be issued by us to DB Holdings and Gulfport, which will be our existing stockholders immediately prior to the closing
of this offering, and by the new investors at the assumed initial public offering price of $         per share, together with
the total consideration paid and average price per share paid by each of these groups, before deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

(1) Diamondback Energy, Inc. was incorporated on December 30, 2011 in Delaware as a holding company and will not conduct
any material business operations prior to the transaction described below. Our historical consolidated financial statements
and other financial information included in this prospectus pertain to assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Windsor
Permian LLC, which is an entity controlled by our equity sponsor, Wexford. Windsor Permian LLC was treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a result, essentially all of Windsor Permian LLC’s taxable earnings and
losses were passed through to Wexford, and Windsor Permian LLC did not pay federal income taxes at the entity level. Prior
to the completion of this offering, Windsor Permian LLC will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and, because we are a
subchapter C corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, the earnings at Windsor Permian LLC will become subject to
federal income tax. For comparative purposes, we have included pro forma financial data to give effect to income taxes
assuming the earnings of Windsor Permian LLC had been subject to federal income tax as a subchapter C corporation in all
periods presented in the accompanying table. If the earnings of Windsor Permian LLC had been subject to federal income
tax as a subchapter C corporation during the periods presented herein, we would have incurred net operating losses for
income tax purposes in each period presented. We would have been in a net deferred tax asset, or DTA, position as a result
of such tax losses and would have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce each period’s DTA balance to zero. A valuation
allowance to reduce each period’s DTA would have resulted in an equal and offsetting credit for the respective expenses or
an equal and offsetting debit for the respective benefits for income taxes, with the resulting tax expenses for each of the
above periods of zero. The unaudited pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only, and does not purport to
project our results of operations for any future period or our financial position as of any future date.
(2) Unaudited pro forma basic and diluted income (loss) per share will be presented for the latest fiscal year and interim period
on the basis of the aggregate number of shares to be issued to DB Holdings in connection with the merger of Diamondback
Energy LLC with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc., upon determination of the number of those shares.
(3) Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our
financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net
income (loss) before loss on derivative contracts, interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairment of
oil and gas properties, non-cash equity based compensation and asset retirement obligation accretion expense. Adjusted
EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) as determined by United States’ generally accepted accounting principles, or
GAAP. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows it to more effectively evaluate our operating
performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or
capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these
amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and
book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not
be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP or
as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant
components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and
tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our
computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measure of other companies or to such
measure in our credit facility.
The following tables present a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the GAAP
financial measure of net income (loss).

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Diamondback Energy, Inc.
Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
Introduction
The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company
have been prepared to show the effect of the Transactions and the distribution by Windsor Permian to its equity
holders of its minority equity interests in Bison and Muskie. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read together with the historical financial statements of Windsor Permian and Windsor
UT and the historical Statements of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses of certain property interests of Gulfport
Energy Corporation included in this prospectus. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated
financial statements are based on assumptions and include adjustments as explained in the accompanying notes.
The acquisition of certain property interests of Gulfport Energy Corporation (the Gulfport properties) will be treated as a
business combination accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting with the identifiable assets
recognized at fair value on the date of transfer.
The Windsor UT contribution is treated as a combination of entities under common control with assets and liabilities
transferred at their carrying amounts in the accounts of the transferring entity at the date of transfer.
The pro forma data presented reflect events directly attributable to the Transactions and other described transactions
and certain assumptions the Company believes are reasonable. The pro forma data are not necessarily indicative of
financial results that would have been attained had the described transactions occurred on the dates indicated below.
The pro forma data also necessarily exclude various operation expenses related to the Gulfport properties and the
financial statements should not be viewed as indicative of operations in future periods. As the current operator of the
properties to be acquired by the Company upon completion of the Gulfport transaction and the Windsor UT
contribution, the Company does not expect any material impact from these transactions on its existing employees or
infrastructure.
The Transactions will be completed immediately prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part and the distribution of the equity interests in Bison and Muskie occurred in June 2012.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet assumes that the Transactions occurred on June 30,
2012. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2011
and for the six months ended June 30, 2012 assumes that the Transactions and other described transactions occurred
on January 1, 2011.

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements
1. Basis of Presentation
The historical financial information is derived from the historical financial statements of Windsor Permian and Windsor
UT and the historical statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of certain property interests of Gulfport.
The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2012 has been prepared as if the
Transactions had taken place on June 30, 2012. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of
operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2012 assumes that the
Transactions and other described transactions had occurred on January 1, 2011.
2. Pro Forma Assumptions and Adjustments
We made the following adjustments in the preparation of the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial
statements.
(a) To record the acquisition of the Gulfport properties at fair value for              shares of our common stock, which will
represent 35% of our outstanding common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering, and $63,590,050 in the
form of a non-interest bearing promissory note that will be repaid in full upon the closing of this offering. The allocation of
the purchase price to the assets acquired is preliminary and, therefore, subject to change.
(b) To record the distribution of minority equity interests in Bison and Muskie to Windsor Permian’s sole member which
occurred on June 15, 2012.
(c) To record incremental accretion of discount on asset retirement obligation associated with the Gulfport transaction.
(d) To record incremental depletion, depreciation, and amortization of oil and natural gas properties associated with the
Transactions, amortized on a unit-of-production basis over the remaining life of total proved reserves, as applicable, due to
the following:
Purchase accounting basis adjustment for Gulfport
properties
Using a larger quantity of reserves in the units of
production computation
Total incremental depletion, depreciation and amortization
Six Months Ended
June 30, 2012
Year Ended
December 31, 2011
$

$
(e) To record estimated net deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences between the historical cost basis and tax basis of
our assets and liabilities as the result of our change in tax status to a subchapter C corporation. A corresponding charge to
earnings has not been reflected in the pro forma Statement of Operations, as the charge is considered non-recurring.
To record the effect of income taxes assuming earnings had been subject to federal income tax as a subchapter C
corporation in all periods presented. If the earnings had been subject to federal income tax as a subchapter C corporation
during the periods presented, we would have incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in each period
presented. Additionally, we would have been in a net deferred tax asset, or DTA, position as a result of such tax losses
and would have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce each period’s DTA balance to zero. A valuation allowance to
reduce each period’s DTA would have resulted in an equal and offsetting credit for the respective expenses or an equal and
offsetting debit for the respective benefits for income taxes, with the resulting tax expenses for each period of zero.

connection with the Gulfport transaction and to DB Holdings in connection with the merger of Diamondback Energy LLC
with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc.
3. Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities
The following table presents estimated unaudited pro forma volumes of proved developed and undeveloped oil and
gas reserves as of December 31, 2011 and changes in proved reserves during the year, assuming continuation of
economic conditions prevailing at the end of the year. The weighted average prices at December 31, 2011 used for
reserve report purposes are $93.09 per Bbl of oil, $56.62 per Bbl of natural gas liquids and $3.96 per Mcf of natural gas,
respectively.
The Company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves shown below are estimates which, by their nature, are subject
to revision. The estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data, as well as production
performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by
additional performance data.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the “Selected Historical Consolidated
Financial Data” and the combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. This
discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates and assumptions
concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results
and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a
number of factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward-Looking Statements” appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.
Overview
We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and
exploitation of unconventional, long-life, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. We
intend to grow our reserves and production through development drilling, exploitation and exploration activities on our
multi-year inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our strategic and
financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves.
We intend to increase stockholder value by profitably growing reserves and production, primarily through drilling
operations. We seek high quality exploration and development projects with potential for providing long-term drilling
inventories that generate high returns. Substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of oil, natural
gas liquids and natural gas production. Our production was approximately 74% oil, 15% natural gas liquids and 11%
natural gas for both the year ended December 31, 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2012.
We began operations in December 2007 with our acquisition of certain strategic oil and gas properties located in the
Permian Basin of West Texas from ExL Petroleum, LP, Ambrose Energy I, Ltd. and certain other sellers for
approximately $85.0 million. Through this transaction, we acquired 4,134 net acres with production at the time of
acquisition of approximately 800 net barrels of oil equivalent, or BOE/d, from 34 gross (16.8 net) wells. Subsequently,
we acquired approximately 26,875 additional net acres, which brought our total net acreage position in the Permian
Basin to approximately 31,009 net acres at June 30, 2012 and, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had 51,623 net
acres in the Permian Basin. Since our initial acquisition in the Permian Basin through June 30, 2012, we drilled or
participated in the drilling of 169 gross (101 net) wells (or 174 gross (153 net) wells after giving effect to the
Transactions) on our acreage in this area, primarily targeting the Wolfberry play. We are the operator of approximately
99% of our Permian Basin acreage.
We have increased our initial leasehold position through acquisitions in the Wolfberry play for an aggregate net cost of
$44.9 million through June 30, 2012. These acquisitions include the following:
•
•
•
•
In 2008, we acquired 6,247 net acres at the Spanish Trail and Munn prospects in Midland County, Texas through 11
leases and one mineral deed, with 5,146 net acres attributable to one lease;
Commencing in 2008 and ending in 2010, we acquired leases at the Barron prospect in Midland County, Texas that
currently cover 225 net acres;
Commencing in 2008 and ending in 2011, we acquired leases at the Gist prospect in Ector County, Texas covering
1,452 net acres;
Commencing in 2008 and ending in 2012, we acquired 37 leases at the UL prospect in Andrews, Upton and Reagan
Counties, Texas covering a total of 10,006 net acres;
•
Beginning in 2008, we acquired 17 leases at the Hurt/WHL prospect in Ector County, Texas covering 2,779 net acres;

•
In 2009, we acquired one lease at the Cumberland prospect located in Midland County, Texas covering 207 net acres;
•
•
In 2010, we acquired leases at the North Howard prospect located in Howard County, Texas that currently cover 131
net acres;
In 2010 and 2011, we acquired leases at the Big Max prospect located in Andrews County, Texas that currently cover
848 net acres; and
•
In 2012, we acquired leases at the Clete prospect in Crockett County, Texas that currently cover 3,110 net acres.
In July 2012, we further increased our leasehold position and acquired leases in the Hume prospect in Crockett County,
Texas that currently covers 1,869 net acres.
Diamondback Energy, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware on December 30, 2011 as a holding company and will not
conduct any material business operations prior to the transaction described below. Our historical financial information
included in this prospectus pertains to assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Windsor Permian LLC. Windsor
Permian LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diamondback Energy LLC, which is an entity controlled by our equity
sponsor, Wexford. Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part,
Diamondback Energy LLC will be merged with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc. and Diamondback Energy, Inc. will
continue as the surviving corporation. In the merger, DB Holdings will be issued shares of our common stock, and
Windsor Permian LLC will become our wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, Wexford has agreed to cause all the
outstanding equity interests in Windsor UT to be contributed to Windsor Permian prior to the merger. After the merger
but prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, Gulfport will complete the
Gulfport transaction in exchange for shares of our common stock.
In June 2012, Windsor Permian distributed to its sole member its minority equity interests in Bison Drilling and Field
Services LLC, or Bison, and Muskie Holdings LLC, or Muskie. Bison was formed in November 2010 as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Windsor Permian. Between March 2011 and April 2012, Gulfport and various entities controlled by
Wexford acquired interests in Bison, which reduced Windsor Permian’s interest to approximately 22%. Bison owns and
operates four drilling rigs and various oil and natural gas well servicing equipment and has performed drilling and
field services for us. Muskie was formed in October 2011 when Windsor Permian contributed certain assets, real estate
and rights in a lease covering land in Wisconsin to Muskie in exchange for a 48.6% equity interest. The contributed
lease is prospective for oil and natural gas fracture grade sand. At the time of the contribution, the remaining interests
in Muskie were held by Gulfport and entities controlled by Wexford. Through additional contributions from the
Wexford-controlled entities, Windsor Permian’s equity interest in Muskie decreased to approximately 33%. Windsor
Permian’s interests in Bison and Muskie were distributed to Windsor Permian’s sole member in June 2012 so we may
focus our activities on our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities. We recorded revenues
attributable to Bison in our consolidated statements of operations of $0.8 million during 2010 and $1.5 million during
the first quarter of 2011, at which time Bison was deconsolidated for financial reporting purposes. Muskie was formed
in 2011, and we recorded a loss from equity method investments of $7,017 for 2011. The interests in Bison and Muskie
are reflected in “Investments-equity method” on our consolidated balance sheets. For additional information regarding
Bison and Muskie, see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements” and “Related Party
Transactions” beginning on pages 52 and 131, respectively, of this prospectus and Note 5 to our consolidated financial
statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.
Since we began operations, we have increased our drilling activity, evaluated potential acquisitions and added to our
acreage portfolio. Because of our growth through acquisitions and development of our properties, our historical results
of operations and period-to-period comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or
indicative of future results.
Like all oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, we face the challenge of natural production
declines. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, oil and natural gas production from a given well
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
60
naturally decreases. Thus, an oil and natural gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base
with each unit of oil or natural gas it produces. We attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find
additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce. Our future growth will depend on our ability to
continue to add reserves in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on managing costs associated with
drilling and the development and production of reserves. Our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on
our capital resources and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and
regulatory approvals. We expect the permitting and approval process to become more difficult with increased activism
from environmental and other groups which may extend the time it takes us to receive permits. Because of our
relatively small size and concentrated property base, we can be disproportionately disadvantaged by delays in
obtaining or failing to obtain drilling approvals compared to companies with larger or more dispersed property bases.
As a result, we are less able to shift drilling activities to areas where permitting may be easier and we have fewer
properties over which to spread the costs related to complying with these regulations and the costs or foregone
opportunities resulting from delays.
Reserves and pricing
In December 2008, the SEC released the final rule for Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting. Among other changes,
the final rule requires us to report oil and natural gas reserves and calculate the full cost ceiling value using the
unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-the-month oil and natural gas prices during the 12-month period ending in
the reporting period. The prior SEC rule required using prices at period end. The requirements of this standard became
effective for the year ended December 31, 2009. These revisions and requirements affect the comparability between
reporting periods prior to and after the year ended December 31, 2009 for reserve volume and value estimates, full cost
pool write-down calculations and the calculations of depletion of oil and gas assets.
In the table below, Ryder Scott estimated all of our proved reserves at December 31, 2011 and Pinnacle estimated all of
our proved reserves at December 31, 2010 and 2009. The prices used to estimate proved reserves for all periods did not
give effect to derivative transactions, were held constant throughout the life of the properties and have been adjusted
for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting
the price received at the wellhead.

Prices for oil and natural gas can fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the global and regional
supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, economic conditions and a variety of additional
factors. Since the inception of our oil and natural gas activities, commodity prices have experienced significant
fluctuations, and additional changes in commodity prices may significantly affect the economic viability of drilling
projects, as well as the economic valuation and economic recovery of oil and gas reserves.

Sources of our revenue
61
Our revenues are derived from the sale of oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that
are extracted from our natural gas during processing. Our oil and natural gas revenues do not include the effects of
derivatives. For the six months ended June 30, 2012 and the year ended December 31, 2011, our revenues were derived
89% and 86%, respectively, from oil sales, 9% and 10%, respectively, from natural gas liquids sales, 2% and 3%,
respectively, from natural gas sales and none and 3%, respectively, from oil and natural gas services. Our revenues
may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in
commodity prices. Oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices have historically been volatile. For example, during
the past five years, the West Texas Intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of $30.28 per Bbl in
December 2008 to a high of $145.31 per Bbl in July 2008. The Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged
from a low of $1.82 per MMBtu in April 2012 to a high of $13.31 per MMBtu in July 2008. During 2011, West Texas
Intermediate prices ranged from $75.40 to $113.39 per Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas ranged
from $2.84 to $4.92 per MMBtu. On June 29, 2012, the West Texas Intermediate posted price for crude oil was $85.04 per
Bbl and the Henry Hub spot market price of natural gas was $2.74 per MMBtu.
To achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, from
time-to-time we enter into derivative arrangements for our crude oil and natural gas production. We utilize commodity
derivatives to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in NYMEX WTI benchmark prices. While these derivative contracts
stabilize our cash flows when market prices are below our contract prices, they also prevent us from realizing
increases in our cash flow when market prices are higher than our contract prices. We will sustain realized and
unrealized losses to the extent our derivatives contract prices are lower than market prices and, conversely, we will
sustain realized and unrealized gains to the extent our derivatives contract prices are higher than market prices. Our
derivatives contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and, as a result, gains or losses on derivatives contracts
are recorded as other income (expense) in our statements of operations.
Principal components of our cost structure
Lease operating and natural gas transportation and treating expenses. These are daily costs incurred to bring oil and
natural gas out of the ground and to the market, together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing
properties. Such costs also include maintenance, repairs and workover expenses related to our oil and natural gas
properties.
Production taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced oil and natural gas based on a percentage of revenues from
products sold at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Where available, we benefit from tax
credits and exemptions in our various taxing jurisdictions. We are also subject to ad valorem taxes in the counties
where our production is located. Ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and gas properties.
General and administrative. These are costs incurred for overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate
staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise
taxes, audit and other fees for professional services and legal compliance.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Under the full cost accounting method, we capitalize costs within a cost
center and then systematically expense those costs on a units of production basis based on proved oil and natural gas
reserve quantities. We calculate depletion on the following types of costs: (i) all capitalized costs, other than the cost of
investments in unproved properties and major development projects for which proved reserves cannot yet be assigned,
less accumulated amortization; (ii) the estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing proved reserves; and
(iii) the estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs, net of estimated salvage values. We calculate depreciation
on the cost of fixed assets related to other fixed assets.
Impairment expense. This is the cost to reduce proved oil and gas properties to the calculated full cost ceiling value.

Other income (expense)
62
Interest income. This represents the interest received on our cash and cash equivalents.
Interest expense. We finance a portion of our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and acquisitions with
borrowings under our credit facility. We incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and
our financing decisions. We reflect interest paid to our lender in interest expense. In addition, we include the
amortization of deferred financing costs (including origination and amendment fees), commitment fees and annual
agency fees in interest expense.
Loss on derivative contracts. We utilize commodity derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to
fluctuations in the price of crude oil. This amount represents (i) the recognition of unrealized gains and losses
associated with our open derivative contracts as commodity prices change and commodity derivative contracts expire
or new ones are entered into, and (ii) our realized gains and losses on the settlement of these commodity derivative
instruments.
Loss from equity investment. This line item represents our proportionate share of the earnings and losses from our
investment in the membership interests of Muskie, an equity method investment.
Income tax expense. As of June 30, 2012, we were a limited liability company treated as a disregarded entity for federal
income tax purposes. Accordingly, no provision for federal or state corporate income taxes has been provided for the
six months ended June 30, 2012 or prior fiscal years because taxable income is allocated directly to our equity holders.
Prior to the completion of this offering, Windsor Permian will become our wholly-owned subsidiary and, because we
are a subchapter C corporation under the Internal Revenue Code, the earnings at Windsor Permian will become subject
to federal and state entity-level taxation. We will establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and
book basis of our assets and liabilities, and we will record a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from
continuing operations. On a pro forma basis, at June 30, 2012 the amount of this charge would have been $37.4
million. It is anticipated that the company will be subject to a future, total combined federal and state income tax rate of
34% to 36%.

(1) After giving effect to our hedging arrangements in effect during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, the average prices per Bbl of oil and per BOE were $80.07 and $66.60, respectively, during the six months
ended June 30, 2012 and $95.46 and $80.15, respectively, during the six months ended June 30, 2011. After giving effect
to our hedging arrangements in effect during 2009, the average prices per Bbl of oil and per BOE (on a combined basis)
were $41.59 and $35.35, respectively, during that year. Average prices for our hydrocarbons were not impacted by our
hedging arrangements during 2011 or 2010.
Six Months ended June 30, 2012 Compared to Six Months ended June 30, 2011
Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Revenues. Our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by
approximately $9.7 million, or 45%, to $31.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 from $22.0 million for the
six months ended June 30, 2011. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production
volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. Average daily production sold increased by 817
BOE/d during the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011. The total increase in
revenue of approximately $9.7 million is largely attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas
production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2011.
Production increased by 111,844 Bbls of oil, 20,368 Bbls of natural gas liquids and 107,309 Mcf of natural gas for the
six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2011. The net dollar effect of the
decreases in prices of approximately $2.4 million (calculated as the change in period-to-period average prices times
current period production volumes of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas) and the net dollar effect of the increase in
production of approximately $12.1 million (calculated as the increase in period-to-period volumes for oil, natural gas
liquids and natural gas times the period average prices) are shown below.

Lease Operating Expense. Lease operating expense was $6.1 million ($14.44 per BOE) for the six months ended
June 30, 2012, an increase of $1.8 million, or 42%, from $4.3 million ($15.60 per BOE) for the six months ended
June 30, 2011. The increase is due to increased drilling activity, which resulted in additional producing wells for the six
months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2011. On a per-BOE
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
65
basis, our lease operating expense decreased $1.29, or 8%, as our well failure rate decreased period-to-period under
the leadership of our new executive team, resulting in reduced costs for the repair and replacement of downhole
equipment and reduced downtime and loss of production as these failures were remediated. Our lease operating
expense during both periods was also adversely impacted by the cost of processing and treating non-hydrocarbon
gases from certain of our wells that came on-line in 2011. During the third quarter of 2012, we intend to complete both
oil and water gathering systems that will transport this gas stream to a sour gas pipeline, thereby eliminating the
monthly processing and treating expense, and reducing water trucking, respectively. We believe that our reduced well
failure rate and the completion of the gathering systems will help reduce our lease operating expense on a per-BOE
basis in future periods.
Production Tax Expense. Production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 4.9% for the six months
ended June 30, 2012, a decrease of 0.1% from 5.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2011. Production taxes are
primarily based on the market value of our production at the wellhead and may vary across the different counties in
which we operate. Total production taxes increased $0.5 million, from $1.1 million during the six months ended
June 30, 2011 to $1.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2012 as a result of higher production and an
increase in the market value of our production.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $2.8 million, or
38%, from $7.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011 to $10.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
The weighted average depletion rate was $24.22 per BOE for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and $26.72 per BOE
for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decrease in depletion rate was due primarily to an increase in proved
reserves at June 30, 2012.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased $1.4 million from $1.4 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2011 to $2.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012. A $2.7 million increase
primarily attributable to salary and equity based compensation expense for our new executive team was partially offset
by the capitalization of $1.8 million of such salary and equity based compensation expense.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $2.1 million, as compared to $1.1
million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, an increase of $1.0 million. Our weighted average outstanding
principal under our credit agreement was $96.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 as compared to $57.0
million for the same period in 2011 with increased borrowings primarily used to fund our increased drilling activity.
Hedging Activities. We have used price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil
sales. In these swaps, we received the fixed price per the contract and paid a floating market price to the counterparty
based on New York Mercantile Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price
payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
On October 4, 2011, in an effort to lock-in prices on our anticipated base level of production, while at the same time
providing downside protection for our borrowing base, we entered into West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil
swaps on the NYMEX for the calendar years 2012 and 2013 of 1,000 barrels per day priced at $78.50 and $80.55,
respectively. The counterparties to our derivative contracts as of June 30, 2012 are Hess Corporation, or Hess, and BNP
Paribas, or BNP, which we believe are acceptable credit risks.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The fair value of
swaps is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other
things, futures prices and time to maturity.
Set forth below are the summarized amounts, terms and fair values of outstanding instruments held as of June 30, 2012
and December 31, 2011. As of June 30, 2012, we had unrealized losses under all of our crude oil swaps. We may seek
to settle some or all of these swaps after the closing of this offering with a portion of the net proceeds depending upon
our assessment of market conditions.

We enter into counter-swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking-in the value of a swap. Under the counter-
swap, we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter-swap
is effective in locking-in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely
offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter-swap.
In December 2007, we entered into a swap contract covering 1,680,000 Bbls of crude oil for the period from January
2008 to December 2012 at various fixed prices. In April 2008, we entered into a series of counter-swaps to lock-in the
value of certain of these swaps settling 1,188,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. In June 2009, we entered into an additional
series of counter-swaps to lock-in the value of the remaining swaps settling 324,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. Hess is
the counterparty to this swap and each counter-swap.
Set forth below are the summarized amounts, terms and fair values of the locked-in swaps from the April 2008

We are required to provide margin deposits whenever our unrealized losses with Hess exceed predetermined credit
limits. We had a margin deposit held by Hess of $0.8 million and $2.3 million as of June 30, 2012 and December 31,
2011, respectively, which earns interest that is remitted to us. Under our master netting agreement with Hess, we have
offset this margin deposit against its derivative positions.
Year ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2010
Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Revenues. Our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by
approximately $20.8 million, or 78%, to $47.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 from $26.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 2010. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production
volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. Average daily production sold increased by 501
BOE/d during the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the same period in 2010. The total increase in revenue
of approximately $20.8 million is largely attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production
volumes and an increase in the prices of oil and natural gas liquids realized for the year ended December 31, 2011 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. Production increased by 161,101 Bbls of oil, 6,837 Bbls of natural gas
liquids and 89,793 Mcf of natural gas for the year ended 2011 as compared to the year ended 2010. The net dollar effect
of the increase in prices of approximately $7.7 million (calculated as the change in year-to-year average prices times
current year production volumes of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas) and the net dollar effect of the increase in
production of approximately $13.0 million (calculated as the increase in year-to-year volumes for oil, natural gas liquids
and natural gas times the prior year average prices) are shown below.

Lease Operating Expense. Lease operating expense was $10.3 million ($17.31 per BOE) for the year ended
December 31, 2011, an increase of $5.7 million, or 125%, from $4.6 million ($11.07 per BOE) for the year ended
December 31, 2010. The increase is due to increased drilling activity, which resulted in additional producing wells for
the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. On a per-BOE basis, the increase
is due to cost increases in services and supplies (primarily as a result of higher demand for such services and supplies
in the Permian Basin and higher commodity prices), the cost of repairing and replacing downhole equipment due to
rod and tubing configurations and pumping practices that resulted in a higher rate of well failures during 2011 and the
associated downtime and loss of production as these failures were remediated. Our lease operating expense for the
year ended December 31, 2011 was also adversely impacted by the cost of processing and treating non-hydrocarbon
gases from certain of our wells that came on line in 2011.

During the third quarter of 2012, we intend to complete both oil and water gathering systems that will transport this gas
stream to a sour gas pipeline, thereby eliminating the monthly processing and treating expense, and reduce water
trucking, respectively. We believe that our reduced well failure rate and the completion of the gathering systems will
help reduce our lease operating expense on a per-BOE basis in future periods.
Production Tax Expense. Production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 4.9% for the year ended
December 31, 2011 as compared to 5.1% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Production taxes are primarily based
on the market value of our production at the wellhead and vary across the different counties in which we operate. Total
production taxes increased $1.0 million, or 73.3%, from $1.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 to $2.3
million during the year ended December 31, 2011 as a result of higher production and an increase in the market value
of our production.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $7.3 million, or
89.1%, from $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 to $15.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.
The weighted average depletion rate was $25.40 per BOE for the year ended December 31, 2011 and $17.78 per BOE for
the year ended December 31, 2010. The depletion rate increase was due primarily to an increase in costs and a
decrease in proved reserves at December 31, 2011 for the reasons described in “Business—Oil and Gas Data”
beginning on page 95 of this prospectus.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense increased $0.5 million from $3.1 million for
the year ended December 31, 2010 to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. A $1.9 million increase
primarily attributable to salary and equity based compensation expense for our new executive team was partially offset
by the capitalization of $0.9 million of such expense and a $0.5 million increase in COPAS overhead payments due to
increased drilling activity.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $2.5 million, as compared to $0.8 million
for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of $1.7 million. Our weighted average outstanding principal under
our credit agreement was $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $24.3 million for 2010 due
to our increased drilling activity.
Hedging Activities. We have used price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil
sales. In these swaps, we received the fixed price per the contract and paid a floating market price to the counterparty
based on New York Mercantile Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price
payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty.
On October 4, 2011, in an effort to lock-in prices on our anticipated base level of production, while at the same time
providing downside protection for our borrowing base, we entered into West Texas Intermediate light sweet crude oil
swaps on the NYMEX with BNP for the calendar years 2012 and 2013 of 1,000 barrels per day priced at $78.50 and
$80.55, respectively. The counterparties to our derivative contracts as of December 31, 2011 are Hess and BNP, which
we believe are acceptable credit risks.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The fair value of
swaps is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other
things, futures prices and time to maturity.

Set forth below are the summarized amounts, terms and fair values of outstanding instruments held as of December 31,
2011. As of December 31, 2011, we had unrealized losses under all of our crude oil swaps. We may seek to settle some
or all of these swaps after the closing of this offering with a portion of the net proceeds depending upon our
assessment of market conditions.

We enter into counter-swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking-in the value of a swap. Under the counter-
swap, we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter-swap
is effective in locking-in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely
offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter-swap.
In December 2007, we entered into a swap contract covering 1,680,000 Bbls of oil for the period from January 2008
through December 2012 at various fixed prices. In April 2008, we entered into a series of counter-swaps to lock-in the
value of certain of these swaps settling 1,188,000 Bbls of oil swaps. In June 2009, we entered into an additional series
of counter-swaps to lock-in the value of the remaining swaps settling 324,000 Bbls of oil swaps.
Set forth below are the summarized amounts, terms and fair values of the locked-in swaps from the April 2008
settlements as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

We are required to provide margin deposits whenever our unrealized losses with Hess exceed predetermined credit
limits. We had a margin deposit held by Hess of $2.3 million and $6.5 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, which earns interest that is remitted to us. Under our master netting agreement with Hess, we have offset
this margin deposit against its derivative positions.
Year ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year ended December 31, 2009
Oil, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Revenues. Our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas revenues increased by
approximately $13.7 million, or 108%, to $26.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2010 from $12.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2009. Our revenues are a function of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production
volumes sold and average sales prices received for those volumes. Average daily production sold increased by
365 BOE/d during the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The total
increase in revenue of approximately $13.7 million is largely attributable to higher oil, natural gas liquid and natural
gas production volumes as well as an increase in oil, natural gas liquid and natural gas prices realized for the year
ended December 31, 2010 as compared to year ended December 31, 2009. Production increased by 111,980 Bbls of oil,
9,594 Bbls of natural gas liquids and 70,526 Mcf of natural gas during 2010 as compared to 2009. The net dollar effect of
the increase in prices of approximately $6.7 million (calculated as the change in year-to-year average prices times
current year production volumes for oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas) and the net dollar effect of the change in
production of approximately $7.0 million (calculated as the increase in year-to-year volumes for oil, natural gas liquids
and natural gas times the prior year average prices) are shown below.

Lease Operating Expense. Lease operating expense was $4.6 million ($11.07 per BOE) for the year ended December 31,
2010, an increase of $2.2 million, or 92%, from $2.4 million ($8.41 per BOE) for the year ended December 31, 2009. The
increase is due to increased drilling activity, which resulted in additional producing wells in 2010 as compared to 2009.
On a per-BOE basis, the increase is due to cost increases in services and supplies, primarily as a result of the
increased demand for such services and supplies in the Permian Basin, and increased commodity prices as well as
additional well failure repairs coupled with downtime associated with the failures impacting production.
Production Tax Expense. Production taxes as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales were 5.1% for the year ended
December 31, 2010 as compared to 5.2% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Production taxes are primarily based
on the market value of our production at the wellhead and vary across the different counties in which we operate. Total
production taxes increased $0.6 million, or 86%, from $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $1.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 2010 as a result of higher production and an increase in the market value of our
production.
Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense increased $4.9 million, or
153%, from $3.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.
The weighted average depletion rate was $11.21 per BOE in 2009 and $17.78 per BOE in 2010. The higher depletion rate
in 2010 was due primarily to downward reserve revisions due to undeveloped locations being scheduled for
development beyond five years and thus being excluded from proved reserves.
On December 31, 2009, we adopted the new SEC rules related to disclosures of oil and natural gas reserves. As a result
of these new SEC rules, we recorded additional proved reserves and utilized the additional proved reserves in our
depletion computation for 2009. Our 2009 depletion expense rate was $11.21 per BOE, which is lower in part due to
these additional proved reserves.
General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense decreased $2.0 million, or 39%, from $5.1
million for the year ended December 31, 2009 to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. This decrease was
primarily due to a reduction in our labor force. As our capital expenditure programs result in increased production
levels, we expect that general and administrative expense per unit of production will continue to decrease.
Interest Expense. Interest expense for 2010 was $0.8 million as compared to an interest expense of $0.01 million for
2009. During the year ended December 31, 2010, $0.2 million of our interest was capitalized and our weighted average
outstanding principal under our credit agreement was $24.3 million, which was used primarily to fund our increased
drilling program. During the year ended December 31, 2009, most of the interest was capitalized and our weighted
average outstanding principal was $5.7 million.
Hedging Activities. We have used price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil
sales. In these swaps, we received the fixed price per the contract and paid a floating market price to the counterparty
based on New York Mercantile Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price
payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. The counterparty to all of our derivative
contracts is Hess, which we believe is an acceptable credit risk.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The fair value of
swaps is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other
things, futures prices and time to maturity.
We enter into counter-swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking-in the value of a swap. Under the counter-
swap, we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter-swap
is effective in locking-in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely
offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter-swap.

In December 2007, we entered into a swap contract covering 1,680,000 Bbls of oil for the period from January 2008
through December 2012 at various fixed prices. In April 2008, we entered into a series of counter-swaps to lock-in the
value of certain of these swaps settling 1,188,000 Bbls of oil swaps. In June 2009, we entered into an additional series
of counter-swaps to lock-in the value of the remaining swaps settling 324,000 Bbls of oil swaps. We have not entered
into any new swap contracts since the initial contract in December 2007. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, all swap
contracts were locked-in with counter swaps.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Historically, our primary sources of liquidity have been capital contributions and loans from our equity sponsor,
borrowings under our credit facility and cash flows from operations. Our primary use of capital has been for the
acquisition, development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties. We regularly evaluate potential capital
sources, including equity and debt financings, in an effort to meet our planned capital expenditures and liquidity
requirements. Our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on our ability to
access outside sources of capital.

Operating Activities
On a historical basis, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2012 as compared to $13.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The increase in operating cash flows is due
to an overall increase in production revenues, partially offset by increased expenses, as discussed above in “—Results
of Operations” beginning on page 64. The increase in production is largely a result of our increased drilling activities
throughout 2012 and 2011.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $30.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to $5.2
million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase in operating cash flows is due to an overall increase in
production revenues, partially offset by increased expenses, as discussed above in “—Results of Operations” on page
64. The increase in production is largely a result of our increased drilling activities throughout 2011.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to $2.7
million for the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in operating cash flows is due to an overall increase in
production revenues, partially offset by increased expenses, as discussed above in “—Results of Operations” on page
64. The increase in production volumes is largely a result of our increased drilling program in 2010. The increase in
operating activities was partially offset by changes in our working capital components in 2010 which consisted
primarily of the purchase of inventory of tubular goods for our drilling program and increased accounts receivables
due to the increase in our drilling activities in 2010.
Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for the oil
and natural gas we produce. Prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions.
Regional and worldwide economic activity, weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions
for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict.

Investing Activities
74
On a historical basis, we used cash for investing activities of $59.4 million and $38.4 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
During the first six months ended 2012, we spent $47.3 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling
program in which we participated in the drilling of 24 gross (16 net) wells. We spent an additional $7.7 million on
leasehold costs, $0.6 million for the purchase of other property and equipment and $3.8 million, net, on the settlement
of our derivative transactions.
The purchase and development of oil and natural gas properties accounted for the majority of our cash outlays for
investing activities. We used cash for investing activities of $76.3 million, $53.1 million and $32.1 million during the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
During 2011, we spent $72.2 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we
participated in the drilling of 54 gross (31 net) wells. We spent an additional $3.2 million on leasehold costs, $0.4
million for the purchase of other property and equipment, $4.2 million for the purchase of certain assets, real estate
and leasehold interests which were subsequently contributed to Muskie and $2.5 million for the purchase of drilling
rigs and other equipment which were subsequently contributed to Bison. These amounts were partially offset by
proceeds of $6.0 million from a partial sale of our equity investment, $0.05 million from the sale of property and
equipment and $0.08 million from the settlement of non-hedge derivative investments and margin deposits.
During 2010, we spent $39.0 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we
participated in the drilling of 40 gross (25 net) wells. We spent an additional $3.5 million for the purchase and
development of leasehold interests, $11.7 million for the purchase of drilling rigs, well servicing equipment and other
equipment which were subsequently contributed to Bison and $0.2 million for the settlement of non-hedge derivative
instruments and margin deposits. These amounts were partially offset by the $1.3 million we received from the sale of
approximately 10,946 net acres of non producing acreage in the Permian Basin.
During 2009, we spent $24.0 million on capital expenditures in conjunction with our drilling program in which we
participated in the drilling of 12 gross (nine net) wells. We spent an additional $2.7 million for the purchase and
development of leasehold interests in the Permian Basin and $5.5 million for the net amount of the settlement of non-
hedge derivative instruments and margin deposits.

Net cash provided by financing activities for the first six months of 2012 was $32.3 million as compared to $23.3 million
for the first six months of 2011. During the first six months of 2012 and 2011, we borrowed $15.0 million and $23.6
million, respectively, under our revolving credit facility and received capital contributions from entities controlled by
Wexford, our equity sponsor, of $4.0 million and zero, respectively. During the first six months of 2012, we also
borrowed $14.1 million of subordinated debt from Wexford. These proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling
costs and purchase property and equipment. During the six months ended June 30, 2012, we paid $0.7 million for costs
associated with this offering.
Net cash provided by financing activities for 2011 was $48.6 million as compared to $49.6 million for 2010. During 2011,
we borrowed $40.2 million under our revolving credit facility and received capital contributions from entities controlled
by Wexford, our equity sponsor, of $9.2 million. These proceeds were used primarily to fund our drilling costs and
purchase property and equipment.
Net cash provided by financing activities for 2010 was $49.6 million as compared to $23.8 million for 2009. The net cash
provided by financing activities in 2010 is primarily attributable to borrowings of $61.1 million under our revolving
credit facility, partially offset by principal payments of $24.0 million under our prior credit facility with the Bank of
Oklahoma, N.A. During 2010, we received capital contributions from entities controlled by Wexford, our equity sponsor,
of $18.8 million which were partially offset by distributions to Wexford of $5.6 million. We paid $0.7 million in debt
issuance costs in 2010. We used the net proceeds from our financing activities during 2010 to fund our drilling costs,
the purchase of property and equipment, the purchase of tubular goods inventory and the acquisition and development
of leasehold.
Net cash provided by financing activities for 2009 was $23.8 million as compared to $80.2 million for 2008. The net cash
provided by financing activities in 2009 is attributable to borrowings of $7.7 million under our revolving credit facility
and $16.9 million of capital contributions from entities controlled by Wexford, our equity sponsor, which amounts were
partially offset by distributions to Wexford of $0.6 million. We paid $0.1 million for debt issuance costs and costs
relating to the preparation for the initial public offering. We used

the net proceeds from our financing activities to fund our drilling program, the purchase of property and equipment,
the acquisition and development of leasehold and the settlement of our non-hedge derivative instruments.
Existing Revolving Credit Facility
On October 15, 2010, we entered into a senior secured revolving credit agreement with BNP Paribas, or BNP, as
administrative agent for the several lenders, as amended, providing for a revolving credit facility. The maximum
availability under the facility is subject to scheduled semi-annual and other elective collateral borrowing base
redeterminations based on our oil and natural gas reserves. The outstanding borrowings bear interest at a rate elected
by us that is currently based on the prime, LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 1.25% to 3.50%
depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base.
Principal may be optionally repaid from time to time and is required to be paid (a) if the loan amount exceeds the
borrowing base, whether due to a borrowing base redetermination or otherwise, and (b) at the maturity date of
October 15, 2014. We are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee equal to 0.5% per year of the unused portion of
the borrowing base. The loan is secured by substantially all of our assets. The borrowing base is re-determined semi-
annually with effective dates of April 1st and October 1st. In addition, we may request up to three additional
redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. The borrowing base was $45.0 million at
December 31, 2010. The borrowing base was increased several times during 2011 as a result of redeterminations and at
December 31, 2011 the borrowing base was $100.0 million. Under the terms of the revolving credit agreement as
currently in effect, the borrowing base will remain at $100.0 million through July 15, 2013 or, if earlier, the closing date
of this offering, at which time the borrowing base will be reduced to $90.0 million, subject to the periodic and elective
borrowing base redeterminations described above. However, we expect that our borrowing base will be increased
above the $90.0 million borrowing base level as a result of our acquisition of the oil and gas properties subject to the
Gulfport transaction and those properties owned by Windsor UT. Notwithstanding future redeterminations of the
borrowing base, the aggregate maximum credit amount under the revolving credit agreement is $250.0 million. As of
June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, we had outstanding borrowings of $100.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively.
Borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.75% at June 30, 2012 and
3.3% at December 31, 2011. We intend to repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility with a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering.
Our revolving credit agreement contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants. These covenants, among other
things, prohibit additional indebtedness, additional liens, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and
distributions, transactions with affiliates and entering into certain swap agreements and require the maintenance of
various financial ratios described below.
On May 10, 2012, our revolving credit agreement was further amended to provide for the resignation of BNP, and the
appointment of Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, as administrative agent for the lenders. The
amendment also permitted certain restricted payments and subordinated debt in an initial principal amount not to
exceed $30.0 million, including any such indebtedness evidenced by our subordinated note with an affiliate of Wexford
described in more detail under “—Subordinated Note” below.
Table of Contents

77
As of July 24, 2012, our revolving credit agreement was amended and restated to include Diamondback Energy LLC
and its subsidiaries as additional guarantors to the facility. The covenant prohibiting additional indebtedness was also
amended to allow the issuance of unsecured debt of up to $250.0 million and, in connection with any such issuance,
the reduction of the borrowing base by 25% of the principal amount of such issuance. A borrowing base reduction in
connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the loan to be repaid. The
amendment also provided that redemptions of any unsecured debt will be restricted unless certain liquidity
requirements are met. Further, the amendment modified certain financial ratios, the current requirements of which are
described below.
Financial Covenant
Ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense
Ratio of total debt to EBITDAX
Ratio of total debt to EBITDAX (after closing date of this offering)
Ratio of debt under revolving credit agreement to EBITDAX

   Not greater than 4.5 to 1.0
   Not greater than 4.0 to 1.0
   Not greater than 3.0 to 1.0
Not less than 1.0 to 1.0
Our revolving credit agreement defines EBITDAX, for any period, as the sum of our consolidated net income for such
period plus the following expenses or charges to the extent deducted from our consolidated net income for such
period: interest; income taxes; depreciation, depletion, amortization and exploration expenses; extraordinary items and
other similar non-cash charges, including expenses related to stock-based compensation and hedging, minus all non-
cash income added to our consolidated net income.
On July 31, 2012, we further amended our revolving credit agreement to provide for the issuance to Gulfport of the
Gulfport transaction note and the payment of the Gulfport transaction note from the proceeds of this offering.
As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our revolving
credit facility. The lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility upon the
occurrence of any event of default unless we cure any such default within any applicable cure period. For payments of
interest under our revolving credit facility, we have a three business day grace period, and a 30-day cure period for
most covenant defaults, except for defaults of certain covenants, including the financial covenants and negative
covenants under our revolving credit facility.
Subordinated Note
Effective May 14, 2012, we issued a subordinated note to an affiliate of Wexford pursuant to which the Wexford affiliate
may, from time to time, advance up to an aggregate $25.0 million. These advances are solely at the lender’s discretion
and neither Wexford nor any of its affiliates has any commitment or obligation to provide further capital support to us.
The note bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.28% or 8% per annum, whichever is lower. Interest is due
quarterly in arrears beginning on July 1, 2012. Interest payments are payable in kind by adding such amounts to the
principal balance of the note. The unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest on the note are due and payable in
full on January 31, 2015 or the earlier completion of this offering. Any indebtedness evidenced by this note is
subordinate in the right of payment to any indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility. As of August
13, 2012, there was $24.5 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under this note. We will repay the
outstanding borrowings under this note with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering.
Prior Revolving Credit Facility
On September 17, 2009, we entered into a revolving credit facility with the Bank of Oklahoma, N.A., or BOK. The BOK
revolving credit facility had a maximum principal amount of $50.0 million, subject to a collateral borrowing base
calculation which was based on the underlying reserve value of the oil and natural gas
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
78
properties securing the credit facility and outstanding letters of credit. The BOK revolving credit facility was repaid in
full in October 2010 with borrowings under the BNP revolving credit facility and then terminated.
Borrowings under the BOK revolving credit facility bore interest at our election of either BOK’s listed national prime
rate plus an interest rate spread ranging from 1.0% to 2.5% (based on borrowing levels) payable monthly or at LIBOR
rates plus an interest rate spread ranging from 2.5% to 4.0% (based on borrowing levels) payable at the end of the
applicable interest period. The credit facility agreement allowed BOK to charge a 0.25% commitment fee on the unused
available borrowing.
The BOK revolving credit facility was collateralized by oil and natural gas properties and contained certain financial
and non-financial covenants, which included: providing quarterly financial statements and annual audited financial
statements; providing semi-annual reserve engineering reports; restrictions on distributions to members; restrictions
on incurring additional debt; restrictions on financial derivative contracts; maintaining a funded debt to earnings before
hedge gains or losses, asset gains or losses, depreciation, depletion, amortization and interest expense of no greater
than 3.0 to 1.0.
Capital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity
We currently anticipate our 2012 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure will be approximately $140.0 million to
$150.0 million after giving effect to the Transactions. We intend to allocate these expenditures as follows:
•
•
•
•
$116.0 million for the drilling and completion of operated wells;
$10.5 million for our participation in the drilling and completion of non-operated wells;
$8.0 million for leasehold acquisitions; and
$6.0 million for the construction of infrastructure to support production, including investments in water disposal
infrastructure and gathering line projects.
During the six months ended June 30, 2012, aggregate capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure after giving
effect to the Transactions were $70.7 million while our capital expenditures without giving effect to the Transactions
were $56.6 million.
However, the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. We could
choose to defer a portion of these planned 2012 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including but
not limited to the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the
availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits
and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other interest
owners.
Based upon current oil and natural gas price expectations for 2012, following the closing of this offering we believe that
our cash flow from operations, proceeds of this offering and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be
sufficient to fund our operations through year-end 2013. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of
variables, including the level of oil and natural gas production and prices, and significant additional capital
expenditures will be required to more fully develop our properties. We cannot assure you that operations and other
capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures.
Further, our capital expenditure budget for 2012 allocates $8.0 million to leasehold interest and property acquisitions.
In the event we make additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have
available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures and/or
seek additional capital. If we require additional capital for that or other reasons, we may seek such capital through
traditional reserve base borrowings, joint venture partnerships, production payment financings, asset sales, offerings
of debt and equity securities or other means. We cannot assure you that needed capital will be

79
available on acceptable terms or at all. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may
be required to curtail our current drilling programs, which could result in a loss of acreage through lease expirations.
In addition, we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us or finance the capital expenditures
necessary to replace our reserves.

(1) Consists of the outstanding principal amount at December 31, 2011 under our revolving credit facility. This table does not
include future commitment fees, interest expense or other fees payable under this floating rate facility as we cannot predict
the timing of future borrowings and repayments or interest rates to be charged. All borrowings under our revolving credit
facility are due on October 15, 2014.
(2) Amounts represent our estimates of future asset retirement obligations. Because these costs typically extend many years
into the future, estimating these future costs requires management to make estimates and judgments that are subject to
future revisions based upon numerous factors, including the rate of inflation, changing technology and the political and
regulatory environment. Please read Note 4 to our audited financial statements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States. Below, we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies, estimates
and judgments. We believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in
preparation of our financial statements. See Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing
elsewhere in this prospectus for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management.
Use of Estimates
Certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be
estimated by our management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that
cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and
assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts and other
methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly
from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
80
from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become
known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of proved reserve quantities
and related estimates of the present value of future net revenues, the carrying value of oil and gas properties and asset
retirement obligations.
Method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties
We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting. Accordingly, all
costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and natural gas properties, including the
costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized. We also
capitalize direct operating costs for services performed with internally owned drilling and well servicing equipment.
General and administrative costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs incurred
directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs associated
with overseeing the exploration and development activities. All general and administrative corporate costs unrelated to
drilling activities are expensed as incurred. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted
for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would
significantly change. Income from services provided to working interest owners of properties in which we also own an
interest, to the extent they exceed related costs incurred, are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs of oil and
natural gas properties. Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production
method based on proved reserves.
Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until we have made a determination
as to the existence of proved reserves. We assess all items classified as unevaluated property on a quarterly basis for
possible impairment. We assess properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually
insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors, among others: intent to drill; remaining
lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of proved reserves;
and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these factors
indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the
associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization. The inclusion of
our unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be completed within three years.
Oil and natural gas reserve quantities and standardized measure of future net revenue
Our independent engineers and technical staff prepare our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and associated
future net revenues. The SEC has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of oil and gas which geological
and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs
under existing economic and operating conditions. The process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex,
requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data.
The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including
additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of
production under changing economic conditions. As a result, material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur
from time to time. Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the
most accurate assessments possible, the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties
increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates. If such changes are material, they could significantly
affect future amortization of capitalized costs and result in impairment of assets that may be material.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. Oil and
natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural
gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
81
of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and
production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates
are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
Revenue recognition
Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and
allowances, as applicable. We account for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales method, whereby
a liability is recorded when our volumes exceed our estimated remaining recoverable reserves. No receivables are
recorded for those wells where we have taken less than our ownership share of production. We did not have any gas
imbalances as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 or as of June 30, 2012. Revenues from oil and natural gas services
are recognized as services are provided.
Impairment
The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which
the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent
capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization,
impairment and deferred income taxes exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas
reserves, less any related income tax effects, the excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. In calculating future
net revenues, effective December 31, 2009, prices are calculated as the average oil and gas prices during the preceding
12-month period prior to the end of the current reporting period, determined as the unweighted arithmetic average first-
day-of-the-month prices for the prior 12-month period and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate
quarterly period.
Asset retirement obligations
ASC Topic 410 requires companies to record a liability relating to the retirement and removal of assets used in their
businesses. ASC Topic 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation be recorded in
the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the corresponding cost be
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. For oil and gas properties, this is the period
in which the well is drilled or acquired. The asset retirement obligation represents the estimated amount we will incur
to plug, abandon and remediate the properties at the end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable state
laws. The liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated on the unit-of-
production method.
We determine the asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the
liability. Estimating the future asset retirement obligation requires management to make estimates and judgments
regarding timing, existence of a liability, as well as what constitutes adequate restoration. Inherent in the fair value
calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted
discount rates, timing of settlement and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To
the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing asset retirement obligation
liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the related asset.
Derivatives
From time to time, we have used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in
the market price of crude oil. We recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value.
The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has
been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship. We
enter into counter-swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking-in the value of a swap. Under the counter-swap,
we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
82
fixed price to the counterparty. The counter-swap is effective in locking-in the value of a swap since subsequent
changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter-
swap. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the
hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Changes
in the fair value of instruments designated as a fair value hedge offset changes in the fair value of the hedge item and
changes in the fair value of instruments designated as cash flow hedges are shown in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as
hedging instruments, the unrealized gain or loss on the change in fair value of these instruments are recognized in
earnings during the period of change. None of our derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 or for the six months ended June 30, 2012.
Equity-Based Compensation
During the year ended December 31, 2011, we granted to our executive officers options to acquire membership interests
in our Company. Such options vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the date
of grant and are exercisable for five years from the date of grant. Generally, in the event more than 50% of the
combined voting power of our Company is not owned by Wexford or its affiliates and there is a material change in the
terms of the option holder’s employment, the options will vest immediately. Summarized below are the grant dates
with the total exercise prices and total fair values of the underlying options:

At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, for outstanding options, the intrinsic value was $112,500 and $112,500,
respectively, and the weighted-average remaining contractual terms were 4.1 and 4.6 years, respectively. Also, at June
30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, no options were exercisable.
We account for such options issued using a fair-value-based method calculated on the grant-date of the award. The
resulting cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire option.
The fair value of the options issued was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. One of the inputs to
this model is the estimate of the fair value of the underlying membership interest on the date of grant. The other inputs
include an estimate of the expected volatility of the membership interest, an option’s expected term, the risk-free
interest rate over the option’s expected term, the option’s exercise price and our expectations regarding dividends.
We do not have a history of market prices for our membership interests because such interests are not publicly traded.
We utilized the observable data for a group of peer companies that grant options to assist in developing our volatility
assumption. The expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility for a peer group of companies. The
expected term for options issued was determined based on the contractual terms of the awards. The weighted-average
risk-free interest rate was based on the daily U.S. treasury yield curve rate whose term was consistent with the expected
life of the options. We do not anticipate paying cash dividends; therefore, the expected dividend yield was assumed to
be zero.

We assumed no annual forfeiture rate because of our lack of turnover and lack of history for this type of award. We will
continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of
employee turnover behavior and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on
reported equity-based compensation expense, because the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense
amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.
We perform annual valuations to estimate our enterprise value. Our valuations consider a number of objective and
subjective factors that we believe market participants would consider, including: (a) our business, financial condition,
and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations; (b) our forecasted operating
performance and projected future cash flows; (c) the liquid or illiquid nature of our membership interest; (d) liquidation
preferences, redemption rights and other rights and privileges of our membership interest; (e) market multiples of our
most comparable public peers; and (f) market conditions affecting our industry.
We used the income approach to estimate our enterprise value. The income approach involves applying an appropriate
risk-adjusted discount rate to projected cash flows based on forecasted revenue and costs. The valuations were based
primarily on our independent engineering oil and gas reserve reports which are generally a cash flow model of the
Company. There were no significant events during the year that caused us to adjust these values at the various grant
dates.
There is inherent uncertainty in our forecasts and projections and, if we had made different assumptions and estimates
than those described previously, the amount of our equity-based compensation expense could have been materially
different.
Equity-based compensation expense recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $582,221. The unrecognized
equity-based compensation expense as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $3,531,255 and $4,113,477,
respectively, related to these awards which is expected to be recognized over a weight-average period of 3.1 and 3.6
years, respectively. Equity-based compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was not material.
Recent accounting pronouncements
Fair Value
In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2011-11, which increases disclosures
about offsetting assets and liabilities. New disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to
understand significant quantitative differences in balance sheets prepared under GAAP and International Financial
Reporting Standards related to the offsetting of financial instruments. The existing GAAP guidance allowing balance
sheet offsetting, including industry-specific guidance, remains unchanged. The guidance in ASU No. 2011-11 is
effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The disclosures should be
applied retrospectively for all prior periods presented. We do not expect the adoption of this new guidance to have a
significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

Comprehensive Income
84
In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income: Presentation of
Comprehensive Income,” which provides amendments to FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income.” The
purpose of the amendments in this update is to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner
transactions that affect an entity’s equity. The amendments eliminate the option to report other comprehensive income
and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity and require an entity to present the total of
comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a
single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update 2011-12 which defers the requirement in Accounting Standards Update 2011-05 that
companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in
both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements. Both amendments are
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. The
adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash
flow.
Emerging Growth Company
The JOBS Act permits an “emerging growth company” like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to
comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We are choosing to “opt out” of this
provision and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are
adopted. This decision to opt out of the extended transition period is irrevocable.
Internal Controls and Procedures
We are not currently required to comply with the SEC’s rules implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of
2002, and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting for that purpose. Upon becoming a public company, we will be required to comply with the SEC’s
rules implementing Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which will require our management to certify
financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will not be required to make our first assessment of
our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 until the year following our first annual report required
to be filed with the SEC.
Inflation
Inflation in the United States has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results
of operations for the years ended 2009, 2010 and 2011. Although the impact of inflation has been insignificant in recent
years, it is still a factor in the United States economy and we tend to experience inflationary pressure on the cost of
oilfield services and equipment as increasing oil and gas prices increase drilling activity in our areas of operations.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risks
Commodity Price Risk
Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production. Realized pricing is
primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our natural gas
production. Pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we
expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of
our control.
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
85
We use price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil sales. Under these swap
contracts, we receive a fixed price per barrel of oil and pay a floating market price per barrel of oil to the counterparty
based on New York Mercantile Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price
payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. For the purpose of locking-in the value of
a swap, we enter into counter-swaps from time to time. Under the counter-swap, we receive a floating price for the
hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty. The counter-swap is effective in locking-in the value of a
swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the
market value of the counter-swap.
In December 2007, we placed a swap contract covering 1,680,000 Bbls of crude oil for the period from January 2008 to
December 2012 at various fixed prices. In April 2008, we entered into a series of counter-swaps to lock-in the value of
certain of these swaps settling 1,188,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. In June 2009, we entered into an additional series of
counter-swaps to lock-in the value of the remaining swaps settling 324,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. In October 2011 we
placed a swap contract covering 730,000 Bbls of crude oil for the period from January 2012 to December 2013 at a fixed
price of $78.50 for 2012 and $80.55 for 2013. Such contracts and any future hedging arrangements may expose us to
risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices
increase. In addition, these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil.
At June 30, 2012, we had a net liability derivative position of $5.5 million related to our price swap derivatives.
Counterparty and Customer Credit Risk
Our principal exposures to credit risk are through receivables resulting from joint interest receivables (approximately
$10.5 million at June 30, 2012) and receivables from the sale of our oil and natural gas production (approximately $4.8
million at June 30, 2012).
We are subject to credit risk due to the concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant
customers. We do not require our customers to post collateral, and the inability of our significant customers to meet
their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. For the six months
ended June 30, 2012, three purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Plains Marketing, L.P. (63%);
Andrews Oil Buyers Inc. (13%); and Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. (12%). For the years ended December 31, 2011
and 2010, one purchaser, Windsor Midstream LLC, an entity controlled by Wexford, our equity sponsor, accounted for
approximately 78% and 81% of our revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, two purchasers
accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Windsor Midstream LLC (68%) and DCP Midstream, LP (14%). No other
customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods.
Joint operations receivables arise from billings to entities that own partial interests in the wells we operate. These
entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we intend to drill. We have little
ability to control whether these entities will participate in our wells. At June 30, 2012, we had two customers that
represented approximately 94% of our total joint operations receivables. At each of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we
had one customer that represented approximately 68% and 62%, respectively, of our total joint operations receivables.
Prior to 2010, we did not operate the wells and, therefore, did not have joint operations receivables.
Interest Rate Risk
We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under our revolving
credit facility with Wells Fargo. The terms of our revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo provide for interest on
borrowings at a floating rate equal to prime, LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from
Table of Contents

86
1.25% to 3.50% depending on the base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing
base. Borrowings under our revolving credit facility bore interest at a weighted average rate of 3.75% as of June 30,
2012. An increase or decrease of 1% in the interest rate would have a corresponding decrease or increase in our net
income (loss) of approximately $1.0 million annually, based on the $100.0 million outstanding in the aggregate under
our revolving credit facility as of June 30, 2012, and assuming no interest is capitalized. Pending use of the net
proceeds from this offering to fund our exploration and development activities and for general corporate purposes, we
intend to repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Please read Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this prospectus for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies, some of which are not
recognized in the balance sheets under GAAP.

BUSINESS
We are an independent oil and natural gas company currently focused on the acquisition, development, exploration
and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas. This
basin, which is one of the major producing basins in the United States, is characterized by an extensive production
history, a favorable operating environment, mature infrastructure, long reserve life, multiple producing horizons,
enhanced recovery potential and a large number of operators.
We began operations in December 2007 with our acquisition of 4,134 net acres with production at the time of
acquisition of approximately 800 BOE/d from 34 gross (16.8 net) wells in the Permian Basin. Subsequently, we acquired
approximately 26,875 additional net acres, which brought our total net acreage position in the Permian Basin to 31,009
net acres at June 30, 2012 and, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had 51,623 net acres. We are the operator of
approximately 99% of this acreage. As of June 30, 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had drilled 159 gross
(147 net) wells, and participated in an additional 15 gross (six net) non-operated wells, in the Permian Basin. Of these
174 gross wells, 160 were completed as producing wells and 14 were in various stages of completion. In the aggregate,
as of June 30, 2012, we held interests in 194 gross (177 net) producing wells in the Permian Basin.
We built our current leasehold position through the following acquisitions and development activities in the Wolfberry
play:
•
•
•
•
In 2008, we acquired 6,247 net acres at the Spanish Trail and Munn prospects in Midland County, Texas through 11
leases and one mineral deed, with 5,146 net acres attributable to one lease;
Commencing in 2008 and ending in 2010, we acquired leases at the Barron prospect in Midland County, Texas that
currently cover 225 net acres;
Commencing in 2008 and ending in 2011, we acquired leases at the Gist prospect in Ector County, Texas covering
1,452 net acres;
Commencing in 2008 and ending in 2012, we acquired 37 leases at the UL prospect in Andrews, Upton and Reagan
Counties, Texas covering a total of 10,006 net acres;
•
Beginning in 2008, we acquired 17 leases at the Hurt/WHL prospect in Ector County, Texas covering 2,779 net acres;
•
In 2009, we acquired one lease at the Cumberland prospect located in Midland County, Texas covering 207 net acres;
•
•
•
In 2010, we acquired leases at the North Howard prospect located in Howard County, Texas that currently cover 131
net acres;
In 2010 and 2011, we acquired leases at the Big Max prospect located in Andrews County, Texas that currently cover
848 net acres; and
In 2012, we acquired leases in the Clete and Hume prospects in Crockett County, Texas that currently cover 4,979
net acres.
Our activities are primarily focused on the Clearfork, Spraberry, Wolfcamp, Cline, Strawn and Atoka formations, which
we refer to collectively as the Wolfberry play. The Wolfberry play is characterized by high oil and liquids rich natural
gas, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production history, long-lived reserves and high drilling
success rates. The Wolfberry play is a modification and extension of the Spraberry play, the majority of which is
designated in the Spraberry Trend area field. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the Spraberry
trend area ranks as the second largest oilfield in the United States, based on 2009 reserves.

As of December 31, 2011, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves pro forma for the Transactions were 39,460
MBOE based on reserve reports prepared by Ryder Scott Company L.P., or Ryder Scott, our independent reserve
engineers. Of these reserves, approximately 21.7% are classified as proved developed producing, or PDP. Proved
undeveloped, or PUD, reserves included in this estimate are from 329 gross well locations on 40-acre spacing. As of
December 31, 2011, these proved reserves were approximately 66% oil, 20% natural gas liquids and 14% natural gas.
We have 925 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on our evaluation of applicable geologic and
engineering data, and we have an additional 1,122 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20-acre
downspacing. These identified potential drilling locations do not include any potential horizontal drilling locations. We
intend to grow our reserves and production through development drilling, exploitation and exploration activities on
this multi-year project inventory of identified potential drilling locations and through acquisitions that meet our
strategic and financial objectives, targeting oil-weighted reserves. Our estimated ultimate recoveries, or EURs, from
future PUD wells on 40-acre spacing, as estimated by Ryder Scott, range from 102 MBOE per well, consisting of 46
MBbls of oil, 143 MMcf of natural gas and 32 MBbls of natural gas liquids, to 158 MBOE per well, consisting of 112
MBbls of oil, 113 MMcf of natural gas and 27 MBbls of natural gas liquids, with an average EUR per well of 135 MBOE,
consisting of 93 MBbls of oil, 102 MMcf of natural gas and 25 MBbls of natural gas liquids. We also intend to continue
to refine our drilling pattern and completion techniques in an effort to increase our average EUR per well from vertical
wells drilled on 40-acre spacing. We currently anticipate a reduction of approximately 20% in our EURs from vertical
wells drilled on 20-acre spacing. Our 2012 drilling plan currently contemplates drilling 58 gross (54 net) vertical wells
on 40-acre spacing and two gross (two net) horizontal wells in the Wolfberry play. As of June 30, 2012, we were using
three drilling rigs and, upon completion of this offering, intend to increase our drilling program to six or seven rigs.
We believe the experience gained from our historical drilling programs and the information obtained from the results of
extensive industry drilling activity in the Permian Basin have helped us reduce the risk and uncertainity associated with
drilling vertical wells on our Permian Basin acreage. We intend to supplement our vertical development drilling activity
with horizontal wells targeting various intervals in the Wolfberry play. Our horizontal drilling program is intended to
further capture the upside potential that may exist on our properties and increase our well performance and recoveries
as compared to drilling vertical wells alone.
During 2011, we assembled a new executive team and, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011, this team assumed
management control of our operations and development activities in the Permian Basin. With an average of
approximately 24 years of industry experience per person, this team has extensive experience in the Permian Basin as
well as other resource plays in North America, including significant experience in drilling and completing horizontal
wells. Under the direction of our new executive team, the average drilling time required to reach total depth, or TD, was
shortened by 25% to 15 days during the fourth quarter of 2011 from 20 days during the second quarter of 2011, and our
average gross well cost (including drilling and completion cost) was reduced from $2.6 million during the second
quarter of 2011 to $2.5 million during the first quarter of 2012. We also reduced the time from spud to production from
an average of 68 days during the fourth quarter of 2011 to an average of 50 days during the first quarter of 2012. Also,
during the quarter ended June 30, 2012 our average daily production, pro forma for the Transactions, was 3,637 BOE/d,
consisting of 2,579 Bbls/d of oil, 2,757 Mcf/d of natural gas and 599 Bbls/d of natural gas liquids, an increase of 13%, or
409 BOE/d, from 3,229 BOE/d, consisting of 2,365 Bbls/d of oil, 2,267 Mcf/d of natural gas and 486 Bbls/d of natural gas
liquids, for the quarter ended March 31, 2012. This increase was due primarily to improved strategies and procedures
introduced by our new executive team relating to wellbore configuration, completion, execution, fluid recovery and well
pumping practices that significantly reduced the level of required well remediation and the associated loss of
production. We anticipate further increases in efficiencies as our new executive team executes on our development
strategies across our acreage base.

drilling locations on which we actually drill wells will ultimately depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, oil
and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors.
Includes 60 gross (56 net) wells for which we are the operator and nine gross (three net) non-operated wells.

(3) During June 2012.
We currently anticipate our 2012 capital budget for drilling and infrastructure will be approximately $140.0 million to
$150.0 million after giving effect to the Transactions. Of this amount, we plan to spend approximately $116.0 million on
the drilling and completion of 58 gross (54 net) operated vertical wells and two gross and two net horizontal wells,
$10.5 million for the drilling and completion of nine gross (three net) non-operated wells, $8.0 million for leasehold
acquisitions and $6.0 million for the construction of infrastructure to support production, including investments in
water disposal infrastructure and gathering line projects. During the six months ended June 30, 2012, our aggregate
capital expenditures for drilling and infrastructure after giving effect to the Transactions were $70.7 million.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to increase stockholder value through the following:
•
•
Grow production and reserves by developing our oil-rich resource base. We intend to actively drill and develop
our acreage base in an effort to maximize its value and resource potential. Through the conversion of our undeveloped
reserves to developed reserves, we will seek to increase our production, reserves and cash flow while generating
favorable returns on invested capital. As of June 30, 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had 925
identified potential vertical drilling locations on our acreage in the Permian Basin based on 40-acre spacing and an
additional 1,122 such locations based on 20-acre downspacing. We believe the drilling of these locations will provide
us with the critical subsurface data necessary to target potential horizontal horizons. Our 2012 drilling plan currently
contemplates drilling 58 gross (54 net) vertical wells and two gross (two net) horizontal wells in the Wolfberry play. We
ended 2011 with a two rig drilling program which we increased to four drilling rigs in 2012. As of June 30, 2012, we
were using three drilling rigs. Upon completion of this offering, we intend to increase our drilling program to six or
seven rigs. Subject to market conditions and rig availability, we expect to operate up to eight rigs in the first half of
2013, which we expect will allow us to significantly increase our drilling program in 2013.
Focus on increasing hydrocarbon recovery through horizontal drilling and increased well density. We believe
there are opportunities to target various intervals in the Wolfberry play with horizontal wells and we currently plan to
drill two gross (two net) horizontal wells in 2012 to target these producing horizons. Our first horizontal well was
completed in Upton County in June, 2012 with a 4,000 foot lateral and a 30-day average initial production rate of 486
BOE/d. Our horizontal drilling program is designed to further capture the upside potential that may exist on our
properties. We also believe our horizontal drilling program may significantly increase our recoveries per section as
compared to drilling vertical wells alone. Horizontal drilling may also be economical in areas where vertical drilling is
currently not economical or logistically viable. In addition, we believe increased well density opportunities may exist
across our acreage base. We closely monitor industry trends with respect to higher well density, which could increase
the recovery factor per section and enhance returns since infrastructure is typically in place.

Leverage our experience operating in the Permian Basin. Our executive team, which has an average of
approximately 24 years of industry experience per person and significant experience in the Permian Basin, intends to
continue to seek ways to maximize hydrocarbon recovery by refining and enhancing our drilling and completion
techniques. The time to reach TD for our vertical Wolfberry wells decreased from an average of 20 days during the
•
•
•
second quarter of 2011 to an average of 15 days during the fourth quarter of 2011, resulting in a lower total well cost.
Our focus on efficient drilling and completion techniques, and the resulting reduction in time to reach TD, is an
important part of the continuous drilling program we have planned for our significant inventory of identified potential
drilling locations. In addition, we believe that the experience of our new executive team in deviated and horizontal
drilling and completions should help reduce the execution risk normally associated with these complex well paths.
Additionally, our completion techniques are continually evolving as we evaluate hydraulic fracturing practices that may
potentially increase recovery and reduce completion costs. Our executive team regularly evaluates our operating
results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to benchmark our performance against the best
performing operators and evaluate and adopt best practices.
Enhance returns through our low cost development strategy of resource conversion, capital allocation and
continued improvements in operational and cost efficiencies. In the current commodity price environment, our oil
and liquids rich asset base provides attractive returns. Our acreage position in the Wolfberry play is generally in
contiguous blocks which allows us to develop this acreage efficiently with a “manufacturing” strategy that takes
advantage of economies of scale and uses centralized production and fluid handling facilities. We are the operator of
approximately 99% of our acreage. This operational control allows us to more efficiently manage the pace of
development activities and the gathering and marketing of our production and control operating costs and technical
applications, including horizontal development. Our average 86.2% working interest in our acreage pro forma for the
Transactions allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these expected improvements and cost efficiencies.
Pursue strategic acquisitions with exceptional resource potential. We have a proven history of acquiring
leasehold positions in the Permian Basin that we believe have substantial oil-weighted resource potential and can
achieve attractive returns on invested capital. Our executive team, with its extensive experience in the Permian
Basin, has what we believe is a competitive advantage in identifying acquisition targets and a proven ability to
evaluate resource potential. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions that meet our strategic and financial targets.
Maintain Financial flexibility. We seek to maintain a conservative financial position. As of June 30, 2012, on a pro
forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding
borrowings under our revolving credit facility, we would have had $         million of available borrowing capacity under
such facility. We expect that we will fund our capital development plans for 2012 from our operating cash flow and
borrowings under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay the
outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility pending their use to fund our capital expenditures.
Our Strengths
We believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals:
•
Oil rich resource base in one of North America’s leading resource plays. All of our leasehold acreage is located
in one of the most prolific oil plays in North America, the Permian Basin in West Texas. As of June 15, 2012, the
Baker Hughes Rig Count survey reported that there were 453 rigs drilling in the Permian Basin. The majority of our
current properties are well positioned in the core of the Wolfberry play. We believe that our historical vertical
development success will be complemented with horizontal drilling locations that could ultimately translate into an
increased recovery factor on a per section basis. Our production was approximately 74% oil, 15% natural gas liquids
and 11% natural gas for both the

year ended December 31, 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2012. As of December 31, 2011, after giving
year ended December 31, 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2012. As of December 31, 2011, after giving
effect to the Transactions, our estimated net proved reserves were comprised of approximately 66% oil and 20%
natural gas liquids. This oil and liquids exposure allows us to benefit from their currently more favorable prices as
compared to natural gas.
Multi-year drilling inventory in one of North America’s leading oil resource plays. We have identified a multi-
year inventory of potential drilling locations for oil-weighted reserves that we believe provides attractive growth and
return opportunities. As of June 30, 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we had 925 identified potential
vertical drilling locations based on 40-acre spacing and an additional 1,122 identified potential vertical drilling locations
based on 20-acre downspacing. In 2012, after giving effect to the Transactions, we anticipate drilling 58 gross (54 net)
vertical operated wells, which represent only approximately 6.2% of our identified vertical potential drilling locations on
40-acre spacing at June 30, 2012. We also believe that there are a significant number of horizontal locations that
could be drilled on our acreage. We expect to drill two gross (two net) horizontal operated wells during 2012 targeting
three different producing horizons. Management currently estimates that EURs for our horizontal wells will be
approximately 400 MBOE. In addition, the liquids rich natural gas component of our inventory adds value with Btu
content ranging from 1,225 MMBtu to 1,528 MMBtu and our June 2012 natural gas liquids yield was 118 Bbls/MMcf.
In addition, we have approximately 117 square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic data covering our acreage. This data
facilitates the evaluation of our existing drilling inventory and provides insight into future development activity,
including horizontal drilling opportunities and strategic leasehold acquisitions.
Experienced, incentivized and proven management team. Our new executive team has an average of
approximately 24 years of industry experience per person, most of which is focused on resource play development.
This team has a proven track record of executing on multi-rig development drilling programs and extensive experience
in the Permian Basin. In addition, our executive team has significant experience with both drilling and completing
horizontal wells as well as horizontal well reservoir and geologic expertise, which will be of strategic importance as we
expand our future development plans to include horizontal drilling. Prior to joining us, our Chief Executive Officer held
management positions at Apache Corporation, Laredo Petroleum Holdings, Inc. and Burlington Resources.
Favorable and stable operating environment. We have focused our drilling and development operations in the
Permian Basin, one of the oldest hydrocarbon basins in the United States, with a long and well-established production
history and developed infrastructure. With approximately 380,000 wells drilled in the Permian Basin since the 1940s,
we believe that the geological and regulatory environment is more stable and predictable, and that we are faced with
less operational risks, in the Permian Basin as compared to emerging hydrocarbon basins.
High degree of operational control. We are the operator of approximately 99% of our Permian Basin acreage. This
operating control allows us to better execute on our strategies of enhancing returns through operational and cost
efficiencies and increasing ultimate hydrocarbon recovery by seeking to continually improve our drilling techniques,
completion methodologies and reservoir evaluation processes. Additionally, as the operator of substantially all of our
acreage, we retain the ability to adjust our capital expenditure program based on commodity price outlooks. This
operating control also enables us to obtain data needed for efficient exploration of horizontal prospects.
Financial flexibility to fund expansion. Upon the completion of this offering, we will have a conservative balance
sheet. We will seek to maintain financial flexibility to allow us to actively develop our drilling, exploitation and
exploration activities in the Wolfberry play and maximize the present value of our oil-weighted resource potential. As
of June 30, 2012, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and the use of proceeds from this offering to
repay the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, we would have had $90.0 million of available
borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. We expect that our borrowing base will be increased as a result
of the Transaction.

locations based on 20-acre downspacing. These identified potential drilling locations do not include any potential
horizontal drilling locations. The drilling locations on which we actually drill wells will ultimately depend on the
availability of capital, regulatory approvals, oil and natural gas prices, costs, actual drilling results and other
factors.

Permian Basin
Location and Land
We acquired approximately 4,134 net acres in West Texas (near Midland) in the Permian Basin on December 20, 2007,
with an effective date of November 1, 2007, from ExL Petroleum, LP, Ambrose Energy I, Ltd. and certain other sellers.
Subsequently, we acquired approximately 26,875 additional net acres, which brought our total net acreage position in
the Permian Basin to approximately 31,009 net acres at June 30, 2012 and, after giving effect to the Transactions, we
had 51,623 net acres. Since our initial acquisition in the Permian Basin through June 30, 2012, we drilled or
participated in the drilling of 169 gross (101 net) wells (or 174 gross (153 net) wells after giving effect to the
Transactions) on our leasehold in this area, primarily targeting the Wolfberry play. We are the operator of
approximately 99% of our Permian Basin acreage. The Permian Basin area covers a significant portion of western
Texas and eastern New Mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the United States.
Area History
Our proved reserves are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas, in particular in the Clearfork, Spraberry,
Wolfcamp, Cline, Strawn and Atoka formations. The Spraberry play was initiated with production from several new field
discoveries in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was eventually recognized that a regional productive trend was present,
as fields were extended and coalesced over a broad area in the central Midland Basin. Development in the Spraberry
play was sporadic over the next several decades due to typically low productive rate wells, with economics being
dependent on oil prices and drilling costs.
The Wolfcamp formation is a long-established reservoir in West Texas, first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for
deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties. Exploration using
2-D seismic data located additional fields, but it was not until the use of 3-D seismic data in the 1990s that the greater
extent of the Wolfcamp formation was revealed. The additional potential of the shales within this formation as reservoir
rather than just source rocks was not recognized until very recently.
During the late 1990s, Atlantic Richfield Company, or Arco, began a drilling program targeting the base of the
Spraberry formation at 10,000 feet, with an additional 200 to 300 feet drilled to produce from the upper
93

Index to Financial Statements
portion of the Wolfcamp formation. Henry Petroleum, a private firm, owned interests in the Pegasus field in Midland
and Upton counties. While drilling in the same area as the Arco project, Henry Petroleum decided to drill completely
through the Wolfcamp section. Henry Petroleum mapped the trend and began acquiring acreage and drilling wells
using multiple slick-water fracturing treatments across the entire Wolfcamp interval. In 2005, former members of Henry
Petroleum’s Wolfcamp team formed their own private company, ExL Petroleum, and began replicating Henry
Petroleum’s program. After ExL had drilled 32 productive Wolfcamp/Spraberry wells through late 2007, they monetized
a portion of their acreage position, which led to the acquisition that enabled us to begin our participation in this play.
Recent advancements in enhanced recovery techniques and horizontal drilling continue to make this play attractive to
the oil and gas industry. By mid-2010, approximately half of the rigs active in the Permian Basin were drilling wells in
the Wolfberry play. As of June 30, 2012, we held interests in 194 gross (177 net) producing wells.
Geology
The Permian Basin formed as an area of rapid Mississippian-Pennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the Ouachita
fold belt. It is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the U.S., and has oil and gas production from several reservoirs
from Permian through Ordovician in age. The term “Wolfberry” was coined initially to indicate commingled production
from the Permian Spraberry, Dean and Wolfcamp formations. In this prospectus, we refer to the Clearfork, Spraberry,
Wolfcamp, Cline, Strawn and Atoka formations collectively as the Wolfberry play. The Wolfberry play of the Midland
Basin lies in the area where the historically productive Spraberry trend geographically overlaps the productive area of
the emerging Wolfcamp play. The Spraberry was deposited as turbidites in a deep water submarine fan environment,
while the Wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debris-flow and grain-flow sediments, which were also deposited in a
submarine fan setting. The best carbonate reservoirs within the Wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the
Central Basin Platform, while the shale reservoirs within the Wolfcamp thicken basinward away from the Central Basin
Platform. Both the Spraberry and Wolfcamp contain organic-rich mudstones and shales which, when buried to
sufficient depth for maturation, became the source of the hydrocarbons found in the reservoirs.
The Wolfberry play can be generally characterized as a combination of low-permeability clastic, carbonate and shale
reservoirs which are hydrocarbon-charged and are economic due to the overall thickness of the section (more than
3,000 feet) and application of enhanced stimulation (fracking) techniques. The Wolfberry is an unconventional “basin-
centered oil” resource play, in the sense that there is no regional downdip oil/water contact.
Several shale intervals within the Wolfcamp formation are currently being evaluated for horizontal development
potential, with initial drilling expected in 2012. The shales exhibit micro-darcy permeabilities, which result in relatively
small drainage areas and recovery factors. Because of this, we believe the horizontal exploitation of these reservoirs
will supplement, and not replace, the vertical development program.
There are also productive carbonate and shale intervals within the shallower Permian Clearfork formation. Two shale
intervals within the Clearfork formation are currently being evaluated for potential horizontal development. Below the
Wolfcamp formation lie the Pennsylvanian Strawn and Atoka formations. Although difficult to predict, there are
conventional pay intervals that develop locally within these formations which, when present, can add significant
reserves.
Debris flows within the Spraberry and Wolfcamp carbonates have been observed on 3-D seismic surveys. Initial tests
have confirmed the presence of enhanced reservoir. Additionally, structural closures have been mapped and are being
evaluated for drilling to test deeper targets. Our extensive geophysical database, which includes approximately 117
square miles of proprietary 3-D seismic data, will be used to enhance grading of future locations.
Ryder Scott, an independent petroleum engineering firm, has estimated that at December 31, 2011, proved reserves net
to our interest in these assets were approximately 24,750 MBOE, of which 22.0% were classified as
94

proved developed producing, or PDP. Proved undeveloped, or PUD, reserves included in this estimate were from 293
gross well locations on 40-acre spacing. The proved reserves are generally characterized as long-lived, with predictable
production profiles.
Production Status
In June 2012, net production from our Permian Basin acreage, pro forma for the Transactions, was 114,660 BOE, or an
average of 3,822 BOE/d, of which 71% was oil, 17% was natural gas liquids and 12% was natural gas. From January 1,
2011 through December 31, 2011, our average daily net production from our Permian Basin acreage, pro forma for the
Transactions, was 2,512 BOE/d, of which 72% was from oil, 16% was from natural gas liquids and 12% was from
natural gas.
Facilities
Our land oil and gas processing facilities are typical of those found in the Permian Basin. Our facilities located at well
locations include storage tank batteries, oil/gas/water separation equipment and pumping units.
Recent and Future Activity
During 2011, 54 gross (31 net) wells were drilled on our Permian Basin acreage for an aggregate estimated net cost of
$82.2 million. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, 56 gross (49 net) wells were drilled on our
Permian acreage during 2011. As of June 30, 2012, we had 925 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on
40-acre spacing and an additional 1,122 identified potential vertical drilling locations based on 20-acre downspacing.
We currently expect to drill an estimated 58 gross (54 net) vertical wells and two gross (two net) horizontal wells on our
acreage in 2012. The wells are expected to be drilled to approximately 11,200 feet at an estimated average completed
gross well cost of approximately $1.9 million to $2.4 million per vertical well and $6.0 million to $7.0 million per
horizontal well. In this prospectus, we define identified potential drilling locations as locations specifically identified
by management as an estimation of our multi-year drilling activities based on evaluation of applicable geologic and
engineering data on 40-acre or 20-acre downspacing as indicated. The availability of local infrastructure, drilling
support assets and other factors as management may deem relevant, such as easement restrictions and state and local
regulations, are considered in determining such locations. The drilling locations on which we actually drill wells will
ultimately depend upon the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, seasonal restrictions, oil and natural gas
prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors.
Oil and Gas Data
Proved Reserves
SEC Rule-Making Activity
In December 2008, the SEC released its final rule for “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting.” These rules require
disclosure of oil and gas proved reserves by significant geographic area, using the arithmetic 12-month average
beginning-of-the-month price for the year, as opposed to year-end prices as had previously been required unless
contractual arrangements designate the price to be used. Other significant amendments included the following:
•
Disclosure of unproved reserves: probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis.
•
Proved undeveloped reserve guidelines: reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of
confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years, unless
the specific circumstances justify a longer time.
•
Reserves estimation using new technologies: reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in
Reserves estimation using new technologies: reserves may be estimated through the use of reliable technology in

•
Reserves personnel and estimation process: additional disclosure is required regarding the qualifications of the chief
technical person who oversees the reserves estimation process. We are also required to provide a general discussion
of our internal controls used to assure the objectivity of the reserves estimate.
•
Non-traditional resources: the definition of oil and gas producing activities has expanded and focuses on the
marketable product rather than the method of extraction.
We adopted the rules effective December 31, 2009, as required by the SEC.
Evaluation and Review of Reserves
Our historical reserve estimates were prepared by Ryder Scott as of December 31, 2011 and by Pinnacle as of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, in each case with respect to our assets in the Permian Basin. Reserve estimates for
properties attributable to Windsor UT and the properties subject to the Gulfport transaction were prepared, in each
case, by Ryder Scott as of December 31, 2011.
Each of Ryder Scott and Pinnacle is an independent petroleum engineering firm. The technical persons responsible for
preparing our proved reserve estimates meet the requirements with regards to qualifications, independence, objectivity
and confidentiality set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves
Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Neither independent third-party engineering firm
owns an interest in any of our properties or is employed by us on a contingent basis.
Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and
engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date
forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government
regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that
renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation.
If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of
confidence that the quantities will be recovered.” All of our 2011 proved reserves were estimated using a deterministic
method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the
estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the
uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules.
The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally
accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1)
performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or
in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. The proved reserves for
our properties were estimated by performance methods, analogy or a combination of both methods. Approximately
85% of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods. These
performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of
available historical production and pressure data. The remaining 15% of the proved reserves were estimated by
analogy, or a combination of performance and analogy methods. The analogy method was used where there were
inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance
data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate. All proved developed non-producing and
undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method.
To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, Ryder Scott considered many
factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and
engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing
requirements and forecasts of future production rates. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated
proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our
96
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
proved reserves included production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical
logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data.
We maintain an internal staff of petroleum engineers and geoscience professionals who worked closely with our
independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved
reserves relating to our assets in the Permian Basin. Our internal technical team members met with our independent
reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve report to discuss the assumptions and
methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to the independent reserve
engineers for our properties such as ownership interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices and
operating and development costs. Our Vice President—Reservoir Engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing
the preparation of all of our reserve estimates. Our Vice President—Reservoir Engineering is a petroleum engineer with
over 30 years of reservoir and operations experience and our geoscience staff has an average of approximately 26 years
of industry experience per person. Our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership
interest, oil and gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs.
The preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures.
These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following:
•
review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by us;
•
preparation of reserve estimates by our Vice President—Reservoir Engineering or under his direct supervision;
•
review by our Vice President—Reservoir Engineering of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each
quarter, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions;
•
direct reporting responsibilities by our Vice President—Reservoir Engineering to our Chief Executive Officer; and
•
verification of property ownership by our land department.

(1) Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were prepared using an average price equal to the
unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within
the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in accordance with revised SEC guidelines
applicable to reserves estimates as of the end of such periods. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or
possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent
our net revenue interest in our properties. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production,
cash flows, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas
reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.
The foregoing reserves are all located within the continental United States. Reserve engineering is a subjective process
of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner.
The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and
production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil
and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future
net revenues are based on a number of variables and

assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices and future production
rates and costs. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 17 of this prospectus. We have not filed any estimates of total,
proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the SEC.
Additional information regarding our proved reserves can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations” and “—Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates” beginning on pages 59 and 80, respectively, of this prospectus, the notes to our consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this prospectus and the reserve reports as of December 31, 2011 included as
Appendices B, C and D to this prospectus.
Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUDs)
As of December 31, 2011, our proved undeveloped reserves totaled 12,912 MBbls of oil, 14,432 MMcf of natural gas and
3,530 MBbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of 18,847 MBOE. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the
Transactions, at December 31, 2011 our total proved undeveloped reserves would have totaled 20,140 MBbls of oil,
24,262 MMcf of natural gas and 5,871 MBbls of natural gas liquids for a total of 30,055 MBOE. PUDs will be converted
from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.
Changes in PUDs that occurred during 2011 on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions were primarily
due to:
•
Additions of 7,133 MBOE attributable to extensions resulting from strategic drilling of wells by us to delineate our
acreage position;
•
Conversion of approximately 3,620 MBOE attributable to PUDs into proved developed reserves;
•
Negative revisions of approximately 1,679 MBOE in PUDs due to revisions related to offset well performance;
•
•
Exclusion of 1,447 MBOE attributable to PUD locations that were not scheduled to be drilled within the next five
years; and
Movement of 6,116 MBOE from PUD to probable reserves due to changes in booking methodology used by our new
independent petroleum engineers and well performance in one prospect area. The 2011 reserve report prepared by
Ryder Scott assigned PUDs only in close proximity to seasoned production. The prior reports prepared by Pinnacle
utilized a methodology consistent with large resource basins where geologic risk is minimal. The methodology utilized
by Pinnacle typically results in a greater number of PUD locations than the “close proximity” method used by Ryder
Scott. There was also a shift of 2,748 MBOE from proved to probable reserves in one prospect area where existing
well performance declined more quickly than originally projected. Locations in this area were moved to the probable
reserve category until more production history is obtained to confirm the economic viability of the area.
Costs incurred relating to the development of PUDs were approximately $53.9 million during 2011 and approximately
$80.9 million on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2011.
Estimated future development costs relating to the development of PUDs are projected to be approximately $106.9
million in 2012, $165.2 million in 2013, $151.3 million in 2014, $131.0 million in 2015 and $124.0 million in 2016 after
giving effect to the Transactions. Since our new executive team assumed management control in 2011, our average
drilling costs and drilling times have been reduced. As we continue to develop our properties and have more well
production and completion data, we believe we will continue to realize cost savings and experience lower relative
drilling and completion costs as we convert PUDs into proved developed reserves in upcoming years.
All of our PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of 2016.
As of December 31, 2011, 2% of our total proved reserves were classified as proved developed non-producing.

Productive Wells
As of June 30, 2012, we owned an average 58.5% working interest in 190 gross (111 net) productive wells. On a pro
forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, at June 30, 2012 we would have owned an average 91.0% working
interest in 194 gross (177 net) productive wells. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of
production, including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections to commence deliveries and oil wells awaiting
connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest,
and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells.

As of December 31, 2011, we had 12 gross (6.4 net) wells in the process of drilling, completing or dewatering or shut in
awaiting infrastructure that are not reflected in the above table. Since our initial acquisition in the Permian Basin
through June 30, 2012, we drilled or participated in the drilling of 169 gross (101 net) wells in the Permian Basin (or 174
gross (153 net) wells after giving effect to the Transactions), of which we operate 154 gross (95 net) wells (or 159 gross
(147 net) net wells after giving effect to the Transactions). Of the 174 gross wells drilled, 160 were completed as
producing wells and 14 are in various stages of completion.
Operations
General
We are the operator of approximately 99% of our Permian Basin acreage. As operator, we design and manage the
development of a well and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. Independent
contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ
petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve production rates, increase reserves and
lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties.
Marketing and Customers
We market the majority of the oil and natural gas production from properties we operate for both our account and the
account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our natural gas production to purchasers at
market prices. In March 2009, we entered into an agreement with Windsor Midstream LLC, or Midstream, an entity
controlled by Wexford, our equity sponsor. During 2010 and 2011, Midstream purchased a significant portion of our oil
volumes. For a description of this agreement, see “Related Party Transactions—Marketing Services” on page 133 of
this prospectus. We sell all of our natural gas under contracts with terms of greater than twelve months and all of our
oil under contracts with terms of twelve months or less.
We normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration,
development and production business. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, three purchasers accounted for more
than 10% of our revenue: Plains Marketing, L.P. (63%); Andrews Oil Buyers, Inc. (13%); and Occidental Energy
Marketing, Inc. (12%). For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, one purchaser, Midstream, accounted for
approximately 78% and 81% of our revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2009, two purchasers
accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Windsor Midstream LLC (68%) and DCP Midstream, LP (14%). No other
customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. If a major customer decided to stop
purchasing oil and natural gas from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could
be harmed. However, based on the current demand for oil and natural gas, and the availability of other purchasers, we
believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets
and numerous purchasers.
On May 24, 2012, we entered into an oil purchase agreement with Shell Trading (US) Company, or Shell Trading, in
which we agreed to sell specified quantities of oil to Shell Trading. We are obligated to commence delivery of our oil to
Shell Trading upon completion of the reversal of the Longhorn pipeline and its conversion for oil shipment, which we
refer to as the completion date, which is currently anticipated to occur at the end of the first quarter of 2013. Our
agreement with Shell Trading has an initial term of five years from the completion date. Each party has the right to
terminate the agreement by written notice to the other party without any obligations to the other party in the event that
the completion date does not occur by January 15, 2014. The agreement may also be terminated by Shell Trading by
written notice to us in the event that Shell Trading’s contract for transportation on the pipeline is terminated.
Our delivery obligation under this agreement is 5,000 barrels per day from the service commencement date to March
31, 2013, 6,000 barrels per day from April 1, 2013 to September 30, 2013 and 8,000 barrels per day during the remainder
of the term of the agreement. We have a one-time right to elect to decrease the contract
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
102
quantity by not more than 20% of the then-current quantity, which decreased contract quantity will be effective for the
remainder of the term of the agreement. Shell Trading has agreed to pay to us the price per barrel of oil based on the
arithmetic average of the daily settlement price for “Light Sweet Crude Oil” Prompt Month future contracts reported by
the New York Mercantile Exchange over the one-month period, as adjusted based on adjustment formulas specified in
the agreement. If we fail to deliver the required quantities of oil under the agreement, we have agreed to pay Shell
Trading certain deficiency payments.
Transportation
During the initial development of our fields we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our
production. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems. The oil is then
transported by the purchaser by truck to a tank farm where it is further transported by pipeline. Our natural gas is
generally transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s pipeline interconnection point through our gathering
system.
Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater
resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream
and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These
companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to
define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human
resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during
periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the
burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which
would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in
the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions
in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many
companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and
natural gas properties.
Title to Properties
As is customary in the oil and gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties. At
such time as we determine to conduct drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination
and perform curative work with respect to significant defects prior to commencement of drilling operations. To the
extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for
curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have
cured any material title defects on such property. We have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing
properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards
generally accepted in the oil and gas industry. Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas
leases, we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and, depending on the materiality of properties, we may
obtain a title opinion, obtain an updated title review or opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. Our oil and
natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests, liens for current taxes and other burdens
which we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the properties.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the
mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties
and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 18.75% to 25.00%, resulting in a net revenue
interest to us generally ranging from 81.25% to 75.00%.

Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Regulation
Environmental Matters and Regulation
Our oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and
regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental
protection. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, issue
regulations which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and
criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may
require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of
various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities,
limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically
sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations,
such as plugging abandoned wells or closing pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits,
licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for
pollution resulting from our operations or relate to our owned or operated facilities. The strict and joint and several
liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon us regardless of fault. Moreover, it is not
uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage
allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and
costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements could materially
adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the oil and natural gas industry in general. Our
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we
have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these environmental requirements. This trend,
however, may not continue in the future.
Waste Handling. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes
and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities
by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of
hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the
provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes
associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation
as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent
requirements of non-hazardous waste provisions. However, we cannot assure you that the EPA or state or local
governments will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some
non-hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in
Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as “hazardous
wastes.” Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital
expenditures and operating expenses.
Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. We
believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements related to waste handling, and that we hold
all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations to the extent that our operations require
them under such laws and regulations. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as
presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration
and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act,
as amended, also known as CERCLA or the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, generally imposes strict and
joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are
considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
104
These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the
facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous
substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed “responsible parties” may be
subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes
(including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including
groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it
is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property
damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations,
we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state statutes. Therefore, governmental
agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part
of the costs to clean up sites at which such “hazardous substances” have been released.
Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the “Clean Water Act,”
the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Oil Pollution Act, or OPA, and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated
thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including
produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The
discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by
the EPA or the state. The Clean Water Act and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of
dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately
issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate
containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a
petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. These laws and regulations also prohibit certain activity in wetlands
unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has also adopted regulations
requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage
under general permits for storm water discharges. In addition, on October 20, 2011, the EPA announced a schedule to
develop pre-treatment standards for wastewater discharges produced by natural gas extraction from underground
coalbed and shale formations. The EPA stated that it will gather data, consult with stakeholders, including ongoing
consultation with industry, and solicit public comment on a proposed rule for coalbed methane in 2013 and a proposed
rule for shale gas in 2014. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing
storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of
our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or
operations that may impact groundwater conditions.
The Oil Pollution Act is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating
to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that
operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain
facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential
environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability
for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to,
the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters.
Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act or OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties,
as well as injunctive obligations. We believe we are in material compliance with the requirements of each of these laws.
Air Emissions. The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions
of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has
developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources.
New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to
obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
105
example, on April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new
emission controls for oil and natural gas production and processing operations, which regulations are discussed in
more detail on page 107 in “—Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing.” These laws and regulations may increase the costs
of compliance for some facilities we own or operate, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose
administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal
Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all
applicable air emissions regulations and that we hold all necessary and valid construction and operating permits for
our operations. Obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas
projects.
Climate Change. Many nations have agreed to limit emissions of “greenhouse gases” pursuant to the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the “Kyoto Protocol.” Methane, a primary component of
natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, are
“greenhouse gases,” or GHGs, regulated by the Kyoto Protocol. Although the United States is not participating in the
Kyoto Protocol at this time, several states or geographic regions have adopted legislation and regulations to reduce
emissions of GHGs. Additionally, on April 2, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA, that
the EPA has the authority to regulate the emission of carbon dioxide from automobiles as an “air pollutant” under the
federal Clean Air Act. Thereafter, in December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane
and other GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA,
emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. These findings
by the EPA allowed the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict
emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Subsequently, the EPA adopted two sets of
related rules, one of which purports to regulate emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other of which
regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources of emissions such as power plants or industrial
facilities. The EPA finalized the motor vehicle rule in April 2010 and it became effective January 2011, although it does
not require immediate reductions in GHG emissions. The EPA adopted the stationary source rule, also known as the
“Tailoring Rule,” in May 2010, and it also became effective January 2011, although it remains subject of several
pending lawsuits filed by industry groups. Additionally, in September 2009, the EPA issued a final rule requiring the
reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including natural gas liquids
fractionators and local natural gas/distribution companies, beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. More
recently, in November 2010, the EPA expanded its existing GHG reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and
natural gas production and onshore processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, which may include
certain of our facilities, beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. In addition, the EPA has continued to adopt
GHG regulations of other industries, such as the March 2012 proposed GHG rule restricting future development of coal-
fired power plants. As a result of this continued regulatory focus, future GHG regulations of the oil and gas industry
remain a possibility.
In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of
greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional
greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it
may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Most of
these cap and trade programs work by requiring major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants or major
producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances that
correspond to their annual emissions of GHGs. The number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year
until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. As the number of GHG emission allowances declines each
year, the cost or value of such allowances is expected to escalate significantly.
Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed in various states could adversely affect
the oil and natural gas industry. Currently, while we are subject to certain federal GHG monitoring and reporting
requirements, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and
Table of Contents

local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or
regulations addressing GHG emissions would impact our business.

Hydraulic fracturing is an important common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly
natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals
under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The Safe Drinking Water Act,
or SDWA, regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control, or UIC,
program. Hydraulic fracturing generally is exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing
process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. The EPA, however, has recently taken the position that
hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program, specifically as
“Class II” UIC wells. At the same time, the EPA has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of
hydraulic fracturing activities, and a committee of the U.S. House of Representatives is also conducting an
investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices. Moreover, the EPA announced on October 20, 2011 that it is also
launching a study regarding wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities and currently plans to propose
standards by 2014 that such wastewater must meet before being transported to a treatment plant. As part of these
studies, both the EPA and the House committee have requested that certain companies provide them with information
concerning the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. These studies, depending on their results, could
spur initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or otherwise.
In March 2011, companion bills entitled the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals (FRAC) Act, first
introduced in 2009, were reintroduced in the United States Senate and House of Representatives. These bills, which are
currently under consideration by Congress, would repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the SDWA, which
would have the effect of allowing the EPA to promulgate regulations requiring permits and implementing potential new
requirements on hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA. This development could, in turn, require state regulatory
agencies in states with programs delegated under the SDWA to impose additional requirements on hydraulic fracturing
operations. In addition, the bills would require persons using hydraulic fracturing, such as us, to disclose the chemical
constituents, but not the proprietary formulas, of their fracturing fluids to a regulatory agency, which would make the
information public via the internet. Additionally, fracturing companies would be required to disclose specific chemical
contents of fluids, including proprietary chemical formulas, to state authorities or to a requesting physician or nurse if
deemed necessary by the physician or nurse in connection with a medical emergency.
On April 17, 2012 the EPA approved final regulations under the federal Clean Air Act that establish new air emission
controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package
includes New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds ,
or VOCs, and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil
and natural gas production and processing activities. The final rule includes a 95% reduction in VOCs emitted by
requiring the use of reduced emission completions or “green completions” on all hydraulically-fractured wells
constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The rules also establish specific new requirements regarding
emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment. These rules will
require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions
from our wells by January 1, 2015. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased
capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business.
In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental
aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. The federal government is currently undertaking several studies of hydraulic
fracturing’s potential impacts, the results of which are expected between later in 2012 and 2014.

These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could
spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or other regulatory authorities.
Several states, including Texas, and the Department of the Interior, in a May 4, 2012 proposed rule covering federal
lands, have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in
certain circumstances and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. On May 31, 2011,
the Texas Legislature adopted new legislation requiring oil and gas operators to publicly disclose the chemicals used
in the hydraulic fracturing process. It was signed into law on June 17, 2011, effective as of September 1, 2011. The
Texas Railroad Commission has adopted rules and regulations implementing this legislation that will apply to all wells
for which the Railroad Commission issues an initial drilling permit on or after February 1, 2012. The new law requires
that the well operator disclose the list of chemical ingredients subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational
Safety and Health Act (OSHA) for disclosure on an internet website and also file the list of chemicals with the Texas
Railroad Commission with the well completion report. The total volume of water used to hydraulically fracture a well
must also be disclosed to the public and filed with the Texas Railroad Commission.
There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to use of fracturing fluids,
impacts on drinking water supplies, use of waters and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the
environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country
implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing, such
as the FRAC Act, are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate
production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to
initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely
affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, our fracturing
activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent
construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and
abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative
changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to
comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it
is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation
governing hydraulic fracturing.
Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation
affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing
the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to
issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of
which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas
industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do
not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with
similar types, quantities and locations of production.
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate
transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the
terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil
and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some
circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.

Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil
and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be
proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what
effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not
currently regulated and are made at market prices.
Drilling and Production. Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local level.
These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning
operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the
following:
•
the location of wells;
•
the method of drilling and casing wells;
•
the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;
•
the rates of production or “allowables”;
•
the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
•
the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
•
notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.
State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and
natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other
states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be
implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation
laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of
natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the
amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we
can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale
of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in
other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future
regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect
the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations we can drill.
Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or
decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where we operate. The U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and
abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require
bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation. Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of
the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. FERC has jurisdiction over the
transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural
Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have
resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first
sales,” which include all of our sales of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has
substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders,
including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.
FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under
which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas
Table of Contents

109
that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline
capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly
fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are
required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless
of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC’s initiatives have led to the
development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of
natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry
historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach
currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if
any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities.
Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, non-
discriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently
competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the
states onshore and in state waters. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain
jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our
costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
Oil Sales and Transportation. Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are
made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in
common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates
under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state
regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and
scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates
are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not
affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors.
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis.
Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same
terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorationing
provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation
services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
State Regulation. Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas,
including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6%
severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of
developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States
may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from natural gas wells
based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other
similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these
regulations may be to limit the amount of natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of
wells or locations we can drill.
The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws.
Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that
compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.

Operational Hazards and Insurance
The oil business involves a variety of operating risks, including the risk of fire, explosions, blow outs, pipe failures
and, in some cases, abnormally high pressure formations which could lead to environmental hazards such as oil
spills, natural gas leaks and the discharge of toxic gases. If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense
costs and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural
resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension
of operations.
In accordance with what we believe to be industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the
operating risks to which our business is exposed. We currently have insurance policies for property (including leased
oil and gas properties), general liability, operational control of certain wells, pollution, commercial auto, umbrella
liability, inland marine, workers compensation and other coverage. The limits for certain of our policies are as follows:
•
oil and gas lease property: $21,888,656 with a deductible ranging from $5,000 to $20,000 based on property value;
•
general liability: $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate with a $25,000 deductible;
•
pollution: $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate with a $50,000 deductible;
•
umbrella liability: $5,000,000 per occurrence with $5,000,000 aggregate coverage; and
•
inland marine: limit varies on a per rig basis from $3,586,000 to $7,155,000 with a $250,000 deductible per accident.
As noted above, most of our insurance coverage includes deductibles that must be met prior to recovery. Additionally,
our insurance is subject to exclusion and limitations, and there is no assurance that such coverage will fully or
adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences, damages and losses. Any of these operational
hazards could cause a significant disruption to our business. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a
material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
We reevaluate the purchase of insurance, policy terms and limits annually. Future insurance coverage for our industry
could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may
become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that we believe are economically acceptable. No assurance
can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may
elect to maintain minimal or no insurance coverage. We may not be able to secure additional insurance or bonding that
might be required by new governmental regulations. This may cause us to restrict our operations, which might
severely impact our financial position. The occurrence of a significant event, not fully insured against, could have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Generally, we also require our third party vendors to sign master service agreements in which they agree to indemnify
us for injuries and deaths of the service provider’s employees as well as contractors and subcontractors hired by the
service provider.
Employees
As of June 30, 2012, we had approximately 54 full time employees, including three geologists, three engineers and
three land professionals, all of whom are salaried administrative or supervisory employees. Of these 54 full time
employees, 14 work in our office in Midland, Texas. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered
by any collective bargaining agreements. We also hire independent contractors and consultants involved in land,
technical, regulatory and other disciplines to assist our full time employees.

Our corporate headquarters is located in Midland, Texas. We also lease additional office space in Midland and in
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. We believe that our facilities are adequate for our current operations.
Legal Proceedings
Due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or
claims related to our business activities, including workers’ compensation claims and employment related disputes. In
the opinion of our management, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

Capital Advisors LLC, or Greyhawke, which he co-founded in 1998. Prior to founding Greyhawke, Mr. Plaumann was a
Senior Vice President of Wexford. Mr. Plaumann was formerly a Managing Director of Alvarez & Marsal, Inc. and the
President of American Healthcare Management, Inc. He also was Senior Manager at Ernst & Young LLP. Mr. Plaumann
served as a director and audit committee chairman for ICx Technologies, Inc. until October 2010 and currently serves
as a director and audit committee chairman of Republic Airways Holdings, Inc., and a director of one private company.
Mr. Plaumann also has served as a director, an audit committee chairman and a member of the conflicts committee of
the general partner of Rhino Resource Partners LP, a coal operating company, since October 2010. Mr. Plaumann holds
an M.B.A. and a B.A. in Business from the University of Central Florida. We believe that Mr. Plaumann’s service on the
boards of other public companies and his executive management experience, including previous experience as
chairman of audit committees, qualifies him for service on our board of directors.
Our Board of Directors and Committees
Upon completion of this offering, our board of directors will consist of five directors, at least three of whom will satisfy
the independence requirements of current SEC rules and The NASDAQ Global Market listing standards. Our certificate
of incorporation provides that the terms of office of the directors are one year from the time of their election until the
next annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified.
Our certificate of incorporation provides that the authorized number of directors will generally be not less than five nor
more than thirteen, and the exact number of directors will be fixed from time to time exclusively by the board of
directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the whole board. In addition, our certificate of incorporation
and our bylaws provide that, in general, vacancies on the board may be filled by a majority of directors in office,
although less than a quorum.
Our board of directors will establish an audit committee in connection with this offering whose functions include the
following:
•
assist the board of directors in its oversight responsibilities regarding the integrity of our financial statements, our
compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent accountant’s qualifications and independence and
our accounting and financial reporting processes of and the audits of our financial statements;
•
prepare the report required by the SEC for inclusion in our annual proxy or information statement;
•
appoint, retain, compensate, evaluate and terminate our independent accountants;
•
approve audit and non-audit services to be performed by the independent accountants;
•
review and approve related party transactions; and
•
perform such other functions as the board of directors may from time to time assign to the audit committee.
The specific functions and responsibilities of the audit committee will be set forth in the audit committee charter. Upon
completion of this offering, our audit committee will include three directors who satisfies the independence
requirements of current SEC rules and The NASDAQ Global Market listing standards. We expect that one of the
members of the audit committee will qualify as an audit committee financial expert as defined under these rules and
listing standards, and the other members of our audit committee will satisfy the financial literacy standards for audit
committee members under these rules and listing standards.

Pursuant to our bylaws, our board of directors may, from time to time, establish other committees to facilitate the
management of our business and operations. In connection with this offering, we will establish a compensation
committee composed of at least two independent directors. See “—Executive Compensation—Compensation
Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Policy” on page 118 of this prospectus. We will also establish a nominating
committee composed of at least three independent directors.
In connection with the Gulfport transaction, Gulfport will have the right to designate one individual as a nominee to
serve on our board of directors for so long as Gulfport beneficially owns more than 10% of our outstanding common
stock. Such nominee, if elected to our board, will also serve on each committee of the board so long as he or she
satisfies the independence and other requirements for service on the applicable committee. So long as Gulfport has the
right to designate a nominee to our board and there is no Gulfport nominee actually serving as a director, Gulfport
shall have the right to appoint one individual as an advisor to the board who shall be entitled to attend board and
committee meetings.
Director Compensation
To date, none of our directors has received compensation for services rendered as a board member. Members of our
board of directors who are also officers or employees of our company will not receive compensation for their services
as directors. It is anticipated that after the completion of this offering, we will pay our non-employee directors a
monthly retainer of $1,000 and a per meeting attendance fee of $500 and reimburse all ordinary and necessary expenses
incurred in the conduct of our business.
In connection with this offering, we intend to implement an equity incentive plan. Under the plan, certain non-employee
directors will be granted 6,666 restricted stock units, which will vest in three equal annual installments beginning on
the date of grant.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
We do not currently have a compensation committee. None of our executive officers serves, or has served during the
past year, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company that has one or
more executive officers serving as a member of our board of directors or compensation committee.
Executive Compensation
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Compensation Practices
Historically, our equity sponsor, Wexford, determined our overall compensation philosophy and set the compensation
of our named executive officers, after taking into consideration recommendations of our then serving chief executive
officer. In the case of our named executives with employment agreements, the compensation of such individuals is
determined in accordance with their respective employment agreements.
Prior to the completion of this offering, our board of directors intends to establish a compensation committee
comprised of at least two independent, non-employee directors and adopt a written charter for the compensation
committee setting forth the compensation committee’s purpose and responsibilities. The principal responsibilities of
the compensation committee will be to review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the
compensation of our executive officers, evaluate their performance in light of these goals and, subject to the terms of
the employment agreements with our named executive officers, determine and approve our executive officers’
compensation based on such evaluation and establish policies, including with respect to the following:
•
the determination of the elements of executive compensation and allocation among different types of executive
compensation;
Table of Contents
117
Index to Financial Statements
•
the determination as to when awards are granted, including awards of equity-based compensation such as restricted
stock units, restricted stock and/or options;
•
stock ownership guidelines and any policies regarding hedging the economic risk of such ownership; and
•
the review of the risks and rewards associated with our compensation policies and programs.
The compensation committee will seek to provide a total compensation package designed to drive performance and
reward contributions in support of our business strategies and to attract, motivate and retain high quality talent with
the skills and competencies required by us. It is possible that the compensation committee will examine the
compensation practices of our peer companies and may also review compensation data from the oil and natural gas
industry generally to the extent the competition for executive talent is broader than a group of selected peer companies,
but any decisions regarding possible benchmarking will be made following the completion of this offering. In addition,
the compensation committee may review and, in certain cases, participate in, various relevant compensation surveys
and consult with compensation consultants with respect to determining any changes in the compensation for our
named executive officers, subject to the terms of their respective employment agreements. We expect that our Chief
Executive Officer will provide periodic recommendations to the compensation committee regarding such
determinations. We expect that the compensation committee will design our compensation policies and programs to
encourage and reward prudent business judgment and appropriate risk taking over the long term.
Compensation Policy
Our general compensation policy is guided by several key principles:
•
•
designing competitive total compensation programs to enhance our ability to attract and retain knowledgeable and
experienced senior management level employees;
motivating employees to deliver outstanding financial performance and meet or exceed general and specific business,
operational and individual objectives;
•
setting compensation and incentive levels relevant to the market in which the employee provides service; and
•
providing a meaningful portion of the total compensation to our named executive officers in equity, thus assuring an
alignment of interests between our senior management level employees and our stockholders.
Upon completion of this offering, our compensation committee will determine, subject to the terms of the employment
agreements with our named executive officers, the mix of compensation, both among short-term and long-term
compensation and cash and non-cash compensation, to establish structures that it believes are appropriate for each of
our named executive officers. In making compensation decisions with respect to each element of compensation, the
compensation committee is expected to consider numerous factors, including:
•
the individual’s particular background and circumstances, including training and prior relevant work experience;
•
the individual’s role with us and the compensation paid to similar persons at comparable companies;
•
the demand for individuals with the individual’s specific expertise and experience at the time of hire;
•
achievement of individual and company performance goals and other expectations relating to the position;
•
•
comparison to other executives within our company having similar levels of expertise and experience and the
uniqueness of the individual’s industry skills; and
aligning the compensation of our executives with the performance of our company on both a short-term and long-term
basis.
118
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Although we expect the compensation committee to follow these policies, it is possible that the compensation
committee could develop a compensation philosophy different than that discussed here.
Historic Elements of Compensation
Historically the principal elements of compensation for our named executive officers have been:
•
base salary;
•
bonus awards;
•
equity awards contained in their employment agreements; and
•
health insurance, life and disability insurance and 401(k) plan benefits available to all of our other employees.
We believe that our company does not utilize compensation policies and programs that create risks that are reasonably
likely to have a material adverse impact on our company. Historically, certain management, administrative and treasury
functions were provided to us by Everest, an entity controlled by Wexford, our equity sponsor. For purposes of
presenting the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this prospectus, allocations were made to
determine the cost of general and administrative activities performed attributable to us. The allocations were made
based upon underlying salary costs of employees performing Company related functions, payroll, revenue or
headcount relative to other companies managed by Everest, or specifically identified invoices processed, depending
on the nature of the cost. Currently, we employ all our named executive officers directly.
Components of Compensation Following the Completion of the Offering
We believe a material amount of executive compensation should be tied to our performance, and a significant portion
of the total prospective compensation of each named executive officer should be tied to measurable financial and
operational objectives. These objectives may include absolute performance or performance relative to a peer group.
During periods when performance meets or exceeds established objectives, our named executive officers should be
paid at or above targeted levels, respectively. When our performance does not meet key objectives, incentive award
payments, if any, should be less than such targeted levels.
Following the completion of this offering, we anticipate that the compensation committee will seek to balance awards
based on short-term annual results with awards intended to compensate our executives based on our long-term
viability and success. Consequently, in addition to annual bonuses, in the future we may provide long-term incentives
to our executives in the form of equity based awards to continue to align the interests of our named executive officers
with those of our equity holders. These awards would be in addition to the equity awards contained in their
employment agreements. In connection with this offering, our board of directors will adopt a long-term incentive plan,
which we believe will further incentivize the executive officers to perform their duties in a way that will enhance our
long-term success.
As discussed above, following the completion of this offering and subject to the terms of the employment agreements
with our named executive officers, our compensation committee will determine the mix of compensation, both among
short-term and long-term compensation and cash and non-cash compensation, to establish structures that it believes
are appropriate for each of our named executive officers. We believe that the mix of base salary, performance-based
incentive compensation, bonus awards, existing equity awards under their employment agreements, awards under the
long-term incentive plan and the other benefits that are or will be available to our named executive officers will
accomplish our overall compensation objectives. We believe that these elements of compensation create competitive
compensation opportunities to align and drive employee performance in support of our business strategies and to
attract, motivate and retain high quality talent with the skills and competencies required by us.

Base Salary
119
Our named executive officers’ base salaries are determined in accordance with their respective employment
agreements. We have not retained compensation consultants to advise us on compensation matters. Subject to
applicable employment agreements, the compensation committee may increase base salaries to align such salaries
with market levels for comparable positions in other companies in our industry if we identify significant market
changes. Additionally, the compensation committee may adjust base salaries as warranted throughout the year for
promotions or other changes in the scope or breadth of an executive’s role or responsibilities. The compensation
committee may also evaluate our named executive officers’ salaries together with other components of their
compensation to ensure that the executive’s total compensation is in line with our overall compensation philosophy.
Upon completion of this offering, our named executive officers will, initially, continue to be compensated at their
current annual rates, as specified in the Summary Compensation Table below.
Discretionary Annual Performance Bonus
In accordance with our named executive officers’ employment agreements, the board of directors will have the
authority to award annual cash bonuses to our named executive officers that have achieved their respective
performance goals determined by the board of directors for the applicable year. Pursuant to the terms of their
respective employment agreements, the amount of the annual cash bonus that each of our named executive officers
(with the exception of Mr. Stice) is eligible to receive is equal to 50% of such officer’s annual base salary. Mr. Stice is
entitled to receive an annual bonus of at least $200,000 and may receive an annual bonus of up to $400,000 upon the
achievement of performance goals to be determined by the board of directors. We have not established any specific
performance goals for our named executive officers. For 2011, the discretionary annual bonuses were paid to our
named executive officers based on their respective performances and contribution to our company in 2011 and other
factors generally, including our company’s performance in 2011, the value these executives bring to our company,
market trends, economic climate, experience, leadership and employee retention. None of these factors was given
materially greater weight than the other factors in determining the officers’ bonuses. The discretionary annual cash
bonuses received by our named executive officers for 2011 are set forth in the table under the caption “Summary of
Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers” included beginning on page 121 of this prospectus.
Long Term Equity Incentive Compensation
We will seek to promote an ownership culture among our executive officers in an effort to enhance our long-term
performance. We believe the use of stock and stock-based awards offers the best approach to achieving our
compensation goals. Each of our named executive officers has been awarded an option to purchase shares of our
common stock in accordance with the terms of his or her employment agreement. See “—Employment Agreements”
beginning on page 123 of this prospectus. To date, we have not adopted stock ownership guidelines for our executives.
In connection with this offering, we intend to implement an equity incentive plan. The purpose of this plan will be to
continue to enable us, and our affiliates, to attract and retain the services of the types of employees, consultants and
directors who will contribute to our long term success and to provide incentives that will be linked directly to increases
in share value that will inure to the benefit of our stockholders. The plan will provide a means by which eligible
recipients of awards may be given an opportunity to benefit from increases in value of our common stock through the
granting of equity awards. The terms of our equity incentive plan are described in more detail following the Summary
Compensation Table.
Other Compensation and Perquisites
Consistent with our compensation philosophy, we anticipate that our compensation committee will continue to provide
benefits to our executives that are substantially the same as those currently being offered to our other employees,
including health insurance, life and disability insurance and a 401(k) plan. The benefits and perquisites that may be
available to our executive officers in addition to those available to our other employees include a car allowance and
club dues.

Tax Implications of Executive Compensation Policy
Under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, a public company generally may not deduct compensation in
excess of $1.0 million per year per person paid to its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and the three
other most highly compensated executive officers whose compensation is disclosed in its proxy statement as a result
of their total compensation, subject to certain exceptions. Qualifying performance-based compensation will not be
subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements are met. Although our long-term and incentive compensation
plans and agreements have provisions that are intended to satisfy the performance-based compensation exception to
the Section 162(m) deduction limit, regulations under Section 162(m) also provide a transition reliance period in the
case of a corporation that is not publicly held and becomes publicly held in connection with an initial public offering.
During the reliance period, the deduction limit of Section 162(m) does not apply to any compensation paid pursuant to
a plan or agreement that existed during the period that the corporation was not publicly held, provided the prospectus
accompanying the initial public offering discloses information concerning the plans or agreements in accordance with
applicable securities laws. The reliance period ends on the earliest of (1) the expiration of the plan or agreement; (2) the
material modification of the plan or agreement; (3) the issuance of all employer stock or compensation reserved under
the plan; or (4) the first meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected that occurs after the close of the third
calendar year following the calendar year in which the initial public offering occurs.
We anticipate that our compensation committee will structure our long-term and incentive compensation programs to
preserve the tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers. However, our compensation committee
will have the authority to award performance-based compensation that is not deductible and we cannot guarantee that it
will only award deductible compensation to our executive officers. In addition, notwithstanding our compensation
committee’s efforts, ambiguities and uncertainties regarding the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) make
it impossible to provide assurance that any performance based compensation will, in fact, satisfy the requirements for
deductibility under Section 162(m). Time vested restricted stock awards will not be treated as performance based
compensation and, as a result, the deductibility of such awards could be limited. Also, base salaries and other non-
performance based compensation as defined in Section 162(m) in excess of $1.0 million paid to these executive officers
in any year would not qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m).
Summary of Compensation for Our Named Executive Officers
The following table shows the compensation of all individuals serving as our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer during 2011 and of our next most highly compensated executive officer serving as of December 31,
2011, whose total compensation exceeded $100,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011.

Employment Agreements
The following summarizes the material terms of the employment agreements we have with our named executive
officers.
Travis D. Stice. Effective April 2011, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Stice, our Chief Executive
Officer. The employment agreement has a three-year term and provides for an annual base salary of $300,000. Mr. Stice
is also entitled to receive an annual bonus of at least $200,000, which could be increased up to $400,000 depending
upon his achievement of certain performance goals as determined by our board of directors. Mr. Stice is entitled to
participate in such life and medical insurance plans and other similar plans that we establish from time to time for our
executive employees, and is paid a $900 monthly vehicle allowance. Pursuant to the terms of his employment
agreement, Mr. Stice has an option to acquire a 1.0% membership interest in our subsidiary Windsor Permian LLC for
an aggregate exercise price of $3.6 million, subject to adjustment in the event of certain asset sales. Such option vests
in four equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of Mr. Stice’s employment
agreement and will be exercisable for five years from the effective date of his employment agreement or until his earlier
termination. In connection with this offering, this option will be cancelled and replaced with the right to receive
$1,000,000 in cash, of which two-thirds will be payable at the time of the offering and one-third will be payable on the
first anniversary if Mr. Stice is still employed by us or if he terminated by us prior to that date without “cause” as
defined below, restricted stock units in an amount equal to $1,000,000 divided by the IPO price per share and options
to purchase 300,000 shares of our common stock at the IPO price per share. The vesting schedule and exercise rights
for these options and the restricted stock units will remain the same as the original option. Mr. Stice has agreed to
certain restrictive covenants in his employment agreement, including, without limitation, his agreement not to compete
with us, not to interfere with any of our employees, suppliers or regulators and not to solicit our customers or
employees, in each case during Mr. Stice’s affiliation with us and for a period of six months
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
123
thereafter. Mr. Stice’s continued employment with us is “at-will,” meaning that either we or Mr. Stice may terminate the
employment relationship at any time and for any reason, with or without notice. However, if we terminate Mr. Stice’s
employment without “cause,” we will be obligated to continue paying Mr. Stice’s annual base salary until the
expiration of the term of his employment agreement and pay a prorated portion of Mr. Stice’s minimum annual bonus
for the period prior to termination, subject to Mr. Stice’s compliance with the restrictive covenants discussed above
and his execution of a full general release in our favor. If Mr. Stice’s employment is terminated due to death or
disability, our sole obligation, subject to Mr. Stice’s compliance with the restrictive covenants discussed above, will be
to pay any earned but unpaid base salary and a prorated portion of Mr. Stice’s minimum annual bonus for the period
prior to termination. In the event Mr. Stice’s employment is terminated for “cause,” our obligations will terminate with
respect to the payment of any base salary or bonuses and the option described above effective as of the termination
date. For purposes of Mr. Stice’s employment agreement, “cause” is generally defined as Mr. Stice’s (a) willful and
knowing refusal or failure to perform his duties in any material respect, (b) willful misconduct or gross negligence in
performing his duties, (c) material breach of his employment agreement or any other agreement with us, (d) conviction
of, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a criminal act that constitutes a felony or involves fraud, dishonesty or
moral turpitude, (e) indictment for a felony involving embezzlement, theft or fraud, (f) filing of a voluntary, or consent to
an involuntary, bankruptcy petition or (g) failure to comply with directives of our board of directors. In addition, in the
event that more than 50% of the combined voting power of our then outstanding stock is controlled by one or more
parties that is not Wexford or an affiliate of Wexford, the options described above will vest immediately. The benefits
Mr. Stice is entitled to receive upon certain terminations, resignations and changes of control are summarized below in
“Potential Payments Upon Termination, Resignation or Change of Control” on page 128 of this prospectus.
Teresa L. Dick. Effective September 2011, we entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Dick, our Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. The employment agreement has a one-year term and provides for an annual base
salary of $250,000. Subject to Ms. Dick’s achievement of certain performance goals as determined by our board of
directors for each fiscal year, Ms. Dick is entitled to an annual bonus of 50% of her annual base salary. Ms. Dick is also
entitled to participate in any life and medical insurance plans and other similar plans that we establish from time to
time for our executive employees. Pursuant to the terms of her employment agreement, Ms. Dick has an option to
acquire a 0.25% membership interest in our subsidiary Windsor Permian LLC for an aggregate exercise price of
$900,000, subject to adjustment in the event of certain asset sales. Such option vests in four equal annual installments
commencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of Ms. Dick’s employment agreement and will be exercisable
for five years from the effective date of such employment agreement or until her earlier termination (except for
termination upon death, disability or by us without cause). In connection with the closing of this offering, this option
will be cancelled and replaced with the right to receive $300,000 in cash, restricted stock units in an amount equal to
$300,000 divided by the IPO price per share and options to purchase 50,000 shares of our common stock at the IPO
price per share. The vesting schedule and exercise rights for these options and the restricted stock units will remain
the same as the original option. Ms. Dick has agreed to certain restrictive covenants in her employment agreement,
including, without limitation, her agreement not to compete with us, not to interfere with any of our employees,
suppliers or regulators and not to solicit our customers or employees, in each case during Ms. Dick’s affiliation with us
and for a period of six months thereafter. Ms. Dick’s continued employment with us is “at-will,” meaning that either we
or Ms. Dick may terminate the employment relationship at any time and for any reason, with or without notice.
However, if (i) we terminate Ms. Dick’s employment without “cause,” (ii) Ms. Dick resigns for good reason, meaning
such resignation follows a material uncured breach by us of the employment agreement or a material diminution in
Ms. Dick’s position, duties or authority, or (iii) Ms. Dick’s employment is terminated due to death or disability, then we
will be obligated to continue paying Ms. Dick’s base annual salary until the expiration of the term of her employment
agreement and, in the case of termination without cause or upon death or disability, to honor our obligations with
respect to the option described above; provided, in each case, that Ms. Dick continues to comply with the restrictive
covenants described above and (except in the case of clause (iii) above) executes a full general release in our favor. In
the event Ms. Dick’s employment is terminated for “cause,” our obligations will terminate with respect to the payment
of any base salary or bonuses and the option

described above effective as of the termination date. For purposes of Ms. Dick’s employment agreement, “cause” is
generally defined as Ms. Dick’s (a) willful and knowing refusal or failure to perform her duties in any material respect,
(b) willful misconduct or gross negligence in performing her duties, (c) material breach of her employment agreement
or any other agreement with us, (d) conviction of, or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a criminal act that
constitutes a felony or involves fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude, (e) indictment for a felony involving
embezzlement, theft or fraud, (f) filing of a voluntary, or consent to an involuntary, bankruptcy petition, (g) dishonesty
in connection with her responsibilities as an employee or (h) failure to comply with directives of our board of directors.
In addition, (x) in the event that more than 50% of the combined voting power of our then outstanding stock is
controlled by one or more parties that is not Wexford, an affiliate of Wexford or an underwriter temporarily holding
securities pursuant to an offering of securities and there is a material change in Ms. Dick’s position, duties or authority
or (y) upon termination without cause or due to death or disability, the options and restricted stock units described
above will vest immediately. The benefits Ms. Dick is entitled to receive upon certain terminations, resignations and
changes of control are summarized below in “Potential Payments Upon Termination, Resignation or Change of
Control” on page 128 of this prospectus.
Jeff White. Effective September 2011, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. White, our Vice President—
Operations. The employment agreement has a three-year term and provides for an annual base salary of $220,000.
Subject to Mr. White’s achievement of certain performance goals as determined by our board of directors for each
fiscal year, Mr. White is entitled to an annual bonus of 50% of his annual base salary. Upon entering into the
employment agreement, Mr. White received an $85,000 signing bonus and, if this offering is completed within one year
of Mr. White’s hiring, he will be entitled to receive shares of our common stock with a value equal to $170,000. If we do
not complete this offering within one year of his hiring, Mr. White will receive a $170,000 cash bonus. Mr. White is also
entitled to participate in any life and medical insurance plans and other similar plans that we establish from time to
time for our executive employees. Pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. White has an option to
acquire a 0.5% membership interest in our subsidiary Windsor Permian LLC for an aggregate exercise price of $2.5
million, subject to adjustment in the event of certain asset sales. Such option vests in four equal annual installments
commencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of Mr. White’s employment agreement and will be exercisable
for five years from the effective date of his employment agreement or until his earlier termination (except for
termination upon death, disability or by us without cause). In connection with the closing of this offering, this option
will be cancelled and replaced with the right to receive $350,000 in cash, restricted stock units in an amount equal to
$600,000 divided by the IPO price per share and options to purchase 100,000 shares of our common stock at the IPO
price per share. The vesting schedule and exercise rights for these options and the restricted stock units will remain
the same as the original option. Mr. White has agreed to certain restrictive covenants in his employment agreement,
including, without limitation, his agreement not to compete with us, not to interfere with any of our employees,
suppliers or regulators and not to solicit our customers or employees, in each case during Mr. White’s affiliation with
us and for a period of six months thereafter. Mr. White’s continued employment with us is “at-will,” meaning that either
we or Mr. White may terminate the employment relationship at any time and for any reason, with or without notice.
However, if (i) we terminate Mr. White’s employment without “cause,” (ii) Mr. White resigns for good reason, meaning
such resignation follows a material uncured breach by us of the employment agreement or a material diminution in
Mr. White’s position, duties or authority, or (iii) Mr. White’s employment is terminated due to death or disability, then
we will be obligated to continue paying Mr. White’s base annual salary until the expiration of the term of his
employment agreement and, in the case of termination without cause or upon death or disability, to honor our
obligations with respect to the option described above; provided, in each case, that Mr. White continues to comply with
the restrictive covenants described above and (except in the case of clause (iii) above) executes a full general release in
our favor. In the event Mr. White’s employment is terminated for “cause,” our obligations will terminate with respect to
the payment of any base salary or bonuses and the option described above effective as of the termination date. For
purposes of Mr. White’s employment agreement, “cause” is generally defined as Mr. White’s (a) willful and knowing
refusal or failure to perform his duties in any material respect, (b) willful misconduct or gross negligence in performing
his duties, (c) material breach of his employment agreement or any other agreement with us, (d) conviction of, or a plea
of guilty or nolo contendere to, a criminal act that constitutes a felony or involves fraud, dishonesty or moral turpitude,

felony involving embezzlement, theft or fraud, (f) filing of a voluntary, or consent to an involuntary, bankruptcy petition,
(g) dishonesty in connection with his responsibilities as an employee or (h) failure to comply with directives of our
board of directors. In addition, (x) in the event that more than 50% of the combined voting power of our then
outstanding stock is controlled by one or more parties that is not Wexford, an affiliate of Wexford or an underwriter
temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of securities and there is either a material change in Mr. White’s
position, duties or authority or Mr. White is required to move outside a 50 mile radius of Midland, Texas or (y) upon

immediately. The benefits Mr. White is entitled to receive upon certain terminations, resignations and changes of
control are summarized below in “Potential Payments Upon Termination, Resignation or Change of Control” on page

Equity Incentive Plan
Prior to the completion of this offering, we did not have any stock option or other equity incentive plan except for the
equity awards granted in the employment agreements with our named executive officers and, except for such awards,
there are no stock options, restricted stock units or other equity awards outstanding for any of our named executive
officers. Prior to this offering, we intend to implement our equity incentive plan.
Eligible award recipients are employees, consultants and directors of our company and its affiliates. Incentive stock
options may be granted only to our employees. Awards other than incentive stock options may be granted to
employees, consultants and directors. The shares that may be issued pursuant to awards consist of our authorized but
unissued common stock, and the maximum aggregate amount of such common stock which may be issued upon
exercise of all awards under the plan, including incentive stock options, may not exceed              shares, subject to
adjustment to reflect certain corporate transactions or changes in our capital structure. To the extent that an award is
intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, then the
maximum number of shares of common stock issuable in the form of each type of award under our equity incentive
plan to any one participant during a calendar year shall not exceed              shares. Additionally, no participant shall
receive in excess of the aggregate amount of 1,000,000 shares pursuant to all awards issued under our equity incentive
plan during any calendar year.
We anticipate granting options and restricted stock units to employees and certain non-employee directors under the
plan upon completion of this offering in the amount to be determined by the compensation committee.
Share Reserve. The aggregate number of shares of common stock initially authorized for issuance under the plan is
2,500,000 shares. However, (i) shares covered by an award that expires or otherwise terminates without having been
exercised in full and (ii) shares that are forfeited to, or repurchased by, us pursuant to a forfeiture or repurchase
provision under the plan may return to the plan and be available for issuance in connection with a future award.
Administration. Our board of directors (or our compensation committee or any other committee of the board of
directors as may be appointed by our board of directors from time to time) administers the plan. Among other
responsibilities, the plan administrator selects participants from among the eligible individuals, determines the
number of shares that will be subject to each award and determines the terms and conditions of each award, including
methods of payment, vesting schedules and limitations and restrictions on awards. The plan administrator may amend,
suspend, or terminate the plan at any time. Amendments will not be effective without stockholder approval if
stockholder approval is required by applicable law or stock exchange requirements. Unless terminated earlier, our
equity incentive plan will terminate in August 2022.
Stock Options. Incentive and nonstatutory stock options are granted pursuant to incentive and nonstatutory stock
option agreements. Employees, directors and consultants may be granted nonstatutory stock options, but only
employees may be granted incentive stock options. The plan administrator determines the exercise price of a stock
option, provided that the exercise price of a stock option generally cannot be less than 100% (and in the
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
126
case of an incentive stock option granted to a more than 10% stockholder, 110%) of the fair market value of our
common stock on the date of grant, except when assuming or substituting options in limited situations such as an
acquisition. Generally, options granted under the plan vest ratably over a five-year period and have a term of ten years
(five years in the case of an incentive stock option granted to a more than 10% stockholder), unless specified otherwise
by the plan administrator in the option agreement.
Acceptable consideration for the purchase of common stock issued upon the exercise of a stock option will be
determined by the plan administrator and may include (i) cash or check, (ii) a broker-assisted cashless exercise, (iii) the
tender of common stock previously owned by the optionee, (iv) stock withholding and (v) other legal consideration
approved by the plan administrator, such as exercise with a full recourse promissory note (not applicable for directors
and executive officers).
Unless the plan administrator provides otherwise (solely with respect to intervivos transfers to certain family members
and estate planning vehicles), nonstatutory options generally are not transferable except by will or the laws of descent
and distribution. An optionee may designate a beneficiary, however, who may exercise the option following the
optionee’s death. Incentive stock options are not transferable except by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Restricted Awards. Restricted awards are awards of either actual shares of common stock (e.g., restricted stock
awards), or of hypothetical share units (e.g., restricted stock units) having a value equal to the fair market value of an
identical number of shares of common stock, that will be settled in the form of shares of common stock upon vesting
or other specified payment date, and which may provide that such restricted awards may not be sold, transferred, or
otherwise disposed of for such period as the plan administrator determines. The purchase price and vesting schedule,
if applicable, of restricted awards are determined by the plan administrator. A restricted stock unit is similar to a
restricted stock award except that participants holding restricted stock units do not have any stockholder rights until
the stock unit is settled with shares. Stock units represent an unfunded and unsecured obligation for us and a holder of
a stock unit has no rights other than those of a general creditor.
Performance Awards. Performance awards entitle the recipient to vest in or acquire shares of common stock, or
hypothetical share units having a value equal to the fair market value of an identical number of shares of common
stock that will be settled in the form of shares of common stock upon the attainment of specified performance goals.
Performance awards may be granted independent of or in connection with the granting of any other award under the
plan. Performance goals will be established by the plan administrator based on one or more business criteria that
apply to the plan participant, a business unit, or our company and our affiliates. Performance goals will be objective
and will be intended to meet the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code. Performance goals must be determined
prior to the time 25% of the service period has elapsed but not later than 90 days after the beginning of the service
period. No payout will be made on a performance award granted to a named executive officer unless all applicable
performance goals and service requirements are achieved. Performance awards may not be sold, assigned, transferred,
pledged or otherwise encumbered and terminate upon the termination of the participant’s service to us or our affiliates.
Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights may be granted independent of or in tandem with the granting of
any option under the plan. Stock appreciation rights are granted pursuant to stock appreciation rights agreements. The
exercise price of a stock appreciation right granted independent of an option is determined by the plan administrator,
but as a general rule will be no less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The
exercise price of a stock appreciation right granted in tandem with an option is the same as the exercise price of the
related option. Upon the exercise of a stock appreciation right, we will pay the participant an amount equal to the
product of (i) the excess of the per share fair market value of our common stock on the date of exercise over the strike
price, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of common stock with respect to which the stock appreciation right is
exercised. Payment will be made in cash, delivery of stock, or a combination of cash and stock as deemed appropriate
by the plan administrator.

Adjustments in capitalization. In the event that there is a specified type of change in our common stock without the
receipt of consideration by us, such as pursuant to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization,
reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of
shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction, appropriate adjustments will be made
to the various limits under, and the share terms of, the plan including (i) the number and class of shares reserved
under the plan, (ii) the maximum number of stock options and stock appreciation rights that can be granted to any one
person in a calendar year and (iii) the number and class of shares and exercise price, strike price, or purchase price, if
applicable, of all outstanding stock awards.
Corporate Transactions. In the event of a change in control transaction (other than a transaction resulting in Wexford or
an entity controlled by, or under common control with Wexford maintaining direct or indirect control over the
Company), or a corporate transaction such as a dissolution or liquidation of our company, or any corporate separation
or division, including, but not limited to, a split-up, a split-off or a spin-off, or a sale in one or a series of related
transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of our company or a merger, consolidation, or reverse merger in
which we are not the surviving entity, then all outstanding stock awards under the plan may be assumed, continued or
substituted for by any surviving or acquiring entity (or its parent company), or may be cancelled either with or without
consideration for the vested portion of the awards, all as determined by the plan administrator. In the event an award
would be cancelled without consideration paid to the extent vested, the award recipient may exercise the award in full
or in part for a period of ten days.
401(k) Plan
We participate in a 401(k) Plan. Employees may elect to defer a portion of their compensation up to the statutorily
prescribed limit. Each pay period we make a matching contribution to each employee’s deferral, not to exceed six
percent. An employee’s interests in his or her deferrals are 100% vested when contributed. An employee’s interests in
the matching contribution are vested at the rate of 20% for each completed year of eligibility. The 401(k) Plan is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. As such, contributions to the 401(k) Plan and
earnings on those contributions are not taxable to the employee until distributed from the 401(k) Plan, and all
contributions are deductible by us when made.

Limitations on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
Our certificate of incorporation provides that no director shall be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for
monetary damages resulting from breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such limitation on
or exemption from liability is not permitted under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL. The effect of this
provision of our certificate of incorporation is to eliminate our rights and those of our stockholders (through
stockholders’ derivative suits on our behalf) to recover monetary damages against a director for breach of the fiduciary
duty of care as a director, including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent behavior, except, as
restricted by the DGCL:
•
for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders;
•
for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
•
in respect of certain unlawful dividend payments or stock redemptions or repurchases; and
•
for any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.
129
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
This provision does not limit or eliminate our rights or the rights of any stockholder to seek non-monetary relief, such
as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of a director’s duty of care.
Our certificate of incorporation also provides that we will, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, indemnify our
directors and officers against losses that they may incur in investigations and legal proceedings resulting from their
service.
Our bylaws include provisions relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights consistent with those
provided in our certificate of incorporation. In addition, our bylaws provide:
•
•
for a right of indemnitee to bring a suit in the event a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses is not paid
in full by us within a specified period of time; and
permit us to purchase and maintain insurance, at our expense, to protect us and any of our directors, officers and
employees against any loss, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify that person against that loss under
Delaware law.
Indemnification Agreements
We will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and executive officers effective upon
the closing of this offering. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted
under Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred
as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. We also intend to enter into
indemnification agreements with our future directors and executive officers.
Liability Insurance
We intend to provide liability insurance for our directors and officers, including coverage for public securities matters.
There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which
indemnification from us is sought. We are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for
indemnification from us.

Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
We do not currently have a written policy regarding the review and approval of related party transactions, but intend to
implement such a policy in connection with, and prior to the completion of, this offering. In connection with this
offering, we will establish an audit committee consisting solely of independent directors whose functions will be set
forth in the audit committee charter. We anticipate that one of the audit committee’s functions will be to review and
approve all relationships and transactions in which we and our directors, director nominees and executive officers and
their immediate family members, as well as holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities and their
immediate family members, have a direct or indirect material interest. We anticipate that such policy will be a written
policy included as part the audit committee charter that will be implemented by the audit committee and in the Code of
Business Conduct and Ethics that our board of directors will adopt prior to the completion of this offering.
Historically, the review and approval of related party transactions have been the responsibility of our management, and
all of the transactions discussed under “Related Party Transactions” below have been approved by our management,
subject to a conflicts of interest policy set forth in our employee handbook, pursuant to which all of our employees
must avoid any situations where their personal outside interest could conflict, or even appear to conflict, with the
interests of the Company. Although our management believes that the terms of the related party transactions described
below are reasonable, it is possible that we could have negotiated more favorable terms for such transactions with
unrelated third parties.
Our management will continue to review and approve related party transactions, subject to the above-referenced
conflicts of interest policy, until the adoption of the policy regarding the review and approval of such transactions by
the audit committee, which we intend to adopt in connection with, and prior to the completion of, this offering.
Gulfport Transaction and Investor Rights Agreement
On May 7, 2012, we entered into an agreement with Gulfport in which we agreed to acquire from Gulfport, prior to the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part, all of its oil and natural gas properties in
the Permian Basin in exchange for (i) shares of our common stock representing 35% of our common stock outstanding
immediately prior to the closing of this offering and (ii) approximately $63.6 million in the form of a non-interest
bearing promissory note that will be repaid in full upon the closing of this offering with a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering. The aggregate consideration payable to Gulfport is subject to a post-closing cash adjustment and
will be increased or decreased by an amount equal to the difference between $118.1 million and the “final capital
amount,” divided by 65% and then multiplied by 35%. For purposes of our agreement with Gulfport, “final capital
amount” means Windsor Permian’s (a) total current assets, consisting of cash, trade accounts receivable (net of an
allowance for doubtful accounts), inventory, prepaid expenses, other current assets and other assets, less (b) total
current liabilities, consisting of trade accounts payable, accounts payable to related parties, accrued capital and other
expenses, long-term debt and asset retirement obligations, in each case as of the closing date of the transaction.
Accordingly, for purposes of illustration only, if the final capital amount is $110.0 million, we would owe Gulfport an
additional approximately $4.4 million and if the final capital amount is $125.0 million, Gulfport would owe us
approximately $3.7 million. Gulfport’s obligation to complete this transaction is contingent upon, among other things,
the contribution to us of all the outstanding equity interests in Windsor Permian and Gulfport’s satisfaction with the
terms of this offering. Under the agreement, Gulfport is generally responsible for all liabilities and obligations with
respect to its Permian Basin properties arising prior to the closing of the transaction and we are responsible for such
liabilities and obligations arising after the closing of the transaction. At the closing of the Gulfport transaction, we will
enter into an investor rights agreement with Gulfport in which Gulfport will be granted certain (i) demand and
“piggyback” registration rights, (ii) director nomination rights and (iii) information rights. For additional information
regarding the terms of the Gulfport transaction agreement and the investor rights agreement, see “Prospectus
Summary—The Transactions,” “Management—Our Board of Directors and Committees” and “Shares Eligible for
Future Sale—Registration Rights” beginning on pages 7, 116 and 142,

respectively, of this prospectus. Mike Liddell, who served as the Operating Member and Chairman of Windsor Permian
prior to the completion of this offering, is also the Chairman of the Board and a director of Gulfport and has an interest
in DB Holdings. Charles E. Davidson, the Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of Wexford, beneficially owned
approximately 9.5% of Gulfport’s outstanding common stock as of March 13, 2012.
Administrative Services
We are a party to a shared services agreement, dated March 1, 2008, with Everest Operations Management LLC
(formerly, Windsor Energy Resources LLC), or Everest, an entity controlled by Wexford, our equity sponsor. Under this
agreement, Everest provided us with administrative and payroll services and office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma
and we reimbursed Everest in an amount determined by Everest’s management based on estimates of the amount of
office space provided and the amount of its employees’ time spent performing services for us. For purposes of
presenting the consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this prospectus, allocations were made to
determine the cost of general and administrative activities performed attributable to us. The allocations were made
based upon underlying salary costs of employees performing Company related functions, payroll, revenue or
headcount relative to other companies managed by Everest, or specifically identified invoices processed, depending
on the nature of the cost.
The initial term of the shared services agreement with Everest was two years. Since the expiration of such two-year
period on March 1, 2010, the agreement, by its terms, has continued on a month-to-month basis and will continue to do
so until terminated by either party upon thirty days prior written notice. For the six months ended June 30, 2012 and the
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we incurred total costs to Everest of approximately $4.1 million, $10.0
million, $8.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, and at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we
owed $0.0 million, $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively, under this shared services agreement. We
expect to discontinue all services under this shared services agreement prior to the closing of this offering.
Effective January 1, 2012, we entered into a shared services agreement with Everest under which we provide Everest
and, at its request, certain of its affiliates with consulting, technical and administrative services, including payroll,
human resources administration, accounts payable and treasury services. The initial term of the shared services
agreement is two years. Upon expiration of the initial term, the agreement will continue on a month-to-month basis
until cancelled by either party upon thirty days prior written notice. Everest, or its affiliates, reimburse us for our
dedicated employee time and administrative costs based on the pro rata share of time our employees spend
performing these services, including pro rata benefits and bonuses of such employees. For the six months ended June
30, 2012, Everest and its affiliates reimbursed us $1,058,043 for services and overhead under the shared services
agreement and at June 30, 2012, Everest and its affiliates owed us $135,811.
Windsor Permian
The historical financial and operating information included in this prospectus pertains to the assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses of Windsor Permian. Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part, Diamondback Energy LLC will be merged with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc. and
Diamondback Energy, Inc. will continue as the surviving corporation. In the merger, DB Holdings will be issued shares
of our common stock and Windsor Permian will become our wholly-owned subsidiary. In addition, Wexford has agreed
to cause all the outstanding equity interests in Windsor UT to be contributed to Windsor Permian prior to the merger.
For additional information regarding the merger and this contribution by Wexford, see “Prospectus Summary—Our
History” on page 8 of this prospectus.
Subordinated Note
Effective May 14, 2012, we issued a subordinated note to an affiliate of Wexford pursuant to which the Wexford affiliate
may, from time to time, advance up to an aggregate $25.0 million. These advances are solely at the lender’s discretion
and neither Wexford nor any of its affiliates has any commitment or obligation to provide future capital support to us.
The note bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.28% or 8% per annum,

whichever is lower. Interest is due quarterly in arrears beginning on July 1, 2012. Interest payments are payable in kind
by adding such amounts to the principal balance of this note. The unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest on
the note is due and payable in full on January 31, 2015 or the earlier completion of this offering. Any indebtedness
evidenced by this note is subordinate in the right of payment to any indebtedness outstanding under our revolving
credit facility. On August 13, 2012, there was $24.5 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding under this note.
We will repay the outstanding borrowings under this note with a portion of the net proceeds of this offering.
Drilling Services
Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC, or Bison, has performed drilling and field services for us under master drilling
agreements. Under our most recent master drilling agreement with Bison, effective as of January 1, 2012, Bison
committed to accept orders from us for the use of at least two of its rigs. As of June 30, 2012, we were using three
Bison drilling rigs and will seek to utilize additional Bison rigs, subject to availability, as we increase our drilling
program through 2013. This master drilling agreement is terminable by either party on 30 day’s prior written notice,
although neither party will be relieved of its respective obligations arising from a drilling contract being performed
prior to the termination of the master drilling agreement. Bison was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Windsor Permian
until March 31, 2011, when various entities controlled by Wexford started contributing capital to Bison. These
contributions aggregated $11.5 million and ultimately diluted Windsor Permian’s ownership interest to 52.2%. In
September 2011, Windsor Permian sold a 25% interest in Bison to Gulfport for $6.0 million, subject to adjustment. At
the time of the transaction, an affiliate of Wexford beneficially owned approximately 13.3% of Gulfport’s common stock,
but that ownership is now less than 10%. In April 2012, Gulfport increased its ownership interest in Bison to 40%. As a
result of these transactions, Windsor Permian’s ownership interest in Bison was reduced to 22%, with the remaining
equity interests in Bison held by Gulfport and various entities controlled by Wexford. In June 2012, Windsor Permian
distributed its remaining interest in Bison to its member. As a result, we will not acquire any interest in Bison when
Diamondback Energy LLC is merged with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc. prior to the effectiveness of the
registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. For the period April 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011 and
the six months ended June 30, 2012, we were billed $16.3 million and $7.5 million, respectively, by Bison for drilling
services. We owed $1,101,754 to Bison as of June 30, 2012.
Completion and Well Servicing Services
We contracted with Great White Energy Services, or Great White, an entity formerly controlled by Wexford, for certain
well completion services. For the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we were billed $7.7 million and $3.3 million
by Great White, and we owed $3.1 million for such services at December 31, 2010 and no amounts at December 31,
2009. Effective August 24, 2011, Great White was sold to an unrelated third party and, therefore, Great White is no
longer a related party. While still a related party, during the year ended December 31, 2011 Great White billed us $12.5
million for such services.
Marketing Services
On March 1, 2009, we entered into an agreement with Windsor Midstream LLC, or Midstream, an entity controlled by
Wexford, pursuant to which Midstream purchased a significant portion of our oil volumes. For the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, our revenues from Midstream were $38.2 million, $21.4 million and $8.8 million,
respectively, and at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 we had an accounts receivable balance of
zero, $4.1 million, $2.7 million and $1.5 million, respectively. Effective December 1, 2011, we ceased all sales of our oil
production to Midstream under this agreement.
Midland Lease
We occupy our corporate headquarters in Midland, Texas under a five-year lease, effective May 15, 2011, with Fasken
Midland, LLC, or Fasken, an entity controlled by an affiliate of Wexford. Through December 31, 2011, we paid $40,080 to
Fasken under this lease. Our monthly rent as of June 30, 2012 under the lease was $7,371, and this amount will
increase approximately 4% annually on June 1 of each year during the remainder of the lease term.

Oklahoma City Lease
133
We occupy office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma under a sixty-seven month lease agreement, effective January 1,
2012, with Caliber Investment Group, LLC, or Caliber, an entity controlled by an affiliate of Wexford. Through June 30,
2012, we paid $206,429 to Caliber under this lease. Our monthly base rent as of June 30, 2012 was $15,352, which will
increase to $16,687 on August 1, 2012 for the remainder of the lease term. We are also responsible for paying a portion
of specified costs, fees and expenses associated with the operation of the premises.
Area of Mutual Interest and Related Agreements
Effective as of November 1, 2007, we and Gulfport entered into an area of mutual interest agreement to jointly acquire
oil and gas leases in the Permian Basin. The agreement provides that each party must offer the other party the right to
participate in 50% of each such acquisition. The parties also agreed, subject to certain exceptions, to share third-party
costs and expenses in proportion to their respective participating interests and pay certain other fees as provided in the
agreement. The agreement continues in force on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either party upon 30 days
prior written notice.
In connection with the area of mutual interest agreement, we, Gulfport and Windsor Energy Group, L.L.C., or Energy
Group, an entity controlled by Wexford, as the operator, entered into a joint development agreement, effective as of
November 1, 2007, pursuant to which we and Gulfport agreed to develop certain jointly-held oil and gas leases in the
Permian Basin and Energy Group agreed to act as the operator under the terms of a joint operating agreement, effective
as of November 1, 2007. In the event either party has a majority interest in a prospect (as defined in the development
agreement), the majority party may designate the operator of its choice. The parties agreed to designate Energy Group
as the operator with respect to the contract area as provided in the joint operating agreement. As operator of these
properties, Energy Group was responsible for the daily operations, monthly operation billings and monthly revenue
disbursements for the properties in which we held an interest. Effective February 26, 2010, the agreement with Energy
Group was terminated and we became the operator of these properties. As of December 31, 2011 we did not owe Energy
Group any amounts. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, Energy Group billed us approximately
$4.4 million and $20.7 million, respectively, and at December 31, 2010 and 2009, we owed $0.07 million and
$2.8 million, respectively, for these services.
Upon becoming operator effective February 26, 2010, we began providing joint interest billing services to certain of our
affiliates. For the six months ended June 30, 2012 and the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we billed Gulfport
$25.6 million, $56.7 million and $32.4 million, respectively, and we billed an entity controlled by Wexford $0.7 million,
$5.3 million and $8.8 million, respectively, for such services. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and 2010,
Gulfport owed us $7.5 million, $8.6 million and $5.6 million, respectively, and the Wexford controlled entity owed us
$0.1 million, $0.4 million and zero, respectively.
Our area of mutual interest agreement and joint development agreement, each with Gulfport, will be terminated upon
the Gulfport transaction.
Investment in Muskie Holdings LLC
During 2011, Windsor Permian purchased certain assets, real estate and rights in a lease covering land in Wisconsin
that is prospective for mining oil and natural gas fracture grade sand for $4.2 million from an unrelated third party. On
October 7, 2011, Windsor Permian contributed these assets, real estate and lease rights to a newly-formed entity,
Muskie Holdings LLC, or Muskie, in exchange for a 48.6% equity interest. The remaining equity interests in Muskie are
held 25% by Gulfport and 26.4% by entities controlled by Wexford. Through additional contributions from the Wexford-
controlled entities to Muskie, Windsor Permian’s equity interest decreased to approximately 33%. In June 2012,
Windsor Permian distributed its remaining interest in Muskie to its member. As a result, we will not acquire any
interest in Muskie when Diamondback Energy LLC is merged with and into Diamondback Energy, Inc. prior to the
effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.

MidMar
134
We are party to a gas purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2009, as amended, with MidMar Gas LLC, or MidMar, an entity
that owns a gas gathering system and processing plant in the Permian Basin. Under this agreement, MidMar is
obligated to purchase from us, and we are obligated to sell to MidMar, all of the gas conforming to certain quality
specifications produced from certain of our Permian Basin acreage. Following the expiration of the initial ten-year term,
the agreement will continue on a year-to-year basis until terminated by either party on 30 days written notice. Under the
gas purchase agreement, MidMar is obligated to pay us 87% of the net revenue received by MidMar for all components
of our dedicated gas, including liquid hydrocarbons, and the sale of residue gas, in each case, extracted, recovered or
otherwise processed at MidMar’s gas processing plant; and 94.56% of the net revenue received by MidMar from the sale
of such gas components and residue gas, extracted, recovered or otherwise processed at the Chevron Headlee plant.
Travis D. Stice, our Chief Executive Officer, has served as a manager on MidMar’s board of managers since April 2011
and as Vice President and Secretary of MidMar since April 2012. An entity controlled by Wexford in which Gulfport and
certain entities controlled by Wexford are members owns approximately a 28% equity interest in MidMar. The
remaining equity interests in MidMar are owned by nonaffiliated third parties. For the six months ended June 30, 2012
and the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, MidMar paid us $1.2 million, $3.1 million and $1.1 million,
respectively, and at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 and 2010, MidMar owed us $0.3 million, $0.4 million and
$0.1 million, respectively, for our portion of the net proceeds from the sale of such gas products and residue gas by
MidMar. We were not paid, nor were we owed, any amounts for 2009 by MidMar.
Advisory Services Agreement
During the six months ended June 30, 2012, Wexford provided certain professional services to us, for which we were
billed approximately $94,200. As of June 30, 2012, we owed Wexford $46,790 for such services. Prior to the closing of
this offering we will enter into an advisory services agreement with Wexford under which Wexford will provide us with
general financial and strategic advisory services related to our business in return for an annual fee of $500,000, plus
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. This agreement has a term of two years commencing on the completion of this
offering. The agreement will continue for additional one-year periods unless terminated in writing by either party at
least ten days prior to the expiration of the then current term. The agreement may be terminated at any time by either
party upon 30 days’ prior written notice. In the event we terminate the agreement, we are obligated to pay all amounts
due through the remaining term of the agreement. In addition, in this agreement we have agreed to pay Wexford to-be-
negotiated market-based fees approved by our independent directors for such services as may be provided by Wexford
at our request in connection with future acquisitions and divestitures, financings or other transactions in which we may
be involved. The services provided by Wexford under the advisory services agreement will not extend to our day-to-day
business or operations. In this agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Wexford and its affiliates from any and all
losses arising out of or in connection with the agreement except for losses resulting from Wexford’s or its affiliates’
gross negligence or willful misconduct.
Registration Rights
Prior to the closing of this offering, we will enter a registration rights agreements with DB Holdings and Gulfport under
which we will grant DB Holdings and Gulfport certain demand and “piggyback” registration rights. For more
information regarding this agreement, see “Shares Eligible for Future Sale—Registration Rights” on page 142 of this

(1) Percentage of beneficial ownership is based upon              shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the
offering after giving effect to the Transactions, and              (including              shares of common stock issuable on the
closing date of this offering upon vesting of certain restricted stock units granted to our executive officers and directors)
shares of common stock (or              shares of common stock if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is
exercised in full) outstanding after the offering. For purposes of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have
“beneficial ownership” of any shares which such person has the right to acquire within 60 days. For purposes of computing
the percentage of outstanding shares held by each person or group of persons named above, any security which such
person or group of persons has the right to acquire within 60 days is deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of
computing the percentage ownership for such person or persons, but is not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of
computing the percentage ownership of any other person. As a result, the denominator used in calculating the beneficial
ownership among our stockholders may differ.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
We will amend and restate our certificate of incorporation and bylaws in connection with this offering. The following
description of our common stock, certificate of incorporation and our bylaws are summaries thereof and are qualified
by reference to our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws as so amended and restated, copies of which will be
filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.
Our authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share. We have applied to have our shares of common stock listed on
The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “FANG.”
Common Stock
Holders of shares of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of
stockholders. Shares of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights, which means that the holders of more
than 50% of the shares voting for the election of the board of directors can elect all the directors to be elected at that
time, and, in such event, the holders of the remaining shares will be unable to elect any directors to be elected at that
time. Our certificate of incorporation denies stockholders any preemptive rights to acquire or subscribe for any stock,
obligation, warrant or other securities of ours. Holders of shares of our common stock have no redemption or
conversion rights nor are they entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund provisions.
In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of shares of common stock shall be entitled to
receive, pro rata, all the remaining assets of our company available for distribution to our stockholders after payment
of our debts and after there shall have been paid to or set aside for the holders of capital stock ranking senior to
common stock in respect of rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up the full preferential amounts to which
they are respectively entitled.
Holders of record of shares of common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the board of
directors out of any assets legally available for such dividends, subject to both the rights of all outstanding shares of
capital stock ranking senior to the common stock in respect of dividends and to any dividend restrictions contained in
debt agreements. All outstanding shares of common stock and any shares sold and issued in this offering will be fully
paid and nonassessable by us.
Preferred Stock
Our board of directors is authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. The
board of directors may fix for each series:
•
the distinctive serial designation and number of shares of the series;
•
the voting powers and the right, if any, to elect a director or directors;
•
the terms of office of any directors the holders of preferred shares are entitled to elect;
•
the dividend rights, if any;
•
the terms of redemption, and the amount of and provisions regarding any sinking fund for the purchase or redemption
thereof;
•
the liquidation preferences and the amounts payable on dissolution or liquidation;
•
the terms and conditions under which shares of the series may or shall be converted into any other series or class of
stock or debt of the corporation; and
•
any other terms or provisions which the board of directors is legally authorized to fix or alter.

Index to Financial Statements
We do not need stockholder approval to issue or fix the terms of the preferred stock. The actual effect of the
authorization of the preferred stock upon your rights as holders of common stock is unknown until our board of
directors determines the specific rights of owners of any series of preferred stock. Depending upon the rights granted
to any series of preferred stock, your voting power, liquidation preference or other rights could be adversely affected.
Preferred stock may be issued in acquisitions or for other corporate purposes. Issuance in connection with a
stockholder rights plan or other takeover defense could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to
acquire, or of discouraging a third party from acquiring, control of our company. We have no present plans to issue
any shares of preferred stock.
Related Party Transactions and Corporate Opportunities
Subject to the limitations of applicable law, our certificate of incorporation, among other things:
•
•
•
permits us to enter into transactions with entities in which one or more of our officers or directors are financially or
otherwise interested so long as it has been approved by our board of directors;
permits any of our stockholders, officers or directors to conduct business that competes with us and to make
investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments; and
provides that if any director or officer of one of our affiliates who is also one of our officers or directors becomes
aware of a potential business opportunity, transaction or other matter (other than one expressly offered to that director
or officer in writing solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer), that director or officer will have no duty to
communicate or offer that opportunity to us, and will be permitted to communicate or offer that opportunity to such
affiliates and that director or officer will not be deemed to have (i) acted in a manner inconsistent with his or her
fiduciary or other duties to us regarding the opportunity or (ii) acted in bad faith or in a manner inconsistent with our
best interests.
Anti-takeover Effects of Provisions of Our Certificate of Incorporation and Our Bylaws
Some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult
to acquire us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise, or to remove our incumbent officers and
directors. These provisions, summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate
takeover bids. These provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first
negotiate with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to
negotiate with the proponent of an unfriendly or unsolicited proposal to acquire or restructure us outweigh the
disadvantages of discouraging such proposals because negotiation of such proposals could result in an improvement
of their terms.
Undesignated preferred stock. The ability to authorize and issue undesignated preferred stock may enable our board of
directors to render more difficult or discourage an attempt to change control of us by means of a merger, tender offer,
proxy contest or otherwise. For example, if in the due exercise of its fiduciary obligations, the board of directors were
to determine that a takeover proposal is not in our best interest, the board of directors could cause shares of preferred
stock to be issued without stockholder approval in one or more private offerings or other transactions that might dilute
the voting or other rights of the proposed acquirer or insurgent stockholder or stockholder group.
Stockholder meetings. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that a special meeting of stockholders may
be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or by a resolution adopted by a majority of our
board of directors.
Requirements for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals. Our bylaws establish advance notice
procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than
nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors.

Stockholder action by written consent. Our bylaws provide that, except as may otherwise be provided with respect to
the rights of the holders of preferred stock, no action that is required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders at
any annual or special meeting may be effected by written consent of stockholders in lieu of a meeting of stockholders,
unless the action to be effected by written consent of stockholders and the taking of such action by such written
consent have expressly been approved in advance by our board. This provision, which may not be amended except by
the affirmative vote of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, makes it difficult for stockholders to initiate or
effect an action by written consent that is opposed by our board.
Amendment of the bylaws. Under Delaware law, the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws is conferred upon the
stockholders. A corporation may, however, in its certificate of incorporation also confer upon the board of directors the
power to adopt, amend or repeal its bylaws. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws grant our board the power to
adopt, amend and repeal our bylaws at any regular or special meeting of the board on the affirmative vote of a majority
of the directors then in office. Our stockholders may adopt, amend or repeal our bylaws but only at any regular or
special meeting of stockholders by an affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all then
outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class.
Removal of Director. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that members of our board of directors may
only be removed by the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares
of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.
Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation. Our certificate of incorporation provides that, in addition to any other
vote that may be required by law or any preferred stock designation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66
2/3% of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, voting together as a single class, is required to amend, alter or repeal, or adopt any provision as part of our
certificate of incorporation inconsistent with the provisions of our certificate of incorporation dealing with distributions
on our common stock, related party transactions, our board of directors, our bylaws, meetings of our stockholders or
amendment of our certificate of incorporation.
The provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from
attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of
our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions may also have
the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to
accomplish transactions which stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. will be the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of
our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could adversely affect the
prevailing market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of shares, or the
availability of shares for future sales, will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time.
Sale of Restricted Shares
Upon completion of this offering, we will have              shares of common stock outstanding. Of these shares of
common stock, the              shares of common stock being sold in this offering, plus any shares sold upon exercise of
the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, will be freely tradable without restriction under the Securities
Act, except for any such shares held or acquired by an “affiliate” of ours, as that term is defined in Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act, which shares will be subject to the volume limitations and other restrictions of
Rule 144 described below. The remaining              shares of common stock held by our existing stockholders upon
completion of this offering, will be “restricted securities,” as that phrase is defined in Rule 144, and may be resold only
after registration under the Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from such registration, including, among others,
the exemptions provided by Rule 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, which rules are summarized below. These
remaining shares of common stock held by our existing stockholder upon completion of this offering will be available
for sale in the public market after the expiration of the lock-up agreements described in “Underwriting ” beginning on
page 147 of this prospectus, taking into account the provisions of Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act.
Rule 144
In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, persons who became the beneficial owner of shares of our common
stock prior to the completion of this offering may sell their shares upon the earlier of (1) the expiration of a six-month
holding period, if we have been subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”), for at least 90 days prior to the date of the sale and have filed all reports required
thereunder, or (2) the expiration of a one-year holding period.
At the expiration of the six-month holding period, assuming we have been subject to the Exchange Act reporting
requirements for at least 90 days and have filed all reports required thereunder, a person who was not one of our
affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares
of our common stock, and a person who was one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale
would be entitled to sell, within any three-month period, a number of shares of common stock that does not exceed the
greater of either of the following:
•
•
1% of the number of shares of our common stock then outstanding, which will equal approximately              shares
immediately after this offering; or
the average weekly trading volume of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market during the four calendar
weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale.
At the expiration of the one-year holding period, a person who was not one of our affiliates at any time during the three
months preceding a sale would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares of our common stock without
restriction. A person who was one of our affiliates at any time during the three months preceding a sale would remain
subject to the volume restrictions described above.
Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates are also subject to manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the
availability of current public information about us.

Rule 701
141
In general, under Rule 701, any of our employees, directors, officers, consultants or advisors who purchased shares
from us in connection with a compensatory stock or option plan or other written agreement before the effective date of
this offering, or who purchased shares from us after that date upon the exercise of options granted before that date, are
eligible to resell such shares in reliance upon Rule 144 beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus. If such
person is not an affiliate, the sale may be made subject only to the manner-of-sale restrictions of Rule 144. If such a
person is an affiliate, the sale may be made under Rule 144 without compliance with its one-year minimum holding
period, but subject to the other Rule 144 restrictions.
Registration Rights
Prior to the closing of this offering, we will enter into a registration rights agreements with DB Holdings and an
investor rights agreement with Gulfport. Under these agreements, each of DB Holdings and Gulfport has demand and
“piggyback” registration rights. The demand rights enable each such stockholder to require us to register its shares of
our common stock with the SEC at any time, subject to the 180-day lock-up agreement it has entered into in connection
with this offering. The piggyback rights will allow each such stockholder to register the shares of our common stock
that it owns along with any shares that we register with the SEC. These registration rights are subject to customary
conditions and limitations, including the right of the underwriters of an offering to limit the number of shares.
Stock Plans
We intend to file one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register shares of our
common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plan. The first such registration statement is
expected to be filed soon after the date of this prospectus and will automatically become effective upon filing with the
SEC. Accordingly, shares registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market
following the effective date, unless such shares are subject to vesting restrictions with us, Rule 144 restrictions
applicable to our affiliates or the lock-up restrictions described below.
Lock-Up Agreements
We, each of our directors and executive officers, DB Holdings and Gulfport have agreed that, subject to certain
exceptions, without the prior written consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, we and they will not, directly or
indirectly, for a period of 180 days after the date of the offering (a period that may be extended for up to 18 days under
certain circumstances), offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of any shares of our
common stock (other than the shares of our common stock subject to this offering) or any other securities convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock. For additional information, see “Underwriting” beginning
on page 147 of this prospectus.

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS
The following is a general discussion of material U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences of the ownership
and disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder (as defined below). This discussion deals only with
common stock purchased in this offering that is held as a “capital asset” within the meaning of Section 1221 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code (generally, property held for investment), by a non-U.S.
holder. Except as modified for estate tax purposes, the term “non-U.S. holder” means a beneficial owner of our
common stock that is not a “U.S. person” or a partnership for U.S. federal income and estate tax purposes. A U.S.
person is any of the following:
•
an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;
•
a corporation (including any entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized
in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;
•
an estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or
•
a trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust
and one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if it has a valid
election in effect under applicable U.S. Treasury Regulations to be treated as a U.S. person.
An individual may generally be treated as a resident of the United States in any calendar year for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, by, among other ways, being present in the United States for at least 31 days in that calendar year and for
an aggregate of at least 183 days during a three-year period ending in the current calendar year. For purposes of the
183-day calculation, all of the days present in the current year, one-third of the days present in the immediately
preceding year and one-sixth of the days present in the second preceding year are counted. Residents are taxed for
U.S. federal income tax purposes as if they were U.S. citizens.
This discussion is based upon provisions of the Code, and Treasury Regulations, administrative rulings and judicial
decisions, all as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in U.S.
federal income and estate tax consequences different from those discussed below. No ruling has been or will be
sought from the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, with respect to the matters discussed below, and there can be no
assurance the IRS will not take a contrary position regarding the tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership or
disposition of our common stock, or that such contrary position would not be sustained by a court. This discussion
does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income and estate taxation and does not deal with other U.S. federal tax
laws (such as gift tax laws) or foreign, state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to non-U.S. holders
in light of their personal circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not address tax considerations applicable to
investors that may be subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as (without limitation):
•
certain former U.S. citizens or residents;
•
•
•
•
shareholders that hold our common stock as part of a straddle, constructive sale transaction, synthetic security,
hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment or risk reduction transaction;
shareholders that acquired our common stock through the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as
compensation or through a tax-qualified retirement plan;
shareholders that are partnerships or entities treated as partnerships for U.S. federal income tax purposes or other
pass-through entities or owners thereof;
shareholders that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent (5%) of our outstanding common stock (except
to the extent specifically set forth below);
•
shareholders subject to the alternative minimum tax;
143
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
•
financial institutions, banks and thrifts;
•
insurance companies;
•
tax-exempt entities;
real estate investment trusts;
•
•
real estate investment trusts;
“controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” or corporations that accumulate earnings to
avoid U.S. federal income tax;
•
broker-dealers or dealers in securities or foreign currencies; and
•
traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
If a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our common
stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership (including an entity treated as a partnership for U.S.
federal income tax purposes) holding our common stock, you should consult your tax advisor.
THIS DISCUSSION IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS TAX ADVICE.
INVESTORS CONSIDERING THE PURCHASE OF OUR COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX
ADVISORS REGARDING THE APPLICATION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE AND GIFT TAX LAWS TO
THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATION AS WELL AS THE APPLICABILITY AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN
TAX LAWS OR TAX TREATIES AND ANY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS.
Distributions on Common Stock
We do not expect to pay any cash distributions on our common stock in the foreseeable future. However, in the event
we do make such cash distributions, these distributions generally will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax
purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal
income tax principles. If any such distribution exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits, the excess
will be treated as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of the non-U.S. holder’s tax basis in our common stock
and thereafter as capital gain from the sale or exchange of such common stock. See “—Gain on Disposition of
Common Stock” below. Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock that are not effectively connected
with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States will be subject to U.S. withholding
tax at a 30% rate, or if an income tax treaty applies, a lower rate specified by the treaty. In order to receive a reduced
treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must provide to us or our withholding agent IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable substitute
or successor form) properly certifying eligibility for the reduced rate. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide us or
our withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of
any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under an applicable income tax treaty.
Dividends that are effectively connected with a non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States
and, if an income tax treaty so requires, are attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S.
holder in the United States, are taxed on a net income basis at the regular graduated rates and in the manner applicable
to U.S. persons. In that case, we or our withholding agent will not have to withhold U.S. federal withholding tax if the
non-U.S. holder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements (which may generally be met by
providing an IRS Form W-8ECI). In addition, a “branch profits tax” may be imposed at a 30% rate (or a lower rate
specified under an applicable income tax treaty) on a foreign corporation’s effectively connected earnings and profits
for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items. Non-U.S. holders should consult any applicable income tax treaties
that may provide for different rules.

Gain on Disposition of Common Stock
Subject to the discussion below regarding backup withholding, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on gain recognized on a disposition of our common stock unless:
•
•
•
the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States and, if
an income tax treaty applies, is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the
United States, in which case, the gain will be taxed on a net income basis at the U.S. federal income tax rates and in
the manner applicable to U.S. persons, and if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, the branch profits tax
described above may also apply;
the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the
disposition and meets other requirements, in which case, the non-U.S. holder will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the
gain derived from the disposition (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be
offset by U.S. source capital losses, provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns
with respect to such losses; or
we are or have been a “United States real property holding corporation”, or USRPHC, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the
non-U.S. holder held our common stock.
Generally, a corporation is a USRPHC if the fair market value of its United States real property interests equals or
exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of its worldwide real property interests and its other assets used or
held for use in a trade or business. We believe we currently are a USRPHC. If we are or become a USRPHC, a non-U.S
holder nonetheless will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax or withholding in respect of any gain realized on a
sale or other disposition of our common stock so long as (i) our common stock is “regularly traded on an established
securities market” for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) such non-U.S. holder does not actually or
constructively own, at any time during the applicable period described in the third bullet point, above, more than 5% of
our outstanding common stock. We expect our common stock to be “regularly traded” on an established securities
market, although we cannot guarantee it will be so traded. Accordingly, a non-U.S holder who actually or constructively
owns more than 5% of our common stock would be subject to U.S. federal income tax and withholding in respect of
any gain realized on any sale or other disposition of common stock (taxed in the same manner as gain that is
effectively connected income, except that the branch profits tax would not apply). Non-U.S. holders should consult their
own advisor about the consequences that could result if we are, or become, a USRPHC.
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax
Dividends paid to you will generally be subject to information reporting and may be subject to U.S. backup
withholding. You will be exempt from backup withholding if you properly provide a Form W-8BEN certifying under
penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S. holder or otherwise meet documentary evidence requirements for
establishing that you are a non-U.S. holder, or you otherwise establish an exemption. Copies of the information returns
reporting such dividends and the tax withheld with respect to such dividends also may be made available to the tax
authorities in the country in which you reside.
The gross proceeds from the disposition of our common stock may be subject to information reporting and backup
withholding. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a disposition of our common stock to or through a U.S. office
of a broker, the payment will be subject to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you properly
provide an IRS Form W-8BEN certifying under penalties of perjury that you are a non-U.S. person (and the payor does
not have actual knowledge or reason to know that you are a U.S. person) or you otherwise establish an exemption. If
you sell your common stock outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker and the sales
proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information reporting
requirements generally will not apply to that payment. However, U.S.
145
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
information reporting, but not backup withholding, will generally apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that
payment is made outside the United States, if you sell your common stock through a non-U.S. office of a broker that
has certain relationships with the United States unless the broker has documentary evidence in its files that you are a
non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met, or you otherwise establish an exemption.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax. You may obtain a refund or credit of any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules that exceed your U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.
Additional Withholding Requirements
Withholding taxes may apply to certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions” (as defined in the
Code) and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, the relevant withholding agent may be required to withhold 30%
of any dividends and the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock paid to (i) a foreign financial
institution unless such foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting and enters into an
agreement with the IRS requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain U.S.
persons or U.S. owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on
payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders or (ii) a non-financial
foreign entity that is the beneficial owner of the payment unless such entity certifies that it does not have any
substantial United States owners or provides the name, address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial
United States owner and such entity meets certain other requirements.
Although these rules currently apply to applicable payments made after December 31, 2012, the IRS has issued
Proposed Treasury Regulations providing that withholding will only be made on payments of dividends made on or
after January 1, 2014, and on other withholdable payments (including payments of gross proceeds) made on or after
January 1, 2015. The Proposed Treasury Regulations described above will not be effective until they are issued in their
final form, and as of the date of this prospectus, it is not possible to determine whether the proposed regulations will
be finalized in their current form or at all. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding these
withholding provisions.
Federal Estate Tax
Our common stock that is owned (or treated as owned) by an individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United
States (as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes) at the time of death will be included in such
individual’s gross estate for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise,
and, therefore, may be subject to U.S. federal estate tax.

UNDERWRITING
Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in an underwriting agreement dated                 , 2012 we have
agreed to sell to the underwriters named below, for whom Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC is acting as
representative, the following respective numbers of shares of common stock:
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Underwriter
Number
of Shares
Total
The underwriting agreement provides that the underwriters are obligated to purchase all the shares of common stock in
the offering if any are purchased, other than those shares covered by the option described below. The underwriting
agreement also provides that if an underwriter defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may
be increased or the offering may be terminated.
We have granted to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an aggregate of              additional shares at the
initial public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. The option may be exercised only to
cover any over-allotments of common stock.
The underwriters propose to offer the shares of common stock initially at the public offering price on the cover page of
this prospectus and to selling group members at that price less a selling concession of $            per share. The
underwriters and selling group members may allow a discount of $            per share on sales to other broker/dealers.
After the initial public offering the representatives may change the public offering price and concession and discount to
broker/dealers. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the
underwriters’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.
The following table summarizes the compensation and estimated expenses we will pay:

We estimate that our out of pocket expenses for this offering will be approximately $            .
The representative has informed us that it does not expect sales to accounts over which the underwriters have
discretionary authority to exceed 5% of the shares of common stock being offered.
We have agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, we will not offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose
of, directly or indirectly, or file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a registration statement under the
Securities Act relating to any shares of our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for any shares of our common stock, or publicly disclose the intention to make any offer, sale, pledge, disposition or
filing, without the prior written consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC for a period of 180 days after the date of
this prospectus. However, in the event that either (1) during the last 17 days of the “lock-up” period, we release
earnings results or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (2) prior to the expiration of the “lock-up”
period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the
“lock-up” period, then in either case the expiration of

the “lock-up” will be extended until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the date of the release of the
earnings results or the occurrence of the material news or event, as applicable, unless Credit Suisse Securities (USA)
LLC waives, in writing, such an extension.
Our officers, directors and the principal stockholders have each agreed that, subject to certain exceptions, they will not
offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any shares of our common stock or
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of our common stock, enter into a transaction
that would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part,
any of the economic consequences of ownership of our common stock, whether any of these transactions are to be
settled by delivery of our common stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise, or publicly disclose the intention to
make any offer, sale, pledge or disposition, or to enter into any transaction, swap, hedge or other arrangement,
without, in each case, the prior written consent of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC for a period of 180 days after the
date of this prospectus. However, in the event that either (1) during the last 17 days of the “lock-up” period, we release
earnings results or material news or a material event relating to us occurs or (2) prior to the expiration of the “lock-up”
period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning on the last day of the
“lock-up” period, then in either case the expiration of the “lock-up” will be extended until the expiration of the 18-day
period beginning on the date of the release of the earnings results or the occurrence of the material news or event, as
applicable, unless Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC waives, in writing, such an extension.
Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, in its sole discretion, may release the common stock and other securities subject
to the lock-up agreements described above in whole or in part at any time. When determining whether or not to release
the common stock and other securities from lock-up agreements, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC will consider,
among other factors, the holder’s reasons for requesting the release and the number of shares of common stock or
other securities for which the release is being requested.
The underwriters have reserved for sale at the initial public offering price up to                 shares of the common stock
for employees, directors and other persons associated with us who have expressed an interest in purchasing common
stock in the offering. The number of shares available for sale to the general public in the offering will be reduced to the
extent these persons purchase the reserved shares. Any reserved shares not so purchased will be offered by the
underwriters to the general public on the same terms as the other shares.
We have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against liabilities under the Securities Act, or contribute to payments
that the underwriters may be required to make in that respect.
We have applied to list the shares of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “FANG”.
In connection with the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Market, the underwriters will undertake to
sell round lots of 100 shares or more to a minimum of 400 beneficial owners.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price for our
common stock will be determined by negotiation between us and the underwriters. The principal factors to be
considered in determining the initial public offering price include the following:
•
the general condition of the securities markets;
•
market conditions for initial public offerings;
•
the market for securities of companies in businesses similar to ours;
•
the history and prospects for the industry in which we compete;
•
our past and present operations and earnings and our current financial position;

other information included in this prospectus and otherwise available to the underwriters.
We cannot assure you that the initial public offering price will correspond to the price at which our common stock will
trade in the public market subsequent to this offering or that an active trading market will develop and continue after
this offering.
Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have from time to time performed, and may in the future
perform, various financial advisory, commercial banking and investment banking services for us and for our affiliates
in the ordinary course of business for which they have received and would receive customary compensation.
In connection with the offering the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions, over-allotment transactions,
syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
•
•
•
Stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a
specified maximum.
Over-allotment involves sales by the underwriters of shares in excess of the number of shares the underwriters are
obligated to purchase, which creates a syndicate short position. The short position may be either a covered short
position or a naked short position. In a covered short position, the number of shares over-allotted by the underwriters
is not greater than the number of shares that they may purchase in the over-allotment option. In a naked short
position, the number of shares involved is greater than the number of shares in the over-allotment option. The
underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their over-allotment option and/or
purchasing shares in the open market.
Syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the common stock in the open market after the distribution has
been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions. In determining the source of shares to close out the short
position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open
market as compared to the price at which they may purchase shares through the over-allotment option. If the
underwriters sell more shares than could be covered by the over-allotment option, a naked short position, the position
can only be closed out by buying shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the
underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the shares in the open market after
pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering.
•
Penalty bids permit the representative to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the common
stock originally sold by the syndicate member is purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover
syndicate short positions.
These stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or
maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the
common stock. As a result the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in
the open market. These transactions may be effected on the NASDAQ Global Market or otherwise and, if commenced,
may be discontinued at any time.
A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on the web sites maintained by one or more of the
underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering and one or more of the underwriters
participating in this offering may distribute prospectuses electronically. The representative may agree to allocate a
number of shares to underwriters and selling group members for sale to their online brokerage account holders.
Internet distributions will be allocated by the underwriters and selling group members that will make internet
distributions on the same basis as other allocations.

Gentlemen:
At your request, Ryder Scott Company (Ryder Scott) has prepared an estimate of the proved reserves, future
production, and income attributable to certain leasehold interests of Windsor Permian LLC (Windsor) as of
December 31, 2011. This report supersedes our report of January 20, 2012 and reflects a revised drilling schedule. The
subject properties are located in the state of Texas. The reserves and income data were estimated based on the
definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in
Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in
the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our third party study, completed on January 20, 2012 and presented herein, was
prepared for public disclosure in Windsor’s filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements
set forth in the SEC regulations.
The properties evaluated by Ryder Scott represent 100 percent of the total net proved liquid hydrocarbon reserves and
100 percent of the total net proved gas reserves of Windsor as of December 31, 2011.
The results of this study are summarized below.

The estimated reserves and future net income amounts presented in this report, as of December 31, 2011 are related to
hydrocarbon prices. The hydrocarbon prices used in the preparation of this report are based on the average prices
during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered in this report, determined as the un-weighted
arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless
prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary
significantly from the prices required by SEC regulations; therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and the
amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report.
Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in thousands of standard 42 gallon barrels (MBbl). All gas volumes are reported on
an “as sold basis” expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the
areas in which the gas reserves are located. The net remaining reserves are also shown herein on an equivalent unit
basis wherein natural gas is converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel
of oil equivalent. MBOE means thousands barrels of oil equivalent. In this report, the revenues, deductions, and
income data are expressed as thousands of U.S. dollars (M$).
The estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties in this report were prepared
using the economic software package AriesTM System Petroleum Economic Evaluation Software, a copyrighted
program of Halliburton. The program was used solely at the request of Windsor. Ryder Scott has found this program to
be generally acceptable, but notes that certain summaries and calculations may vary due to rounding and may not
exactly match the sum of the properties being summarized. Furthermore, one line economic summaries may vary
slightly from the more detailed cash flow projections of the same properties, also due to rounding. The rounding
differences are not material.
The future gross revenue is after the deduction of production taxes. The deductions incorporate the normal direct costs
of operating the wells, ad valorem taxes, recompletion costs and development costs. The future net income is before
the deduction of state and federal income taxes and general administrative overhead, and has not been adjusted for
outstanding loans that may exist nor does it include any adjustment for cash on hand or undistributed income.
Liquid hydrocarbon reserves account for approximately 96.0 percent and gas reserves account for the remaining 4.0
percent of total future gross revenue from proved reserves.

Reserves Included in This Report
The proved reserves included herein conform to the definitions as set forth in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a)
entitled “Petroleum Reserves Definitions” is included as an attachment to this report.
The various reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled “Petroleum Reserves Definitions” in
this report. The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the shut-in category.
No attempt was made to quantify or otherwise account for any accumulated gas production imbalances that may exist.
The proved gas volumes included herein do not attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves.
Reserves are “estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically
producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.” All reserve estimates
involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be
greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends
chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the
interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two
principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing
uncertainty in their recoverability. At Windsor’s request, this report addresses the proved reserves attributable to the
properties evaluated herein.

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data,
can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. If deterministic
methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that
the quantities will be recovered.”
Reserve estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as
economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that “as changes due to increased availability of
geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated
ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to
decrease.” Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation
by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are
estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, the revenues therefrom, and
the actual costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.
Windsor’s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and
regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to
produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies,
royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in
governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of
proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities.
The estimates of reserves presented herein were based upon a detailed study of the properties in which Windsor owns
an interest; however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this
report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included for potential liabilities to restore
and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
Estimates of Reserves
The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the
quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty
associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas
reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These
RYDER SCOTT COMPANY    PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS
B-5

Windsor Permian LLC
May 31, 2012
Page 5
analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based
methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the
process of estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserve evaluators must select the method or combination of methods
which in their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and
engineering data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the
reservoir being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this
data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the
incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental
approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserve category
assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable and/or possible
that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined
by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the “quantities actually recovered are much more likely than not to be
achieved.” The SEC states that “probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered
than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.” The SEC states
that “possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and
the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus
possible reserves.” All quantities of reserves within the same reserve category must meet the SEC definitions as noted
above.
Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may be revised in the future as additional
geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated
reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future
operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted
herein.
The proved reserves for the properties included herein were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a
combination of both methods. Approximately 85 percent of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing
wells were estimated by performance methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline
curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December,
2011 in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The data utilized in this analysis were furnished
to Ryder Scott by Windsor and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. The remaining 15 percent of the
proved reserves were estimated by analogy, or a combination of performance and analogy methods. The analogy
method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the
use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate.
All proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves included herein were estimated by the analogy
method.
To estimate economically recoverable proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows, we consider many
factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological,
geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and
SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates.

Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically
producible from a given date forward based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which
economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future
prices received for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may
increase or decrease from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules
adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
Windsor has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering
data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In preparing our forecast of future proved production
and income, we have relied upon data furnished by Windsor with respect to property interests owned, production and
well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation
and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, product prices based
on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well
logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness;
however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Windsor. We consider the factual
data used in this report appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves and future net
revenues herein.
In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used in this report appropriate for
the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate to
prepare the estimates of reserves herein. The proved reserves included herein were determined in conformance with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule,
including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, referred to herein collectively as the “SEC Regulations.”
In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report comply with the definitions, guidelines and disclosure
requirements as required by the SEC regulations.
Future Production Rates
For wells currently on production, our forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance data. If
no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the
effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of
decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as
the basis for estimating future production rates.
Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or
locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an
anticipated date furnished by Windsor. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier
or later than anticipated in our estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate
production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling,
completing and/or recompleting wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies.
The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing
may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating
conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions,
producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.

Hydrocarbon Prices
The hydrocarbon prices used herein are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month
period prior to the ending date of the period covered in this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages
of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by
contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and
determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract. Upon contract
expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month un-weighted arithmetic average as previously described.
As noted above, Windsor furnished us with the average prices in effect on December 31, 2011. These initial SEC
hydrocarbon prices were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate
to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for
differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the “benchmark prices” and “price reference” used for
the geographic area included in the report. In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may
be defined by contractual arrangements.
The product prices which were actually used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect
adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and/or
distance from market, referred to herein as “differentials.” The differentials used in the preparation of this report were
furnished to us by Windsor and were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however,
we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Windsor to determine these differentials.
In addition, the table below summarizes the net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials and
referred to herein as the “average realized prices.” The average realized prices shown in the table below were
determined from the total future gross revenue before production taxes and the total net reserves by reserve category
for the geographic area and presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic
areas included in the report.

Costs
Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report are based on the operating expense reports of Windsor and
include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells. The operating costs include a portion of general and
administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. The operating costs furnished to us were accepted as
factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification
of the operating cost data used by Windsor. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or
exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells.
Development costs were furnished to us by Windsor and are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed
work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs furnished to us were accepted as factual data and
reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of these costs.
Windsor’s estimates of zero abandonment costs after salvage value for onshore properties were used in this report.
Ryder Scott has not performed a detailed study of the abandonment costs or the salvage value and makes no warranty
for Windsor’s estimate.
The proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves in this report have been incorporated herein in
accordance with Windsor’s plans to develop these reserves as of December 31, 2011. The implementation of Windsor’s
development plans as presented to us and incorporated herein is subject to the approval process adopted by
Windsor’s management. As the result of our inquiries during the course of preparing this report, Windsor has informed
us that the development activities included herein have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required
by Windsor’s management at the appropriate local, regional and/or corporate level. In addition to the internal approvals
as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to specific partner AFE processes, Joint Operating
Agreement (JOA) requirements or other administrative approvals external to Windsor. Additionally, Windsor has
informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political or economic obstacles that would significantly
alter their plans.
Current costs used by Windsor were held constant throughout the life of the properties.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS
As Adapted From:
RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210
UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
PREAMBLE
On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the “Modernization of
Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” includes revisions and additions to the definition section in
Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and
amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule”,
including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the “SEC
regulations”. The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17,
Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages
excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically
producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates
involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be
greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends
chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the
interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two
principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing
uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a
company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents
publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources
other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless
such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in §229.1202 Instruction
to Item 1202.
Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as
economic conditions change.
Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods
include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate
recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods,
chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may
be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum
accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place
characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. Examples of unconventional
petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas
hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized
extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS
Page 2
Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from
different reserves categories.
RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
Reserves.    Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be
economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In
addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a
revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all
permits and financing required to implement the project.
Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing,
faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned
to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir,
structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially
recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
Proved oil and gas reserves.    Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a
given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and
government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for
the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably
certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and
(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it
and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known
hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable
technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential
exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the
reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact
with reasonable certainty.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS
Page 3
PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) CONTINUED
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including,
but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the
reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence
using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or
program was based; and
(B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental
entities.
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be
determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period
covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each
month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon
future conditions.

Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be
made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the
following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted
from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required
equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions)
While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-
classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
Developed Producing Reserves
Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at
the time of the estimate.
Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
Developed Non-Producing
Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
Shut-In
Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from:
(1)
completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing;

(2)
wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or
(3)
wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
Behind-Pipe
Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional
completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a
new well.
UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as
follows:
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are
reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes
reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted
indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer
time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an
application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been
proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of
this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

At your request, Ryder Scott Company (Ryder Scott) has prepared an estimate of the proved reserves, future
production, and income attributable to certain leasehold interests of Windsor UT (Windsor) as of December 31, 2011.
This report supersedes our report of January 20, 2012 and reflects a revised drilling schedule. The subject properties
are located in the state of Texas. The reserves and income data were estimated based on the definitions and disclosure
guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) contained in Title 17, Code of Federal
Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC
regulations). Our third party study, completed on January 20, 2012 and presented herein, was prepared for public
disclosure in Windsor’s filings made with the SEC in accordance with the disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC
regulations.
The properties evaluated by Ryder Scott represent 100 percent of the total net proved liquid hydrocarbon reserves and
100 percent of the total net proved gas reserves of Windsor as of December 31, 2011.
The results of this study are summarized below.

The estimated reserves and future net income amounts presented in this report, as of December 31, 2011 are related to
hydrocarbon prices. The hydrocarbon prices used in the preparation of this report are based on the average prices
during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered in this report, determined as the un-weighted
arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless
prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary
significantly from the prices required by SEC regulations; therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and the
amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report.
Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in thousands of standard 42 gallon barrels (MBbl). All gas volumes are reported on
an “as sold basis” expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the
areas in which the gas reserves are located. The net remaining reserves are also shown herein on an equivalent unit
basis wherein natural gas is converted to oil equivalent using a factor of 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas per one barrel
of oil equivalent. MBOE means thousands barrels of oil equivalent. In this report, the revenues, deductions, and
income data are expressed as thousands of U.S. dollars (M$).
The estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties in this report were prepared
using the economic software package AriesTM System Petroleum Economic Evaluation Software, a copyrighted
program of Halliburton. The program was used solely at the request of Windsor. Ryder Scott has found this program to
be generally acceptable, but notes that certain summaries and calculations may vary due to rounding and may not
exactly match the sum of the properties being summarized. Furthermore, one line economic summaries may vary
slightly from the more detailed cash flow projections of the same properties, also due to rounding. The rounding
differences are not material.
The future gross revenue is after the deduction of production taxes. The deductions incorporate the normal direct costs
of operating the wells, ad valorem taxes, recompletion costs and development

costs. The future net income is before the deduction of state and federal income taxes and general administrative
overhead, and has not been adjusted for outstanding loans that may exist nor does it include any adjustment for cash
on hand or undistributed income.
Liquid hydrocarbon reserves account for approximately 97.5 percent and gas reserves account for the remaining 2.5
percent of total future gross revenue from proved reserves.
The discounted future net income shown above was calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum
compounded monthly. Future net income was discounted at four other discount rates which were also compounded
monthly. These results are shown in summary form as follows.

Reserves Included in This Report
The proved reserves included herein conform to the definitions as set forth in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a)
entitled “Petroleum Reserves Definitions” is included as an attachment to this report.
The various reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled “Petroleum Reserves Definitions” in
this report. The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the shut-in category.
No attempt was made to quantify or otherwise account for any accumulated gas production imbalances that may exist.
The proved gas volumes included herein do not attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves.
Reserves are “estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically
producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.” All reserve estimates
involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be
greater or less than the estimated quantities

determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and
engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of
uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved.
Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable
and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. At Windsor’s request, this
report addresses the proved reserves attributable to the properties evaluated herein.
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data,
can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. If deterministic
methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that
the quantities will be recovered.”
Reserve estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as
economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that “as changes due to increased availability of
geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated
ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to
decrease.” Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation
by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved included in this report are estimates
only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, the revenues therefrom, and the actual
costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.
Windsor’s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and
regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to
produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies,
royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax and are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in
governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of
proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities.

The estimates of reserves presented herein were based upon a detailed study of the properties in which Windsor owns
an interest; however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was given in this
report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included for potential liabilities to restore
and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
Estimates of Reserves
The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the
quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty
associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas
reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into
three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy.
These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the
quantities of reserves. Reserve evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in their
professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering data
available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir being
evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this
data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the
incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental
approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserve category
assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable and/or possible
that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined
by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the “quantities actually recovered are much more likely than not to be
achieved.” The SEC states that “probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered
than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.” The SEC states
that “possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and
the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus
possible reserves.” All quantities of reserves within the same reserve category must meet the SEC definitions as noted
above.
Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may be revised in the future as additional
geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated
reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future
operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted
herein.

The proved reserves for the properties included herein were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a
combination of both methods. Approximately 85 percent of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing
wells were estimated by performance methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline
curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through December,
2011 in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The data utilized in this analysis were furnished
to Ryder Scott by Windsor and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. The remaining 15 percent of the
proved reserves were estimated by analogy, or a combination of performance and analogy methods. The analogy
method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the
use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate.
All proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves included herein were estimated by the analogy
method.
To estimate economically recoverable proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows, we consider many
factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological,
geophysical and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and
SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and
(26), proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing
economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be
determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received for the sale of production and the
operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease from those under existing
economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC, omitted from consideration in
making this evaluation.
Windsor has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering
data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In preparing our forecast of future proved production
and income, we have relied upon data furnished by Windsor with respect to property interests owned, production and
well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation
and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion and development costs, product prices based
on the SEC regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well
logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness;
however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Windsor. We consider the factual
data used in this report appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves and future net
revenues herein.
In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used in this report appropriate for
the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate to
prepare the estimates of reserves herein. The proved reserves included herein were determined in conformance with
the United States Securities

and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule, including all references to
Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, referred to herein collectively as the “SEC Regulations.” In our opinion, the proved
reserves presented in this report comply with the definitions, guidelines and disclosure requirements as required by
the SEC regulations.
Future Production Rates
For wells currently on production, our forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance data. If
no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the
effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of
decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as
the basis for estimating future production rates.
Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or
locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an
anticipated date furnished by Windsor. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier
or later than anticipated in our estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate
production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling,
completing and/or recompleting wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies.
The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing
may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating
conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions,
producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
Hydrocarbon Prices
The hydrocarbon prices used herein are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month
period prior to the ending date of the period covered in this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages
of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by
contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the contract prices, including fixed and
determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until expiration of the contract. Upon contract
expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month un-weighted arithmetic average as previously described.
As noted above, Windsor furnished us with the average prices in effect on December 31, 2011. These initial SEC
hydrocarbon prices were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate
to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for
differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the “benchmark prices” and “price reference” used for
the geographic area included in the report. In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may
be defined by contractual arrangements.

The product prices which were actually used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect
adjustments to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees and/or
distance from market, referred to herein as “differentials.” The differentials used in the preparation of this report were
furnished to us by Windsor and were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however,
we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Windsor to determine these differentials.
In addition, the table below summarizes the net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials and
referred to herein as the “average realized prices.” The average realized prices shown in the table below were
determined from the total future gross revenue before production taxes and the total net reserves by reserve category
for the geographic area and presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic
areas included in the report.

Costs
Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report are based on the operating expense reports of Windsor and
include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells. The operating costs include a portion of general and
administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. The operating costs furnished to us were accepted as
factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification
of the operating cost data used by Windsor. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or
exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells.
Development costs were furnished to us by Windsor and are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed
work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs furnished to us were accepted as factual data and

development plans as presented to us and incorporated herein is subject to the approval process adopted by
Windsor’s management. As the result of our inquiries during the course of preparing this report, Windsor has informed
us that the development activities included herein have been subjected to and received the internal approvals required
by Windsor’s management at the appropriate local, regional and/or corporate level. In addition to the internal approvals
as noted, certain development activities may still be subject to specific partner AFE processes, Joint Operating
Agreement (JOA) requirements or other administrative approvals external to Windsor. Additionally, Windsor has
informed us that they are not aware of any legal, regulatory, political or economic obstacles that would significantly
alter their plans.
Current costs used by Windsor were held constant throughout the life of the properties.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS
As Adapted From:
RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210
UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
PREAMBLE
On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the “Modernization of
Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” includes revisions and additions to the definition section in
Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and
amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule”,
including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the “SEC
regulations”. The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17,
Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages
excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically
producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates
involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be
greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends
chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the
interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two
principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing
uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a
company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents
publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources
other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless
such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in §229.1202 Instruction
to Item 1202.
Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as
economic conditions change.
Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods
include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate
recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods,
chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may
be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum
accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature
C-13
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS
Page 2
of their in-place characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. Examples of
unconventional petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale
gas, gas hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require
specialized extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.
Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from
different reserves categories.
RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
Reserves.    Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be
economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In
addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a
revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all
permits and financing required to implement the project.
Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing,
faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned
to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir,
structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially
recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a
given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and
government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for
the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably
certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and
RYDER SCOTT COMPANY    PETROLEUM CONSULTANTS

PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) CONTINUED
(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it
and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known
hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable
technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential
exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the
reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact
with reasonable certainty.
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including,
but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the
reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence
using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or
program was based; and
(B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental
entities.
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be
determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period
covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each
month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon
future conditions.

completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing;
(1)
(2) wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or
(3) wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
Behind-Pipe
Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional
completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a
new well.
UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as
follows:
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are
reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes
reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted
indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer
time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an
application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been
proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of
this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

Gentlemen:
At your request, Ryder Scott Company (Ryder Scott) has prepared an estimate of the proved reserves, future
production, and income attributable to certain leasehold interests of Gulfport Energy Corporation (Gulfport) as of
December 31, 2011. This report corrects a mis-statement in our January 13, 2012 letter concerning the geographical
area of coverage. The subject properties are located in the state of Texas. The reserves and income data were estimated
based on the definitions and disclosure guidelines of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
contained in Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released
January 14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our third party study, completed on January 6, 2012, and
presented herein, was prepared for public disclosure by Gulfport in filings made with the SEC in accordance with the
disclosure requirements set forth in the SEC regulations.
The properties evaluated by Ryder Scott represent 100 percent of the total net proved liquid hydrocarbon reserves and
100 percent of the total net proved gas reserves in Gulfport’s Permian Basin area as of December 31, 2011.
The results of this study are summarized below.

The estimated reserves and future net income amounts presented in this report, as of December 31, 2011, are related to
hydrocarbon prices. The hydrocarbon prices used in the preparation of this report are based on the average prices
during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered in this report, determined as the unweighted
arithmetic averages of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless
prices were defined by contractual arrangements, as required by the SEC regulations. Actual future prices may vary
significantly from the prices required by SEC regulations; therefore, volumes of reserves actually recovered and the
amounts of income actually received may differ significantly from the estimated quantities presented in this report.
Liquid hydrocarbons are expressed in thousands of standard 42 gallon barrels (Mbbl). All gas volumes are reported on
an “as sold basis” expressed in millions of cubic feet (MMCF) at the official temperature and pressure bases of the
areas in which the gas reserves are located. In this report, the revenues, deductions, and income data are expressed as
thousands of U.S. dollars (M$).
The estimates of the reserves, future production, and income attributable to properties in this report were prepared
using the economic software package AriesTM System Petroleum Economic Evaluation Software, a copyrighted
program of Halliburton. The program was used solely at the request of Gulfport. Ryder Scott has found this program to
be generally acceptable, but notes that certain summaries and calculations may vary due to rounding and may not
exactly match the sum of the properties being summarized. Furthermore, one line economic summaries may vary
slightly from the more detailed cash flow projections of the same properties, also due to rounding. The rounding
differences are not material.
The future gross revenue is after the deduction of production taxes. The deductions incorporate the normal direct costs
of operating the wells, ad valorem taxes, recompletion costs, and development costs. The future net income is before
the deduction of state and federal income taxes and general administrative overhead, and has not been adjusted for
outstanding loans that may exist, nor does it include any adjustment for cash on hand or undistributed income. Liquid
hydrocarbon reserves account for approximately 94.9 percent and gas reserves account for the remaining 5.1 percent of
total future gross revenue from proved reserves.
The discounted future net income shown above was calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum
compounded monthly. Future net income was discounted at four other discount rates which were also compounded
monthly. These results are shown in summary form as follows.

Reserves Included in This Report
The proved reserves included herein conform to the definition as set forth in the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). An abridged version of the SEC reserves definitions from 210.4-10(a)
entitled “Petroleum Reserves Definitions” is included as an attachment to this report.
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
D-3
The various proved reserve status categories are defined under the attachment entitled “Petroleum Reserves
Definitions” in this report. The proved developed non-producing reserves included herein consist of the shut-in
category.
No attempt was made to quantify or otherwise account for any accumulated gas production imbalances that may exist.
The proved gas volumes included herein do not attribute gas consumed in operations as reserves.
Reserves are “estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically
producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations.” All reserve estimates
involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be
greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends
chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the
interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two
principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves, and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing
uncertainty in their recoverability. At Gulfport’s request, this report addresses only the proved reserves attributable to
the properties evaluated herein.
Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data,
can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. The proved
reserves included herein were estimated using deterministic methods. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has
defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.”
Proved reserve estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or
as economic conditions change. For proved reserves, the SEC states that “as changes due to increased availability of
geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and economic data are made to the estimated
ultimate recovery (EUR) with time, reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to
decrease.” Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation
by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are
estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, the revenues therefrom, and
the actual costs related thereto, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.
Gulfport’s operations may be subject to various levels of governmental controls and regulations. These controls and
regulations may include, but may not be limited to, matters relating to land tenure and leasing, the legal rights to
produce hydrocarbons, drilling and production practices, environmental protection, marketing and pricing policies,
royalties, various taxes and levies including income tax are subject to change from time to time. Such changes in
governmental regulations and policies may cause volumes of proved reserves actually recovered and amounts of
proved income actually received to differ significantly from the estimated quantities.
The estimates of proved reserves presented herein were based upon a detailed study of the properties in which
Gulfport owns an interest; however, we have not made any field examination of the properties. No consideration was
given in this report to potential environmental liabilities that may exist nor were any costs included for potential
liabilities to restore and clean up damages, if any, caused by past operating practices.
Estimates of Reserves
The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the
quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty
associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions set forth by the
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
D-4
Securities and Exchange Commission’s Regulations Part 210.4-10(a). The process of estimating the quantities of
recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical
procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods; (2) volumetric-based methods;
and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of
estimating the quantities of reserves. Reserve evaluators must select the method or combination of methods which in
their professional judgment is most appropriate given the nature and amount of reliable geoscience and engineering
data available at the time of the estimate, the established or anticipated performance characteristics of the reservoir
being evaluated and the stage of development or producing maturity of the property.
In many cases, the analysis of the available geoscience and engineering data and the subsequent interpretation of this
data may indicate a range of possible outcomes in an estimate, irrespective of the method selected by the evaluator.
When a range in the quantity of reserves is identified, the evaluator must determine the uncertainty associated with the
incremental quantities of the reserves. If the reserve quantities are estimated using the deterministic incremental
approach, the uncertainty for each discrete incremental quantity of the reserves is addressed by the reserve category
assigned by the evaluator. Therefore, it is the categorization of reserve quantities as proved, probable and/or possible
that addresses the inherent uncertainty in the estimated quantities reported. For proved reserves, uncertainty is defined
by the SEC as reasonable certainty wherein the “quantities actually recovered are much more likely than not to be
achieved.” The SEC states that “probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered
than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered.” The SEC states
that “possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves and
the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus
possible reserves.” All quantities of reserves within the same reserve category must meet the SEC definitions as noted
above.
Estimates of reserves quantities and their associated reserve categories may be revised in the future as additional
geoscience or engineering data become available. Furthermore, estimates of reserves quantities and their associated
reserve categories may also be revised due to other factors such as changes in economic conditions, results of future
operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks as previously noted
herein.
The proved reserves for the properties included herein were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a
combination of methods. Approximately 90 percent of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells
and/or reservoirs were estimated by performance methods. These performance methods involved decline curve
analysis which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through October 2011 in
those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. The data utilized in this analysis were furnished to Ryder
Scott by Gulfport or obtained from public data sources and were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof. The
remaining 10 percent of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy or a combination of performance
and analogy. These methods were used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a
definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered
to be inappropriate.
All of the proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves included herein were estimated by the analogy
method. The data utilized from the analogues were considered sufficient for the purpose thereof.
To estimate economically recoverable proved oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows, we consider many
factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological,
geophysical and engineering data that cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC
pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26),
proved reserves must be anticipated to be economically producible from a given date forward based on existing
economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic
D-5
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. While it may reasonably be anticipated that the future prices received
for the sale of production and the operating costs and other costs relating to such production may increase or decrease
from those under existing economic conditions, such changes were, in accordance with rules adopted by the SEC,
omitted from consideration in making this evaluation.
Gulfport has informed us that they have furnished us all of the material accounts, records, geological and engineering
data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In preparing our forecast of future proved production
and income, we have relied upon data furnished by Gulfport with respect to property interests owned, production and
well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation
and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, and development costs, product prices based on the SEC
regulations, adjustments or differentials to product prices, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core
analyses, and pressure measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its reasonableness; however, we
have not conducted an independent verification of the data furnished by Gulfport. We consider the factual data used in
this report appropriate and sufficient for the purpose of preparing the estimates of reserves and future net revenues
herein.
In summary, we consider the assumptions, data, methods and analytical procedures used in this report appropriate for
the purpose hereof, and we have used all such methods and procedures that we consider necessary and appropriate to
prepare the estimates of reserves herein. The proved reserves included herein were determined in conformance with
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule,
including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, referred to herein collectively as the “SEC Regulations.”
In our opinion, the proved reserves presented in this report comply with the definitions, guidelines and disclosure
requirements as required by the SEC regulations.
Future Production Rates
For wells currently on production, our forecasts of future production rates are based on historical performance data. If
no production decline trend has been established, future production rates were held constant, or adjusted for the
effects of curtailment where appropriate, until a decline in ability to produce was anticipated. An estimated rate of
decline was then applied to depletion of the reserves. If a decline trend has been established, this trend was used as
the basis for estimating future production rates.
Test data and other related information were used to estimate the anticipated initial production rates for those wells or
locations that are not currently producing. For reserves not yet on production, sales were estimated to commence at an
anticipated date furnished by Gulfport. Wells or locations that are not currently producing may start producing earlier
or later than anticipated in our estimates due to unforeseen factors causing a change in the timing to initiate
production. Such factors may include delays due to weather, the availability of rigs, the sequence of drilling,
completing and/or recompleting wells and/or constraints set by regulatory bodies.
The future production rates from wells currently on production or wells or locations that are not currently producing
may be more or less than estimated because of changes including, but not limited to, reservoir performance, operating
conditions related to surface facilities, compression and artificial lift, pipeline capacity and/or operating conditions,
producing market demand and/or allowables or other constraints set by regulatory bodies.
Hydrocarbon Prices
The hydrocarbon prices used herein are based on SEC price parameters using the average prices during the 12-month
period prior to the ending date of the period covered in this report, determined as the unweighted arithmetic averages
of the prices in effect on the first-day-of-the-month for each month within such period, unless prices were defined by
contractual arrangements. For hydrocarbon products sold under contract, the
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
D-6
contract prices, including fixed and determinable escalations, exclusive of inflation adjustments, were used until
expiration of the contract. Upon contract expiration, the prices were adjusted to the 12-month unweighted arithmetic
average as previously described.
Gulfport furnished us with the above mentioned average prices in effect on December 31, 2011. These initial SEC
hydrocarbon prices were determined using the 12-month average first-day-of-the-month benchmark prices appropriate
to the geographic area where the hydrocarbons are sold. These benchmark prices are prior to the adjustments for
differentials as described herein. The table below summarizes the “benchmark prices” and “price reference” used for
the geographic area included in the report. In certain geographic areas, the price reference and benchmark prices may
be defined by contractual arrangements.
The product prices that were actually used to determine the future gross revenue for each property reflect adjustments
to the benchmark prices for gravity, quality, local conditions, gathering and transportation fees, and/or distance from
market, referred to herein as “differentials.” The differentials used in the preparation of this report were furnished to us
by Gulfport. The differentials furnished to us were accepted as factual data and reviewed by us for their
reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data used by Gulfport to determine
these differentials.
In addition, the table below summarizes the net volume weighted benchmark prices adjusted for differentials and
referred to herein as the “average realized prices.” The average realized prices shown in the table below were
determined from the total future gross revenue before production taxes and the total net reserves for the geographic
area and presented in accordance with SEC disclosure requirements for each of the geographic areas included in the
report.

Costs
Operating costs for the leases and wells in this report are based on the operating expense reports of Gulfport and
include only those costs directly applicable to the leases or wells. The operating costs include a portion of general and
administrative costs allocated directly to the leases and wells. The operating costs furnished to us were accepted as
factual data and reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification
of the operating cost data used by Gulfport. No deduction was made for loan repayments, interest expenses, or
exploration and development prepayments that were not charged directly to the leases or wells.
Development costs were furnished to us by Gulfport and are based on authorizations for expenditure for the proposed
work or actual costs for similar projects. The development costs furnished to us were accepted as factual data and
reviewed by us for their reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of these costs.
Gulfport’s estimates of zero abandonment costs after salvage value for onshore properties were used in this report.
Ryder Scott has not performed a detailed study of the abandonment costs or the salvage value and makes no warranty
for Gulfport’s estimate.

PETROLEUM RESERVES DEFINITIONS
As Adapted From:
RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210
UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
PREAMBLE
On January 14, 2009, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published the “Modernization of
Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” in the Federal Register of National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule” includes revisions and additions to the definition section in
Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X, revisions and additions to the oil and gas reporting requirements in Regulation S-K, and
amends and codifies Industry Guide 2 in Regulation S-K. The “Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting; Final Rule”,
including all references to Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K, shall be referred to herein collectively as the “SEC
regulations”. The SEC regulations take effect for all filings made with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010. Reference should be made to the full text under Title 17,
Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) for the complete definitions (direct passages
excerpted in part or wholly from the aforementioned SEC document are denoted in italics herein).
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically
producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. All reserve estimates
involve an assessment of the uncertainty relating the likelihood that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be
greater or less than the estimated quantities determined as of the date the estimate is made. The uncertainty depends
chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the
interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by placing reserves into one of two
principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote progressively increasing
uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC regulations as of December 31, 2009, or after January 1, 2010, a
company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves in documents
publicly filed with the SEC. The SEC regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources
other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the SEC unless
such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in §229.1202 Instruction
to Item 1202.
Reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as
economic conditions change.
Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods
include all methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate
recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, natural gas cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods,
chemical flooding, and the use of miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may
be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve.
Reserves may be attributed to either conventional or unconventional petroleum accumulations. Petroleum
accumulations are considered as either conventional or unconventional based on the nature of their in-place
characteristics, extraction method applied, or degree of processing prior to sale. Examples of unconventional
petroleum accumulations include coalbed or coalseam methane (CBM/CSM), basin-centered gas, shale gas, gas
hydrates, natural bitumen and oil shale deposits. These unconventional accumulations may require specialized
extraction technology and/or significant processing prior to sale.
Reserves do not include quantities of petroleum being held in inventory.

Because of the differences in uncertainty, caution should be exercised when aggregating quantities of petroleum from
different reserves categories.
RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(26) defines reserves as follows:
Reserves. Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be
economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In
addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a
revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market, and all
permits and financing required to implement the project.
Note to paragraph (a)(26): Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing,
faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned
to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir,
structurally low reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially
recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations).
PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(22) defines proved oil and gas reserves as follows:
Proved oil and gas reserves. Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which, by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a
given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and
government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence
indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for
the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably
certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time.
(i) The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:
(A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts, if any, and
(B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it
and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data.
PROVED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS) CONTINUED
(ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known
hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable
technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.
(iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential
exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the
reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact
with reasonable certainty.

D-12
(iv) Reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques (including,
but not limited to, fluid injection) are included in the proved classification when:
(A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the
reservoir as a whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir, or other evidence
using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or
program was based; and
(B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities, including governmental
entities.
(v) Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be
determined. The price shall be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period
covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each
month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations based upon
future conditions.

RESERVES STATUS DEFINITIONS AND GUIDELINES
As Adapted From:
RULE 4-10(a) of REGULATION S-X PART 210
UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)
and
PETROLEUM RESOURCES MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (SPE-PRMS)
Sponsored and Approved by:
SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS (SPE)
WORLD PETROLEUM COUNCIL (WPC)
AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF PETROLEUM GEOLOGISTS (AAPG)
SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM EVALUATION ENGINEERS (SPEE)
Reserves status categories define the development and producing status of wells and reservoirs. Reference should be
made to Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Regulation S-X Part 210, Rule 4-10(a) and the SPE-PRMS as the
following reserves status definitions are based on excerpts from the original documents (direct passages excerpted
from the aforementioned SEC and SPE-PRMS documents are denoted in italics herein).
DEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(6) defines developed oil and gas reserves as follows:
Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered:
(i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required
equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and
(ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the
extraction is by means not involving a well.
Developed Producing (SPE-PRMS Definitions)
While not a requirement for disclosure under the SEC regulations, developed oil and gas reserves may be further sub-
classified according to the guidance contained in the SPE-PRMS as Producing or Non-Producing.
Developed Producing Reserves
Developed Producing Reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at
the time of the estimate.
Improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation.
Developed Non-Producing
Developed Non-Producing Reserves include shut-in and behind-pipe reserves.
D-14
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Shut-In
Shut-in Reserves are expected to be recovered from:
(1)
completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate, but which have not started producing;
(2)
wells which were shut-in for market conditions or pipeline connections; or
(3)
wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons.
Behind-Pipe
Behind-pipe Reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells, which will require additional
completion work or future re-completion prior to start of production.
In all cases, production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a
new well.
UNDEVELOPED RESERVES (SEC DEFINITIONS)
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X §210.4-10(a)(31) defines undeveloped oil and gas reserves as
follows:
Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on
undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.
(i) Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are
reasonably certain of production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes
reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances.
(ii) Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted
indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances, justify a longer
time.
(iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an
application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques have been
proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of
this section, or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Members
Windsor Permian LLC
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Windsor Permian LLC and subsidiaries (collectively
the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in
member’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to
perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control
over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Windsor Permian LLC and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company adopted the new oil and gas reserve estimation and
disclosure requirements as of December 31, 2009.

1. Organization
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Windsor Permian LLC (“Windsor”) is a limited liability company formed on October 23, 2007 to acquire, produce,
develop and exploit oil and natural gas properties. As a limited liability company, the members of Windsor are not
liable for the liabilities or other obligations of Windsor. Windsor is wholly owned by an investment fund which is
controlled and managed by Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford”). Collectively, Windsor and its subsidiaries, Bison Drilling
and Field Services LLC (formerly known as Windsor Drilling LLC) through March 31, 2011, and West Texas Field
Services LLC, are referred to in these financial statements as the “Company”.
The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development and production of oil and natural gas properties
and related sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Company’s reserves are located in the Southern region
of the United States. The Company’s results of operations are largely dependent on the difference between the prices
received for its oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the cost to find, develop, produce and market such
resources. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty
and a variety of other factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include worldwide political instability,
quantity of natural gas in storage, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of
consumer demand and the price of available alternative fuels, among others.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Windsor and its wholly owned subsidiaries, except for the accounts of Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC, which
has been excluded from the Company’s consolidated financial statements effective March 31, 2011 (Note 5). All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of estimates
Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
must be estimated by management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that
cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and
assumptions affect the amounts the Company reports for assets and liabilities and the Company’s disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts
and other methods the Company considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results
may differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Any effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give
rise to the revision become known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of
proved reserve quantities and related estimates of the present value of future net revenues, the carrying value of oil and
gas properties and asset retirement obligations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and
money market funds to be cash equivalents. The Company utilizes bank deposit accounts which periodically sweep
available cash into uninsured short-term investment securities. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.

Accounts Receivable
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
Accounts receivable consist of receivables from joint interest owners on properties the Company operates and oil and
natural gas production delivered to purchasers. The purchasers remit payment for production directly to the Company.
As discussed in Note 10, through February 26, 2010 a significant portion of the Company’s oil and natural gas
properties were contractually operated by an affiliate. Prior to February 26, 2010, purchasers remitted payment for
production to the affiliated operator and the affiliated operator, in turn, remitted payment to the Company. Most
payments are received within three months after the production date.
Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from joint interest owners or purchasers, net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts when the Company believes collection is doubtful. For receivables from joint interest owners, the
Company typically has the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint
interest billings. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts
receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the debtor’s current ability to pay its obligation to the
Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off specific accounts
receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to
the allowance for doubtful accounts. No allowance was deemed necessary at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, derivatives and note
payable. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates fair value because
of the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of the revolving credit facility approximates its carrying value
based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.
Derivatives are recorded at fair value (see Note 9).
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
The Company accounts for its oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting.
Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved oil and natural gas
properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, and annual lease rentals are
capitalized. General and administrative costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs
incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs
associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. All general and administrative costs not directly
associated with exploration and development activities are charged to expense as they are incurred. Capitalized general
and administrative costs were $871,036 for the year ended December 31, 2011, and no amounts were capitalized for the
years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted
for as adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would
significantly change. Any income from services provided by subsidiaries to working interest owners of properties in
which the Company also owns an interest, to the extent they exceed related costs incurred, are accounted for as
reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties proportionate to the Company’s investment in the
subsidiary (see Note 5). Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production
method based on proved reserves. The average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was $25.40,
$17.78 and $11.21 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties was $15,178,366, $7,373,126 and $3,155,084 for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Index to Financial Statements
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which
the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent
capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization
and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess
capitalized costs are charged to expense.
Beginning December 31, 2009, the Company used the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil
and natural gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date in estimating discounted future net revenues.
No impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or
2009.
Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until the Company has made a
determination as to the existence of proved reserves. The Company assesses all items classified as unevaluated
property on an annual basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a
group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors,
among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and
activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned.
During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such
property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject
to amortization. The inclusion of the Company’s unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be
completed within three years.
Other Property and Equipment
Other property and equipment is recorded at cost. The Company expenses maintenance and repairs in the period
incurred. Upon retirements or disposition of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the consolidated balance sheet with the resulting gains or losses, if any, reflected in operations. Depreciation of other
property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from
three to fifteen years. Depreciation expense was $726,949, $772,017 and $60,807 for the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Other long-lived assets, drilling rigs and related equipment used in operations are reviewed whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized
only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its estimated future undiscounted cash flows.
An impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The Company had no
such impairment losses for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 or 2009.
Capitalized Interest
The Company capitalizes interest on expenditures made in connection with exploration and development projects that
are not subject to current amortization. Interest is capitalized only for the period that activities are in progress to bring
these projects to their intended use. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense. During the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company capitalized interest expense totaling $150,280 and $54,322, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company did not capitalize any interest expense.

Inventories
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of the following:
Tubular goods and equipment
Crude oil
December 31,
2011
$5,630,208    
376,147    
 
   
    
$6,006,355
2010
$8,269,628  
164,106  
 
   
 
$8,433,734
The Company’s tubular goods and equipment is primarily comprised of oil and gas drilling or repair items such as
tubing, casing and pumping units. The inventory is primarily acquired for use in future drilling or repair operations
and is carried at lower of cost or market. “Market”, in the context of inventory valuation, represents net realizable value,
which is the amount that the Company is allowed to bill to the joint accounts under joint operating agreements to
which the Company is a party. As of December 31, 2011, the Company estimated that all of its tubular goods and
equipment will be utilized within one year. The total inventory includes tubular goods in transit of $1,093,708 and
$1,377,567 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Some of the tubular and casing pipe has been purchased, at
cost, from an affiliated company. The Company owed this affiliate $68,875 at December 31, 2010, and did not have an
outstanding balance with the affiliated company at December 31, 2011. This amount is included in accounts payable-
related party in the consolidated balance sheets.
Debt issuance costs
The Company amortizes debt issuance costs related to its credit facility as interest expense over the scheduled
maturity period of the debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs were $1,167,621 and $637,562 as of December 31, 2011
and 2010, respectively. The Company includes the unamortized costs in other assets in its consolidated balance
sheets.
Revenue and Royalties Payable
For certain oil and natural gas properties, where the Company serves as operator, the Company receives production
proceeds from the purchaser and further distributes such amounts to other revenue and royalty owners. Production
proceeds applicable to other revenue and royalty owners are reflected as revenue and royalties payable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes revenue for only its net revenue interest in oil
and natural gas properties.
Revenue Recognition
Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and
allowances, as applicable. The Company accounts for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales
method, whereby a liability is recorded when the Company’s overtake volumes exceed its estimated remaining
recoverable reserves. No receivables are recorded for those wells where the Company has taken less than its ownership
share of production. The Company did not have any gas imbalances as of December 31, 2011 and 2010. Revenues from
oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided.
Investments
Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control, are accounted for using
the equity method. Under the equity method, generally the Company’s share of investees’ earnings or loss
F-10
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
is recognized in the statement of operations. However, because substantially all of Bison’s earnings are generated by
performing services on properties owned and operated by the Company, the Company’s share of Bison’s earnings has
not been recognized but has been credited to oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its investments to
determine if a loss in value which is other than a temporary decline has occurred. If such loss has occurred, the
Company would recognize an impairment provision. There was no impairment for the Company’s equity investments
at December 31, 2011. For additional information on the Company’s investments, see Note 5.
Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for equity-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718,
“Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“FASB ASC 718”). FASB ASC 718 requires equity-based payments to
employees to be recognized as expense over the applicable service period based on the fair value of the award on the
date of grant.
Concentrations
The Company is subject to risk resulting from the concentration of its crude oil and natural gas sales and receivables
with several significant purchasers. For the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, Windsor Midstream LLC, an
entity controlled by Wexford, our equity sponsor, accounted for 78% and 81% of our revenue, respectively. For the year
ended December 31, 2009, two purchasers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue: Windsor Midstream LLC
(68.3%) and DCP Midstream, LP (14.8%). The Company does not require collateral and does not believe the loss of any
single purchaser would materially impact its operating results, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with
well-established markets and numerous purchasers.
Commodity Risk Management
The Company has used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the
market price of crude oil. The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair
value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether
it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship.
For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the
hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Changes
in the fair value of instruments designated as a fair value hedge offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item and
changes in the fair value of instruments designated as cash flow hedges are shown in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as
hedging instruments, the unrealized gain or loss on the change in fair value of these instruments are recognized in
earnings during the period of change. None of the Company’s derivatives were designated as hedging instruments
during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.
Environmental Compliance and Remediation
Environmental compliance and remediation costs, including ongoing maintenance and monitoring, are expensed as
incurred. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and remediation are probable, and the costs can be
reasonably estimated.
Income Taxes
The operations of the Company, as limited liability companies, are not subject to federal income taxes. As appropriate,
the taxable income or loss applicable to those operations is included in the federal income tax returns
Table of Contents

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
of the respective owners and no income tax effect is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The Company is subject to margin tax in the state of Texas. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009,
there was no margin tax expense. The Company’s 2008, 2009 and 2010 federal income tax and state margin tax returns
remain open to examination by tax authorities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has no unrecognized
tax benefits that would have a material impact on the effective rate. The Company is continuing its practice of
recognizing interest and penalties related to income tax matters as interest expense and general and administrative
expenses, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, there was no interest or penalties
associated with uncertain tax positions in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Unaudited Pro Forma Income Taxes and Earnings Per Share
Prior to the completion of a proposed 2012 initial public offering of common stock (“IPO”) by Diamondback Energy,
Inc. (“Diamondback”), Diamondback Energy LLC will be merged with and into Diamondback and Diamondback will
continue as the surviving entity and as a result of the merger, Windsor will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Diamondback (“Proposed Merger”). Diamondback, a holding company formed on December 30, 2011 which will not
conduct any material business operations prior to the Proposed Merger, is a C-Corp under the Internal Revenue Code
and is subject to income taxes. Accordingly, the Company computed a pro forma income tax provision as if the
Company were a C-Corp for all periods presented. The pro forma tax provision has been calculated at a rate based
upon a federal corporate level tax rate and a state tax rate, net of federal benefit, incorporating permanent differences.
However, on a pro forma basis, management has determined that any net deferred income tax asset would not be
realizable; therefore, tax expense would be zero for all periods. Additionally, upon Windsor becoming a subsidiary of
Diamondback, the Company will establish a net deferred tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of
the Company’s assets and liabilities, and record a corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from
continuing operations. On a pro forma basis, at December 31, 2011 the amount of this charge would have been
approximately $26.2 million.
Also, upon completion of the Proposed Merger, the Company will present pro forma earnings per share for the most
recent period. Pro forma basic and diluted income per share will be computed by dividing net income attributable to
the Company by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as if the shares of Diamondback issued in the
Proposed Merger were issued and outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2011.
Recently issued accounting standards
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-
04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS,”
which provides a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure
about fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance changes
some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements, but does not require additional fair value
measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial
reporting. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance
will not have a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.
In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income: Presentation of
Comprehensive Income,” which provides amendments to FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income” (“FASB ASC
220”). The purpose of the amendments in this update is to provide a
F-12
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
more consistent method of presenting non-owner transactions that affect an entity’s equity. The amendments eliminate
the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity and require
an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other
comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. In
December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2011-12 which defers the requirement in Accounting
Standards Update 2011-05 that companies present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated
other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial
statements. Both amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and
should be applied retrospectively. The adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flow.

The Company measures the future cost to retire its tangible long-lived assets and recognizes such cost as a liability in
accordance with ASC Topic 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (“ASC Topic 410”), which provides
accounting and reporting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset.
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
F-13
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
ASC Topic 410 requires companies to record a liability relating to the retirement and removal of assets used in their
businesses. For the Company, asset retirement obligations represent the future abandonment costs of tangible assets,
namely wells. ASC Topic 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation be recorded in
the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the corresponding cost be
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present
value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is
settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties.
A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligation is as follows:
Asset retirement obligation, beginning of period
Additional liability incurred
Accretion expense
Asset retirement obligation, end of period
Less current portion
Asset retirement obligations - long-term

The Company held a wholly owned subsidiary, Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC (“Bison”), formerly known as
Windsor Drilling LLC, formed on November 15, 2010. In addition, the Company also held a wholly owned subsidiary,
West Texas Field Services LLC, formed on March 2, 2010 which, on January 1, 2011, contributed all of its assets and
liabilities to Bison. Bison owns and operates four drilling rigs and various oil and gas well servicing equipment.
Beginning on March 31, 2011, various related party investors contributed capital to Bison diluting the Company’s
ownership interest. The Company assessed its ability to exercise financial control over Bison and based on the results
of its assessment, the Company concluded it maintained significant influence but it no longer had the ability to
exercise control over Bison. The Company deconsolidated Bison for financial reporting purposes as of March 31, 2011
and the previously consolidated amounts were removed from the consolidated balance sheet and reflected as an equity
method investment. The Company now reflects its investment in Bison on the equity method basis of accounting. The
Company eliminates any intercompany profits or losses in relation to its continuing involvement with Bison,
proportionate to its equity interest.
An entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the
subsidiary. Upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary, an entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures
any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value. The gain or loss includes any gain or loss associated with the
difference between the fair value of the retained investment in the subsidiary and its carrying amount at the date the
subsidiary is deconsolidated.
The Company internally reviewed the balance sheet of Bison to determine its fair value. At the time of the transaction
Bison was still a recently formed company and had not yet built value in its operations. Bison’s assets consisted
primarily of four recently purchased drilling rigs. Two of the drilling rigs were purchased at market

price from a third party in December 2010 and the second two were purchased from the same third party in April 2011.
The Company also reviewed pricing of similar rigs in the market through retail and auction transactions. Because the
rigs had just recently been purchased and this purchase price was in line with other outside transactions, the Company
determined that Bison’s book value equaled fair value. There was no gain or loss recorded and the retained investment
was recorded at fair value which equaled book value.
In September 2011, the Company completed the sale of 25% of its membership interest in Bison to a related party. The
Company internally reviewed the fair value of Bison and, because the effective date of this transaction was May 1, 2011
and was within thirty days of the above valuation, the Company concluded the value of Bison had not changed. The
Company determined that fair value equaled book value at the date of this transaction. There was no gain or loss
recorded and the retained investment was recorded at fair value which equaled book value.
The Company has a 27.2% ownership in Bison at December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the Company’s
investment in Bison is reflected as a non-current asset of $6,172,480.

6. Revolving Bank Credit Facility
Credit Facility-BNP Paribus
On October 15, 2010, the Company executed a secured loan agreement with BNP Paribas (“BNP”) as the administrative
agent, sole book runner and lead arranger. The loan agreement originally provided for a maximum principal amount of
$100 million and was increased to $250 million through an amendment dated December 30, 2011. The loan agreement
is subject to a collateral borrowing base calculation which is based on the Company’s oil and natural gas reserves (the
“borrowing base”). The loan bears interest at a rate elected by the Company that is based on the prime, LIBOR or
federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 1.25% to 3.00% depending on the base rate used and the amount of the
loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base.
Principal is payable voluntarily by the Company or is required to be paid (i) if the loan amount exceeds the borrowing
base; (ii) if the lender elects to require periodic payments as a part of a borrowing base re-determination; and (iii) at the
maturity date of October 15, 2014. The Company is obligated to pay, quarterly, a commitment fee equal to 0.5% per year
of the unused portion of the borrowing base. The loan is secured by substantially all of the Company’s assets. The
borrowing base is re-determined semi-annually with effective dates of April 1st and October 1st (a “scheduled
redetermination”). In addition, the Company may request an additional three redeterminations of the borrowing base
between scheduled redeterminations. The borrowing base was $45 million at December 31, 2010. The borrowing base
increased throughout 2011 through various redeterminations and at December 31, 2011 the borrowing base was $100
million. The current lenders and their percentage commitments in the reserve-based credit facility are BNP (45%),
Amegy Bank of Texas (25%), US Bancorp (25%) and West Texas National Bank (5%).
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $85,000,000 and $44,766,687,
respectively. The credit facility bears a weighted average interest rate of 3.3% and 3.5% as of December 31, 2011 and
2010, respectively.
The agreement contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants. These covenants, among other things, prohibit
additional indebtedness, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, and changes in
management and require the maintenance of various financial ratios defined below.
Financial Covenant
Ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement
Ratio of total debt to EBITDAX
Current ratio, as defined in the credit agreement
Required Ratio
Not less than 2.5 to 1.0
Not greater than 3.5 to 1.0
Not less than 1.0 to 1.0
As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the revolving
bank credit facility. The lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under the revolving bank credit facility upon the
occurrence of any event of default unless the Company cures any such default within any applicable grace period. For
payments of principal and interest under the revolving bank credit facility, the Company generally has a three business
day grace period, and a 30-day cure period for most covenant defaults, but not for defaults of certain specific
covenants, including the financial covenants and negative covenants.
Credit Facility-Bank of Oklahoma, N.A.
On September 17, 2009, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with the Bank of Oklahoma, N.A. (“BOK”).
This revolving credit facility was repaid and closed in October 2010 with borrowings from the BNP revolving credit
facility. The BOK revolving credit facility had a maximum principal amount of $50 million; subject to a collateral
borrowing base calculation, which was based on the underlying reserve value of the oil and natural gas properties
securing the credit facility and outstanding letters of credit.

7. Derivatives
F-16
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
The Company has used price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of its oil sales. In these
swaps, the Company receives the fixed price per the contract and pays a floating market price to the counterparty based
on New York Mercantile Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price
payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. The counterparties to the Company’s
derivative contracts are BNP Paribas (“BNP”) and Hess Corporation (“Hess”), who the Company believes are acceptable
credit risks.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The fair value of
swaps is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other
things, futures prices and time to maturity.
On October 4, 2011, in order to lock-in prices on the anticipated base level of production, while at the same time
providing downside protection for the Borrowing Base, the Company executed with BNP, West Texas Intermediate light
sweet crude oil swaps on the NYMEX for calendar year 2012 and 2013 of one thousand barrels per day priced at $78.50
and $80.55, respectively.
Set forth below are the summarized amounts, terms and fair values of outstanding instruments held as of December 31,
2011.

The Company enters into counter-swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking-in the value of a swap. Under the
counter-swap, the Company receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the
counterparty. The counter-swap is effective in locking-in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market
value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter-swap.
In December 2007, the Company placed a swap contract with Hess covering 1,680,000 Bbls of crude oil for the period
from January 2008 to December 2012 at various fixed prices. In April 2008, the Company entered into a series of
counter-swaps to lock-in the value of certain of these swaps settling 1,188,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. In June 2009,
the Company entered into an additional series of counter-swaps to lock-in the value of the remaining swaps settling
324,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps.

The Company is required to provide margin deposits to Hess whenever its unrealized losses exceed predetermined
credit limits. The Company had a margin deposit held by Hess of $2,325,643 and $6,528,111 as of December 31, 2011
and 2010, respectively, which earns interest that is remitted to the Company. As the Company has a master netting
agreement with Hess, the Company has offset this margin deposit against its derivative positions.

8. Equity-Based Compensation
F-18
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company granted to its executive officers options to acquire
membership interests in the Company. Such options vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the first
anniversary of the date of grant and are exercisable for five years from the date of grant. Generally, in the event more
than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company is not owned by Wexford or its affiliates and there is a material
change in the terms of the option holder’s employment, the options will vest immediately. Summarized below are the
grant dates with the total exercise prices and total fair values of the underlying options:

At December 31, 2011, for outstanding options, the intrinsic value was $112,500 and the weighted-average remaining
contractual terms were 4.6 years. Also, at December 31, 2011, no options were exercisable.
The Company accounts for such options issued using a fair-value-based method calculated on the grant-date of the
award. The resulting cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire option.
The fair value of the options issued was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. One of the inputs to
this model is the estimate of the fair value of the underlying membership interest on the date of grant. The other inputs
include an estimate of the expected volatility of the membership interest, an option’s expected term, the risk-free
interest rate over the option’s expected term, the option’s exercise price, and the Company’s expectations regarding
dividends.
The Company does not have a history of market prices for its membership interests because such interests are not
publicly traded. The expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility for a peer group of companies.
The expected term for options issued was determined based on the contractual term of the awards. The weighted-
average risk-free interest rate was based on the daily U.S. treasury yield curve rate whose term was consistent with the
expected life of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends; therefore, the expected dividend
yield was assumed to be zero.
A summary of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options to acquire membership
interests during the year ended December 31, 2011 was as follows:
Expected term
Risk-free interest rate
Expected volatility
Expected dividend yield
Year Ended
December 31, 2011 
 
5 years  
0.96% 
 
45.50% 
 
 
0.00%
As of December 31, 2011, the Company assumed no annual forfeiture rate because of its lack of turnover and lack of
history for this type of award. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on
actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior, and other factors.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported equity-based compensation expense,
because the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture
estimate is changed.
Equity-based compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $544,290. The unrecognized
equity-based compensation expense as of December 31, 2011 was $4,113,477 related to these awards which is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. No equity-based compensation expense was recorded for
the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 as the Company had not historically issued equity-based compensation
awards.
9. Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures and discloses fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures (“ASC Topic 820”). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques
used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
ASC Topic 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value. The Company’s assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the
assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses
appropriate valuation techniques based on available inputs to measure the fair values of its assets and liabilities.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC Topic 820 are as follows:
Level 1—Pricing inputs include quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and
volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as
exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities and listed equities.
Level 2—Pricing inputs include quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative
instruments that the Company values using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in
the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data, or
supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Level 2 instruments primarily
include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swaps, basis swaps, investments
and interest rate swaps. The Company’s valuation models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various
inputs including: (i) quoted forward prices for commodities, (ii) time value and (iii) current market and contractual
prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. The Company utilizes its
counterparties’ valuations to assess the reasonableness of its prices and valuation techniques.
Level 3—Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These
inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.

Level 2 Fair Value Measurements
Derivative contracts-The fair values of the Company’s crude oil swaps are measured internally using established index
prices and other sources. These are based upon, among other things, futures prices and time to maturity.
Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations
The Company estimates asset retirement obligations pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 410, “Asset
Retirement and Environmental Obligations” (“FASB ASC 410”). The initial measurement of asset retirement obligations
at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and based on internal estimates of future retirement
costs associated with oil and gas properties. Given the unobservable nature of the inputs, including plugging costs
and reserve lives, the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation liability is deemed to use Level 3 inputs.
See Note 4 for further discussion of the Company’s asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement obligations incurred
were $288,640, $208,083 and $79,666 during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
10. Related Party Transactions
Administrative Services
An entity under common management provided technical, administrative and payroll services to the Company under a
shared services agreement which began January 1, 2008. The reimbursement amount for indirect expenses is
determined by the affiliate’s management based on estimates of office space provided and time devoted to the
Company. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Company incurred total costs of $10,020,059,
$7,982,816 and $5,464,190, respectively. Costs incurred unrelated to drilling activities are expensed and costs incurred
in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved oil and natural gas properties have been capitalized. The
expensed costs were partially offset in general and administrative expenses by overhead reimbursements of $1,896,829,
$1,375,267 and $831,519 for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Amounts received until
February 26, 2010 were through the related party operator discussed below from the Company’s working interest
partners. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company owed the administrative services affiliate
$769,278 and $372,121, respectively and such amounts are included in accounts payable-related party in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

respectively. Each of these affiliated parties is either controlled by or was an affiliate of Wexford.
Completion and Well Servicing Services
The Company contracted with an affiliate for certain of its well completion services. Effective August 24, 2011, the
affiliate was sold to a non-related third party. While still an affiliate of the Company, the Company was billed
$12,511,084, $7,709,051 and $3,261,932 during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Such
amounts are capitalized in oil and natural gas properties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. At
December 31, 2010, approximately $3,061,688 in charges were owed under monthly operations billings and included in
accounts payable-related party in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2011, the entity was
no longer a related party.
Marketing Services
The Company entered into an agreement on March 1, 2009 with an entity under common management that purchases
and receives a significant portion of the Company’s oil volumes. The Company’s revenues from the affiliate were
$38,178,686, $21,402,799 and $8,815,681 during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and
such amounts are included in oil sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company had an accounts receivable-related party balance with the affiliate of
$4,132,316 and $2,730,483, respectively, and such amounts are included in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets.
Midland Lease
Effective May 15, 2011, the Company occupied corporate office space in Midland, Texas under a lease with a five-year
term. The office space is owned by an entity controlled by an affiliate of Wexford. Through December 31, 2011, the
Company paid $40,080 under this lease. The current monthly rent under the lease will increase approximately 4%
annually on June 1 of each year during the lease term.

Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
As discussed in Note 1, the Company is wholly owned by an investment fund which is controlled and managed by
Wexford. Management believes the credit facility combined with the cash flow generated from operations will be
sufficient to sustain the Company’s operations through the end of 2012; however, if additional financing is required
management will seek additional sources with could include Wexford.
11. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company could be subject to various possible loss contingencies which arise primarily from interpretation of
federal and state laws and regulations affecting the natural gas and crude oil industry. Such contingencies include
differing interpretations as to the prices at which natural gas and crude oil sales may be made, the prices at which
royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases, environmental issues and other matters. Management
believes it has complied with the various laws and regulations, administrative rulings and interpretations.
In March 2011, the Company began leasing field office space in Midland, Texas from an unrelated party. The lease term
is 84 months with equal monthly installments that escalate 3% annually on March 1st of each year. In May 2011, the

12. Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated the period after December 31, 2011 through March 23, 2012, the date the financial
statements were available to be issued, noting no subsequent events or transactions that required recognition or
disclosure in the financial statements, other than noted below.
On February 21, 2012, Wells Fargo & Company announced it had agreed to purchase BNP Paribas’ energy lending
business in the United States and that the purchase is subject to regulatory and other approvals and is expected to
close in the second quarter of 2012. BNP Paribas is administrative agent, sole book runner and lead arranger of our
reserve-based credit facility with 45% of our current borrowing base of $100 million, and a counterparty to certain of
our commodity derivatives. The purchase of BNP’s energy lending business by Wells Fargo & Company should not
have an effect on the Company’s credit facility.
13. Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Operations (Unaudited)
The following supplemental unaudited information regarding the oil and natural gas activities of the Company is
presented pursuant to the disclosure requirements promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) and the FASB ASU 2010-03, “Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas (Topic 932)”. The

reserve reports were prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and, accordingly, were based on
existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 were prepared by Pinnacle Energy
Services, LLC and as of December 31, 2011 were prepared by Ryder Scott Company L.P., both independent petroleum
engineers.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. Oil and
natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural
gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available
data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production
subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often
different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
The Company’s oil and natural gas reserves are attributable solely to properties within the United States.
Costs incurred in oil and natural gas property acquisition, exploration and development activities are as follows:
Acquisition costs:
Proved properties
Unproved properties
Development costs
Exploration costs
Capitalized asset retirement costs

As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 reserves were computed using the 12-month unweighted average of the first-
day-of-the-month prices, in accordance with revised guidelines of the SEC applicable to reserves estimates as of year-
end 2009.
Revisions represent changes in previous reserves estimates, either upward or downward, resulting from new
information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in
economic factors, such as commodity prices, operating costs or development costs.

Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
The Company experienced downward reserve revisions in estimated proved reserves in 2011. These downward
revisions were primarily the result of negative revisions in proved undeveloped wells due to offset well performance;
exclusion of proved undeveloped locations that were not scheduled to be drilled within the next five years; and the
movement of reserves previously categorized as proved undeveloped to probable reserves due to changes in booking
methodology used by our independent petroleum engineers as well as performance of wells in one prospect area.
The Company experienced downward reserve revisions in 2010, due to undeveloped locations being scheduled for
development beyond five years and thus being excluded from proved reserves.
The Company experienced upward reserve revisions in 2009, due to the pricing recovery in 2009 and the amendments
of ASC 932 in ASU 2010-03.
The increase in 2009 reserves described above had an effect on our depletion and net loss in 2009. The Company is
unable to estimate the effect on the 2009 financial statements of the SEC Modernization of the Oil and Gas Reporting
Requirement rule that was effective as of December 31, 2009 because a comparative reserve report prepared under the
previous rules does not exist.
As of December 31, 2008 all proved undeveloped reserves were noneconomic due to the commodity pricing utilized for
the reserve estimate at year end.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The following information has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the FASB ASU 2010-03, “Extractive
Activities—Oil and Gas (Topic 932).” As of December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 the standardized measure of discounted
future net cash flows are based on the average, first-day-of-the-month price.
The projections should not be viewed as realistic estimates of future cash flows, nor should the “standardized
measure” be interpreted as representing current value to the Company. Material revisions to estimates of proved
reserves may occur in the future; development and production of the reserves may not occur in the periods assumed;
actual prices realized are expected to vary significantly from those used; and actual costs may vary. The Company’s
investment and operating decisions are not based on the information presented, but on a wide range of reserve
estimates that include probable as well as proved reserves and on different price and cost assumptions.
The standardized measure is intended to provide a better means for comparing the value of the Company’s proved
reserves at a given time with those of other oil and gas producing companies than is provided by a comparison of raw
proved reserve quantities.

Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(Unaudited)
1. Organization
Windsor Permian LLC (“Windsor”) is a limited liability company formed on October 23, 2007 to acquire, produce,
develop and exploit oil and natural gas properties. As a limited liability company, the members of Windsor are not
liable for the liabilities or other obligations of Windsor. Windsor is controlled by Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford”).
Collectively, Windsor and its subsidiaries, Diamondback E&P LLC, formed on February 17, 2012, Bison Drilling and
Field Services LLC (formerly known as Windsor Drilling LLC) through March 31, 2011, and West Texas Field Services
LLC through its dissolution on June 12, 2012, are referred to in these financial statements as the “Company”.
The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development and production of oil and natural gas properties
and related sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Company’s reserves are located in the Southern region
of the United States. The Company’s results of operations are largely dependent on the difference between the prices
received for its oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the cost to find, develop, produce and market such
resources. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty
and a variety of other factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include worldwide political instability,
quantity of natural gas in storage, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of
consumer demand and the price of available alternative fuels, among others.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Windsor and its wholly owned subsidiaries, except for the accounts of Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC, which
has been excluded from the Company’s consolidated financial statements effective March 31, 2011 (Note 5). All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring accruals) considered
necessary to present fairly our financial position as of June 30, 2012, and our results of operations, changes in
members’ equity and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. Operating results for the six months
ended June 30, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year because of the
impact of fluctuations in prices received for natural gas and oil, natural production declines, timing of development
and exploration activities, the uncertainty of exploration and development drilling results and other factors. For a more
complete understanding of our operations, financial position and accounting policies, these financial statements
should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements.
Use of estimates
Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
must be estimated by management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that
cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. These estimates and
assumptions affect the amounts the Company reports for assets and liabilities and the Company’s disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
F-32
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts
and other methods the Company considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results
may differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Any effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give
rise to the revision become known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of
proved reserve quantities and related estimates of the present value of future net revenues, the carrying value of oil and
gas properties and asset retirement obligations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and
money market funds to be cash equivalents. The Company utilizes bank deposit accounts which periodically sweep
available cash into uninsured short-term investment securities. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on such accounts.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist of receivables from joint interest owners on properties the Company operates and oil and
natural gas production delivered to purchasers. The purchasers remit payment for production directly to the Company.
Most payments are received within three months after the production date.
Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from joint interest owners or purchasers, net of an allowance for
doubtful accounts when the Company believes collection is doubtful. For receivables from joint interest owners, the
Company typically has the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non-payment of joint
interest billings. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due.
The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time accounts
receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the debtor’s current ability to pay its obligation to the
Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off specific accounts
receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to
the allowance for doubtful accounts. No allowance was deemed necessary at June 30, 2012 or December 31, 2011.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, payables, derivatives and
notes payable. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates fair value
because of the short-term nature of the instruments. The fair value of the revolving credit facility approximates its
carrying value based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and
maturities. The fair value of the note payable and note payable – related party are carried at cost, which approximates
fair value due to the nature of the instruments and relatively short maturities. Derivatives are recorded at fair value (see
Note 9).
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
The Company accounts for its oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting.
Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved oil and natural gas
properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, and annual lease rentals are
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
F-33
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
capitalized. General and administrative costs capitalized to the full cost pool represent management’s estimate of costs
incurred directly related to exploration and development activities such as geological and other administrative costs
associated with overseeing the exploration and development activities. All general and administrative costs not directly
associated with exploration and development activities are charged to expense as they are incurred. Capitalized general
and administrative costs were $1,774,539 for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and no amounts were capitalized for
the six months ended June 30, 2011. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as
adjustments to capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would
significantly change. Any income from services provided by subsidiaries to working interest owners of properties in
which the Company also owns an interest, to the extent they exceed related costs incurred, are accounted for as
reductions of capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties proportionate to the Company’s investment in the
subsidiary (see Note 5). Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production
method based on proved reserves. The average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was $24.22 and
$26.72 for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization
expense for oil and natural gas properties was $10,043,901 and $7,336,891 for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and
2011, respectively.
The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which
the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent
capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization
and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess
capitalized costs are charged to expense. No impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the
six months ended June 30, 2012 or 2011.
Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until the Company has made a
determination as to the existence of proved reserves. The Company assesses all items classified as unevaluated
property on an annual basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a
group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors,
among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and
activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned.
During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such
property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject
to amortization. The inclusion of the Company’s unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be
completed within three years.
Other Property and Equipment
Other property and equipment is recorded at cost. The Company expenses maintenance and repairs in the period
incurred. Upon retirements or disposition of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from
the consolidated balance sheet with the resulting gains or losses, if any, reflected in operations. Depreciation of other
property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from
three to fifteen years. Depreciation expense was $191,829 and $606,553 for the six months ended June 30, 2012, and
2011, respectively.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Other long-lived assets, drilling rigs and related equipment used in operations are reviewed whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
F-34
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
recognized only if the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable from its estimated future undiscounted
cash flows. An impairment loss is the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. The Company
had no such impairment losses for the six months ended June 30, 2012 or 2011.
Capitalized Interest
The Company capitalizes interest on expenditures made in connection with exploration and development projects that
are not subject to current amortization. Interest is capitalized only for the period that activities are in progress to bring
these projects to their intended use. Capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense. During the six months
ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 the Company did not capitalize any interest expense.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and consist of the following:
Tubular goods and equipment
Crude oil
June 30,
2012
$5,695,162    
195,416    
 
   
    
$5,890,578
December 31,
2011
$ 5,630,208  
376,147  
 
   
 
$ 6,006,355
The Company’s tubular goods and equipment is primarily comprised of oil and gas drilling or repair items such as
tubing, casing and pumping units. The inventory is primarily acquired for use in future drilling or repair operations
and is carried at lower of cost or market. “Market”, in the context of inventory valuation, represents net realizable value,
which is the amount that the Company is allowed to bill to the joint accounts under joint operating agreements to
which the Company is a party. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company estimated that all of its tubular
goods and equipment will be utilized within one year. The total inventory includes tubular goods held by others of
$1,093,708 at both June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.
Debt issuance costs
The Company amortizes debt issuance costs related to its credit facility as interest expense over the scheduled
maturity period of the debt. Unamortized debt issuance costs were $1,017,315 and $1,167,621 as of June 30, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively. The Company includes the unamortized costs in other assets in its consolidated
balance sheets.
Revenue and Royalties Payable
For certain oil and natural gas properties, where the Company serves as operator, the Company receives production
proceeds from the purchaser and further distributes such amounts to other revenue and royalty owners. Production
proceeds applicable to other revenue and royalty owners are reflected as revenue and royalties payable in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company recognizes revenue for only its net revenue interest in oil
and natural gas properties.
Revenue Recognition
Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and
allowances, as applicable. The Company accounts for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
sales method, whereby a liability is recorded when the Company’s overtake volumes exceed its estimated remaining
recoverable reserves. No receivables are recorded for those wells where the Company has taken less than its ownership
share of production. The Company did not have any gas imbalances as of June 30, 2012 or December 31, 2011.
Revenues from oil and natural gas services are recognized as services are provided.
Investments
Equity investments in which the Company exercises significant influence but does not control are accounted for using
the equity method. Under the equity method, generally the Company’s share of investees’ earnings or loss is
recognized in the statement of operations. However, because substantially all of Bison’s earnings are generated by
performing services on properties owned and operated by the Company, the Company’s share of Bison’s earnings has
not been recognized but has been credited to oil and gas properties. The Company reviews its investments to
determine if a loss in value which is other than a temporary decline has occurred. If such loss has occurred, the
Company would recognize an impairment provision. There was no impairment for the Company’s equity investments
for the periods ended June 30, 2012 or December 31, 2011. For additional information on the Company’s investments,
see Note 5.
Accounting for Equity-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for equity-based compensation in accordance with the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718,
“Compensation—Stock Compensation” (“FASB ASC 718”). FASB ASC 718 requires equity-based payments to
employees to be recognized as expense over the applicable service period based on the fair value of the award on the
date of grant.
Concentrations
The Company is subject to risk resulting from the concentration of its crude oil and natural gas sales and receivables
with several significant purchasers. For the six months ended June 30, 2012 three purchasers accounted for more than
10% of our revenue: Plains Marketing, LP (63%); Andrews Oil Buyers, Inc. (13%); and Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc.
(12%). For the six months ended June 30, 2011 Windsor Midstream LLC, an entity controlled by Wexford, our equity
sponsor, accounted for 84% of our revenue. The Company does not require collateral and does not believe the loss of
any single purchaser would materially impact its operating results, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products
with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.
Commodity Risk Management
The Company has used energy derivatives for the purpose of mitigating the risk resulting from fluctuations in the
market price of crude oil. The Company recognizes all of its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair
value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument depends on whether
it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and further on the type of hedging relationship.
For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the Company designates the
hedging instrument, based on the exposure being hedged, as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. Changes
in the fair value of instruments designated as a fair value hedge offset changes in the fair value of the hedged item and
changes in the fair value of instruments designated as cash flow hedges are shown in accumulated other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. For derivative instruments not designated as
hedging instruments, the unrealized gain or loss on the change in fair

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change. None of the Company’s derivatives
were designated as hedging instruments.
Environmental Compliance and Remediation
Environmental compliance and remediation costs, including ongoing maintenance and monitoring, are expensed as
incurred. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and remediation are probable, and the costs can be
reasonably estimated.
Income Taxes
The operations of the Company, as limited liability companies, are not subject to federal income taxes. As appropriate,
the taxable income or loss applicable to those operations is included in the federal income tax returns of the respective
owners and no income tax effect is included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company is
subject to margin tax in the state of Texas. During the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, there was no margin
tax expense. The Company’s 2008, 2009 and 2010 federal income tax and state margin tax returns remain open to
examination by tax authorities. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 the Company had no unrecognized tax
benefits that would have a material impact on the effective rate. The Company is continuing its practice of recognizing
interest and penalties related to income tax matters as interest expense and general and administrative expenses,
respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, there was no interest or penalties associated with
uncertain tax positions recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Unaudited Pro Forma Income Taxes and Earnings Per Share
Prior to the completion of a proposed 2012 initial public offering of common stock (“IPO”) by Diamondback Energy,
Inc. (“Diamondback”), all the equity interests in Windsor will be contributed to Diamondback and Windsor will become
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diamondback (Proposed Contribution Transaction). Diamondback, a holding company
formed on December 30, 2011 which will not conduct any material business operations prior to the Proposed
Contribution Transaction, is a C-Corp under the Internal Revenue Code and is subject to income taxes. Accordingly, the
Company computed a pro forma income tax provision as if the Company were a C-Corp for all periods presented. The
pro forma tax provision has been calculated at a rate based upon a federal corporate level tax rate and a state tax rate,
net of federal benefit, incorporating permanent differences. However, on a pro forma basis, management has
determined that any net deferred income tax asset would not be realizable; therefore tax expense would be zero for all
periods. Additionally, upon Windsor becoming a subsidiary of Diamondback, the Company will establish a net deferred
tax liability for differences between the tax and book basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities, and record a
corresponding “first day” tax expense to net income from continuing operations. On a pro forma basis, at June 30,
2012 the amount of this charge would have been approximately $37.4 million.
Also, upon completion of the Proposed Contribution Transaction, the Company will present pro forma earnings per
share for the most recent period. Pro forma basic and diluted income per share will be computed by dividing net
income attributable to the Company by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as if the shares of
Diamondback Energy, Inc., issued in the Proposed Contribution Transaction, were issued and outstanding for the six
months ended June 30, 2012.

New Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted
In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-11, which increases disclosures about
offsetting assets and liabilities. New disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to understand
significant quantitative differences in balance sheets prepared under GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards related to the offsetting of financial instruments. The existing GAAP guidance allowing balance sheet
offsetting, including industry-specific guidance, remains unchanged. The guidance in ASU No. 2011-11 is effective for
annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The disclosures should be applied
retrospectively for all prior periods presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a
significant impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

The Company measures the future cost to retire its tangible long-lived assets and recognizes such cost as a liability in
accordance with ASC Topic 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (“ASC Topic 410”), which provides
accounting and reporting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset.
ASC Topic 410 requires companies to record a liability relating to the retirement and removal of assets used in their
businesses. For the Company, asset retirement obligations represent the future abandonment costs of tangible assets,
namely wells. ASC Topic 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement

obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that
the corresponding cost be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is
accreted to its then present value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related
asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded in oil and
natural gas properties.
A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligation for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 is as follows:

The Company held a wholly owned subsidiary, Bison Drilling and Field Services LLC (“Bison”), formerly known as
Windsor Drilling LLC, formed on November 15, 2010. In addition, the Company also held a wholly owned subsidiary,
West Texas Field Services LLC, formed on March 2, 2010 which, on January 1, 2011, contributed all of its assets and
liabilities to Bison and subsequently dissolved on June 12, 2012. Bison owns and operates drilling rigs and various oil
and gas well servicing equipment.
Beginning on March 31, 2011, various related party investors contributed capital to Bison diluting the Company’s
ownership interest. The Company assessed its ability to exercise financial control over Bison and based on the results
of its assessment, the Company concluded it maintained significant influence but it no longer had the ability to
exercise control over Bison. The Company deconsolidated Bison for financial reporting purposes as of March 31, 2011
and the previously consolidated amounts were removed from the consolidated balance sheet and reflected as an equity
method investment. Under the equity method, the Company eliminated intercompany profits or losses in relation to its
continuing involvement with Bison, proportionate to its equity interest.
An entity is required to deconsolidate a subsidiary when the entity ceases to have a controlling financial interest in the
subsidiary. Upon deconsolidation of a subsidiary, an entity recognizes a gain or loss on the transaction and measures
any retained investment in the subsidiary at fair value. The gain or loss includes any gain or loss associated with the
difference between the fair value of the retained investment in the subsidiary and its carrying amount at the date the
subsidiary is deconsolidated.
The Company internally reviewed the balance sheet of Bison to determine its fair value. At the time of the transaction
Bison was still a recently formed company and had not yet built value in its operations. Bison’s assets consisted
primarily of four recently purchased drilling rigs. Two of the drilling rigs were purchased at market price from a third
party in December 2010 and the second two were purchased from the same third party in April 2011. The Company also
reviewed pricing of similar rigs in the market through retail and auction transactions.

Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
Because the rigs had just recently been purchased and this purchase price was in line with other outside transactions
the Company determined that Bison’s book value equaled fair value. There was no gain or loss recorded and the
retained investment was recorded at fair value which equaled book value.
In September 2011, the Company completed the sale of 25% of its membership interest in Bison to a related party. The
Company internally reviewed the fair value of Bison and because the effective date of this transaction was May 1, 2011
and was within thirty days of the above valuation the Company concluded the value of Bison had not changed. The
Company determined that fair value equaled book value at the date of this transaction. There was no gain or loss
recorded and the retained investment was recorded at fair value which equaled book value.
As of June 15, 2012, the Company distributed its remaining interest in Bison to an entity which is controlled and
managed by Wexford. As the transaction was between entities under common management, the Company has
recognized the distribution of $6,437,000 as an equity transaction. Bison continues to be a related party with the
Company.
Muskie Holdings LLC
During 2011, the Company paid approximately $4,200,000 for land and various other capital items related to the land.
On October 7, 2011, the Company contributed these assets to a newly formed entity, Muskie Holdings LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company, for a 48.6% equity interest. Through additional contributions to Muskie from a related party
and various Wexford portfolio companies, the Company’s interest in Muskie decreased to 33% as of June 15, 2012.
Muskie generated a loss during the period from January 1, 2012 through June 15, 2012 and the Company has recorded
its share of this loss.
As of June 15, 2012, the Company distributed its remaining interest in Muskie to an entity which is controlled and
managed by Wexford. As the transaction was between entities under common management, the Company has
recognized the distribution of $4,067,020 as an equity transaction. Muskie continues to be a related party with the
Company.
6. Debt
Credit Facility-Wells Fargo Bank
On October 15, 2010, the Company executed a secured loan agreement with BNP Paribas (“BNP”) as the administrative
agent, sole book runner and lead arranger, as amended, providing for a revolving credit facility. On May 10, 2012, the
revolving credit agreement was further amended to provide for the resignation of BNP, and the appointment of Wells
Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent for the lenders. The amendment also permitted subordinated
debt in an initial principal amount not to exceed $30.0 million, including any such indebtedness evidenced by the
Company’s subordinated note with an affiliate of Wexford described in more detail under “-Subordinated Note” below.
The aggregate maximum credit amount under the revolving credit agreement is $250 million notwithstanding future
redeterminations of the borrowing base. The outstanding borrowings bear interest at a rate elected by the Company
that is based on the prime, LIBOR or federal funds rate plus margins ranging from 1.25% to 3.50% depending on the
base rate used and the amount of the loan outstanding in relation to the borrowing base.
Principal may be optionally repaid from time to time and is required to be paid (i) if the loan amount exceeds the
borrowing base; (ii) if the lender elects to require periodic payments as a part of a borrowing base re-determination;
and (iii) at the maturity date of October 15, 2014. The Company is obligated to pay, quarterly, a commitment fee equal to
0.5% per year of the unused portion of the borrowing base. The loan is secured by
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
F-40
Windsor Permian LLC and Subsidiaries
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
substantially all of the Company’s assets. The borrowing base is re-determined semi-annually with effective dates of
April 1st and October 1st (a “scheduled redetermination”). In addition, the Company may request an additional three
redeterminations of the borrowing base during any 12-month period. The borrowing base was $45 million at
December 31, 2010. The borrowing base increased throughout 2011 through various redeterminations and at
December 31, 2011 the borrowing base was $100 million. Under the terms of the revolving credit agreement as currently
in effect, the borrowing base will remain at $100 million through July 15, 2013 or the date of the closing of an initial
public offering, at which time the borrowing base will be reduced to $90 million, subject to the periodic and elective
borrowing base redeterminations described above. As of June 30, 2012, the Company has classified $10 million of the
outstanding borrowings under this credit facility as short term based on management’s expectation of the timing of
closing an initial public offering.
The current lenders and their percentage commitments in the reserve-based credit facility are Wells Fargo Bank, NA
(45%), Amegy Bank of Texas (25%), US Bancorp (25%) and West Texas National Bank (5%).
As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $100.0 million and $85.0
million, respectively. Outstanding borrowings under the credit facility bore a weighted average interest rate of 3.75%
and 3.30% as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.
The agreement contains various affirmative and restrictive covenants. These covenants, among other things, prohibit
additional indebtedness, sales of assets, mergers and consolidations, dividends and distributions, and changes in
management and require the maintenance of various financial ratios defined below.
Financial Covenant
Ratio of EBITDAX to interest expense, as defined in the credit agreement
Ratio of total debt to EBITDAX
Current ratio, as defined in the credit agreement
Required Ratio
Not less than 2.5 to 1.0
  
   Not greater than 3.5 to 1.0
Not less than 1.0 to 1.0
As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants under the
revolving bank credit facility. The lenders may accelerate all of the indebtedness under the revolving bank credit facility
upon the occurrence of any event of default unless the Company cures any such default within any applicable grace
period. For payments of principal and interest under the revolving bank credit facility, the Company generally has a
three business day grace period, and a 30-day cure period for most covenant defaults, but not for defaults of certain
specific covenants, including the financial covenants and negative covenants.
Subordinated Note
Effective May 14, 2012, the Company issued a subordinated note to an affiliate of Wexford pursuant to which the
Wexford affiliate may, from time to time, advance up to an aggregate of $25.0 million. These advances are solely at the
lender’s discretion and neither Wexford nor any of its affiliates has any commitment or obligation to provide further
capital support to the Company. The note bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 0.28% or 8% per annum,
whichever is lower. Interest is due quarterly in arrears beginning on July 1, 2012. Interest payments are payable in kind
by adding such amounts to the principal balance of the note. The unpaid principal balance and all accrued interest on
the note are due and payable in full on January 31, 2015 or the earlier completion of an initial public offering. Any
indebtedness evidenced by this note is subordinate in the right of payment to any indebtedness outstanding under the
Company’s revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2012, there was $14.1 million in aggregate principal amount
outstanding under this note.

Note Payable
The Company entered into an installment payment contract with EMC Corporation for the purchase of computer
equipment. The contract is payable in equal installments over a period of 36 months. As of June 30, 2012 there was
$411,106 outstanding under this note.
7. Derivatives
The Company has used price swap derivatives to reduce price volatility associated with certain of its oil sales. In these
swaps, the Company receives the fixed price per the contract and pays a floating market price to the counterparty based
on New York Mercantile Exchange Light Sweet Crude Oil pricing. The fixed-price payment and the floating-price
payment are offset, resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty. The counterparties to the Company’s
derivative contracts are BNP Paribas (“BNP”) and Hess Corporation (“Hess”), who the Company believes are acceptable
credit risks.
All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The fair value of
swaps is generally determined using established index prices and other sources which are based upon, among other
things, futures prices and time to maturity.
On October 4, 2011, in order to lock-in prices on the anticipated base level of production, while at the same time
providing downside protection for the Borrowing Base, the Company executed with BNP, West Texas Intermediate light
sweet crude oil swaps on the NYMEX for calendar year 2012 and 2013 of one thousand barrels per day priced at $78.50
and $80.55, respectively.
Set forth below are the summarized amounts, terms and fair values of outstanding instruments held as of June 30, 2012
and December 31, 2011.

The Company enters into counter-swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking-in the value of a swap. Under the
counter-swap, the Company receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the
counterparty. The counter-swap is effective in locking-in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market
value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter-swap.
In December 2007, the Company placed a swap contract with Hess covering 1,680,000 Bbls of crude oil for the period
from January 2008 to December 2012 at various fixed prices. In April 2008, the Company entered into a series of
counter-swaps to lock-in the value of certain of these swaps settling 1,188,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps. In June 2009,
the Company entered into an additional series of counter-swaps to lock-in the value of the remaining swaps settling
324,000 Bbls of crude oil swaps.

The Company is required to provide margin deposits to Hess whenever its unrealized losses exceed predetermined
credit limits. The Company had a margin deposit held by Hess of $846,588 and $2,325,643 as of June 30, 2012 and
December 31, 2011, respectively, which earns interest that is remitted to the Company. As the Company has a master
netting agreement with Hess, the Company has offset this margin deposit against its derivative positions.
8. Equity-Based Compensation
During the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company granted to its executive officers options to acquire
membership interests in the Company. Such options vest in four equal annual installments commencing on the first
anniversary of the date of grant and are exercisable for five years from the date of grant. Generally, in the event more
than 50% of the combined voting interests of the Company is not owned by Wexford or its affiliates and there is a
material change in the terms of the option holder’s employment, the options will vest immediately. Under one
agreement, however, the options will vest solely in the event that more than 50% of the voting interests of the Company
is not owned by Wexford or its affiliates.

At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, for outstanding options, the intrinsic value was $112,500 and $112,500,
respectively, and the weighted-average remaining contractual terms were 4.1 and 4.6 years, respectively. Also, at
June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, no options were exercisable.
The Company accounts for such options issued using a fair-value-based method calculated on the grant-date of the
award. The resulting cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the entire option.
The fair value of the options issued was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. One of the inputs to
this model is the estimate of the fair value of the underlying membership interest on the date of grant. The other inputs
include an estimate of the expected volatility of the membership interest, an option’s expected term, the risk-free
interest rate over the option’s expected term, the option’s exercise price, and the Company’s expectations regarding
dividends.
The Company does not have a history of market prices for its membership interests because such interests are not
publicly traded. The expected volatility was determined using the historical volatility for a peer group of companies.
The expected term for options issued was determined based on the contractual term of the awards. The weighted-
average risk-free interest rate was based on the daily U.S. treasury yield curve rate whose term was consistent with the
expected life of the options. The Company does not anticipate paying cash dividends; therefore, the expected dividend
yield was assumed to be zero.
A summary of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the options to acquire membership
interests during the year ended December 31, 2011 was as follows:
Expected term
Risk-free interest rate
Expected volatility
Expected dividend yield
5 years  
 
0.96% 
  45.50% 
 
0.00%
The Company assumed no annual forfeiture rate because of its lack of turnover and lack of history for this type of
award. The Company will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture
experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior, and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can
have a significant effect on reported equity-based compensation expense, because the cumulative effect of adjusting
the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed.

Equity-based compensation expense recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $582,221. The unrecognized
equity-based compensation expense as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011 was $3,531,255 and $4,113,477,
respectively, related to these awards which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 and 3.6
years, respectively. Equity-based compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2011 was not material.
9. Fair Value Measurements
The Company measures and discloses fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and
Disclosures (“ASC Topic 820”). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques
used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.
ASC Topic 820 describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value. The Company’s assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the valuation of the
assets and liabilities being measured and their placement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company uses
appropriate valuation techniques based on available inputs to measure the fair values of its assets and liabilities.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC Topic 820 are as follows:
Level 1—Pricing inputs include quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the
reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and
volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Level 1 primarily consists of financial instruments such as
exchange-traded derivatives, marketable securities and listed equities.
Level 2—Pricing inputs include quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either
directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. This category includes those derivative
instruments that the Company values using observable market data. Substantially all of these inputs are observable in
the marketplace throughout the full term of the derivative instrument, can be derived from observable data, or
supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Level 2 instruments primarily
include non-exchange traded derivatives such as over-the-counter commodity price swaps, basis swaps, investments
and interest rate swaps. The Company’s valuation models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various
inputs including: (i) quoted forward prices for commodities, (ii) time value and (iii) current market and contractual
prices for the underlying instruments, as well as other relevant economic measures. The Company utilizes its
counterparties’ valuations to assess the reasonableness of its prices and valuation techniques.
Level 3—Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These
inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.

Level 2 Fair Value Measurements
Derivative contracts-The fair values of the Company’s crude oil swaps are measured internally using established index
prices and other sources. These are based upon, among other things, futures prices and time to maturity.
Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations
The Company estimates asset retirement obligations pursuant to the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 410, “Asset
Retirement and Environmental Obligations” (“FASB ASC 410”). The initial measurement of asset retirement obligations
at fair value is calculated using discounted cash flow techniques and based on internal estimates of future retirement
costs associated with oil and gas properties. Given the unobservable nature of the inputs, including plugging costs
and reserve lives, the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation liability is deemed to use Level 3 inputs.
See Note 4 for further discussion of the Company’s asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement obligations incurred
were $95,077 and $136,909 during the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
10. Related Party Transactions
Administrative Services
An entity under common management provided technical, administrative and payroll services to the Company under a
shared services agreement which began January 1, 2008. Through December 31, 2011, amounts charged to the
Company included those costs directly attributable to the Company as well as indirect costs allocated to the Company.
The reimbursement amount for indirect costs is determined by the affiliate’s management based on estimates of time
devoted to the Company. During the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company incurred total costs of
$4,122,515 and $4,504,043 respectively. Costs incurred unrelated to drilling activities are expensed and costs incurred
in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved oil and natural gas properties have been capitalized. The
expensed costs were partially offset in general and administrative expenses by overhead reimbursements of $1,151,985
and $908,807 for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the Company had no
outstanding balance and as of December 31, 2011, the Company owed the administrative services affiliate $769,278.
This amount is included in accounts payable-related party in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

administrative services. The initial term of the additional shared services agreement is two years. Upon expiration of
the initial term the agreement will continue on a month-to-month basis until cancelled by either party upon thirty days
prior written notice. Costs that are attributable to and billed to other affiliates are reported as other income-related
party. For the six months ended June 30, 2012, the affiliate reimbursed the Company $1,058,043 for services under the
shared services agreement and at June 30, 2012, the affiliate owed the Company $135,811 and this amount is included
in accounts receivable-related party in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

services to the Company using two of its rigs. This master drilling agreement is terminable by either party on 30 days’
prior written notice, although neither party will be relieved of its respective obligations arising from a drilling contract
being performed prior to the termination of the master drilling agreement. For the three months ended March 31, 2011,
Bison was a wholly-owned subsidiary thus intercompany amounts were eliminated in consolidation. The Company
owed Bison $1,101,754 as of June 30, 2012 and $153,826 as of December 31, 2011.
Completion and Well Servicing Services
The Company contracted with an affiliate for certain of its well completion services. Effective August 24, 2011, the
affiliate was sold to a non-related third party. While still an affiliate of the Company, the Company was billed
$10,006,747 during the six months ended June 30, 2011. Such amounts are capitalized in oil and natural gas properties
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the entity was no longer a
related party.

agreement with the affiliate was cancelled. The Company’s revenues from the affiliate were $18,418,388 during the six
months ended June 30, 2011, respectively, and such amounts are included in oil sales in the accompanying
consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had an accounts receivable-related party
balance with the affiliate of $4,132,316 and such amount is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
MidMar
The Company is party to a gas purchase agreement, dated May 1, 2009, as amended, with MidMar Gas LLC, or MidMar,
an entity affiliated with Wexford that owns a gas gathering system and processing plant in the Permian Basin. Under
this agreement, MidMar is obligated to purchase from the Company, and the Company is obligated to sell to MidMar,
all of the gas conforming to certain quality specifications produced from certain of the Company’s Permian Basin
acreage. Following the expiration of the initial ten-year term, the agreement will continue on a year-to-year basis until
terminated by either party on 30 days written notice. Under the gas purchase agreement, MidMar is obligated to pay the
Company 87% of the net revenue received by MidMar for all components of the Company’s dedicated gas, including
the liquid hydrocarbons, and the sale of residue gas, in each case extracted, recovered or otherwise processed at
MidMar’s gas processing plant, and 94.56% of the net revenue received by MidMar from the sale of such gas
components and residue gas, extracted, recovered or otherwise processed at Chevron’s Headlee plant. For the six
months ended June 30, 2012, MidMar paid the Company $1,202,946. For the six months ended June 30, 2011, MidMar
through its affiliate, paid the Company $759,201. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, MidMar owed the
Company $269,880 and $461,956, respectively, for the Company’s portion of the net proceeds from the sale of gas, gas
products and residue gas.
Midland Lease
Effective May 15, 2011, the Company occupied corporate office space in Midland, Texas under a lease with a five-year
term. The office space is owned by an entity controlled by an affiliate of Wexford. For the six months ended June 30,
2012 and 2011, the Company paid $71,525 and $8,067, respectively. The current monthly rent under the lease will
increase approximately 4% annually on June 1 of each year during the lease term.
Oklahoma City Lease
Effective January 1, 2012, the Company occupied corporate office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma under a lease
with a 67 month term. The office space is owned by an entity controlled by an affiliate of Wexford. For the six months
ended June 30, 2012, the Company paid $206,429 under this lease. The current monthly rent under the lease will
increase $2.00 per square foot on August 1, 2012 with no further escalations for the remaining term of the lease.
Reliance on Wexford
As discussed in Note 1, the Company is controlled by Wexford. Management believes the credit facility combined with
the cash flow generated from operations will be sufficient to sustain the Company’s operations; however, if additional
financing is required management will seek additional sources which could include Wexford. During the six months
ended June 30, 2012, Wexford provided certain professional services to the Company, for which the Company was
billed $94,239. As of June 30, 2012, the Company owed Wexford $46,790, and this amount is included in accounts
payable-related party in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not incur any costs for
technical services from Wexford during the six months ended June 30, 2011.

11. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company could be subject to various possible loss contingencies which arise primarily from interpretation of
federal and state laws and regulations affecting the natural gas and crude oil industry. Such contingencies include
differing interpretations as to the prices at which natural gas and crude oil sales may be made, the prices at which
royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases, environmental issues and other matters. Management
believes it has complied with the various laws and regulations, administrative rulings and interpretations.
In March 2011, the Company began leasing field office space in Midland, Texas from an unrelated party. The lease term
is 84 months with equal monthly installments that escalate 3% annually on March 1st of each year. In May 2011, the
Company began leasing corporate office space in Midland, Texas from an entity controlled by an affiliate of Wexford
with a lease term of five years. In January 2012, the Company began leasing corporate office space in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma from an entity controlled by an affiliate of Wexford with a lease term of 67 months. (See Note 10)
Future minimum lease payments for these leases are as follows as of June 30, 2012:

As of July 24, 2012, the Company’s revolving credit agreement was amended and restated to include Diamondback
Energy LLC and its subsidiaries as additional guarantors to the facility. The covenant prohibiting additional
indebtedness was also amended to allow the issuance of unsecured debt of up to $250.0 million and, in connection
with any such issuance, the reduction of the borrowing base by 25% of the principal amount of such issuance. A
borrowing base reduction in connection with such issuance may require a portion of the outstanding principal of the
loan to be repaid. The amendment also provided that redemptions of any unsecured debt will be restricted unless
certain liquidity requirements are met. Further, the amendment modified certain financial ratios, the current
requirements of which are described below.

Members
Windsor UT LLC
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Windsor UT LLC (a Delaware limited liability company) as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related statements of operations, changes in members’ equity and cash flows for
the year ended December 31, 2011 and the period from inception (April 28, 2010) to December 31, 2010. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An
audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Windsor UT LLC as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year
ended December 31, 2011 and the period from inception (April 28, 2010) to December 31, 2010 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

1. Organization
See accompanying notes to financial statements.
F-55
Windsor UT LLC
Notes to Financial Statements
Windsor UT LLC (“the Company”) is a limited liability company formed on April 28, 2010 to acquire, produce, develop
and exploit oil and natural gas properties. As a limited liability company, the members of the Company are not liable
for the liabilities or other obligations of the Company. The Company is wholly owned by investment funds which are
controlled and managed by Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford”).
The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development and production of oil and natural gas properties
and related sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Company’s reserves are located in the Southern region
of the United States. The Company’s results of operations are largely dependent on the difference between the prices
received for its oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the cost to find, develop, produce and market such
resources. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty
and a variety of other factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include worldwide political instability,
quantity of natural gas in storage, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of
consumer demand and the price of available alternative fuels, among others. The Company was a development stage
enterprise at December 31, 2010.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.
Use of estimates
Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated
by management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known
with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts
the Company reports for assets and liabilities and the Company’s disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts
and other methods the Company considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results
may differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Any effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give
rise to the revision become known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimates of
proved reserve quantities and related estimates of the present value of future net revenues, the carrying value of oil and
gas properties and asset retirement obligations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and
money market funds to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables for oil and natural gas production delivered to purchasers. Those
purchasers remit payment for production to the operator of the respective producing properties and the operator, in
turn, remits payment to the Company. As discussed in Note 5, the Company’s oil and natural gas properties are
contractually operated by an affiliate. Most payments are received within three months after the production date.
Table of Contents
Index to Financial Statements
F-56
Windsor UT LLC
Notes to Financial Statements-(Continued)
Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from purchasers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts when the
Company believes collection is doubtful. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms
are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the
length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the debtor’s current ability to
pay its obligation to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company
writes off specific accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such
receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. No allowance was deemed necessary at December 31,
2011 or 2010.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables. The carrying
amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates fair value because of the short-term
nature of the instruments.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
The Company accounts for its oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting.
Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved oil and natural gas
properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, and annual lease rentals are
capitalized. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change.
Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved
reserves. The average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was $26.11 for the year ended
December 31, 2011 and because the Company did not have any production in 2010 there was no depletion for the
period ended December 31, 2010. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas properties
was $198,712 for the year ended December 31, 2011, and there was no expense for the period ended December 31, 2010.
The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which
the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent
capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion, amortization
and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the excess
capitalized costs are charged to expense. No impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded for the
periods ended December 31, 2011 or 2010.
Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until the Company has made a
determination as to the existence of proved reserves. The Company assesses all items classified as unevaluated
property on an annual basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a
group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors,
among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and
activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned.
During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such
property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject
to amortization. The inclusion of the Company’s unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be
completed within three years.

Revenue Recognition
F-57
Windsor UT LLC
Notes to Financial Statements-(Continued)
Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and
allowances, as applicable. The Company accounts for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales
method, whereby a liability is recorded when the Company’s overtake volumes exceed its estimated remaining
recoverable reserves. No receivables are recorded for those wells where the Company has taken less than its ownership
share of production. The Company did not have any gas imbalances as of December 31, 2011 and 2010.
Concentrations
During the year period ended December 31, 2011, the Company sold its production to one purchaser. Windsor
Midstream LLC, an entity controlled by Wexford, accounted for 100% of the oil revenue. The Company believes there
are other crude oil purchasers to whom it would be able to sell its oil if the current purchaser discontinued purchasing
from the Company.
Environmental Compliance and Remediation
Environmental compliance and remediation costs, including ongoing maintenance and monitoring, are expensed as
incurred. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and remediation are probable, and the costs can be
reasonably estimated.
Income Taxes
The operations of the Company, as a limited liability company, is not subject to federal income taxes. As appropriate,
the taxable income or loss applicable to operations is included in the federal income tax returns of the respective
owners and no income tax effect is included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company is subject to
margin tax in the state of Texas. During the periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, there was no margin tax
expense. The Company’s 2010 federal income tax and state margin tax returns remain open to examination by tax
authorities. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company has no unrecognized tax benefits that would have a
material impact on the effective rate. The Company is continuing its practice of recognizing interest and penalties
related to income tax matters as interest expense and general and administrative expenses, respectively. During the
periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 there was no interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions in
the Company’s financial statements.
Recently issued accounting standards
In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2011-
04, “Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRS,”
which provides a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for measurement of and disclosure
about fair value between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. This new guidance changes
some fair value measurement principles and disclosure requirements, but does not require additional fair value
measurements and is not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial
reporting. The update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The adoption of this guidance
will not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

220”). The purpose of the amendments in this update is to provide a more consistent method of presenting non-owner
transactions that affect an entity’s equity. The amendments eliminate the option to report other comprehensive income
and its components in the statement of changes in equity and require an entity to present the total of comprehensive
income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single
continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update 2011-12 which defers the requirement in Accounting Standards Update 2011-05 that companies
present reclassification adjustments for each component of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net
income and other comprehensive income on the face of the financial statements. Both amendments are effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and should be applied retrospectively. The adoption of
this guidance will not have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

The Company measures the future cost to retire its tangible long-lived assets and recognizes such cost as a liability in
accordance with ASC Topic 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (“ASC Topic 410”), which provides
accounting and reporting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset.
ASC Topic 410 requires companies to record a liability relating to the retirement and removal of assets used in their
businesses. For the Company, asset retirement obligations represent the future abandonment costs of tangible assets,
namely wells. ASC Topic 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation be recorded in
the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the corresponding cost be
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present
value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. If the liability is
settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is recorded in oil and natural gas properties.

An entity under common management provided technical, administrative and payroll services to the Company under a
shared services agreement which began April 28, 2010. The reimbursement amount for indirect expenses is determined
by the affiliate’s management based on estimates of office space provided and time devoted to the Company. During
the periods ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, the Company incurred total costs of $90,127 and $12,879, respectively.
Costs incurred unrelated to drilling activities are expensed and costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and
development of oil and natural gas properties have been capitalized. The expensed costs were partially offset in
general and administrative expenses by overhead reimbursements of $57,250 and $14,437 for the periods ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively which were received through the related party operator discussed below. As
of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the Company owed the administrative services affiliate $3,864 and $709,
respectively and such amounts are included in accounts payable-related party in the accompanying balance sheets.
Operating Services
An entity under common management operates the oil and natural gas properties in which the Company has working
and revenue interests. As operator of these properties, this entity is responsible for the daily operations, monthly
operation billings and monthly revenue disbursements for the properties. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the
Company has an accounts payable balance to this entity of $276,124 and $15,140, respectively.
As of December 31, 2010, $251,715 was prepaid to the operator for prepaid drilling costs and as of December 31, 2011
there were no amounts prepaid for drilling costs to the operator. This amount is included in prepaid drilling costs-
related party in the accompanying balance sheets.
Marketing Services
An entity under common management purchases and receives all of the Company’s oil volumes. The Company’s
revenues from the affiliate during year ended December 31, 2011 were $694,666. As of December 31, 2011 the Company
had an accounts receivable balance with the affiliate of $214,633.
Reliance on Wexford
As discussed in Note 1, the Company is wholly owned by investment funds which are controlled and managed by
Wexford. Management believes cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to sustain the Company’s

operations through the end of 2012; however, if additional financing is required to continue to develop our properties
management will seek additional sources which could include Wexford.
6. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company could be subject to various possible loss contingencies which arise primarily from interpretation of
federal and state laws and regulations affecting the natural gas and crude oil industry. Such contingencies include
differing interpretations as to the prices at which natural gas and crude oil sales may be made, the prices at which
royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases, environmental issues and other matters. Management
believes it has complied with the various laws and regulations, administrative rulings and interpretations.
7. Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated the period after December 31, 2011 through May 1, 2012 the date the financial statements
were available to be issued, noting no subsequent events or transactions that required recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements, other than noted below.
Wexford has agreed in principle to cause all the outstanding equity interests in the Company to be contributed to
Windsor Permian LLC, an entity under common control. This contribution will close prior to the initial public offering
of Diamondback Energy Inc. which will be the parent of Windsor Permian LLC.
8. Supplemental Information on Oil and Natural Gas Operations (Unaudited)
The following supplemental unaudited information regarding the oil and natural gas activities of the Company is
presented pursuant to the disclosure requirements promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”) and the FASB ASU 2010-03, “Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas (Topic 932)”. The reserve
reports were prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the SEC and, accordingly, were based on existing
economic and operating conditions.
Proved oil and natural gas reserve estimates as of December 31, 2010 were prepared by Pinnacle Energy Services, LLC
and as of December 31, 2011 were prepared by Ryder Scott Company L.P., both independent petroleum engineers.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves. Oil and
natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural
gas that cannot be precisely measured and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available
data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Results of drilling, testing and production
subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimate. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often
different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered.
The Company’s oil and natural gas reserves are attributable solely to properties within the United States.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 reserves were computed using the trailing 12-month unweighted average of the first-
day-of-the-month prices, in accordance with the SEC guidelines applicable to reserves estimates.
Revisions represent changes in previous reserves estimates, either upward or downward, resulting from new
information normally obtained from development drilling and production history or resulting from a change in
economic factors, such as commodity prices, operating costs or development costs.
Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows
The following information has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the FASB ASU 2010-03, “Extractive
Activities—Oil and Gas (Topic 932).” As of December 31, 2011 and 2010 the standardized measure of discounted future
net cash flows are based on the trailing 12-month unweighted average, first-day-of-the-month prices.
The projections should not be viewed as realistic estimates of future cash flows, nor should the “standardized
measure” be interpreted as representing current value to the Company. Material revisions to estimates of proved
reserves may occur in the future; development and production of the reserves may not occur in the periods assumed;
actual prices realized are expected to vary significantly from those used; and actual costs may vary.

1. Organization
Windsor UT LLC (“the Company”) is a limited liability company formed on April 28, 2010 to acquire, produce, develop
and exploit oil and natural gas properties. As a limited liability company, the members of the Company are not liable
for the liabilities or other obligations of the Company. The Company is controlled by Wexford Capital LP (“Wexford”).
The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploitation, development and production of oil and natural gas properties
and related sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. The Company’s reserves are located in the Southern region
of the United States. The Company’s results of operations are largely dependent on the difference between the prices
received for its oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and the cost to find, develop, produce and market such
resources. Oil and natural gas prices are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply, market uncertainty
and a variety of other factors beyond the Company’s control. These factors include worldwide political instability,
quantity of natural gas in storage, foreign supply of oil and natural gas, the price of foreign imports, the level of
consumer demand and the price of available alternative fuels, among others.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.
The accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for interim financial information. Pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
unaudited financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring accruals) considered
necessary to present fairly our financial position as of June 30, 2012, and our results of operations, changes in
members’ equity and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. Operating results for the six months
ended June 30, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year because of the
impact of fluctuations in prices received for natural gas and oil, natural production declines, timing of development
and exploration activities, the uncertainty of exploration and development drilling results and other factors. For a more
complete understanding of our operations, financial position and accounting policies, these financial statements
should be read in conjunction with our annual financial statements.
Use of estimates
Certain amounts included in or affecting the Company’s financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated
by management, requiring certain assumptions to be made with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known
with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts
the Company reports for assets and liabilities and the Company’s disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis, using historical experience, consultation with experts
and other methods the Company considers reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results
may differ significantly from the Company’s estimates. Any effects on the Company’s business, financial position or
results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give
rise to the revision become known. Significant items subject to such estimates and

Windsor UT LLC
Notes to Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
assumptions include estimates of proved reserve quantities and related estimates of the present value of future net
revenues, the carrying value of oil and gas properties and asset retirement obligations.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and
money market funds to be cash equivalents.
Accounts Receivable
Accounts receivable consist primarily of receivables for oil and natural gas production delivered to purchasers. Those
purchasers remit payment for production to the operator of the respective producing properties and the operator, in
turn, remits payment to the Company. As discussed in Note 5, the Company’s oil and natural gas properties are
contractually operated by an affiliate. Most payments are received within three months after the production date.
Accounts receivable are stated at amounts due from purchasers, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts when the
Company believes collection is doubtful. Accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms
are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the
length of time accounts receivable are past due, the Company’s previous loss history, the debtor’s current ability to
pay its obligation to the Company, the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company
writes off specific accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such
receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts. No allowance was deemed necessary at June 30, 2012
or December 31, 2011.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The Company’s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables. The carrying
amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables approximates fair value because of the short-term
nature of the instruments.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
The Company accounts for its oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting.
Accordingly, all costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and development of proved oil and natural gas
properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs, and annual lease rentals are
capitalized. Sales or other dispositions of oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recorded unless the ratio of cost to proved reserves would significantly change.
Depletion of evaluated oil and natural gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on proved
reserves. The average depletion rate per barrel equivalent unit of production was $27.42 and $21.33 for the six months
ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for oil and natural gas
properties was $179,956 and $27,724 for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
The net capitalized costs of proved oil and natural gas properties are subject to a full cost ceiling limitation in which
the costs are not allowed to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at 10%. To the extent
capitalized costs of evaluated oil and natural gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion,
Table of Contents

Notes to Financial Statements-(Continued)
(Unaudited)
amortization and impairment exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the
excess capitalized costs are charged to expense. No impairment on proved oil and natural gas properties was recorded
for the six months ended June 30, 2012 or 2011.
Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from the full cost pool until the Company has made a
determination as to the existence of proved reserves. The Company assesses all items classified as unevaluated
property on an annual basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses properties on an individual basis or as a
group if properties are individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration of the following factors,
among others: intent to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical evaluations; drilling results and
activity; the assignment of proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned.
During any period in which these factors indicate an impairment, the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such
property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject
to amortization. The inclusion of the Company’s unevaluated costs into the amortization base is expected to be
completed within three years.
Revenue Recognition
Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and
allowances, as applicable. The Company accounts for oil and natural gas production imbalances using the sales
method, whereby a liability is recorded when the Company’s overtake volumes exceed its estimated remaining
recoverable reserves. No receivables are recorded for those wells where the Company has taken less than its ownership
share of production. The Company did not have any gas imbalances as of June 30, 2012 or December 31, 2011.
Concentrations
During the six months ended June 30, 2012, the Company sold all of its production to one unaffiliated purchaser.
During the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Company sold all of its production to one affiliated purchaser, Windsor
Midstream LLC, an entity controlled by Wexford. The Company believes there are other crude oil purchasers to whom it
would be able to sell its oil if the current purchaser discontinued purchasing from the Company.
Environmental Compliance and Remediation
Environmental compliance and remediation costs, including ongoing maintenance and monitoring, are expensed as
incurred. Liabilities are accrued when environmental assessments and remediation are probable, and the costs can be
reasonably estimated.
Income Taxes
The operations of the Company, as a limited liability company, is not subject to federal income taxes. As appropriate,
the taxable income or loss applicable to operations is included in the federal income tax returns of the respective
owners and no income tax effect is included in the accompanying financial statements. The Company is subject to
margin tax in the state of Texas. During the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, there was no margin tax
expense. The Company’s 2011 and 2010 federal income tax and state margin tax returns remain open to examination by
tax authorities. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company has no unrecognized tax benefits that would
have a material impact on the effective rate. The Company is continuing its practice of recognizing interest and
penalties related to income tax matters as interest expense and general and

administrative expenses, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 no interest or penalties
associated with uncertain tax positions was recognized in the Company’s financial statements.
New Pronouncements Issued but Not Yet Adopted
In December 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-11, which increases disclosures about
offsetting assets and liabilities. New disclosures are required to enable users of financial statements to understand
significant quantitative differences in balance sheets prepared under GAAP and International Financial Reporting
Standards related to the offsetting of financial instruments. The existing GAAP guidance allowing balance sheet
offsetting, including industry-specific guidance, remains unchanged. The guidance in ASU No. 2011-11 is effective for
annual and interim reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013. The disclosures should be applied
retrospectively for all prior periods presented. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a
significant impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

4. Asset Retirement Obligations
The Company measures the future cost to retire its tangible long-lived assets and recognizes such cost as a liability in
accordance with ASC Topic 410, Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (“ASC Topic 410”), which provides
accounting and reporting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result
from the acquisition, construction or normal operation of a long-lived asset.
ASC Topic 410 requires companies to record a liability relating to the retirement and removal of assets used in their
businesses. For the Company, asset retirement obligations represent the future abandonment costs of tangible assets,
namely wells. ASC Topic 410 requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset’s retirement obligation be recorded in
the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made and that the corresponding cost be
capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then present
value each period, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful

life of the related asset. If the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded amount, the difference is
recorded in oil and natural gas properties.
A reconciliation of the asset retirement obligation is as follows:
Asset retirement obligation, beginning of period
Additional liability incurred
Accretion expense
Asset retirement obligation, end of period
Less current portion
Asset retirement obligation, long-term

An entity under common management provided technical, administrative and payroll services to the Company under a
shared services agreement which began April 28, 2010. The reimbursement amount for indirect expenses is determined
by the affiliate’s management based on estimates of office space provided and time devoted to the Company. During
the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, the Company incurred total costs of $59,594 and $14,887, respectively.
Costs incurred unrelated to drilling activities are expensed and costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration, and
development of oil and natural gas properties have been capitalized. The expensed costs were partially offset in
general and administrative expenses by overhead reimbursements of $25,191 and $17,111 for the six months ended
June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively which were received through the related party operator discussed below. As of
June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Company owed the administrative services affiliate $76 and $3,864,
respectively and such amounts are included in accounts payable-related party in the accompanying balance sheets.
Operating Services
An entity under common management operates the oil and natural gas properties in which the Company has working
and revenue interests. As operator of these properties, this entity is responsible for the daily operations, monthly
operation billings and monthly revenue disbursements for the properties. As of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011
the Company has an accounts payable balance to this entity of $132,787 and $276,124, respectively.
Marketing Services
Through December 31, 2011 an entity under common management purchased and received all of the Company’s oil
volumes. The Company’s revenues from the affiliate during six months ended June 30, 2011 were $129,449. As of
December 31, 2011 the Company had an accounts receivable balance with the affiliate of $214,633. Effective January 1,
2012 the agreement with the affiliate was terminated and none of the Company’s oil volumes are sold to the affiliate.

Reliance on Wexford
(Unaudited)
As discussed in Note 1, the Company is controlled by Wexford. Management believes cash flows generated from
operations will be sufficient to sustain the Company’s operations through the end of 2012; however, if additional
financing is required to continue to develop our properties, management will seek additional sources which could
include Wexford.
6. Commitments and Contingencies
The Company could be subject to various possible loss contingencies which arise primarily from interpretation of
federal and state laws and regulations affecting the natural gas and crude oil industry. Such contingencies include
differing interpretations as to the prices at which natural gas and crude oil sales may be made, the prices at which
royalty owners may be paid for production from their leases, environmental issues and other matters. Management
believes it has complied with the various laws and regulations, administrative rulings and interpretations.
7. Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated the period after June 30, 2012 through August 17, 2012, the date the financial statements
were available to be issued, noting no subsequent events or transactions that required recognition or disclosure in the
financial statements, other than noted below.
Wexford has agreed in principle to cause all the outstanding equity interests in the Company to be contributed to
Windsor Permian LLC, an entity under common control. This contribution will close prior to the initial public offering
of Diamondback Energy, Inc. which will be the parent of Windsor Permian LLC.

Report of Independent Certified Public Accountants
Board of Directors
Gulfport Energy Corporation
We have audited the accompanying statements of revenues and direct operating expenses of working and revenue
interests of certain oil and gas properties (the “Properties”) owned by Gulfport Energy Corporation (“Gulfport”) for the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. These statements are the responsibility of Gulfport’s management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Properties’ internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As described in Note A, the accompanying statements are prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended to be a complete financial presentation.
In our opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and direct
operating expenses as described in Note A for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2011 AND 2010
NOTE A—BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying statements present the revenues and direct operating expenses of working and revenue interests of
certain oil and natural gas properties located in the Permian Basin of West Texas (the “Properties”) owned by Gulfport
Energy Corporation (“Gulfport”) for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.
The accompanying statements of revenues and direct operating expenses are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting and were derived from the historical accounting records of Gulfport. Such amounts may not be
representative of future operations. The statements do not include depreciation, depletion and amortization, general
and administrative expenses, income taxes or interest expense.
Historical financial statements reflecting financial position, results of operations and cash flows required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America are not presented as such information is not readily
available on an individual property basis. Accordingly, the historical statements of revenues and direct operating
expenses of the Properties are presented in lieu of the financial statements required under Rule 3-05 of the Securities
and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X.
NOTE B—SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of estimates
The preparation of the accompanying statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and direct operating expenses during
the reporting period. The estimates include oil and gas revenue accruals and reserve quantities. It is emphasized that
reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of
producing oil and gas properties. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
Revenue recognition
Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and
allowances, as applicable.
NOTE C—SUPPLEMENTAL OIL AND GAS RESERVE INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
The proved oil and gas reserves attributable to the Properties consist of the estimated quantities of crude oil and
natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future
years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The weighted average prices used for
reserve report purposes are $96.19 and $4.12 for December 31, 2011 and $79.43 and $4.38 at December 31, 2010,
adjusted for transportation fees and regional price differentials, for oil and natural gas reserves, respectively. The
following estimates of proved reserves have been made by the independent engineering firms of Ryder Scott Company
L.P. and Pinnacle Energy Services, LLC based on the Gulfport’s net revenue interest for 2011 and 2010, respectively.
Oil and gas reserve quantity estimates are subject to numerous uncertainties inherent in the estimation quantities of
proved reserves and in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures. The
accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment. Results of subsequent drilling, testing and production may cause either

upward or downward revision of previous estimates. Further, the volumes considered to be commercially recoverable
fluctuate with changes in prices and operating costs. Reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of
new discoveries are more imprecise than those of currently producing oil and gas properties. Accordingly, these
estimates are expected to change as additional information becomes available in the future.

Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows
The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is computed by applying unweighted average first-of-
the-month prices of oil and natural gas, adjusted for transportation fees and regional price differentials, to the
estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves less estimated future expenditures (based on certain
prevailing economic conditions) to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, discounted using a
rate of 10 percent per year to reflect the estimated timing of the future cash flows. Income taxes are excluded because
the property interests included represent only a portion of a business for which income taxes are not estimable.
Discounted future cash flow estimates like those shown below are not intended to represent estimates of the fair value
of oil and gas properties. Estimates of fair value would also take into account, among other things, probable and
possible reserves, anticipated future oil and natural gas prices, changes in development and production costs and
risks associated with future production. Because of these and other considerations, any estimate of fair value is
necessarily subjective and imprecise.

NOTES TO STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 AND 2011
(Unaudited)
These statements of revenues and direct operating expenses have been prepared by Gulfport Energy Corporation
(“Gulfport”) without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the
interim periods, on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements of revenues and direct operating expenses.
All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Certain information, accounting policies, and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the
disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These statements of revenues and direct
operating expenses should be read in conjunction with the annual statements of revenues and direct operating
expenses and notes. Results for the six-month period ended June 30, 2012 are not necessarily indicative of the results
expected for the full year.
NOTE A—BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying statements present the revenues and direct operating expenses of working and revenue interests of
certain oil and natural gas properties located in the Permian Basin of West Texas (the “Properties”) owned by Gulfport
for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.
The accompanying statements of revenues and direct operating expenses are presented on the accrual basis of
accounting and were derived from the historical accounting records of Gulfport. Such amounts may not be
representative of future operations. The statements do not include depreciation, depletion and amortization, general
and administrative expenses, income taxes or interest expense.
Historical financial statements reflecting financial position, results of operations and cash flows required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America are not presented as such information is not readily
available on an individual property basis. Accordingly, the historical statements of revenues and direct operating
expenses of the Properties are presented in lieu of the financial statements required under Rule 3-05 of the Securities
and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X.
NOTE B—SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Use of estimates
The preparation of the accompanying statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and direct operating expenses during
the reporting period. The estimates include oil and gas revenue accruals and reserve quantities. It is emphasized that
reserve estimates are inherently imprecise and that estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise than those of
producing oil and gas properties. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates.
Revenue recognition
Oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title passes to the purchaser, net of royalty interests, discounts and
allowances, as applicable.

CERTAIN PROPERTY INTERESTS OF
GULFPORT ENERGY CORPORATION
NOTES TO STATEMENTS OF REVENUES AND DIRECT OPERATING EXPENSES
FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 AND 2011 (CONTINUED)
(Unaudited)
NOTE C—CONTRIBUTION AGREEMENT
On May 7, 2012, Gulfport entered into a contribution agreement with Diamondback Energy, Inc., (“Diamondback”).
Under the terms of the contribution agreement, Gulfport agreed to contribute to Diamondback, prior to the closing of
the Diamondback initial public offering (“Diamondback IPO”), all its interests in the Properties in exchange for
(i) shares of common stock representing 35% of Diamondback’s outstanding common stock immediately prior to the
closing of the Diamondback IPO and (ii) $63,590,050 in the form of a non-interest bearing promissory note, which will
be repaid in full upon the closing of the Diamondback IPO with a portion of the net proceeds from that offering. The
aggregate consideration payable to Gulfport is subject to a post-closing cash adjustment based on changes in the
working capital, long-term debt and other items of Windsor Permian LLC (“Windsor Permian”) referred to in the
contribution agreement as of the date of the contribution. Windsor Permian, an entity controlled by Wexford, is the
operator of Gulfport’s acreage to be contributed and will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diamondback at the time of
the contribution. Gulfport’s obligation to make this contribution is contingent upon, among other things, the
contribution to Diamondback of all the outstanding equity interests in Windsor Permian, Gulfport’s satisfaction with the
terms of the Diamondback IPO and customary closing conditions. Under the contribution agreement, Gulfport is
generally responsible for all liabilities and obligations with respect to the contributed properties arising prior to the
contribution and Diamondback is responsible for such liabilities and obligations with respect to the contributed
properties arising after the contribution.
In connection with the contribution, Gulfport and Diamondback will enter into an investor rights agreement in which
Gulfport will have the right, for so long as it beneficially owns more than 10% of Diamondback’s outstanding common
stock, to designate one individual as a nominee to serve on Diamondback’s board of directors. Such nominee, if
elected to Diamondback’s board, will also serve on each committee of the board so long as he or she satisfies the
independence and other requirements for service on the applicable committee of the board. So long as Gulfport has
the right to designate a nominee to Diamondback’s board and there is no Gulfport nominee actually serving as a
Diamondback director, Gulfport will have the right to appoint one individual as an advisor to the board who shall be
entitled to attend board and committee meetings. Gulfport will also be entitled to certain information rights and
Diamondback will grant Gulfport certain demand and “piggyback” registration rights obligating Diamondback to
register with the SEC any shares of Diamondback common stock that Gulfport owns. If the contribution is completed,
Gulfport will own a 35% equity interest in Diamondback immediately prior to the closing of the Diamondback IPO,
rather than leasehold interests in Gulfport’s Permian Basin acreage.
NOTE D—SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Gulfport has evaluated the period after June 30, 2012 through August 17, 2012, the date the statements of revenues and
direct operating expenses were available to be issued, noting no subsequent events or transactions that required
recognition or disclosure in the statements of revenues and direct operating expenses.

Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
Limitation of Liability
$
*  
 
*
Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, permits a corporation, in its certificate of
incorporation, to limit or eliminate, subject to certain statutory limitations, the liability of directors to the corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of fiduciary duty, except for liability:
•
for any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders;
•
for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;
•
in respect of certain unlawful dividend payments or stock redemptions or repurchases; and
•
for any transaction from which the director derives an improper personal benefit.
In accordance with Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL, Section 9.1 of our certificate of incorporation provides that that no
director shall be personally liable to us or any of our stockholders for monetary damages resulting from breaches of
their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such limitation on or exemption from liability is not permitted
under the DGCL. The effect of this provision of our certificate of incorporation is to eliminate our rights and those of
our stockholders (through stockholders’ derivative suits on our behalf) to recover monetary damages against a director
for breach of the fiduciary duty of care as a director, including breaches resulting from negligent or grossly negligent
behavior, except, as restricted by Section 102(b)(7) of the DGCL. However, this provision does not limit or eliminate our
rights or the rights of any stockholder to seek non-monetary relief, such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a
breach of a director’s duty of care.
If the DGCL is amended to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the liability of directors, then, in
accordance with our certificate of incorporation, the liability of our directors to us or our stockholders will be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or amendment of
provisions of our certificate of incorporation limiting or eliminating the liability of directors, whether by our
stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless
otherwise required by law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to
further limit or eliminate the liability of directors on a retroactive basis.

Indemnification
II-1
Section 145 of the DGCL permits a corporation, under specified circumstances, to indemnify its directors, officers,
employees or agents against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlements
actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any action, suit or proceeding brought by third parties by
reason of the fact that they were or are directors, officers, employees or agents of the corporation, if such directors,
officers, employees or agents acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to
the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reason to believe
their conduct was unlawful. In a derivative action, i.e., one by or in the right of the corporation, indemnification may be
made only for expenses actually and reasonably incurred by directors, officers, employees or agents in connection
with the defense or settlement of an action or suit, and only with respect to a matter as to which they shall have acted
in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation,
except that no indemnification shall be made if such person shall have been adjudged liable to the corporation, unless
and only to the extent that the court in which the action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that the
defendant directors, officers, employees or agents are fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses
despite such adjudication of liability
Our certificate of incorporation provides that we will, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable law,
indemnify our current and former directors and officers, as well as those persons who, while directors or officers of our
corporation, are or were serving as directors, officers, employees or agents of another entity, trust or other enterprise,
including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, in connection with any threatened, pending or completed
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, against all expense, liability and loss (including,
without limitation, attorney’s fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by any such person in connection with any such proceeding. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a person eligible for indemnification pursuant to our certificate of incorporation will be indemnified by us in
connection with a proceeding initiated by such person only if such proceeding was authorized by our board of
directors, except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification.
The right to indemnification conferred by our certificate of incorporation is a contract right that includes the right to be
paid by us the expenses incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding referenced above in
advance of its final disposition, provided, however, that if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by
our officer or director (solely in the capacity as an officer or director of our corporation) will be made only upon
delivery to us of an undertaking, by or on behalf of such officer or director, to repay all amounts so advanced if it is
ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under our certificate of
incorporation or otherwise.
The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses will not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which any
person covered by our certificate of incorporation may have or hereafter acquire under law, our certificate of
incorporation, our bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our certificate of incorporation affecting indemnification rights, whether by
our stockholders or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith, will (unless
otherwise required by law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits us to
provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis, and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any
right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision with
respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent
provision. Our certificate of incorporation also permits us, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by
law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other that those specifically covered by our certificate of
incorporation.

Our bylaws include the provisions relating to advancement of expenses and indemnification rights consistent with
those set forth in our certificate of incorporation. In addition, our bylaws provide for a right of indemnitee to bring a
suit in the event a claim for indemnification or advancement of expenses is not paid in full by us within a specified
period of time. Our bylaws also permit us to purchase and maintain insurance, at our expense, to protect us and/or any
director, officer, employee or agent of our corporation or another entity, trust or other enterprise against any expense,
liability or loss, whether or not we would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or
loss under the DGCL.
Any repeal or amendment of provisions of our bylaws affecting indemnification rights, whether by our board of
directors, stockholders or by changes in applicable law, or the adoption of any other provisions inconsistent therewith,
will (unless otherwise required by law) be prospective only, except to the extent such amendment or change in law
permits us to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis, and will not in any way diminish or
adversely affect any right or protection existing thereunder with respect to any act or omission occurring prior to such
repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.
We will enter into indemnification agreements with each of our current directors and executive officers. These
agreements will require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law against
liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any
proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. We also intend to enter into indemnification
agreements with our future directors and executive officers.
Under the Underwriting Agreement, the underwriters are obligated, under certain circumstances, to indemnify directors
and officers of the registrant against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or the Securities Act. Reference is made to the form of Underwriting Agreement to be filed as Exhibit 1.1 to
this Registration Statement.
Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities.

             shares of our common stock to Gulfport in connection with the Gulfport contribution.
The shares of our common stock described in this Item 15 will be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the

Item 17. Undertakings.
The undersigned Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing specified in the
underwriting agreements, certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the
underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.
Insofar as indemnification by the Registrant for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to
directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is
against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for
indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is
asserted by such director, officer, or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered hereunder,
the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to
a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as
expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
The Registrant hereby undertakes that:
(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of
prospectus filed as part of this Registration Statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of
prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to
be part of this Registration Statement as of the time it was declared effective.
(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, each post-effective amendment that contains a
form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the
offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
