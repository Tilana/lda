Seabridge Gold Expects Substantial Expansion of Deep Kerr Resource at KSM
2014 Drill Program Adds about 400 meters of Strike and 300 meters of Depth Extension
Toronto,  Canada…Seabridge  Gold  today  reported  the  complete  drill  results  from  its  2014
exploration  drilling  campaign  at  the  Deep  Kerr  deposit  on  its  100%-owned  KSM  Project  in
Northwestern British Columbia, Canada. A total of 12,900 meters in 13 core holes successfully
expanded the known dimensions of the deposit along strike to the north and south as well as at
depth. Drilling also confirmed the geological and resource models developed following the 2013
discovery program. Seabridge is highly confident that the 2014 results will support a substantial
increase in the Deep Kerr inferred resource which currently stands at 515 million tonnes grading
0.53% copper and 0.36 g/T gold. A new resource estimate is expected in the first quarter of 2015.
 
 
The KSM Project hosts multiple deposits containing one of the largest undeveloped gold and
copper reserves in the world (see news release of June 29, 2012, disclosing the details of KSM's
most recent Prefeasibility Study). KSM’s composite intrusive complex hosts four known, large,
gold-copper porphyry deposits within the upper portions of their mineralizing systems. Seabridge
believes  these  porphyry  deposits  have  continuity  down  to  near-magmatic,  higher  grade  core
zones. This vertical zonation is typical of many of the world's largest mining districts. Pursuing
this model, Seabridge has discovered two core zones to date-Deep Kerr and the Iron Cap Lower
Zone. Core zones are formed under higher temperature and pressure conditions, resulting in a
mineralogical character usually associated with significantly higher metal content.
 
 
Seabridge  Chairman  and  CEO  Rudi  Fronk  noted  that  “our  program  this  year  was  focused
principally on expanding the Deep Kerr resource and also expanding our understanding of its
limits  and  controls  on  mineralization.  It  is  clear  from  this  program  that  the  resource  model  is
robust-it successfully predicts metal distribution. This year’s drilling demonstrates that the Deep
Kerr high-grade zones are controlled by primary fluid pathways within mineralizing intrusions, an
observation reflected in the high vein and fracture densities which are positive for higher grades.
We have also determined that the depth and south limits remain open. Deep Kerr continues to
emerge as one of the more promising opportunities on a global scale”.
 
Model Confirmation Drilling
Two  holes  (K-14-25D  and  28C)  were  drilled  into  the  existing  resource  to  evaluate  the
performance of the model by determining how well the new data matched up against the model’s
predicted block grades. In order to expedite this work, daughter holes were completed from two
widely spaced 2013 drill holes. In each case, the results showed mineralized intervals consistent
with those predicted by the model, with differences in copper grades ranging from -12% to +30%.
These results are within the acceptable ranges for an inferred resource classification, they are
consistent with our expectation for a predictive geological model and they provide confidence in
the reliability of our estimates.
North Strike Projection
The  north  strike  projection  of  the  Kerr  deposit  was  a  primary  target  at  the  end  of  2013.    The
northernmost drill holes in the 2013 program intersected well mineralized intrusive rocks. Three
additional sections were completed this year at 140 meter intervals stepping north from the 2013
data. Mineralized zones consistent with the Deep Kerr deposit model were encountered in the
first two cross section step-outs (holes K-14-39,  43,  44  and  48),  280  meters  north  of  previous
drilling. On the northern most section (holes K-14-41 and 41A), a large interval of post mineral
intrusive rock was intersected. The high-grade Deep Kerr structures elsewhere are bounded by,
or coincident with, fault structures which remain open along strike.  It is not known if the Deep
Kerr mineralization continues north of this intrusion.
Depth Projection
Three drill holes (K-14-34A, 40 and 45) were targeted to provide mineralogical zoning indicators
and extend the depth projection of the Deep Kerr zone. Holes K-14-34A and 45 were setup to
drill  down  the  interpreted  Deep  Kerr  zone  and  encountered  long  sections  of  the  mineralized
zone, however, this orientation was difficult to maintain and technical limitations terminated the
holes  before  reaching  the  limits  of  the  deposit.  These  two  holes  therefore  bottomed  in  strong
mineralization. Hole K-14-40 was drilled perpendicular to the zone. These tests confirm that the
Deep Kerr zone plunges west-northwest and continues to at least 1350 meters below surface.
South Extension
In  2013,  the  south  limit  of  the  Deep  Kerr  deposit  was  provisionally  established  at  the
southernmost drill hole (K-13-26) in the zone at that time. As the 2014 program progressed, it
became clear the southern boundary was arbitrary. Two drill holes were completed to confirm a
southern extension, one hole (K-14-42) at the southern limit of the 2013 resource model and one
hole  (K-14-46)  550  meters  beyond  the  2013  model.  These  holes  confirm  significant  strike
potential but additional drilling is required to extend the resource model and establish the grade
distribution.

The holes drilled to test the model and the north and south extensions and Hole K-14-40 were
drilled in an orientation designed to intersect the mineralized zone perpendicular to the strike and
accordingly the above intervals are believed to approximate true widths of the mineralized zone.
Holes K-14-34A and 45 were drilled to test the depth projections, were not designed to evaluate
the  true  thickness  of  the  mineralized  interval  and  the  width  of  these  zones  is  indicated  from
previous drilling at between 150 and 300 meters.
Exploration activities at KSM were conducted by Seabridge personnel under the supervision of
William E. Threlkeld, Senior Vice President of Seabridge and a Qualified Person as defined by
National  Instrument  43-101.  Mr.  Threlkeld  has  reviewed  and  approved  this  news  release.  An
ongoing and rigorous quality control/quality assurance protocol was employed during the 2014
program  including  blank  and  reference  standards  in  every  batch  of  assays.  Cross-check
analyses will be conducted at a second external laboratory on 10% of the samples. Samples will
be assayed using fire assay atomic adsorption methods for gold and total digestion ICP methods
for other elements.
Seabridge  holds  a  100%  interest  in  several  North  American  gold  resource  projects.  The
Company’s  principal  assets  are  the  KSM  property  located  near  Stewart,  British  Columbia,
Canada and the Courageous Lake gold project located in Canada’s Northwest Territories. For a
breakdown of Seabridge’s mineral reserves and resources by project and category please visit

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENT
 
All reserve and resource estimates reported by the Corporation were calculated in accordance
with  the  Canadian  National  Instrument  43-101  and  the  Canadian  Institute  of  Mining  and
Metallurgy Classification system. These standards differ significantly from the requirements of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Mineral resources which are not mineral reserves do
not have demonstrated economic viability.
This document contains "forward-looking information" within the meaning of Canadian securities
legislation  and  "forward-looking  statements"  within  the  meaning  of  the  United  States  Private
Securities  Litigation  Reform  Act  of  1995.  This  information  and  these  statements,  referred  to
herein  as  "forward-looking  statements"  are  made  as  of  the  date  of  this  document.  Forward-
looking  statements  relate  to  future  events  or  future  performance  and  reflect  current  estimates,
predictions, expectations or beliefs regarding future events and include, but are not limited to,
statements  with  respect  to:  (i)  the  ability  and  timing  to  complete  an  increased  or  expanded
resource  estimate  for  the  Deep  Kerr  deposit;  (ii)  that  these  porphyry  deposits  have  continuity
down to near-magmatic, higher grade core zones; (iii) that certain of the 2014 intercepts likely
representing true widths; (iv) the estimated amount and grade of mineral reserves and mineral
resources; (v) estimates of capital costs of constructing mine facilities and bringing a mine into
production, including financing payback periods; (vi) the amount of future production; and (vii)
estimates of operating costs, net cash flow and economic returns from an operating mine. Any
statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions, expectations, beliefs,
plans, projections, objectives or future events or performance (often, but not always, using words
or  phrases  such  as  "expects",  "anticipates",  "plans",  "projects",  "estimates",  "envisages",
"assumes", "intends", "strategy", "goals", "objectives" or variations thereof or stating that certain
actions,  events  or  results  "may",  "could",  "would",  "might"  or  "will"  be  taken,  occur  or  be
achieved, or the negative of any of these terms and similar expressions) are not statements of
historical fact and may be forward-looking statements.
All forward-looking statements are based on Seabridge's or its consultants' current beliefs as well
as  various  assumptions  made  by  them  and  information  currently  available  to  them.  These
assumptions  include:  (i)  the  presence  of  and  continuity  of  metals  at  the  Project  at  modeled
grades; (ii) the capacities of various machinery and equipment; (iii) the availability of personnel,
machinery and equipment at estimated prices; (iv) exchange rates; (v) metals sales prices; (vi)
appropriate  discount  rates;  (vii)  tax  rates  and  royalty  rates  applicable  to  the  proposed  mining
operation;  (viii)  financing  structure  and  costs;  (ix)  anticipated  mining  losses  and  dilution;  (x)
metallurgical performance; (xi) reasonable contingency requirements; (xii) success in realizing
proposed  operations;  (xiii)  receipt  of  regulatory  approvals  on  acceptable  terms,  including  the
necessary right of way for the proposed tunnels; and (xiv) the negotiation of satisfactory terms
with  impacted  Treaty  and  First  Nations  groups.  Although  management  considers  these
assumptions to be reasonable based on information currently available to it, they may prove to be
incorrect. Many forward-looking statements are made assuming the correctness of other forward
looking statements, such as statements of net present value and internal rates of return, which
are  based  on  most  of  the  other  forward-looking  statements  and  assumptions  herein.  The  cost
information is also prepared using current values, but the time for incurring the costs will be in the
future and it is assumed costs will remain stable over the relevant period.
By  their  very  nature,  forward-looking  statements  involve  inherent  risks  and  uncertainties,  both
general  and  specific,  and  risks  exist  that  estimates,  forecasts,  projections  and  other  forward-
looking statements will not be achieved or that assumptions do not reflect future experience. We
caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements as a number of
important  factors  could  cause  the  actual  outcomes  to  differ  materially  from  the  beliefs,  plans,
objectives, expectations, anticipations, estimates assumptions and intentions expressed in such
forward-looking  statements.  These  risk  factors  may  be  generally  stated  as  the  risk  that  the
assumptions  and  estimates  expressed  above  do  not  occur,  but  specifically  include,  without
limitation:  risks  relating  to  variations  in  the  mineral  content  within  the  material  identified  as
mineral  reserves  or  mineral  resources  from  that  predicted;  variations  in  rates  of  recovery  and
extraction; developments in world metals markets; risks relating to fluctuations in the Canadian
dollar  relative  to  the  US  dollar;  increases  in  the  estimated  capital  and  operating  costs  or
unanticipated costs; difficulties attracting the necessary work force; increases in financing costs
or adverse changes to the terms of available financing, if any; tax rates or royalties being greater
than assumed; changes in development or mining plans due to changes in logistical, technical or
other  factors;  changes  in  project  parameters  as  plans  continue  to  be  refined;  risks  relating  to
receipt of regulatory approvals or settlement of an agreement with impacted First Nations groups;
the  effects  of  competition  in  the  markets  in  which  Seabridge  operates;  operational  and
infrastructure  risks  and  the  additional  risks  described  in  Seabridge's  Annual  Information  Form
filed  with  SEDAR  in  Canada  (available  at www.sedar.com)  for  the  year  ended  December  31,
2013  and  in  the  Corporation's  Annual  Report  Form  40-F  filed  with  the  U.S.  Securities  and
Exchange Commission on EDGAR (available at www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). Seabridge cautions
that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive.
When relying on our forward-looking statements to make decisions with respect to Seabridge,
investors and others should carefully consider the foregoing factors and other uncertainties and
potential  events.  Seabridge  does  not  undertake  to  update  any  forward-looking  statement,
whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time by Seabridge or on our behalf, except
as required by law.
