<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is the fourth periodic report on the human rights situation in 
Yemen submitted by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to Human Rights Council resolutions 18/19, 19/29 and 21/22. It 
provides an updated assessment of the overall human rights situation in Yemen, from 1 July 
2012 to 30 June 2013, particularly against the backdrop of the recommendations contained 
in previous High Commissioner&#8217;s reports and Council resolutions 18/19, 19/29 and 21/22. 
The information contained in this report is based primarily on human rights monitoring 
carried out by the OHCHR office in Yemen (OHCHR-Yemen). 
</p>
<p><b> II. Background 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. International legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>2. Yemen is party to eight of the nine core international human rights treaties, as well 
as to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on a 
communications procedure. On 11 June 2013, the Cabinet approved the ratification of the 
International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance 
and endorsed the accession of Yemen to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal 
Court. Yemen is also party to all four Geneva Conventions, as well as to Additional 
Protocols I and II, and the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain 
Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have 
Indiscriminate Effects, and is also bound by the customary rules of international 
humanitarian law.  
</p>
<p>3. As a State party to the above-mentioned treaties, Yemen is legally bound to respect, 
protect and fulfil the human rights of those within its jurisdiction. In reviewing the 
implementation by Yemen of its treaty obligations, the relevant human rights treaty bodies 
have noted that violations of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights persist on a 
considerable scale. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Political developments 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Initiative and the Agreement on the 
implementation mechanism for the transition period (&#8220;Transition Agreement&#8221;), signed on 
23 November 2011, put an end to the 2011 protests and brokered a political settlement in 
Yemen. The Transition Agreement envisaged a transition period until 2014 divided into 
two phases: the first phase included an early presidential election, which took place on 21 
February 2012 and saw the election of President Abd Rabu Mansur Hadi; the second phase, 
covering the remaining period until 2014, includes a broad national dialogue, consideration 
of changes to the Yemeni Constitution, a constitutional referendum, the reform of political 
and electoral laws, parliamentary and local council elections, and presidential elections, if 
required. The Transition Agreement affirmed that, once inaugurated, the President and the 
Government of National Unity would convene the National Dialogue Conference (NDC).1 
On 18 March 2013, NDC began, after several postponements. It was originally scheduled to 
start in mid-November 2012, but was delayed mainly due to the refusal of factions within 
Al Hirak al-Janoubi (Al Hirak), the Southern Movement, to attend. NDC is a critical 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Paragraph 20 of the GCC Implementation Agreement, 23 November 2011. </p>


<p>process which, once it concludes its work in September 2013, will be followed by a 
constitution-drafting process leading to a referendum on the adoption of a new Constitution 
and the holding of general elections in February 2014.2 On 20 June 2013, media reported 
that the Yemeni Supreme Commission for Elections had announced that the Constitutional 
referendum would take place on 15 October 2013.3  
</p>
<p>5. NDC has met in nine thematic working groups as defined in the Transition 
Agreement, on themes varying from the most critical political issues of Southern Yemen 
and the question of Sa&#8217;ada, to those bearing significant human rights dimensions, including 
State-Building (Principles and Foundations of Constitution), Rights and Freedoms, Good 
Governance, Independent Institutions and Social Issues, National Reconciliation and 
Transitional Justice. Issues pertaining to specific groups such as women, youth and 
marginalized communities have been mainstreamed throughout the work of NDC.4  
</p>
<p>6. The NDC Technical Committee was charged with the organization of NDC, 
particularly with regard to member representation. It decided to guarantee representation 
for the southern population at a rate of at least 50 per cent of the total number of conference 
members, women at a rate of 30 per cent and youth at a rate of 20 per cent of all 
participating groups and entities.5 This process led to the participation of 565 participants 
from different sections of society. Despite the lengthy and tense nomination process, most 
of the seats were eventually granted to the major political blocks. This led to complaints by 
representatives of independent youth movements, which had been at the forefront of the 
2011 events, for receiving a limited number of seats. Minority groups like the Jewish and 
Ismaili communities did not obtain any representation, whereas the Muhamasheen6 were 
given only one seat, with a view to submitting recommendations to tackle the deep-rooted 
discrimination faced by the members of their community. The United Nations, spearheaded 
by the Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Yemen, in addition to other 
international actors and national stakeholders, have supported the process in various ways, 
particularly to ensure the active and meaningful participation of all Yemenis, in line with 
Security Council resolutions 2014 (2011) and 2051 (2012) (para. 3 (a)).  
</p><p>7. The non-participation of some key Southern leaders, combined with demonstrations 
calling for the independence of the South as well as strikes organized by the Southern pro-
independence movement Al Hirak in Southern cities, added to uncertainty surrounding 
expectations about the results of the Dialogue. The repression of those demonstrations, 
most notably on 21 February 2013, has exacerbated tensions in the South.  
</p>
<p>8. The participation in NDC of the Al Houthi Movement (also known as <i>Ansar Allah</i>), 
the armed group which has de facto control over the Governorate of Sa&#8217;ada and other areas 
in northern Yemen, has been a significant step forward. However, the dispute at NDC as 
well as in northern Yemen between the Al Houthi Movement and groups such as the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 According to the GCC Implementation Agreement, once NDC concludes its work, the National 
</p>
<p>Consensus Government will appoint a committee to draft the constitutional amendments within three 
months. A constitutional referendum to approve the changes will then be held.

<p>Salafists and the Islah party, is a serious cause of concern and contributes to the worsening 
of the fragile security situation.7 
</p>
<p>9.  Two new commissions, on property and on dismissals8 in the south, were established 
in January 2013, as confidence-building measures, to address the root causes of southern 
grievances.9 The Dismissals Commission, which consists of five judges and four military 
officers, started its work on 13 March 2013 and has so far received 60,000 petitions from 
former military employees and 29,000 petitions from former civilian employees.10 The 
Land Commission, consisting of five judges and 24 supporting staff, started its work on 10 
March 2013 and has established seven field offices across south Yemen.11 It has so far 
received 28,000 claims from individuals maintaining that their lands were illegally 
confiscated by the Northern Government following the 1994 war. The Commissions have a 
one-year mandate, but the Heads of both Commissions consider that more time will be 
needed to settle all cases and that the funding allocated by the Government is insufficient. 
</p>
<p>10. Various local and international actors, including the Security Council envoys who 
visited Yemen in January 2013, have expressed concern that former President Ali Abdullah 
Saleh and his loyalists, as well as Al Hirak leader and former Vice-President Ali Salim al 
Beidh, are seeking to undermine the transitional process12 and contributing to the 
deterioration in the security and humanitarian situation. In addition, the rivalry between the 
two major political parties &#8211; the Joint Meeting Parties and the General People&#8217;s Congress, 
still chaired by former President Saleh &#8211; has also ostensibly posed a challenge to the 
President&#8217;s efforts to introduce and implement needed reforms.    
</p>
<p><b> C.  Security situation 
</b></p>
<p>11. During the reporting period, OHCHR noted the frequent tribal road blockades and 
the persistent sabotage of electricity, oil and gas infrastructure, which contribute to a further 
deterioration of the humanitarian situation in the country. Kidnappings of foreigners and 
killings of high-level military and security personnel as well as other individuals were also 
recorded. For instance, on 13 February 2013, Khalid al-Siwari, a lawyer who had been 
performing work in connection with the killing of protesters in Sana&#8217;a on 18 March 2011, 
was killed in Sana&#8217;a. Another lawyer involved in the &#8220;Friday of Dignity&#8221; killings case, 
Hassan al-Dawla, was also killed in Sana&#8217;a in December 2011. 
</p>
<p>12. According to media reports, border security with Saudi Arabia has also dramatically 
worsened in the aftermath of the 2011 events in Yemen, as thousands of illegal immigrants,

 The Commission to Consider and Address Land Issues and the Commission on Forcibly Dismissed

<p>Employees, established by Presidential Decree No. 2 (2013) of 8 January 8 2013, were enacted with a 
view to &#8220;address issues related to land and employees in the Southern Governorates in order to 
complete the National Dialogue and National Reconciliation and as required by the public interest&#8221;.

<p>drug and weapons smugglers try to enter Saudi Arabia.13 Yemen is also considered a base 
for Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Saudi Arabia was reportedly trying to 
secure its borders against possible infiltrations and attacks through the construction of a 
1,800 km border fence to bolster security at its frontiers with Yemen.14 
</p>
<p>13.  After launching Operation Golden Swords in May and June 2012, the military of 
Yemen reclaimed much of the Governorate of Abyan, clearing the territory&#8217;s main 
population centres of AQAP and Ansar al-Sharia. However, the reporting period was 
marked by the killing of high-level military and security personnel: some reports indicated 
that these killings were reprisals by Al-Qaida and its affiliates, being forced out of their 
strongholds; others have viewed these acts as means to settle local political disputes. 
Although the Government claims that it has diminished the number of Al-Qaida operatives 
working from their bases in different governorates, the group remains active in Yemen. In 
addition, a patchwork of State-backed local militias, the Popular Committees, has emerged 
in Abyan as the frontline security force against the insurgent Al-Qaida affiliates. The 
diverse composition of Abyan&#8217;s Popular Committees reflects political and tribal relations 
that have evolved since the 1994 civil war.15  
</p>
<p>14. As part of the GCC Initiative Agreement, and reiterated by the Security Council 
resolution 2051 (2012), the second phase of the transition also had to focus on the 
restructuring of the security and armed forces under a unified professional national 
leadership structure. During the reporting period, President Hadi issued a series of decrees 
dissolving the First Armoured Division and the Republican Guard and transferring its 
brigades to the seven different military zones. General Ali Mohsen al Ahmar, previously at 
the head of the First Armoured Division, was appointed as senior advisor to the President, 
whereas General Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, son of the former President and in charge of 
the Republican Guard, was appointed as ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. Other 
relatives of the former President, who had occupied important security or military position, 
were also removed from their posts during the reporting period.16   
</p>
<p>15. In addition, on 21 February 2013, the President issued Decree No. 5 (2013) on the 
restructuring of the Ministry of Interior, with the stated aim of responding to the need for 
oversight, accountability, combating abuse affecting citizens&#8217; rights and freedoms, and 
fighting corruption. The Decree created the position of Inspector General and established 
the Department of Human Rights that reports directly to the Inspector General.17  
</p>
<p>16. OHCHR-Yemen received numerous reports from human rights groups documenting 
cases of individuals killed by drone strikes in different parts of Yemen. In interviews 
conducted by OHCHR-Yemen with the families of some of the victims of those attacks, it 
appears that no official investigation has been carried out and no compensation has been 
offered to the families. OHCHR recalls the obligation of States under international law to

<p>ensure accountability in all such instances, including through the conduct of credible, 
prompt and effective investigations. 
</p>
<p>17. OHCHR notes with concern the lack of transparency surrounding the use of armed 
drones for targeted killings in Yemen. This contributes to a lack of clarity on the legal bases 
for the use of lethal force through drone strikes, as well as on safeguards to ensure 
compliance with the applicable international law. Moreover, the absence of transparency 
has created an accountability vacuum, in which victims have been unable to seek redress.18 
</p>
<p>18. Prominent Government officials in Yemen have been voicing their concern about 
the legality of drone strikes under international and domestic law, as well as their 
effectiveness as a counter-terrorism strategy, and have called for adjusting the counter-
terrorism strategy and policy of Yemen to ensure that it is coherent with international law. 
National civil society organizations have also called for an end to drone strikes, which they 
believe to be undermining the sovereignty of Yemen, as well as driving individuals to join 
Al-Qaida groups out of revenge and despair. Serious questions also have been raised by 
civil society organizations as to whether, at least in certain instances, targeted individuals 
could have been arrested rather than killed. Officials, including President Hadi, however, 
have defended the drone strikes and maintained that they are carried out by the United 
States of America in full coordination with the Yemeni authorities and only after approval 
by the President. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Humanitarian situation 
</b></p>
<p>19. According to the Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), as of 
May 2013, 10.5 million people were in need of food aid, of which about 5 million were 
faced with acute food shortage; 6.4 million people did not have access to health care and 
almost 1 million children were facing acute malnutrition. Over 13 million people were 
without access to safe water and sanitation.19 Addressing the dire humanitarian situation in 
Yemen remains critical to ensuring the success and sustainability of the ongoing political 
dialogue.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Situation of human rights and implementation of 
recommendations of OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p><b> A.  Accountability and transitional justice 
</b>20. The events of 2011 brought to the forefront the issue of accountability for past 
human rights violations. There are persistent demands to bring perpetrators from all sides to 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>18
 Outside of active hostilities in the context of an armed conflict, the use of lethal force in a law 
</p>
<p>enforcement operation is prohibited except in very narrow circumstances. Under international human 
rights law, this is only insofar as the use of lethal force is required in self-defence or defence of others 
against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly 
serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting 
their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to 
achieve these objectives. In a situation of armed conflict, States must ensure that the use of lethal 
force complies with international humanitarian law, including the principles of distinction, 
proportionality and precaution. In case of doubt, individuals are entitled to a presumption of civilian 
status and are protected against attack.  
</p>
<p>

 OCHA, Humanitarian Bulletin, Yemen, issue No. 15, 7 May&#8211;8 June 2013. </p>


<p>justice and to provide redress for victims and their families. Concerns over the credibility of 
judicial investigations into human rights violations committed in the wake of the unrest in 
2011 have been highlighted in the High Commissioner&#8217;s previous report (see 
A/HRC/21/37). In the case of the Friday of Dignity killings of 18 March 2011, it came to 
the attention of OHCHR-Yemen that the Specialized Criminal Court ordered the Attorney 
General, on 27 April 2013, to investigate the 13 suspects in the case, including former 
President Saleh and his nephew Yahiah. The Attorney General appealed the Court&#8217;s 
decision, but the Appeal Court rejected this appeal on 5 June. In accordance with due 
process, the investigation should therefore be initiated as ordered by the Court. 
</p>
<p>21. With regard to the case of the Presidential Mosque bombing, in which several 
people, including former President Saleh, were injured or died, 6 detainees of 28 were 
acquitted after 20 months in detention. The remaining 22 went on hunger strike on 24 May 
2013 protesting against the length of their detention. On 2 June 2013, the Minister of 
Human Rights, Hooria Mashour, started a hunger strike in solidarity with the 22 detainees, 
who were kept in detention without trial beyond the limit of six months set by the Penal 
Code.20 In interviews conducted by OHCHR-Yemen on 2 June 2013, the prisoners 
interviewed affirmed that they had been exposed to torture and forced to sign confessions.21 
They stated that after an initial detention in an unidentified location,22 they had been moved 
to the Political Prison in December 2011. At that time, the Attorney General reportedly 
informed them that they were being charged with participating in the Presidential Mosque 
bombing. On 4 June 2013, President Hadi issued a decree to release 19 of the 22 detainees. 
The Attorney General decided to release 17, who were released on 6 June, and undertook to 
speedily conclude the investigation of the remaining five detainees. 
</p>
<p>22. In December 2012, the Government budgeted for 2 billion Yemeni rials (YRIs), 
approximately US$ 9 million, to be paid to the victims of the 2011 events. According to 
Presidential Decree No. 8 (2012), the families of victims killed or totally paralysed as a 
result of injuries in 2011 would receive 1 million YRIs, those partially paralysed 500,000 
YRIs, and each individual who was injured during the &#8220;revolution&#8221; would receive 360,000 
YRIs. The Government announced that these payments should not be considered as 
compensation, or &#8220;blood money&#8221;. The beneficiaries would still have the right to file 
complaints and request compensation. According to the Wafaa Society, the institution 
mandated to distribute the compensation, the total number of beneficiaries is reported to be 
3,786. 
</p>
<p>23. Despite this decision, injured individuals from the 2011 events have been holding 
demonstrations and sit-ins calling for the implementation of the decree authorizing 
compensation to be paid for families of the deceased and full treatment to be provided to 
the wounded. On 12 February 2013, security forces forcefully dispersed a sit-in and hunger 
strike in front of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Office. Several individuals were injured, including a 
Parliamentarian who was partaking in the sit-in in solidarity with the protesters. 
</p>
<p>24. In her previous reports to the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner 
recommended that the Government of Yemen launch transparent and independent 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>20
 The Minister ended her hunger strike as soon as the President promised to look into the detainees&#8217; 
</p>
<p>cases. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>21
 OHCHR-Yemen visited the detainees in the Political Security Prison back in June 2012 where they 
</p>
<p>reported the same information. 
 
</p>
<p>22
 In several meetings conducted by OHCHR-Yemen, top officials at the National Security Office 
</p>
<p>maintained that they did not run detention centres. Several people interviewed by OHCHR confirmed 
that they were detained by National Security before being referred to the Political Security detention 
facility. </p>


<p>investigations, compliant with international standards, into any credible allegations of 
serious human rights violations committed by Government security forces during the events 
of 2011 (A/HRC/21/37, para. 67 (a)). A commission to investigate allegations of human 
rights violations that occurred in 2011 was established in September 2012.23 However, at 
the time of writing the present report, the Commissioners had not yet been named. OHCHR 
is concerned that the delay in appointing the Commissioners may hamper the credibility of 
investigations and raises questions as to the commitment to redress and justice for victims 
of past human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>25. No development was recorded with regard to the Law on Transitional Justice and 
National Reconciliation. The draft law produced by the Ministry of Legal Affairs was 
submitted to the Prime Minister and the President in May 2012. However, on 5 January 
2013, the President submitted a different version of the Law to Parliament for 
consideration. The preamble of the draft law submitted by the President confirms the 
immunity granted to the former President and his associates. OHCHR reiterates that the 
immunities from prosecution granted to former President Saleh and his associates as part of 
the GCC initiative, by Law No. 1/2012, were a major setback with regard to 
accountability.24 
</p>
<p>26. It appears that the latest version of the transitional justice law presented by the 
President is still under consideration by the Parliament, and that no decision will be taken 
before the end of NDC, foreseen in September 2013, or before the NDC Transitional 
Justice Working Group produces its recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Detention and enforced disappearances 
</b></p>
<p>27. OHCHR-Yemen has been unable to obtain the official number of detainees and 
prisoners in prisons and detention centres. Despite Cabinet decision No. 180 (2012), which 
requested the release of all those imprisoned for their participation in the 2011 events, 
reports received from local NGOs indicate that the total number of the detainees who 
remain in prison in conjunction with the 2011 events is 68.25 
</p><p>28. Local NGOs reported that the families of 17 individuals, detained at different dates 
in 2011, were not aware of their relatives&#8217; fate or whereabouts. OHCHR-Yemen 
interviewed the families of six individuals who have disappeared, and who confirmed that 
their relatives had been detained by security forces. They had sought information at the 
Ministries of Human Rights, Interior and Defence but had not received satisfactory 
responses. 
</p>
<p>29. OHCHR-Yemen has been able to visit on several occasions the Central Prisons of 
Sana&#8217;a and Aden. At the Sana&#8217;a Central Prison, in April and June 2013, OHCHR-Yemen 
interviewed the detainees charged in the Presidential Mosque case, who complained about 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
 Decree No. 140/2012. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>24
 The Human Rights Committee also expressed concern about the adoption of Law No. 1/2012 granting 
</p>
<p>a blanket amnesty to former President Saleh and immunity from prosecution for all political crimes 
apart from acts of terrorism to all those who served with him during his rule. The Committee 
requested Yemen to repeal the law and to comply with international human rights law prohibiting 
immunity for those responsible for serious human rights violations in respect of which States are 
required to bring in perpetrators to justice (CCPR/C/YEM/CO/5, para. 6).   
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>25
 48 detained in Sana&#8217;a Central Prison, 19 in Hajjah and one in Ta&#8217;izz. </p>


<p>torture and ill-treatment received while in the National Security Prison26 and about the fact 
that they had been detained for two years without trial.  
</p>
<p>30. In March 2013, OHCHR-Yemen visited Aden Central Prison, which held 785 
prisoners, despite a maximum capacity of 300. Thirty-seven detainees were detained 
without court order or proper documentation. Among them, three members of Al Hirak 
were detained in relation to the 21 February 2013 demonstration, accused of incitement to 
violence. Twenty-five other detainees had been arrested by the Political Security on charges 
of being Al-Qaida members. The Director of the prison admitted that there were more 
detainees without proper documentation, arrested by either Central Security Forces or 
Political Security without a court order. He also admitted that the prison did not have a 
physician who could visit the prisoners and examine them for signs of torture or perform 
medical check-ups. 
</p>
<p>31. OHCHR-Yemen raised these issues with the Minister of Interior in April 2013. The 
Minister agreed that prison conditions were not in line with international standards and 
asserted that the Ministry did not have the required budget to improve the situation. 
However, the Minister undertook to consider the cases of prolonged detention; those 
detained without arrest warrants, as well as the cases of the 17 disappeared individuals.      
</p>
<p><b> C.  Freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association  
</b></p>
<p>32. Peaceful demonstrations and sit-ins by various groups have continued to be held 
throughout Yemen. In southern Yemen, some demonstrations have been repressed with 
force by Government security forces. As verified by OHCHR-Yemen, at least 10 persons 
were shot dead and many more wounded during a pro-south independence demonstration 
on 21 February 2013. Since then, the southern pro-independence movement Al Hirak has 
been calling for bi-weekly strikes and frequent demonstrations in southern cities. 
</p>
<p>33. Despite some improvements, the situation of the media and journalists remains of 
concern. OHCHR-Yemen recorded approximately 60 cases of threat and physical attacks 
on journalists by security forces and various armed groups during the reporting period, 
including assassination attempts and assassinations.27 No meaningful efforts have been 
taken by the Government to bring the perpetrators to justice, despite repeated calls for 
action by journalists and human rights activists. In addition, the local NGO Freedom 
Foundation, working on monitoring freedom of the press, recorded more than 15 cases 
brought against journalists at the Press Court since the beginning of 2013.28 Since 2010, the 
Audiovisual Media Law has been under consideration by the Cabinet.29 The law has been 
criticized by local NGOs for not being in line with international standards. No development 
was recorded during the reporting period. 
</p>
<p>34. Abdul Elah Haidar Shayi, a journalist sentenced in 2011 to five years&#8217; imprisonment 
on terror-related charges, has yet to be released. His trial has been strongly criticized by 
local and international human rights organizations for having fallen short of minimum fair 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>26
 Prisoners interviewed also affirmed that they had been subjected to ill-treatment while being detained 
</p>
<p>at the Political Security and the Presidential House. 
 
</p>
<p>27
 For instance, Wadoud Ali Saleh al-Someti, killed in Aden in February 2013, allegedly by 
</p>
<p>Government Defence Forces.  
 
</p>
<p>28
 Despite several requests for amendments and the instruction provided by former President Saleh in 
</p>
<p>2006 to abolish those provisions, the 1991 Press and Publication Law provides for the imprisonment 
of journalists. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>29
 According to the information received, the same version of the law has been submitted for the 
</p>
<p>Cabinet&#8217;s consideration several times since 2010. </p>


<p>trial guarantees. In spite of demonstrations and sit-ins by journalists calling for his release, 
the Government has not taken any action beyond promising to consider the matter.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Judiciary  
</b></p>
<p>35. Judges have continued to hold strikes during the reporting period, demanding 
increased physical security, a better working environment and improved living conditions. 
In April 2013, a two-week strike was held by judges in the Sana&#8217;a Governorate in protest of 
increased threats and physical assaults. Strikes were also held in various southern 
governorates in May and June 2013. Some 50 cases where judges were threatened by 
Government officials, security forces, tribal sheiks or unknown groups were reported.  
Security concerns have been also raised, particularly for commissioners and judges of 
special commissions, i.e. the property and dismissal commissions in southern Yemen. The 
Government recently brought to justice a number of perpetrators linked with physical 
assault and threats against judges. 
</p><p>36. On 14 May 2013, the Parliament adopted the draft amendment to the Judicial 
Authority Law, which had been under consideration for some time and provides for more 
independence of the Supreme Judicial Council from the executive power. In this regard, 
concerns have been raised about the independence and competence of the judiciary to 
adjudicate disputes in the next elections. At the time of writing the present report, the 
amendment is still awaiting endorsement by the President. Meanwhile, on 26 May 2013, 
the Constitutional Court issued a ruling declaring around 35 articles of the above-
mentioned Judicial Authority Law unconstitutional, thus exerting pressure on the 
Government to expedite the process and fill the legal vacuum. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Children&#8217;s rights  
</b></p>
<p>37. In 2012, the peaceful transfer of power and the start of the two-year transitional 
Government contributed to a decrease of grave violations against children, specifically 
killing and maiming through live ammunition, which had also affected children. For 
instance, child casualties due to mines, unexploded ordnance, explosive remnants of war, 
improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks increased especially in the conflict 
affected area of the Governorate of Abyan and peaked in the third quarter of 2012, with a 
reduction after Mine Action Teams had access to those areas.30    
</p>
<p>38. Some tangible progress to prohibit child recruitment was recorded in 2012, 
especially following the visit of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for 
Children and Armed Conflict in November 2012. Noteworthy are the steps taken by the 
Government to prohibit the practice, particularly the comprehensive revision of national 
legislation related to military laws;31 Cabinet resolution No. 212 (2012), according to which 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>30
 According to the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF), during the reporting period, 80 children 
</p>
<p>(73 boys, 7 girls) were either killed (20 boys, 2 girls) or maimed (53 boys, 5 girls) due to mines, 
unexploded ordnance, explosive remnants of war, improvised explosive devices and suicide attacks. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>31
 Police Law No. 15 of 2000 and its amendments, Law No. 22 of 1990 on the mandatory National 
</p>
<p>Defence Service, Law No. 23 of 1990 regarding the general reserve, Law No. 35 of 1992 regulating 
military academies, Law No. 67 of 1991 regarding service in the Armed Forces and Law No. 21 of 
1998 on the Military&#8217;s Penal Code. Several proposals were submitted with amended texts, including 
resetting the age of voluntary recruitment in the Armed Forces at 18, imposing intensive sanctions for 
the recruitment of children under 18 and enlisting the six gross violations against children as war 
crimes in the military Penal Code. </p>


<p>the Government of Yemen officially agreed on the Paris Commitments to end the 
recruitment and use of children by armed forces and groups in conflict; and the adoption of 
Cabinet resolution No. 1 2013 to review implementation of Yemeni commitment to end 
child recruitment in armed conflict. An interministerial committee chaired by the Minister 
of Legal Affairs including the Ministers of Defence, Interior and Human Rights was 
established to implement the Government&#8217;s commitments, by developing an action plan to 
end the recruitment and use of children. However, despite such progress, child recruitment 
and use is ongoing. In the 2012 Secretary-General&#8217;s report on children and armed conflict 
(A/67/845-S/2013/245), Ansar al-Sharia was added to the list of those who systematically 
recruit and use children among their forces.32  
</p>
<p>39. During the reporting period two juvenile offenders were executed after being 
convicted of murder.33 According to UNICEF, there are currently 31 minors on death row, 
and the President has endorsed the sentence for four of them. Over 150 minors are at high 
risk of receiving the death sentence if no immediate action is taken.  
</p>
<p>40. According to the Penal Code, courts may sentence juveniles convicted of murder 
only to a maximum of 10 years in prison and the Yemeni Juvenile Welfare Law requires 
courts to refer children 15 years of age and younger to the juvenile court system. This, 
however, leaves many juvenile offenders to defend their cases before adult criminal courts. 
In addition, sentences are often imposed on the basis of forced confessions or confessions 
given without having had access to legal counsel. 
</p>
<p>41. The issue of birth registration is considered one of the main challenges for the 
enjoyment of rights by children in Yemen such as the right to fair trial and protection from 
death penalty. According to information received by UNICEF, in 2006, the birth 
registration rate amounted to only 22.3 per cent and the registration of children within their 
first year accounted for just 21 per cent of the total registered births. Most minors in prison 
lack birth certificates, which poses difficulties for the determination of the age of juveniles 
at the time they committed an offence. In June 2013, the Minister of Justice created a 
Specialised Forensic Technical Committee, composed of three doctors. The Committee is 
mandated, inter alia, to assess the age of those accused of serious offences whose penalty 
may result in capital punishment where there is doubt about their ages at the time of the 
perpetration of the offence and to supervise and evaluate the cases of children appearing 
before courts in penal cases during investigation and the sentencing stages.

<p>32
 The so-called &#8220;name and shame list&#8221;. Since 2011, Yemen and its parties to the conflict has been 
</p>
<p>listed. Currently the Al Houthi Movement, Government forces which includes Yemeni Armed Forces, 
the First Armoured Division, military police, the special security forces, the Republican Guards, and 
pro-Government militias (the Popular Committees), and Ansar al-Sharia are listed in this annex 
(A/67/845-S/2013/245, annex I). However, the list predates the restructuring of the Armed Forces of 
April 2003 (see para. 14 of the present report) that abolished the First Armoured Division and 
Republican Guards.  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>33
 Hind al-Barti (aged 15 at the time of the offence) was executed on 3 December 2012 and Muhammad 
</p>
<p>Haza&#8217;a (under 18 at the time of the offence) was executed on 9 March 2013. In December 2012, the 
Chairperson of the Committee on the Rights of the Child expressed deep dismay over the execution of 
Ms. Al-Barti. Noting that death sentences had already been imposed on 21 other juveniles aged under 
18 at the time the offences occurred, the Chairperson of the Committee  issued an urgent appeal to the 
Government of Yemen to both immediately halt all executions and take &#8220;effective measures to 
remove juvenile prisoners from death row.&#8221; See &#8220;UN Committee expresses its deep dismay 
concerning the continuing child executions in Yemen&#8221;, press release, Geneva, 12 December 2012.

www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=12886&amp;LangID=E. </p>


<p>42. The execution of minors is a serious infringement of the commitments undertaken 
by the Government during its 2009 universal periodic review, when it committed to not 
impose capital punishment for offences committed by persons under 18 years of age; to 
ensure that the death penalty is not applied to minors; to review the use of the death penalty 
on minors and mentally disabled persons; and to take immediate steps to remove juvenile 
prisoners from death row (see A/HRC/12/13).  
</p>
<p><b> F. Women&#8217;s rights 
</b></p>
<p>43. During the period under review, the National Commission for Women34 made 
efforts to promote the presence and participation of women in NDC. The National 
Conference on Women was held in March 2013 and produced a list of recommendations 
representing the needs of women during the transitional phase. The recommendations, 
which were submitted to the President for inclusion in Government policies, included: a 30 
per cent quota for women&#8217;s representation in the legislative, executive and judicial 
branches; the economic empowerment of women and the integration of gender aspects in 
the State budget; the amelioration of health services for women and children; as well as 
responses to the needs of women in displacement camps, among others. 
</p>
<p>44. The Technical Committee to prepare for NDC, which consisted of 29 members, 
including six women, was tasked to ensure at least a 30 per cent representation of women in 
all constituencies, working groups and bodies.35 Women and gender issues have been 
mainstreamed throughout the NDC Working Groups. NDC members have organized field 
visits to seek people&#8217;s views and ascertain their needs and the expectations which they had 
of the NDC, including on women&#8217;s issues and concerns.  
</p>
<p>45. In November 2012, the position of Adviser to the President on Women&#8217;s Affairs was 
created to follow up on the implementation of the National Commission for Women&#8217;s 
recommendations of March 2013.36 Two female judges were appointed to the Supreme 
Committee on Elections.  
</p>
<p><b> G. Marginalized groups 
</b></p>
<p>46. The Muhamasheen community continues to suffer from discrimination. Although 
the demands of some individuals working as street cleaners were met through the 
regularization of their contracts, the situation remained precarious for the majority of the 
community. In April 2013, members of the Muhamasheen community staged a strike in the 
capital demanding permanent contracts and social benefits, but agreed to its suspension 
after the Government promised to provide a solution within a two-month period.  
</p>
<p>47. Internal displacement directly affects more than half of the country&#8217;s governorates, 
with 13 of the 21 governorates being either a source or destination of such displacement.37 
The total number of displaced people in Yemen decreased to 299,000 in April 2013, due to 
the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to their homes, particularly in Abyan, 
owing to an overall improvement of the security situation, the resumption of basic services 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>34
 The National Commission for Women is a governmental body under the authority of the Prime 
</p>
<p>Minister. It is mandated to integrate women&#8217;s rights and gender issues within national policies and to 
improve women&#8217;s participation and their status in the political, economic, social and cultural spheres.

<p>and the scaling-up of humanitarian activities by various organizations. Despite 
improvements in some basic services, local authorities are struggling to meet the needs of 
all returnees, particularly in the south.38  
</p>
<p>48. While significant returns were observed in the south, most IDPs in the north are still 
reluctant to return home. To date, only about 10 per cent of registered IDPs in the north 
have done so. According to the International Organization for Migration, approximately 
293,000 people remained displaced in Sa&#8217;ada, Hajjah, Amran, Dhamar, Al-Jawf and Sana&#8217;a 
as of May 2013. Over 95 per cent of them lived with host communities or in informal 
settlements. Most IDPs cite security concerns, damaged homes and infrastructure, lack of 
basic services and disruption to livelihoods as the main obstacles to return. Others, who 
were involved in political activity, fear possible persecution by groups that control parts of 
northern Yemen.39  
</p>
<p>49. On 25 June 2013, the Government approved a national policy to address internal 
displacement. The policy, which was developed by the Executive Unit for Internally 
Displaced Persons in cooperation with the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), through extensive consultations with all 
stakeholders, including IDPs, includes three strategic objectives: prepare for new 
displacement and protect civilians from involuntary displacement; protect and assist IDPs 
and displacement-affected communities; and create conditions for durable solutions. The 
adoption of the policy will be followed by the creation of a special committee led by the 
Prime Minister.  
</p>
<p>50. According to data provided by UNHCR, as of 30 April 2013, the number of refugees 
was 242,000. As compared to 2012, fewer migrants are arriving in Yemen. However, 
migrants continue to face exploitation, physical and sexual abuse. Of particular concern are 
reports of increased human trafficking, including of children, reportedly organized by a 
network composed of Yemenis, including tribal leaders and officials, as well as nationals of 
neighbouring countries, who subject migrants, including refugees, to gross human rights 
violations such as torture, sexual violence and slavery.40 
</p>
<p><b> H. Cooperation with OHCHR 
</b></p>
<p>51. In its resolution 21/22, the Council requested the High Commissioner to provide 
technical assistance and to work with the Government of Yemen, as needed, to identify 
additional areas of assistance to enable Yemen to fulfil its human rights obligations. On 26 
September 2012, OHCHR and the Government of Yemen signed the Host Country 
Agreement formally establishing an OHCHR field presence in Yemen.  
</p>
<p>52. OHCHR-Yemen has, inter alia, provided technical assistance and inputs related to 
the draft laws on transitional justice. OHCHR-Yemen has also worked with the Ministries 
of Human Rights and of Legal Affairs to advocate for the establishment of a national 
commission of inquiry to investigate the human rights violations that took place during the 
events of 2011 and provided detailed comments on the draft decree establishing this 
commission. Most of the comments were accommodated in the decree issued.

 Ibid. Since early April 2013, Yemeni military forces raided the borders between Saudi Arabia and 
</p>
<p>Yemen targeting smugglers&#8217; camps in Yemen and resulting in the mass release of Ethiopian migrants. 
UNICEF and partner organizations, who were able to rescue and register 347 children (334 boys, 13 
girls), have expressed their concerns that the actual figure of migrant children and victims of child 
trafficking could be higher. </p>


<p>53. OHCHR-Yemen has also provided technical assistance to relevant Government 
institutions and civil society organizations on reports to United Nations treaty bodies and 
UPR submissions, and it held workshops for a number of national partners, including the 
NDC Working Group on Rights and Freedoms.41 
</p>
<p>54. The draft law on the establishment of the national human rights institution was 
developed by a technical committee led by the Ministry of Human Rights and composed of 
Government officials, quasi-governmental organizations42 and civil society organizations.  
Several consultations with civil society organizations, academics, lawyers, political parties, 
Government officials and Parliamentarians have been organized since November 2012 
throughout the country, with support from OHCHR and the United Nations Development 
Programme. At the time of writing the present report, the technical committee is finalizing 
the draft law on the basis of the comments received. It is expected that the draft law will be 
submitted to the Ministerial Committee in September 2013.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The High Commissioner welcomes progress achieved to strengthen promotion 
and protection of human rights in Yemen, mindful of the significant security, political, 
and humanitarian challenges faced by the country. In line with her previous 
recommendations and based on the observations of her Office in Yemen, the High 
Commissioner:  
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Welcomes the National Dialogue Conference and the inclusion within its 
agenda of issues pertaining to human rights. It notes with appreciation the efforts 
undertaken to ensure the inclusiveness of the process as well as the decision to 
mainstream the concerns of women, children and marginalized communities 
throughout the works of NDC;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Commends the Cabinet decisions to ratify the International Convention 
for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and to ensure the 
accession of Yemen to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. OHCHR 
encourages their swift adoption by the Parliament;  
</b></p>
<p> <b>(c)</b> <b>Notes the establishment of the Commission to Consider and Address 
Land Issues and the Commission on Forcibly Dismissed Employees for Southern 
Yemen as a demonstration of the Government&#8217;s commitment to addressing long-
standing grievances and to create confidence;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Notes the active cooperation of the Government with OHCHR, the steps 
taken towards the establishment of an independent human rights institution, 
including the numerous consultations organized with relevant Government agencies, 
civil society organizations and other pertinent institutions; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Regrets that, since September 2012, the Government has not reached a 
consensus over the appointments of commissioners for the national commission of 
inquiry into allegations of human rights violations that occurred in 2011. This delay 
hampers the credibility of any investigations and points to a lack of solid commitment 
by the Government towards redress and justice for victims of past human rights

<p><b>abuses. Similarly, OHCHR regrets that no decision has been taken on the Law on 
Transitional Justice and National Reconciliation;</b> <b> 
 (f) Notes with concern the continued detention of individuals arrested in 
connection with the 2011 events, despite formal commitments towards their release. It 
also notes the frequent practice of prolonged detention without trial or without proper 
arrest warrants and documentation. OHCHR is further concerned that peaceful 
protests, particularly in southern Yemen, are often suppressed, at times with force, 
with reported arrests, injuries or deaths of protesters. 
</b>56.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that the Government of Yemen take the 
following measures, some of them reiterated from her previous reports: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Expedite the establishment of the national commission of inquiry by 
naming its members and providing it with all facilities to carry out its task;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (b)  Repeal Amnesty Law No. 1/12 and comply with international human 
rights law prohibiting immunity for those responsible for serious human rights 
violations, including war crimes and crimes against humanity; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (c)  Withdraw the draft Law on Transitional Justice and National 
Reconciliation submitted by the President to Parliament in January 2013, and submit 
a revised draft that is in conformity with international standards and good practices; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d)  Release all individuals imprisoned for their participation in the 2011 
events and, according to due process and fair trial standards, verify the names of 
missing persons and inform their families of their whereabouts;  
</b></p>
<p><b> (e) Ensure that prompt, independent and effective investigations are 
conducted in relation to allegations of the excessive use of force in the context of 
demonstrations, in particular in cases resulting in the death of individuals; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f)  Ensure that women&#8217;s participation and women&#8217;s rights are taken into 
due consideration in the Constitution drafting process that will follow NDC; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (g)  Establish a moratorium on the use of the death penalty pursuant to 
moratorium resolutions of the General Assembly. Until then, the Government should 
ensure scrupulous respect of due process-related rights, including fair trial guarantees 
in cases involving the death penalty, and ensure that the death penalty is not applied 
to minors; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (h) Ensure that the counter-terrorism policies and strategies comply fully 
with international law, including human rights law. In this regard, ensure that any use 
of lethal force, including through the use of armed drones, complies fully with 
relevant international law, including the obligations of Yemen under international 
human rights law. Where violations of the law occur, conduct independent, impartial, 
prompt and effective investigations, and provide victims with an effective remedy. 
</b></p>
<p>57.<b> The High Commissioner recommends that the international community: 
</b></p>
<p><b> (a) Encourage prompt, independent and impartial investigations into 
serious human rights violations that have resulted in loss of life and/or serious injury. 
Once they have been conducted, extend the necessary and appropriate support to the 
Government of Yemen in order to ensure accountability and appropriate remedy for 
any violations of the law; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Provide all necessary financial and technical support for the 
Government&#8217;s transitional plan, in particular with regard to those aspects concerning 
the restoration of the rule of law, the consolidation of human rights protection 
mechanisms and programmes, and the promotion of human rights; </b></p>
