<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Human Rights Council, in its resolution 6/13, preserved the Social Forum as a 
space for dialogue between the representatives of Member States and civil society, 
including grass-roots and intergovernmental organizations, on issues linked with the 
promotion of the enjoyment of all human rights by all.1 
</p><p>2. In accordance with resolution 24/25 of the Council, the Social Forum was held in 
Geneva from 1 to 3 April 2014 and considered &#8220;the rights of older persons, including best 
practices in this regard&#8221;. The President of the Council appointed M&#243;nica Roqu&#233;, National 
Policy Director on Older Persons at the Ministry of Social Development of Argentina, the 
Chairperson-Rapporteur of the 2014 Social Forum. 
</p>
<p>3. The programme of work2 for the Social Forum had been prepared with guidance 
from the Chairperson-Rapporteur and input from Member States and other relevant 
stakeholders. Background reports, made available by the Office of the High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (OHCHR) pursuant to paragraph 8 of Council resolution 24/25, informed 
the discussions.3 The present report contains a summary of the proceedings, and its 
conclusions and recommendations.  
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening of the Social Forum 
</b>4. In her opening remarks, the Chairperson-Rapporteur observed that humanity faced 
unprecedented changes as ageing populations produced both new challenges and 
opportunities.4 She called for action to protect older persons from poverty, marginalization, 
discrimination, inadequate access to health and social services, negative stereotypes, abuse, 
maltreatment, and other threats to their well-being and autonomy. Noting that population 
ageing trends would continue to accelerate, she recommended immediate action to respect, 
protect and fulfil the human rights of older persons. Here, she noted with approval the 
appointment by the Human Rights Council of an Independent Expert on the enjoyment of 
all human rights by older persons, while calling for further action to develop and implement 
a binding treaty on the rights of older persons. 
</p>
<p>5. Navi Pillay, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, delivered 
opening remarks. She observed that the ongoing demographic transformation throughout 
the world would result in older persons outnumbering children by 2050. Older persons were 
often subjected to abuse, discrimination, neglect, exclusion and other violations of human 
rights. Noting the absence of an explicit prohibition of age discrimination and other specific 
forms of protection for older persons in international human rights law, the High 
Commissioner called for the articulation of clear and coherent standards on their human 
rights through the drafting of a dedicated instrument. She encouraged participants to 
actively engage in dialogue on that issue and to support the future work of the Human 
Rights Council, the new Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human rights by older 
persons (Independent Expert), and the Open-ended Working Group on Ageing for the 
</p>

<p>purpose of strengthening the protection of the human rights of older persons (the Open-
ended Working Group on the Human Rights of Older Persons (the Working Group)). 
</p><p>6. Baudelaire Ndong Ella, President of the Human Rights Council, commended the 
Social Forum as a subsidiary body of the Council that served as a think tank and permitted 
interactive dialogue on complex and salient issues affecting the full enjoyment of human 
rights. The implications of population ageing were only beginning to be addressed. Mr. Ella 
stressed the need to remove legal and social obstacles to the realization of the rights of 
older persons and noted the efforts of the General Assembly and the Human Rights Council 
to address that subject by respectively establishing the Working Group and an Independent 
Expert. He hoped that the Forum would produce concrete recommendations for action and 
provide a platform for an exchange of views on challenges, opportunities and best practices 
on the realization of the rights of older persons. 
</p>
<p>7. During the general statements segment, representatives of Age International, 
Coordinaci&#243;n Regional de Organismos de la Sociedad Civil de Am&#233;rica Latina y el Caribe 
sobre Envejecimiento y Vejez (CORV), Autistic Minority International, the International 
Coordinating Committee of National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights, the Global Alliance for the Rights of Older People, South Africa, Older 
Women&#8217;s Network Europe, Argentina, the International Longevity Centre Global Alliance 
(ILC GA) the International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA), Slovenia, 
the Council of Europe, International-Lawyers.Org, Ecuador, Venezuela, Brazil, Ligue 
Marocaine pour la Citoyennet&#233; et les Droits de l&#8217;Homme (Ligue Marocaine) and the Red 
Cross of Serbia took the floor. Speakers emphasized the growing challenges posed by 
population ageing, and called for immediate action to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of 
older persons. They welcomed the establishment of the new mandate and supported the 
drafting of a dedicated international instrument on the rights of older persons. Participants 
recommended further research and monitoring of the situation of older persons, including 
through disaggregated data collection and empowerment of national human rights 
institutions. They stressed the need to promote the participation of older persons in society 
and prohibit age discrimination, expressing particular concern about multiple 
discrimination. 
</p>
<p>8. Several speakers shared examples of best practices. For example, regional groups of 
States had adopted, or were debating, instruments to protect the rights of older persons and 
prohibit age discrimination. Some States had drafted similar national legislation and 
implemented universal social protection schemes for older persons. Speakers supported the 
participation of older persons as valued independent members of society, and not merely as 
recipients of social welfare programmes. They called for a productive exchange of ideas 
that would yield concrete, action-oriented recommendations for the consideration of States 
and the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Summary of proceedings 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. The human rights of older persons: Challenges, opportunities, gaps and 
promise 
</b></p>
<p>9. Craig Mokhiber, Chief of the Development and Economic and Social Issues Branch 
of OHCHR, stated that normative gaps on the rights of older persons led to gaps in 
implementation of those rights. Noting that existing laws and policies at all levels failed to 
address multiple human rights concerns related to older persons, including age 
discrimination, he called for urgent action to address those normative gaps and prevent the 
continuing violations of older persons&#8217; rights. In the context of ageing populations, the </p>


<p>economic crisis and changing societal values, it was essential to address the fragmented and 
unsystematic character of the limited existing references to the human rights of older 
persons (such as in the Convention on Migrant Workers, the Convention on the Elimination 
of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of 
Persons with Disabilities, by creating a binding, universal, international instrument on the 
rights of older persons. Such a treaty should permit legal planning, promote equality before 
the law, prohibit elder abuse, facilitate the participation of, and promote respect for, older 
persons in society, and serve as an instrument for accountability, monitoring, data 
collection and reporting.  
</p>
<p>10. Leyla Alyanak, Deputy Director of the Geneva Office of the United Nations 
Population Fund, stated that population ageing was a modern reality that reflected 
development successes and presented unique challenges, particularly for older women, who 
outnumbered older men and often faced greater hardship. Population ageing, particularly in 
developing countries, demanded immediate action, and the rights of older persons must not 
be neglected in the post-2015 development agenda. Action would require working with 
governments, supporting research and data collection, and measures to protect older 
persons&#8217; rights. Ms. Alyanak suggested that those efforts should focus on three key areas: 
(a) income security, training, and employment for all, (b) widespread participation by all, 
including the aged and (c) affirmative measures and instruments to address ageing. In a 
more equitable world, older persons could live in happiness and dignity. 
</p>
<p>11. Isabel Ortiz, Director of the Social Security Department of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), reported that the global financial crisis had had substantial negative 
impacts on the rights of older persons, including through changes to employment status and 
income, pension reforms, lower remittances, increased costs of basic necessities, reduced 
access to credit, loss of savings, and decreased government spending. That situation was 
exacerbated because only about 50 per cent of persons worldwide had access to pensions. 
Coverage was lowest in Africa and the Middle East. The main sources of income for older 
persons&#8217; work and pensions were both under threat. In 131 countries public expenditures 
were being contracted in moves that often had significant impacts on older persons. Pension 
reforms currently taking place in 86 countries were one clear-cut example. The social and 
economic crisis involved individuals, particularly older persons, paying the cost of bailing 
out the financial sector. Ms. Ortiz called for an immediate reversal through implementation 
of the ILO recommendation on social protection floors. A large number of developing 
countries were expanding pension systems in spite of substantial challenges. Ms. Ortiz 
proposed the adoption of a post-2015 target based on the number of persons of retirement 
age receiving an adequate pension. 
</p>
<p>12. In a video address, Dirk Jaspers, Director of the Latin American and Caribbean 
Demographic Centre, Population Division of the Economic Commission for Latin America 
and the Caribbean, stated that there had been substantial progress in several countries in the 
Latin American region towards the realization of the rights of older persons. He argued that 
development, growth and well-being required the explicit inclusion of older persons and 
pointed to recent progress throughout the United Nations system. Although the work of the 
Organization of American States to prepare a draft Inter-American Convention on the rights 
of older persons and the increased visibility of older persons&#8217; issues more generally 
represented positive developments, Mr. Jaspers decried the continuing difficulty faced by 
the international community in moving from words to actions to protect the rights of older 
persons. He called for the adoption of an international treaty on the rights of older persons. 
</p>
<p>13. In the interactive dialogue, representatives of Care Rights, INPEA, the Grupo 
Interinstitucional sobre Envejecimiento y Derechos, Argentina and International-
Lawyers.Org called for the elimination of gaps in the rights-protection framework for older 
persons, the extension of health care and social protection to older persons in migrant and </p>


<p>minority communities, the adoption of a social protection floor, and the drafting and 
implementation of a treaty on the rights of older persons. Participants asserted that 
measures to implement the social protection floor were feasible in all States and should not 
be rejected for economic reasons. They pointed to the need to re-examine neoliberal 
policies, pension systems, workforce discrimination, and the effects of the global financial 
crisis. 
</p>
<p>14. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Ortiz argued that older persons should not be seen as 
a burden and that pensions represented a right rather than a cost. She called for attention to 
growing inequalities and social debts, noting that policymakers had an obligation to create 
viable alternatives to dysfunctional systems and put people at the centre of development. 
Ms. Alyanak compared the movement for the rights of older persons to the world AIDS 
campaign, noting that, by standing together for their rights, older persons could drive 
change. Mr. Mokhiber emphasized the importance of eliminating age discrimination in 
employment decisions. He stated that obstacles to the adoption of a convention on the rights 
of older persons could and should be overcome and called for a redeployment of existing 
resources toward the realization of the human rights of older persons. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Ageism and age discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>15. Bridget Sleap, Senior Rights Policy Adviser at HelpAge International, stated that 
discrimination against older persons occurred in all aspects of life, was universally 
prevalent and took many forms. It could be compounded by other forms of discrimination 
based on gender or other status. For example, older women might be denied access to 
sexual reproductive services or employment because of their age or appearance. Ms. Sleap 
highlighted the need for an explicit prohibition of age discrimination, noting the absence of 
such a prohibition from human rights treaties, apart from the Convention on the Rights of 
Migrant Workers. Filling that gap would ensure that Member States properly addressed age 
discrimination, which was at present only infrequently addressed by States, during the first 
cycle of universal periodic reviews or during treaty body reviews of periodic reports. A new 
treaty that specifically covered older persons could correct that oversight.  
</p>
<p>16. David Obot, Chairman of the Uganda Reach the Aged Association, discussed the 
situation of older persons in Uganda. Younger people were leaving rural areas to look for 
employment in urban areas, leaving behind older family members. The HIV and AIDS 
epidemic had also killed thousands of people, placing an extra burden upon older persons, 
who often cared for the children of deceased or sick parents. Although Uganda had worked 
to improve protection of older persons, implementation and enforcement of existing laws 
had been lacking. Consequently, older persons might suffer from serious rights violations 
including rape, loss of property (particularly land), physical violence and inadequate access 
to health care. Those problems were worsened by conflicts such as that in Northern 
Uganda. Inadequate human rights protection, insufficient financial resources, and the lack 
of participation of older persons in development planning also affected the aged. Mr. Obot 
advocated an international legally binding instrument on older persons, improved 
legislation and policies at the national level, the sharing of experiences at the regional level, 
compliance monitoring, the strengthening of national human rights institutions and 
improved access to justice. 
</p><p>17. Jorge Plano, a member of the Executive Board of CORV, stated that age 
discrimination was the last socially accepted form of discrimination. He defined such 
discrimination as the process of systematic stereotyping of people because they were old. 
Common misconceptions about older persons included the beliefs that they were mentally 
impaired, diseased, unproductive, asexual, anti-technology, waiting to die, childish, 
inflexible and a burden upon their families. Referring to the European Commission&#8217;s 2012 </p>


<p>report on discrimination in the European Union, he highlighted that 45 per cent of survey 
participants believed that being 55 years and older would result in discrimination. Research 
in the United Kingdom demonstrated discrimination against older persons in policies and 
practices, including in the health sector. Mr. Plano viewed discrimination as the 
fundamental obstacle to improving the lives of the aged. He voiced support for a legally 
binding international instrument on the rights of older persons. 
</p>
<p>18. In the interactive dialogue, representatives of CORV, China, the International 
Longevity Centre Global Alliance, INPEA and AIDE-F&#233;d&#233;ration took the floor. Speakers 
discussed the potential of new technologies and communication tools to combat age 
discrimination. The role of the State and the importance of employment, anti-discrimination 
legislation and data collection were also discussed.  
</p>
<p>19. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Sleap stated that low literacy levels could make it 
difficult for elderly persons to access information and that poverty was often a root cause of 
problems for older persons. Mr. Obot highlighted the importance of civil society and faith-
based organizations in addressing age discrimination and the role of education in enabling 
older persons&#8217; political involvement, employment and entrepreneurism. Mr. Plano agreed 
that education was critical for addressing age discrimination and that digital accessibility 
was also essential.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Older persons and the right to health 
</b></p>
<p>20. John Beard, Director of the Department of Ageing and Life Course with the World 
Health Organization (WHO), stated that people were living longer than ever before and 
straining health-care systems. He encouraged relevant stakeholders to make the human 
rights case to encourage governments to improve public health. States must move past 
knee-jerk reactions and make considered policy choices that accounted for individual 
circumstances. Mr. Beard called for a rights-based approach to ageing based on capabilities 
and the elimination of enforced retirement. It should focus on good health, which entailed 
physical, cognitive and emotional well-being, financial security, education, social relations 
and social attitudes. Mr. Beard suggested a coordinated response to ageing to maximize 
resources and described efforts by WHO to promote that approach. 
</p>
<p>21. Astrid Stuckelberger, a lecturer at the Institute of Global Health at the University of 
Geneva, observed that the global population was growing, particularly in developing 
countries. She decried the inadequate attention and resources dedicated to the issue of 
ageing by the United Nations and Member States, calling for a change in societal attitudes 
towards ageing and the refutation of common misconceptions about older persons. She 
advocated the use of science to help older persons and urged OHCHR to lead on older 
persons&#8217; issues, including at upcoming United Nations conferences. 
</p>
<p>22. Sooyoun Han, a founding member of Care Rights, described difficulties in caring for 
older persons and in their end-of-life care and decision-making in the Republic of Korea, 
including challenges faced by returning migrants. The Korean Government was taking 
action, including through financial assistance for end-of-life care. However, there was no 
specific health legislation in place and returning migrants were not eligible for that benefit. 
Ms. Han called for the adoption of a new international instrument to spur government 
action to protect and provide for older migrants and their family caregivers&#8217; rights to 
information on end-of-life care and decision-making. 
</p>
<p>23. Abdulaziz Zguiouar, a representative of AIDE-F&#233;d&#233;ration, described changing 
demographics in Morocco over the past 50 years. Despite a population ageing trend, older 
persons&#8217; issues had been generally overlooked in social policies and Morocco had only 
recently begun to take specific measures. Those included the extension of health coverage </p>


<p>to persons with low income, measures to ensure the affordability of medicines, and the 
creation of social assistance units by the Ministry of Health. However, public policies still 
needed to be adapted to the specific health issues linked with ageing. For example, growing 
life expectancies also involved increased morbidity rates, particularly given the prevalence 
of poverty among older persons. 
</p>
<p>24. In the interactive dialogue, representatives of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease International, 
World Network of Users and Survivors of Psychiatry, AGE Platform Europe, Age 
International and Argentina raised various issues regarding the health of older persons 
including dementia and mental illness, neglect and abuse including torture and degrading 
treatment. Speakers called for an international instrument to address those issues and for 
measures to improve the treatment of older persons. They noted that during times of 
conflict and economic crisis older persons were disproportionately impacted and might be 
unable to afford health care or health insurance. They highlighted the need for 
comprehensive measures to promote the health of older persons, including through 
continuing education and employment. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Older persons and the rights to social security and to work 
</b></p>
<p>25. Emmanuelle St-Pierre Guilbault, a legal specialist in the Social Protection 
Department at the International Labour Organization, discussed the right of older persons to 
work and their rights at work. The rights to work and social security were formulated in 
general terms in human rights instruments and did not address the specific situation of older 
persons. ILO standards defining the content of social security for all population groups 
addressed some older persons&#8217; issues, taking into account best practices at the country 
level. ILO social security standards addressed the rights of older persons at work, social 
security and an adequate standard of living. Recommendation No. 162 (1980) concerning 
Older Workers specifically addressed older workers, pensions and age discrimination. 
Social Security (Minimum Standards) Convention No. 102 (1952) defined social security 
benefits that people should have throughout their lives, including in old age, in the event of 
disability or for other contingencies. Recommendation No. 202 (2012) concerning National 
Floors of Social Protection called for social protection floors and health-care coverage to 
keep people out of poverty and ensure a life of dignity. Ms. Guilbault concluded by 
describing efforts at the most recent international labour conference to address employment 
in the new demographic context which had resulted in a call for a new research agenda and 
further standard-setting. 
</p>
<p>26. Odile Frank, a representative of the Global Coalition for Social Protection Floors, 
described the efforts of that coalition of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and trade 
unions to promote social protection floors worldwide. Of the world population, 80 per cent 
was living in income insecurity. That situation had seriously worsened as a result of the 
economic and financial crisis. The concept of social protection floors had been made 
explicit in the United Nations system and had broad support, including from the Bretton 
Woods institutions, ILO and the human rights community. Social protection floors included 
universal access to essential health care and basic income security for children and in cases 
of maternity, unemployment, sickness and disability, and for older persons. Ms. Frank 
called for States to take a comprehensive approach to social security systems that would 
contribute to social justice and the enjoyment of human rights. 
</p><p>27. Marlene M&#225;rquez Herrera, a member of the executive board of CORV, commended 
the academic work on social protection floors but stressed the importance of including the 
perspectives of older persons themselves in the development of international plans to 
address ageing. She called for an increased focus on social security as a fundamental human 
right and a reconceptualization of how societies viewed ageing and older persons. She </p>


<p>highlighted the need to re-evaluate retirement ages, cope with increasing numbers of 
persons with dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, address the uneven gender distribution of 
care burdens and improve the quality of care. There could be no limitations placed on 
human dignity, which necessitated integral social security without restrictions. 
Ms. M&#225;rquez Herrera appealed to States to redistribute resources so that everyone was 
guaranteed a life of dignity in their old age. 
</p>
<p>28. Maryam Al-Ansari, director of the Research and Development Department of the 
Qatar Foundation for Elderly People Care, discussed the efforts of Qatar to promote the 
rights of older persons at the national and international levels. The national Constitution 
protected older persons and discrimination against them was prohibited. The State provided 
a dignified life for older persons, including through social housing and the guarantee of a 
basic income. A wide array of services including employment training and medical care 
was available to older persons. There was an extensive and evolving system of laws and 
policies designed to protect older persons and the Government engaged with regional and 
international mechanisms addressing older persons&#8217; issues. Ms. Al-Ansari anticipated that 
Qatar would remain at the forefront of developments in that regard.  
</p><p>29. In the interactive dialogue, representatives of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease International 
(ADI), Venezuela and CORV discussed pension reforms to protect older persons&#8217; rights. 
Speakers also emphasized the importance of social protection floors, and the challenges 
faced by migrants and persons suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. They called for a multi-
track pension system that would permit and promote individual retirement plans while also 
guaranteeing access by all, regardless of contributions, to the bare necessities for a life of 
dignity. 
</p>
<p>30. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Al-Ansari called on States to respect the rights of 
older persons and to provide for them. Ms. M&#225;rquez Herrera emphasized the complexity of 
social security, its importance and the need to prevent interference from political and 
economic interests with the rights of all persons to live with dignity. Ms. Frank advocated 
improved monitoring and implementation of ILO conventions on social security. She noted 
that, in addition to representing a moral and legal obligation, the social protection floor 
would have economic benefits in most States. Ms. Guilbault called for a binding instrument 
on the implementation of social security standards. Although current ILO recommendations 
were not binding, widespread support for them indicated their normative character. ILO 
recommendations also called for the equal treatment of migrants.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Violence, neglect and abuse against older persons 
</b></p>
<p>31. Viviane Brunne, from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
(UNECE) Population Unit, whose main focus was on population ageing, discussed the 
work of UNECE on violence, neglect and abuse of older persons, including its policy 
briefs. She spoke of physical, psychological, sexual, financial and material abuse, neglect 
and self-neglect. Older persons and their caregivers might be susceptible to certain risk 
factors which must be mitigated. Older persons became more susceptible if they lived 
alone, were dependent on one family member for care, or had a limited social network. 
Ms. Brunne called on States to ensure a better quality of life for older persons. She 
described good practices, including the promotion of intergenerational programmes, the use 
of volunteer networks to report abuse, and the monitoring, vetting and training of care 
providers. She advocated a client-centred approach to older persons&#8217; care that was sensitive 
to language, culture, ethnicity and religion, promoted better evaluation of interventions, and 
was based on relevant data.  
</p>
<p>32. Svetlana Bashtovenko, president of the Resource Centre for the Elderly, gave a 
presentation on the situation of older persons in Kyrgyzstan, where older persons </p>


<p>constituted more than 9 per cent of the population. Roughly 40 per cent of older persons in 
Kyrgyzstan received pensions, some of which were insufficient to satisfy their subsistence 
needs. That rendered them vulnerable, a problem compounded by discrimination. There had 
been no State surveys of domestic violence against older persons, but NGOs had identified 
substantial problems not reflected in government statistics. Analysis by the Resource 
Centre showed that violence against older persons was prevalent, and that most did not 
know their rights. Older persons, particularly those living in remote, rural areas, also had 
limited recourse. The abuse of older persons could take many forms (sexual, physical, 
economic and psychological), women&#8217;s limited access to land and property could 
exacerbate abuses, societal norms and shame hinder the reporting of and action against 
elder abuse, and problems with substance abuse, unemployment, availability of housing, 
and limited State capacity all further compound the challenges. Ms. Bashtovenko called for 
increased scrutiny of the problem, improved training of health-care specialists, law 
enforcement and State agencies, human rights education, and new prevention centres. 
</p>
<p>33. Silvia Perel-Levin, a representative of INPEA and ILC GA, emphasized the need to 
define elder abuse within the wider contexts of violence, cultural norms, sexism and 
ageism. Violence against older women was often the culmination of lifelong abuse and 
demanded greater attention to the circumstances of older women. Practices such as 
witchcraft accusations and forced remarriages which were used to dispossess women of 
their land and property must be stopped. Ms. Perel-Levin called for a holistic human rights 
approach, noting that society was responsible for the problem and must provide the 
solution. She recommended improved screening of, and monitoring by, health-care 
professionals, social workers and law enforcement, better data collection, and the creation 
of a United Nations dedicated mechanism similar to the Special Representative of the 
Secretary General on Violence against Children to promote United Nations interagency 
collaboration on those issues. 
</p>
<p>34. In the ensuing discussion, representatives of ADI, AGE Platform Europe, CORV, 
and the Red Cross of Serbia and of Switzerland discussed the problem of neglect, violence 
and abuse against older persons. They emphasized the need to address the structural causes 
of those issues (i.e. poverty, gender and age discrimination, societal norms, and inadequate 
health care among others). For older persons with dementia, problems were exacerbated. 
Speakers called for improved analysis of violence, neglect and abuse against older persons 
through a more systematic international approach to data collection and monitoring. They 
also insisted on the importance of participation by older persons in addressing those issues. 
</p>
<p>35. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Perel-Levin agreed that addressing structural and 
societal forms of violence was a top priority. Referring to a Swiss study on the subject, she 
called for greater participation of older persons in policymaking. Ms. Brunne called for 
improved standards across the 56 UNECE member States.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Older persons, autonomy and independent life 
</b></p>
<p>36. Nena Georgantzi, Legal Officer at AGE Platform Europe, explained through 
examples that societies and legal and social protection systems perceived declining abilities 
and dependence as the inevitable destiny of old age and restricted the autonomy of older 
persons. Informal restrictions based on stereotypes could also pose difficulties to 
maintaining autonomy as, for example, when older persons were not able to express wishes 
or were dependent upon the schedules and routines of carers. Maintaining the independence 
of older persons was about crafting inclusive solutions to permit them to contribute to 
society and maintain their independence, including during times of economic difficulty. 
Ms. Georgantzi stressed that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities did </p>


<p>not have a specific consciousness of ageism and called for a new framework to address 
discrimination against older persons. 
</p>
<p>37. Raymond Jessurun, representing ADI, the Central Latinoamericana y del Caribe de 
Trabajadores Jubilados, Pensionados y Adultos Mayores (CLATJUPAM) and CORV, 
described efforts to realize older persons&#8217; rights and promote their autonomy as part of an 
ongoing process that included efforts to draft an Inter-American Convention on the right to 
live independently and with autonomy. In the Caribbean, the population of older persons 
was growing and many lacked the necessities for subsistence. That problem was 
compounded by discrimination, which could be particularly problematic in the Caribbean, 
due to differing treatment for older persons of different nationalities or citizenship status. 
The lack of social insurance schemes and pensions, particularly for persons who worked in 
the informal sector, caused further difficulties, as did the disparate quality of health care 
depending on nationality and residence, particularly for older persons suffering from 
dementia. Mr. Jessurun advocated implementation of the United Nations principles for 
older persons, measures to ensure social inclusion, the adoption of a legally binding 
instrument on the rights of older persons and equality. 
</p>
<p>38. Susan Somers, Secretary General and Team Leader of INPEA activities at the 
United Nations, criticized many current social welfare systems and adult protective services 
as being based on outdated English poor laws that failed to adequately address 
contemporary issues. She discussed the difficulty of balancing autonomy and independence 
with legitimate safety and health concerns for some older persons who were at high risk of 
domestic violence, neglect, and/or self-inflicted harm. The fact that many violent deaths 
(over 3,000 a month) were suicides raised the question of when and how society should 
intervene to protect older persons. Ms. Somers supported further consideration of that issue 
in connection with principles of autonomy, independence and self-determination, including 
the potential implications of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 
</p>
<p>39. In the interactive dialogue, representatives of CORV, AIDE-F&#233;d&#233;ration, Care Rights 
and International-Lawyers.Org discussed the issue of continuing autonomy in old age. It 
was suggested that the concept of equal judicial capacity found in the Convention could be 
extended to older persons. The support system to facilitate decision-making regarding the 
capacity of older persons in Argentina, which included an appeals mechanism, was 
highlighted as one example of that approach. Speakers argued that personal assistants could 
contribute to continuing autonomy, called for intergenerational solidarity, emphasized 
contributions that older persons could make to society and discussed the importance of 
autonomy near the end of life, particularly for older women, often faced with multiple 
discrimination, especially in parts of Asia. The question was posed as to whether autonomy 
could be considered as a component of the right to life. 
</p>
<p>40. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Somers observed that there was much work to be 
done to empower older women in end-of-life decision-making in certain countries. Mr. 
Jessurun stated that the proposal to address autonomy in the drafting process of an Inter-
American instrument on the rights of older persons had been inspired by the Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. He emphasized however that poor people required a 
social protection floor to be free to make their own decisions and called for 
intergenerational solidarity. He also expressed concern that the Convention might grant too 
much power to trustees in the event of memory disabilities. Ms. Georgantzi stated that 
cultural assumptions often led to discrimination against older persons, which could affect 
how issues such as ageing, dementia and socio-economic status influenced their continuing 
independence.  </p>


<p><b> G. Long-term care 
</b></p>
<p>41. The Chairperson Rapporteur of the 2014 Social Forum, who served as moderator of 
the panel on long-term care, introduced the discussion with a presentation of the Argentine 
long-term care model. She discussed the difficulties of providing long-term care for older 
persons, noting that the care burden often fell largely upon women. She emphasized the 
importance of social pensions and universal public health care, which could reduce that 
burden. In Argentina, efforts had been made to move the care burden to the public sphere 
by providing unemployed persons with the necessary training to be caretakers. That 
addressed employment issues and allowed many older persons to remain in their homes. 
For those who could no longer live on their own, efforts had been made to develop 
appropriate care institutions. There, the informed consent of the person was critical, as was 
the proper monitoring, maintenance and care of the facility and its charges. Efforts had to 
be made to ensure that all older persons could age with dignity and, to the fullest extent 
possible, depending on their circumstances, with autonomy. 
</p>
<p>42. Erica Dhar, Senior Advisor for the AARP Office of International Affairs, discussed 
the analysis by AARP of the costs of caregiving for older persons in the United States. The 
study found that there were over 42 million family caregivers in the United States, whose 
paid work had been reduced, as a result of their obligations, by an average of 41 per cent, 
making their unpaid contributions worth around US$450 billion. Ms. Dhar noted that, with 
the population continuing to age, the unpaid care burden would rise. She cited the need to 
improve upon the Affordable Care Act and recent efforts in a number of states to further 
improve the social welfare system for long-term care and reduce the burden of unpaid care-
work. In order to finance long-term care and to ensure its adequacy, AARP advocated for, 
inter alia, improved affordability and access, choice of setting and provider, quality of life 
and quality of care, support for family caregivers, and effective transitions and organization 
of care. 
</p>
<p>43. Claudia Mahler, a senior researcher at the German Institute for Human Rights, 
discussed long-term care in Germany from a human rights perspective. Inhumane 
conditions had been prevalent in private homes, including lack of autonomy for older 
persons and instances of caregivers working daily 12-hour shifts. In 2001, the Committee 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights had expressed serious concern over those 
conditions and recommended urgent measures for improvement. The Institute had focused 
on those issues and produced a study in 2006 on the social human rights of older persons. 
Despite that, significant problems still persisted in the care of older persons, both in family 
care and in institutions. That was particularly true in the case of older persons with 
dementia. Ms. Mahler called for further public debate to promote a rights-based approach to 
long-term care that would permit all older persons a life of human dignity. 
</p>
<p>44. Maude Luherne, Policy and Project Officer at AGE Platform Europe, presented 
AGE Platform&#8217;s efforts to promote a rights-based approach to long-term care for older 
persons, including the European Charter of the rights and responsibilities of older people 
requiring assistance and long-term care. AGE Platform was a network of over 160 
organizations representing more than 30 million older persons. It supported a holistic 
approach to the health of older persons that encompassed prevention, rehabilitation and 
enablement, cure and care, including end-of-life care. In the European Union, approaches to 
long-term care were highly variable between countries but common problems related to 
inadequate coordination of health and social care, financial pressure, lack of support for 
family care-givers, quality of care and elder abuse. AGE Platform, in its European Quality 
Framework for long-term care services, called for a common analysis and vision to address 
those issues, increased participation by older persons in identifying needs and solutions, 
better coordination and exchange of information in order to improve long-term care 
systems in Europe and older persons&#8217; quality of life, and a rights-based approach to long-</p>


<p>term care based on principles for improved quality of service and priority areas for action 
set out in the WeDO project. 
</p><p>45. In the interactive dialogue, representatives of Care Rights, INPEA and the Older 
Women&#8217;s Network, Europe discussed long-term care and end-of-life decisions. Speakers 
raised the implications of migration for long-term care, the lack of adequate protections of 
older persons&#8217; rights, including legal protections of their independence and autonomy, 
inadequate or unaffordable long-term care solutions, and the absence of an explicit right to 
long-term care. They called for the establishment of a new instrument on the rights of older 
persons. One speaker noted that progress was also necessary at the national level, citing the 
example of stalled legislative reform to protect persons living in long-term private 
residential care homes in the United Kingdom under the national human rights act. 
</p>
<p>46. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Dhar emphasized the complexity of long-term care 
and called upon governments to increase financing. Ms. Mahler explained that, while the 
German Institute for Human Rights was aware of the need for culturally sensitive long-term 
care for migrants, the capacity to address those needs, particularly in the palliative care 
sector, was lacking. She emphasized that private care institutions were also subject to 
human rights responsibilities. Ms. Luherne claimed that end-of-life care was part of 
palliative care and referenced current work at the European level to integrate palliative care 
into all health-care systems. On quality of care concerns, she recommended that the 
European quality framework become the standard in all care settings, public and private. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Experiences and opportunities for bilateral cooperation on the rights of 
older persons 
</b></p>
<p>47. Ms. Bashtovenko, president of the Resource Centre for the Elderly, described the 
organization&#8217;s work to promote continuing independence and autonomy for older persons 
through cooperation with other organizations. The Resource Centre provided legal support, 
training, and information, and organized self-help groups to give medical and social support 
to older persons in Kyrgyzstan. It also lobbied at the local, national and international levels 
for policy changes, and participated in government working groups on policy issues 
affecting older persons. It was a member of a number of coalitions of NGOs, including the 
Age Net International network, which was active in 10 countries in the region. Age Net 
International held monthly coordination meetings, lobbied with State agencies, developed a 
culture of philanthropy, and provided humanitarian assistance to members. Among other 
successes, the network had successfully lobbied for a bill on social protection in 
Kyrgyzstan, which was currently being implemented. 
</p>
<p>48. Mr. Jessurun, representing ADI/CLATJUPAM/CORV, recounted 25 years of 
experience working on older persons&#8217; issues through grass-roots organizations in Latin 
America, first at the national level, and then in an international coalition. Following the 
Madrid Action Plan, the coalition aimed to realize all human rights of older persons by 
</p><p>2012. All organizations and national federations were autonomous, but coordination 
meetings allowed for sharing information and adopting common action plans. Through 
participation in intergovernmental meetings, the coalition successfully lobbied for a 
commitment from regional governments to protect the rights of older persons. It had 
developed a digital bulletin to reduce the costs of cooperation, and online forums to share 
experiences. Since 2012, the coalition had increasingly focused on international 
cooperation to share the experience of the Latin America and Caribbean region and provide 
input to United Nations processes that might lead to the development of a binding 
instrument on the rights of older persons. The coalition had also developed a regional 
strategy on dementia and planned to continue its advocacy in relevant forums. </p>


<p>49. David Obot, chairman of the Uganda Reach the Aged Association, described the 
work of his organization, including through international cooperation, to champion the 
realization and preservation of a dignified quality of life for older persons. The organization 
conducted participatory research, contributed to national policy development, campaigned 
for changes in policy and allocation of dedicated budget lines, supported projects, and 
contributed to joint NGO reports to United Nations treaty bodies. A 400-kilometre walk 
had been organized to raise awareness of older persons&#8217; issues and the organization trained 
paralegals to intervene to prevent the displacement of older persons from their land. It also 
cooperated with HelpAge International to improve access to donor funds. Ongoing 
challenges to those efforts included the lack of a binding international convention on the 
rights of older persons, inadequate awareness, persistent violations and the combination of 
high expectations and limited resources. Mr. Obot called for continued advocacy, evidence-
based research to improve and inform policy-making, and increased bilateral cooperation. 
</p>
<p>50. Abdelaziz Zguiouar, representative of AIDE-F&#233;d&#233;ration, described his organization 
as a humanitarian and development aid non-governmental organization, with a branch in 
Morocco since 1998. In Morocco, the organization had embarked on initiatives to promote 
the rights of older persons, in collaboration with government authorities. These included a 
home and care facility for 60 older persons near Rabat, and an observatory for the rights of 
older persons. The home and care centre project had been launched by the King of 
Morocco. 
</p>
<p>51. In the ensuing discussion, representatives of the Ligue Marocaine, the Association of 
World Citizens, AIDE-F&#233;d&#233;ration, and CORV addressed the important role of bilateral 
cooperation in strengthening the enjoyment of older persons&#8217; rights and how it could be 
further reinforced. One suggestion was to promote the participation of older persons and 
their representative organizations, including through improved access to digital technology. 
Another was to establish regional councils of older persons on every continent with special 
attention to migrants and other vulnerable groups. Widespread support had been voiced for 
an international convention to guarantee the rights of older persons. Speakers called for 
intergenerational solidarity, improved data collection to inform cooperative efforts and the 
use of national observatories to study relevant issues and share good practices. 
</p>
<p>52. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Bashtovenko highlighted the importance of 
improved cooperation and organization for older persons&#8217; rights at the local level and for 
the participation of older persons and civil society. She advocated improved access to 
funding through self-assistance networks and councils, which could develop proposals to 
promote cooperation with governments. Mr. Obot stated that collaboration must be global, 
with well-known organizations taking a lead role to ensure transparency and accountability. 
Mr. Jessurun observed that public meetings, marches and other activities could be used to 
increase awareness of older persons&#8217; rights and were particularly powerful when organized 
by coalitions that represented a broad spectrum of society. He reiterated the importance of 
intergenerational cooperation, citing the successful engagement of his organization with 
labour unions. Mr. Zguiouar stressed the need for everyone, including philosophers, 
researchers and doctors, to think about providing long-term care with dignity and 
intergenerational solidarity. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Experiences and opportunities for regional cooperation 
</b></p>
<p>53. Matthias Kloth, an administrator in the Directorate General of Human Rights and 
Rule of Law of the Council of Europe, discussed the recently adopted non-binding 
recommendation of the Council of Europe regarding older persons&#8217; rights. He called for the 
closing of the implementation gap on those issues, stressing that the new recommendation 
could constitute a step forward. The recommendation was grounded in the provisions of </p>


<p>binding instruments, such as the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms, and the European Social Charter. It stated general principles, while not including 
an exhaustive definition of &#8220;older persons&#8221;. It included chapters on non-discrimination, 
autonomy and participation in decision-making (including issues of legal capacity inspired 
by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities), protection from violence and 
abuse, social protection and employment, appropriate and affordable health care, and access 
to justice for older persons (including conditions of detention). States might participate in a 
voluntary follow-up process five years after adoption of the recommendation. 
</p>
<p>54. Jorge Plano, a member of the Executive Board of CORV, expressed his belief that 
strong governmental commitment to societal transformation in Latin America and the 
Caribbean combined with coordinated advocacy by civil society would lead to the eventual 
adoption of a binding regional instrument on the rights of older persons. The 2012 Santiago 
Civil Society Declaration stressed the role of civil society organizations in the region, and 
called for increased cooperation with governments. Other civil society and 
intergovernmental conferences on ageing had produced important outcomes, such as the 
Brasilia Charter and Declaration. Regional meetings included the participation of older 
persons, academics and NGOs. Civil society organizations had contributed by monitoring 
the situation of older persons, proposing changes in their treatment, and participating in 
intergovernmental processes at the Organization of American States. Mr. Plano advocated 
for the development of a universal, legally binding convention on the rights of older 
persons to promote a rights-based approach to public policies affecting them. Civil society 
and regional cooperation would be essential for the development of the convention. 
</p>
<p>55. Vitalija Gaucaite-Wittich, Chief of the Population Unit at UNECE, observed that 
UNECE included 56 countries (including all 47 members of the Council of Europe) in 
which one third of the global population of persons over 65 resided. UNECE therefore 
served as an important platform for sharing good practices on social policies, labour market 
participation and mobility of older persons, the growing base of older consumers, 
sustainability of pension systems, including through fiscal reform, long-term care and 
health provision, and documented and undocumented migrant care workers. Regionally, 
UNECE was in charge of the review and appraisal of the Madrid International Plan of 
Action on Ageing, and cooperated with the Council of Europe, inter alia. It also had 
national focal points on ageing, and monitored progress through its Working Group on 
Ageing, including tools such as the Active Ageing Index and longitudinal data of the 
Generations and Gender Programme. 
</p>
<p>56. In the interactive dialogue, representatives of the Ligue Marocaine, ADI, the 
German Institute for Human Rights, AGE Platform Europe, CORV, HelpAge International 
and the Association of World Citizens raised several issues, including the situation of older 
persons in Palestine, Syria and Iraq; how to move the discussion on a convention on the 
rights of older persons forward; the planned future work of UNECE on the rights of older 
persons, institutionalizing civil society participation in regional mechanisms, the draft 
protocol to the African Charter on the rights of older persons, and the situation of migrant 
workers upon retirement. 
</p>
<p>57. In his concluding remarks, Mr. Kloth stated that, beyond the adoption of a European 
non-binding instrument, there were discussions in the Latin American and African regions 
on binding instruments on the rights of older persons. The follow-up process to the Council 
of Europe recommendation on older persons would consist of State responses, which would 
be made public, but there was no mechanism for NGO participation. He suggested that 
NGOs advocate at the national level. Mr. Plano stated that, even if some regional initiatives 
were valuable, there was no equality between regions with regard to the realization of the 
rights of older persons. He called for a universal approach to older persons and the 
prohibition of age discrimination. Ms. Gaucaite-Wittich voiced the possibility that the </p>


<p>Council of Europe recommendation could provide inspiration for a draft convention but 
noted that some States did not support conventions aimed at specific target groups. She 
recalled that the UNECE Working Group on Ageing allowed NGOs to participate as 
observers and that UNECE closely cooperated with all relevant stakeholders in 
intergovernmental forums. 
</p>
<p><b> J. The universal human rights system: new opportunities for participation  
</b></p>
<p>58. Rosemary Lane, Senior Social Affairs Officer with the United Nations Department 
of Economic and Social Affairs and United Nations Focal Point on Ageing, discussed the 
work of the Open-ended Working Group on the Human Rights of Older Persons, which had 
been established by the General Assembly in its resolution 65/182 &#8220;to consider... the 
existing international framework of the human rights of older persons and identify... 
possible gaps and how best to address them&#8221;. The Working Group&#8217;s gap analysis had so far 
identified the following priority areas (a) discrimination and multiple discrimination, (b) 
enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health including access 
to palliative care, (c) violence and abuse, and (d) social protection and the right to social 
security. Ms. Lane noted that there remained disagreement among Member States about the 
need for and scope of a new convention to address those gaps but that the reception of the 
Working Group had been positive. While some Member States were not convinced of the 
need for a new instrument devoted to older persons and called for mainstreaming of 
relevant issues in existing human rights mechanisms, others were calling for a specific 
convention on the rights of older persons because few existing human rights instruments 
specifically mentioned older persons, and protection mechanisms for that group were 
fragmented and did not sufficiently address critical issues. They claimed that there was a 
need to improve the accountability of, and implementation efforts by, States, and that a new 
convention would reframe the perception of older persons by society. Widespread 
participation by all relevant stakeholders in the Working Group was essential. 
</p>
<p>59. Karim Ghezraoui, leader of the Groups and Accountability Section, Special 
Procedures Branch of OHCHR, discussed the work of the human rights treaty bodies and of 
the special procedures of the Human Rights Council on the rights of older persons, 
including the recent establishment of the Independent Expert on the enjoyment of all human 
rights by older persons. He noted that, while the Independent Expert would work 
specifically on the rights of older persons, other mandate-holders would continue to look at 
older persons through their own lenses (i.e. from the perspective of health or extreme 
poverty) and the treaty bodies would also remain engaged. The Independent Expert could 
help advance international standards on older persons and would aim to (a) assess existing 
laws, (b) investigate the views of stakeholders, and (c) take a gender/disability perspective. 
Mr. Ghezraoui concluded by referencing the new website for the Independent Expert and 
calling upon civil society to seize opportunities to raise older persons&#8217; issues in all relevant 
forums. 
</p>
<p>60. Bridget Sleap, Senior Rights Policy Adviser at HelpAge International, discussed 
human rights mechanisms and how they could be used by civil society organizations to 
address possible violations of the rights of older persons. She pointed out that the universal 
periodic review, the special procedures mechanism of the Human Rights Council and the 
human rights treaty bodies had not consistently addressed older persons&#8217; issues, leaving 
room for improvement. Ms. Sleap opined that existing mechanisms and texts were 
insufficient to fully protect older persons&#8217; rights and called for a new instrument. That 
would promote uniform standards on the rights of older persons throughout the world, 
addressing geographic disparities in the current enjoyment of those rights, and would allow 
for monitoring through a dedicated specialized body. Ms. Sleap called for further 
engagement by all relevant stakeholders on those issues. </p>


<p>61. Erica Dhar, Senior Advisor for the AARP Office of International Affairs, described 
the development and work of the Global Alliance for the Rights of Older People. The 
Alliance had been created to strengthen the rights and voices of older persons on a global 
scale. It represented the collaborative efforts of numerous organizations and advocated for a 
legally binding instrument to consolidate the rights of older persons in one instrument. It 
also coordinated advocacy efforts and educated older persons on their rights. The Alliance 
engaged with the Working Group and other relevant mechanisms to ensure that older 
persons&#8217; issues were addressed in the post-2015 development agenda, including the 
sustainable development agenda. 
</p>
<p>62. In the ensuing dialogue, representatives of the International Association of 
Gerontology and Geriatrics, the Conference of NGOs, the Law Association for Asia and the 
Pacific, the Ligue Marocaine, the Uganda Reach the Aged Association, ADI, Argentina, 
AIDE-F&#233;d&#233;ration, and International-Lawyers.Org considered ways to promote the human 
rights of older persons within the human rights system, including through the creation of a 
new instrument and engagement with existing mechanisms such as the Independent Expert 
and the universal periodic review. Speakers raised issues such as improving advocacy 
efforts on behalf of older persons, promoting evidence-based policymaking, establishing 
intergenerational solidarity, increasing the participation of older persons in relevant 
international forums, and addressing the impacts of conflict and climate change on the 
rights of older persons. Concerns were expressed regarding the necessity for action in Asia 
because of its rapidly ageing population. The need for more discussion between civil 
society organizations and States was emphasized. The Working Group was viewed as a 
potential platform for that engagement. 
</p>
<p>63. In her concluding remarks, Ms. Dhar noted that AARP was concerned about the 
effect of climate change on older persons and provided support through its Foundation for 
older persons affected by natural disasters. She welcomed the participation of youth to 
establish intergenerational solidarity, as on International Older Persons&#8217; Day and 
highlighted the role of civil society as a champion of older persons&#8217; rights. She observed 
that, increasingly, Member States were taking up that cause and encouraged States and 
NGOs to work together and across regions to build consensus. Mr. Ghezraoui stressed that 
there would be discussion on the human rights of older persons, prompted by the annual 
thematic report of the new mandate-holder and relevant country visits at each September 
session of the Human Rights Council. That offered the opportunity to raise specific issues, 
such as discriminatory practices, detected at the national level. Ms. Lane emphasized the 
need to improve the visibility of older persons&#8217; issues and the significant role that civil 
society must play in that regard. She described progress in some United Nations 
intergovernmental bodies through the intervention of Member States, for example on the 
situation of older women, and noted that most of the changes were fostered by pressure 
from civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Final observations from participants  
</b></p>
<p>64. <b>At the conclusion of the 2014 Social Forum, the Chairperson-Rapporteur 
opened the floor for any final interventions from participants. 
</b></p>
<p>65. <b>Ms. Sleap from HelpAge International delivered a joint final statement on 
behalf of a majority of the participating civil society organizations. The organizations 
emphasized the importance of addressing all forms of discrimination against older 
persons and improving the collection and analysis of data regarding their experiences. 
They highlighted that the 2014 Social Forum had reaffirmed the need for a new 
convention on the rights of older persons to address existing gaps in the human rights 
framework and rejected economic arguments for not protecting these rights. They </b></p>


<p><b>called on Member States to ensure that the Working Group on the Human Rights of 
Older Persons fulfilled its mandate and that the new Independent Expert of the 
Human Rights Council promoted and conducted substantive exploration of relevant 
issues. They called for widespread engagement with and participation by older 
persons in relevant forums and decision-making processes. 
</b></p>
<p>66. <b>InternationalLawyers.org requested that the widespread support for a treaty 
on the human rights of older persons and the need for recommendations of the Social 
Forum to receive serious consideration by the Human Rights Council be 
communicated in the report. They also called upon Member States to heed the 
progress on older persons&#8217; rights being made in regional bodies such as the Inter-
American Commission and the African system and to follow those examples at the 
global level. 
</b></p>
<p><b>IV.  Conclusions and recommendations 
</b>67. <b>The Chairperson Rapporteur then offered a summary of the proceedings, 
conclusions and recommendations, which are reflected in the sections that follow. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>68. <b>The 2014 Social Forum comprised a three-day discussion in which States, 
international organizations, NGOs and other stakeholders shared their visions about 
the needs of older persons, the challenges they faced, and the obstacles to the exercise 
of their rights. All participants agreed that there must be greater protection of the 
rights of older persons at the national and international levels. The deliberations made 
it clear that this need would continue to grow as population demographics changed to 
reflect longer life expectancies for people worldwide. In those circumstances, it was 
not enough that people lived longer, they must also live better. 
</b></p>
<p>69. <b>It was manifestly clear that existing mechanisms for guaranteeing older persons 
the exercise of all their rights were insufficient, as many continued to suffer from 
neglect, abuse, social exclusion, discrimination, deprivation, stigmatization, poverty 
and inability to meet their basic needs. 
</b></p>
<p>70. <b>The deliberations identified the absence of an express prohibition of age 
discrimination in most human rights instruments as one obstacle to the exercise of 
older persons&#8217; rights. Consequently, the issue lacked visibility and coherence, and was 
not a central theme of review in international mechanisms even though it was a root 
cause of many of the problems and challenges discussed in the Social Forum. 
</b></p>
<p>71. <b>That deficiency in the human rights framework was evident throughout the 
presentations and related dialogues, which addressed a series of interlinked issues 
crucial for the understanding of the circumstances of many older persons. Those 
included poverty, employment discrimination, inadequate systems for long-term care, 
violations of informed consent, scarcity and inadequacy of services for persons with 
dementia, restricted autonomy and decision-making, discrimination, including 
multiple discrimination against women and others, partial or total lack of pension 
coverage, abuse and neglect, inter alia. Many older persons, where not excluded by 
discrimination from employment and social participation, were productive members 
of society. 
</b></p>
<p>72. <b>The discussion addressed the epidemiological changes that had coincided with 
population ageing trends. Increasing rates of acute and chronic illnesses and disability </b></p>


<p><b>combined with limited human and economic resources were straining health and 
social welfare systems. Participants agreed that long-term care was a fundamental 
right for older persons and that its inadequacy had become a grave problem. 
</b></p>
<p>73. <b>The discussion throughout the Forum produced a consensus call for addressing 
the insufficient protection of the rights of older persons with a new, legally binding 
instrument that affirmed and consolidated those rights, and for the further 
monitoring, study and analysis of issues relating to older persons. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>74. <b>All relevant actors must strive to realize the principles of equality and non-
discrimination with regard to age and to implement the concrete obligations of States, 
including through the development and implementation of rights-based laws and 
policies on behalf of older persons. In so doing, it must be recognized that all human 
rights are interconnected and interdependent. The exercise of civil and political rights 
cannot take place in the absence of economic, social and cultural rights, and vice 
versa.  
</b></p>
<p>75. <b>In going forward, international organizations and mechanisms must be more 
involved in the debate regarding ageing and the rights of older persons. The violation 
of these rights should not be seen merely as a moral failing but also as a justiciable 
violation of international human rights law at both the national and international 
levels.</b> 
</p>
<p>76. <b>Older persons can and do contribute to economic and social development, 
where they are not prevented from doing so through discriminatory laws, policies or 
attitudes. As such their right to do so must be protected and promoted. 
</b></p>
<p>77. <b>A paradigm change is needed to enable older persons to enjoy their rights 
regardless of whether or not they are able to contribute to society economically. The 
realization of rights must not be seen as a public expense but rather as an investment 
in a more just society with a better quality of life for everyone. Additionally, the many 
non-economic contributions of older persons to society should be recognized and 
affirmed as part of our moral and legal obligation to contribute to a conscientious 
society that promotes active ageing and the empowerment of older persons. In this 
regard, the participation of older persons in decision-making that affects them and 
promotion of their independence and autonomy is critical.  
</b></p>
<p>78. <b>Member States should commence work on drafting a legally binding human 
rights instrument that can facilitate efforts to respect, protect and fulfil the rights of 
older persons. Improved mechanisms for data collection, and further discussion and 
research should inform these efforts and constitute an ongoing objective of efforts to 
protect the rights of older persons.  </b></p>
