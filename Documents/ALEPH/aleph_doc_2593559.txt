NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. Description of Business
Mewbourne Energy Partners 04-A, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the “Partnership”), a Delaware limited
partnership, is engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in Texas,
Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on January 27, 2004. The offering of limited and
general partnership interests began June 10, 2004 as a part of an offering registered under the
name Mewbourne Energy Partners 04-05 Drilling Program, (the “Program”), and concluded
August 20, 2004, with total investor contributions of $30,000,000 originally being sold to 1,118
subscribers of which $27,235,000 were sold to 1,022 subscribers as general partner interests
and $2,765,000 were sold to 96 subscribers as limited partner interests. During 2006, all general
partner equity interests were converted to limited partner equity interests. In accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware
Corporation, has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general partner. MD has no
significant equity interest in the Partnership.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Reference is hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2015, which
contains a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Partnership in the
preparation of its financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing the quarterly
report included herein.
In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial statements contain all
adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary to present fairly our financial position, results
of operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods presented. The results of
operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for
the full year.
3. Accounting for Oil and Gas Producing Activities
The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the
full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration
and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and
amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-
production method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. At June
30, 2016 and 2015, all capitalized costs were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or
other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and losses are not
recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between
capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly
ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of estimated future net
cash flows of proved reserves, computed using the 12-month unweighted average of first-day-of-
the-month oil and natural gas prices, discounted at 10%, and the lower of cost or fair value of
unproved properties. If unamortized costs capitalized exceed the ceiling, the excess is charged to
expense in the period the excess occurs. There were cost ceiling write-downs totaling $288,144
and $68,944 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
7
4. Asset Retirement Obligations
The Partnership has recognized an estimated asset retirement obligation liability (ARO) for future
plugging and abandonment costs. A liability for the estimated fair value of the future plugging and
abandonment costs is recorded with a corresponding increase in the full cost pool at the time a
new well is drilled. Depreciation expense associated with estimated plugging and abandonment
costs is recognized in accordance with the full cost methodology.
The Partnership estimates a liability for plugging and abandonment costs based on historical
experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free
rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment
costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements.
The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over
the remaining life of the well.
A reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows:
Balance, beginning of period $545,723  $522,447 
   12,090     23,276  
Accretion expense
Balance, end of period
 $557,813  $545,723
2015
2016
5. Related Party Transactions
In accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne Development Corporation
(“MD”), a Delaware Corporation, has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership. Mewbourne Oil Company
(“MOC”) is operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings,
Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC.
In the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to owners
of the well for which the costs were incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these
costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as
operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges
include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and
equipment furnished by the operator, some of which will be included in the full cost pool pursuant
to Rule 4-10(c)(2) of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in accordance
with the program and partnership agreements.
In accordance with the Partnership agreement, during any particular calendar year the total
amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall not exceed the
greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas
production during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs
and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and
general partners.
8
The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through the Program. The Partnership and
MD are the parties to the Program, and the costs and revenues are allocated between them as
follows:
Partnership MD (1)
Revenues:
 Proceeds from disposition of depreciable and depletable properties70%
70%
 All other revenues
Costs and expenses:
 
0%
 Organization and offering costs (1)

 Lease acquisition costs (1)
 Tangible and intangible drilling costs (1)
100%
 
 Operating costs, reporting and legal expenses, general and
  administrative expenses and all other costs
70%
30%
 30%
  
 100%
 100%
 0%
  
 30%
(1)
As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and
offering costs and lease acquisition costs which should approximate 20% of total capital costs.
To the extent that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than
20% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the
Program's total capital costs reaches approximately 20%. The Partnership's financial
statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.
Item 2.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Mewbourne Energy Partners 04-A, L.P. was formed January 27, 2004. The offering of limited and
general partnership interests began June 10, 2004 and concluded August 20, 2004, with total
investor contributions of $30,000,000. During 2006, all general partner equity interests were
converted to limited partner equity interests.
Future capital requirements and operations will be conducted with available funds generated
from oil and gas activities. No bank borrowing is anticipated. The Partnership had net working
capital of $36,070 at June 30, 2016. MOC has informed the Partnership that if cash flows are
insufficient to fund its operating costs, MOC will not demand immediate payment of amounts
owed to it.
The Partnership had reduced cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016
due to the steep decline in oil and gas prices during the previous twelve months. Considering
these reduced operating cashflows, the Partnership anticipates smaller distributions until prices
improve.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Partnership made cash distributions to the
investor partners in the amount of $17,788 as compared to $127,885 for the six months ended
June 30, 2015. Since inception, the Partnership has made distributions of $40,659,420, inclusive
of state tax payments.
The sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Partnership will be affected by a number of
factors that are beyond the Partnership’s control. These factors include the price of crude oil and
natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand for these products, competitive fuels, refining,
transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude
oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty
the future effect of these factors on the Partnership.

Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above table, total oil and gas sales decreased by
$79,612, a 39.3% decline, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2015.
Of this decline, $7,295 and $57,839 were due to decreases in the average prices of oil and gas
sold, respectively. The average price fell to $39.58 from $48.47 per barrel (bbl) and to $1.48 from
$2.29 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
the three months ended June 30, 2015.
Also contributing to the decline in sales were $14,369 and $109 due to lower volumes of oil and
gas sold, respectively, by 363 bbls and 74 mcf.
Lease operations. Lease operating expense during the three month period ended June 30, 2016
decreased to $83,101 from $114,598 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015 due to
fewer well repairs and workovers.
Production taxes. Production taxes during the three month period ended June 30, 2016
decreased to $7,888 from $13,825 for the three month period ended June 30, 2015. This was due
to lower overall oil and gas revenue for the three month period ended June 30, 2016.
Administrative and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the three month
period ended June 30, 2016 fell to $22,847 from $24,246 for the three month period ended June
30, 2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the three
months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $40,318 from $74,246 for the three months ended
June 30, 2015 due to the overall decrease in oil and gas production.
Cost ceiling write-down. There were cost ceiling write-downs of $260,932 and $68,944 for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These were due to lower average oil
and gas prices for the twelve months preceding the write-downs.

Oil and gas revenues. As shown in the above table, total oil and gas sales decreased by
$153,464, a 40.9% decline, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six
months ended June 30, 2015.
Of this decline, $18,948 and $112,751 were due to decreases in the average prices of oil and
gas sold, respectively. The average price fell to $33.33 from $46.23 per barrel (bbl) and to $1.50
from $2.38 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Also contributing to the decline in sales were $14,832 and $6,933 due to lower volumes of oil
and gas sold, respectively, by 445 bbls and 4,608 mcf.
Lease operations. Lease operating expense during the six month period ended June 30, 2016
decreased to $191,045 from $267,851 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015 due to fewer
well repairs and workovers.
Production taxes. Production taxes during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 decreased
to $14,111 from $25,848 for the six month period ended June 30, 2015. This was due to lower
overall oil and gas revenue for the six month period ended June 30, 2016.
Administrative and general expense. Administrative and general expense for the six month
period ended June 30, 2016 fell to $36,253 from $42,101 for the six month period ended June 30,
2015 due to decreased administrative expenses allocable to the Partnership.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 decreased to $70,081 from $127,425 for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 due to the overall decrease in oil and gas production.
Cost ceiling write-down. There were cost ceiling write-downs totaling $288,144 and $68,944 for
the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These were due to lower average
oil and gas prices for the twelve months preceding the write-downs.
11
Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
The Partnership Agreement allows borrowings from banks or other financial sources of up to
20% of the total capital contributions to the Partnership without investor approval. Should the
Partnership elect to borrow monies for additional development activity on Partnership properties,
it will be subject to the interest rate risk inherent in borrowing activities. Changes in interest rates
could significantly affect the Partnership’s results of operations and the amount of net cash flow
available for partner distributions. Also, to the extent that changes in interest rates affect general
economic conditions, the Partnership will be affected by such changes.
2. Commodity Price Risk
The Partnership does not expect to engage in commodity futures trading or hedging activities or
enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. 
The Partnership currently expects to sell a significant amount of its production from successful oil
and gas wells on a month-to-month basis at market prices. Accordingly, the Partnership is at risk
for the volatility in commodity prices inherent in the oil and gas industry, and the level of
commodity prices will have a significant impact on the Partnership’s results of operations. For the
six months ended June 30, 2016, a 10% change in the price received for oil and gas production
would have had an approximate $22,000 impact on revenue.
3. Exchange Rate Risk
The Partnership currently has no income from foreign sources or operations in foreign countries
that would subject it to currency exchange rate risk. The Partnership does not currently expect to
purchase any prospects located outside of either the United States or United States coastal
waters in the Gulf of Mexico.
Item 4.    Disclosure Controls and Procedures
MD maintains a system of controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as
to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in this report, as well
as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. MD’s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its
disclosure controls and procedures with the assistance and participation of other members of
management. Based upon that evaluation, MD’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective for gathering,
analyzing and disclosing the information the Partnership is required to disclose in the reports it
files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
rules and forms. Since MD’s December 31, 2015 annual report on internal control over financial
reporting, and for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there have been no changes in MD’s internal
controls or in other factors which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the internal controls over financial reporting.
12
Part II – Other Information
Item 1.    Legal Proceedings
From time to time, the Registrant may be a party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the
ordinary course of business. While the outcome of these events cannot be predicted with
certainty, the Partnership does not expect these matters to have a material effect on its financial
position or results of operations.
