I, James T. Murphy certify that:
1.           I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Foresight Energy LP.;
2.           Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the

3.           Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information
included in this annual report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this annual

4.           The registrant’s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and
maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-
15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and we have:
a.            designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls
and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating
to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within
those entities, particularly during the period in which this annual report is being prepared;
b.            designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control
over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
c.            evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and
presented in this report our conclusion about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and
d.           disclosed in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial
reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended June 30, 2016 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial
reporting;
5.           The registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent
evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit
committee of the registrant’s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):
a.            all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
b.           any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.
