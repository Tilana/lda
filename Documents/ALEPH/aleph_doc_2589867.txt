ION GEOPHYSICAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
FOOTNOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(1)    Basis of Presentation
The condensed consolidated balance sheet of ION Geophysical Corporation and its subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as the “Company” or “ION,” unless the context otherwise requires) at
December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company’s audited consolidated financial
statements at that date. The condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016, and the
condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for
a fair presentation have been included. The share numbers have been retroactively adjusted to
reflect the one-for-fifteen reverse stock split completed on February 4, 2016. The results of
operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
operating results for a full year or of future operations.
These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and the
instructions to Form 10-Q and applicable rules of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the “SEC”). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
annual financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States have been omitted. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form
10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and on Form 10-K/A  Amendment No. 2, which was
filed on June 27, 2016 and contains the separate consolidated financial statements of INOVA
Geophysical Equipment Limited (“INOVA Geophysical”) for its fiscal year ended December 31,
2015.
(2)    Restructurings and Special Items
The recent decline in crude oil prices to five-year lows and the depressed level of natural gas
prices have negatively impacted the economic outlook of the Company’s exploration and
production (“E&P”) customers, which has also negatively impacted the outlook for the Company’s
seismic contractor customers. In response to the decline in crude oil prices, E&P companies
have reduced their capital expenditures and shifted their spending from exploration activities to
production-related activities on existing assets. Because seismic spending is discretionary, E&P
companies have disproportionately cut their spending on seismic-related services and products.
In April, 2016, the Company implemented additional cost saving initiatives by reducing its current
workforce by over 12%. Additional reductions were needed to further streamline the organization
and bring it in line with the Company’s current revenue stream, while maintaining the necessary
core capabilities to continue our operations and strategic initiatives. During the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized the following pre-tax charges (in
thousands):

(3)    Segment Information
The Company operates through four business segments – Solutions, Systems, Software and
Ocean Bottom Services. The Company measures segment operating results based on income
(loss) from operations. In addition, the Company has an equity ownership interest in its INOVA
Geophysical joint venture. As of December 31, 2014, the Company wrote down its investment in
INOVA Geophysical to zero and has suspended recording its share of losses in the joint venture.
If at a future date, the Company’s cumulative share of earnings during the period of suspension
becomes greater than its share of losses during the same period, the Company will begin to
record its share of earnings in the joint venture as long as its net equity method investment
remains greater than zero.
On August 4, 2016, the Company announced it plans to realign its four business segments into
three. See further discussion at Footnote 18 “Subsequent Event” of Footnotes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.”

Revolving Credit Facility
In August 2014, ION and its material U.S. subsidiaries, ION Exploration Products (U.S.A.), Inc.,
I/O Marine Systems, Inc. and GX Technology Corporation (collectively, the “Subsidiary
Borrowers”), and together with the Company, collectively, the “Borrowers”) entered into a
Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with PNC Bank, National Association (“PNC”), as
agent (the “Original Credit Agreement”), which was amended by the First Amendment to
Revolving Credit and Security Agreement in August 2015 (the “First Amendment”) and the
Second Amendment (as defined below) (the Original Credit Agreement, as amended by the First
Amendment, and the Second Amendment, the “Credit Facility”). For a complete discussion of the
terms, available credit and security of this Credit Facility, prior to the effectiveness of the Second
Amendment, see Footnote 4 to the Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
The Credit Facility is available to provide for the Borrowers’ general corporate needs, including
working capital requirements, capital expenditures, surety deposits and acquisition financing.
The maximum amount of the revolving line of credit under the Credit Facility is the lesser of $40.0
million or a monthly borrowing base (which may be recalculated more frequently under certain
circumstances).
On April 28, 2016, the Borrowers and PNC entered into a second amendment (the “Second
Amendment”) to the Credit Facility. The Second Amendment, among other things:
increases the applicable margin for loans by 0.50% per annum (from 2.50% per annum to 3.00%
per annum for alternate base rate loans and from 3.50% per annum to 4.00% per annum for
LIBOR-based loans);
increases the minimum excess availability threshold to avoid triggering the agent’s rights to
exercise dominion over cash and deposit accounts and increases certain of the thresholds upon
which such dominion ceases;
increases the minimum liquidity threshold to avoid triggering the Company’s obligation to
calculate and comply with the existing fixed charge coverage ratio and increases certain of the
thresholds upon which such required calculation and compliance cease;
establishes a reserve that reduces the amount available to be borrowed by the aggregate
amount owing under all Third Lien Notes that remain outstanding (if any) on or after February
14, 2018 (i.e., 90 days prior to the stated maturity of the Third Lien Notes);
increases the maximum amount of certain permitted junior indebtedness to $200.0 million (from
$175.0 million);
incorporates technical and conforming changes to reflect that the Second Lien Notes and the
remaining Third Lien Notes (and any permitted refinancing thereof or subsequently incurred
replacement indebtedness meeting certain requirements) constitute permitted indebtedness;
clarifies the circumstances and mechanics under which the Company may prepay, repurchase
or redeem the Second Lien Notes, the remaining Third Lien Notes and certain other junior
indebtedness;
modifies the cross-default provisions to incorporate defaults under the Second Lien Notes, the
remaining Third Lien Notes and certain other junior indebtedness; and
eliminates the potential early commitment termination date and early maturity date that would
otherwise have occurred ninety (90) days prior the maturity date of the Third Lien Notes if any of
the Third Lien Notes then remained outstanding.

•
The borrowing base under the Credit Facility will increase or decrease monthly using a formula
based on certain eligible receivables, eligible inventory and other amounts, including a
percentage of the net orderly liquidation value of the Borrowers’ multi-client data library (not to
exceed $15.0 million for the multi-client data library data component).  As of June 30, 2016, the
borrowing
9
base under the Credit Facility was $26.9 million, and there was $15.0 million of indebtedness
under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is scheduled to mature on August 22, 2019.
The obligations of Borrowers under the Credit Facility are secured by a first-priority security
interest in 100% of the stock of the Subsidiary Borrowers and 65% of the equity interest in ION
International Holdings L.P. and by substantially all other assets of the Borrowers.
The Credit Facility contains covenants that, among other things, limit or prohibit the Borrowers,
subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, from incurring additional indebtedness (including
capital lease obligations), repurchasing equity, paying dividends or distributions, granting or
incurring additional liens on the Borrowers’ properties, pledging shares of the Borrowers’
subsidiaries, entering into certain merger transactions, entering into transactions with the
Company’s affiliates, making certain sales or other dispositions of the Borrowers’ assets, making
certain investments, acquiring other businesses and entering into sale-leaseback transactions
with respect to the Borrowers’ property.
The Credit Facility, requires that ION and the Subsidiary Borrowers maintain a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio of 1.1 to 1.0 as of the end of each fiscal quarter during the existence of a
covenant testing trigger event. The fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) ION’s
EBITDA, minus unfunded capital expenditures made during the relevant period, minus
distributions (including tax distributions) and dividends made during the relevant period, minus
cash taxes paid during the relevant period, to (ii) certain debt payments made during the relevant
period. A covenant testing trigger event occurs upon (a) the occurrence and continuance of an
event of default under the Credit Facility or (b) the failure to maintain a measure of liquidity
greater than (i) $7.5 million for five consecutive business days or (ii) $6.5 million on any given
business day. Liquidity, as defined in the Credit Facility, is the Company’s excess availability to
borrow ($11.9 million at June 30, 2016) plus the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash held by
ION, the Subsidiary Borrowers and their domestic subsidiaries.
At June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit
Facility.
The Credit Facility contains customary event of default provisions (including a “change of control”
event affecting ION), the occurrence of which could lead to an acceleration of the Company’s
obligations under the Credit Facility as amended.
Senior Secured Notes
In May 2013, the Company sold $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Senior
Secured Second-Priority Notes due 2018 (the “Third Lien Notes”) in a private offering pursuant to
an Indenture dated as of May 13, 2013 (the Third Lien Notes Indenture”). Prior to the completion
of the Exchange Offer (as defined below) and Consent Solicitation (as defined below) on April
28, 2016, the Third Lien Notes were senior secured second-priority obligations of the Company.
After giving effect to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, the remaining aggregate
principal amount of approximately $28.5 million of outstanding Third Lien Notes became senior
secured third-priority obligations of the Company subordinated to the liens securing all senior
and second priority indebtedness of the Company, including under the Credit Facility and
Second-Priority Lien Notes (defined below).
Pursuant to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, the Company (i) issued approximately
$120.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the Company’s new 9.125% Senior Secured
Second Priority Notes due 2021 (the “Second Lien Notes,” and collectively with the Third Lien
Notes, the “Notes”) and 1,205,477 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for
approximately $120.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Third Lien Notes, and (ii)
purchased approximately $25.9 million in aggregate principal amount of Third Lien Notes in
exchange for aggregate cash consideration totaling approximately $15.0 million, plus accrued
and unpaid interest on the Third Lien Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but
not including, April 28, 2016.
After giving effect to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, the aggregate principal
amount of the Third Lien Notes remaining outstanding was approximately $28.5 million and the
aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes outstanding was approximately $120.6 million.
See “Exchange Offer” below.
The Third Lien Notes are guaranteed by the Company’s material U.S. subsidiaries, GX
Technology Corporation, ION Exploration Products (U.S.A.), Inc. and I/O Marine Systems, Inc.
(the “Guarantors”), and mature on May 15, 2018. Interest on the Third Lien Notes accrues at the
rate of 8.125% per annum and will be payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November
15 of each year during their term. In May 2014, the holders of the Third Lien Notes exchanged
their Third Lien Notes for a like principal amount of registered Third Lien Notes with the same
terms. For a complete discussion of the terms and security the Third Lien Notes in effect prior to
the completion of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation on April 28, 2016, see Footnote 4
to the Financial Statements included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.

Prior to the completion of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, the Third Lien Notes
Indenture contained certain covenants that, among other things, limited or prohibited the
Company’s ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to take certain actions or permit
certain conditions to exist during the term of the Third Lien Notes, including among other things,
incurring additional indebtedness, creating liens, paying dividends and making other
distributions in respect of the Company’s capital stock, redeeming the Company’s capital stock,
making investments or certain other restricted payments, selling certain kinds of assets, entering
into transactions with affiliates, and effecting mergers or consolidations. These and other
restrictive covenants contained in the Third Lien Notes Indenture are subject to certain
exceptions and qualifications. After giving effect to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation,
the Third Lien Notes Indenture was amended to, among other things, provide for the release of
the second priority security interest in the collateral securing the remaining Third Lien Notes and
the grant of a third priority security interest in the collateral, subordinate to liens securing all
senior and second priority indebtedness of the Company, including the Credit Facility and the
Second Lien Notes, and eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events
of default pertaining to the remaining Third Lien Notes.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants with respect to the
Third Lien Notes.
On or after May 15, 2015, the Company may on one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the
Third Lien Notes at the redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and

Exchange Offer
On April 28, 2016, the Company successfully completed the previously announced exchange
offer (the “Exchange Offer”) and consent solicitation (the “Consent Solicitation”) related to the
Third Lien Notes. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds in connection with the
Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation.
Under the terms of the Exchange Offer, for each $1,000 principal amount of Third Lien Notes
validly tendered for exchange and not validly withdrawn by an eligible holder (an “Exchange
Participant”) prior to 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on April 25, 2016, and accepted for
exchange by the Company, the Company offered the consideration (the “Exchange
Consideration”) of (i) $1,000 principal amount of Second Lien Notes plus (ii) either (a) for Third
Lien Notes tendered at or prior to 4:59 P.M., New York City time, on April 15, 2016 (the “Extended
Early Tender Deadline”), ten (10) shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Early Stock
Consideration”), or (b) for Third Lien Notes tendered after the Extended Early Tender Deadline,
seven (7) shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Stock Consideration”) (such shares
issued as the Early Stock Consideration or the Stock Consideration, together with the Second
Lien Notes, the “Exchange Securities”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
the Company’s confidential Offer to Exchange and related Consent and Letter of Transmittal,
each dated March 28, 2016 (the “Offer Documents”).
As part of the Exchange Offer, each Exchange Participant had the opportunity to tender all or a
portion of its Third Lien Notes for a cash payment in lieu of the Exchange Consideration upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer Documents (the “Cash Tender Option”).
The aggregate amount of cash consideration that could be paid by the Company for tendered
Third Lien Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Cash Tender Option was approximately
$15.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date of the
Exchange Offer (collectively, the “Cash Tender Cap”).
Concurrently with the Exchange Offer, the Company solicited consents from eligible holders to
proposed amendments to the Third Lien Notes Indenture (the “Proposed Amendments”). The
Proposed Amendments, among other things, provide for the release of the second priority
security interest in the collateral securing the Third Lien Notes and the grant of a third priority
security interest in the collateral, subordinate to liens securing all the Company’s senior and
second priority indebtedness, including the Credit Facility and the Second Lien Notes, and
eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default pertaining to
the Third Lien Notes.
The Exchange Offer, including the Cash Tender Option, and the Consent Solicitation expired at
11:59 P.M., New York City time, on April 28, 2016. In total, the Company accepted for exchange
approximately $146.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Third Lien Notes, or
approximately 83.72% of the $175 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Third
Lien Notes, validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Exchange Offer. The Third Lien Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Exchange Offer were accepted by the Company.
Because the Company received the necessary consents to effect the Proposed Amendments,
any Third Lien Notes not validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer remain outstanding
and the holders are subject to the terms of the supplemental indenture implementing the
Proposed Amendments. No consideration was paid to holders of Third Lien Notes in connection
with the Consent Solicitation. After giving effect to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation,
the aggregate principal amount of the Third Lien Notes remaining outstanding was approximately
$28.5 million as of April 25, 2016, and such Third Lien Notes are secured on a third priority basis
subordinated to the liens securing all senior and second priority indebtedness of the Company,
including under the Credit Facility and Second Lien Notes.
In exchange for approximately $120.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Third Lien Notes,
the Company issued approximately $120.6 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien
Notes and 1,205,477 shares of common stock, including 1,204,980 shares issued as Early Stock
Consideration and 497 shares issued as Stock Consideration. The Company utilized 508,464 of
treasury shares towards the total 1,205,477 shares issued. The securities issued in the
Exchange Offer were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration set forth in Section
4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company received no cash consideration in exchange for the
issuance of the Exchange Securities.
The Cash Tender Option was fully subscribed. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer, the
Company accepted for purchase tendered Third Lien Notes at the lowest bid prices until the
Cash Tender Cap was reached, subject to proration. In exchange for aggregate cash
consideration totaling approximately $15.0 million, the Company purchased approximately $25.9
million in aggregate principal amount of Third Lien Notes. The Company also paid in cash
accrued and unpaid interest on Third Lien Notes accepted for purchase in the Exchange Offer
from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, April 28, 2016.

(5)    Net Income (Loss) per Share
Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) applicable
to common shares by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is determined based on the assumption that
dilutive restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards have vested and outstanding dilutive
stock options have been exercised and the aggregate proceeds were used to reacquire common
stock using the average price of such common stock for the period. The total number of shares
issued or reserved for future issuance under outstanding stock options at June 30, 2016 and
2015 was 900,623 and 621,443, respectively, and the total number of shares of restricted stock
and shares reserved for restricted stock units outstanding at June 30, 2016 and 2015 was
293,709 and 98,054, respectively. The foregoing share numbers have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the one-for-fifteen reverse stock split completed on February 4, 2016. All
outstanding stock options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were anti-dilutive.

(6)    Income Taxes
The Company maintains a valuation allowance for substantially all of its deferred tax assets. The
valuation allowance is calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740 “Income
Taxes,” which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is “more
likely than not” that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. In the event the
Company’s expectations of future operating results change, the valuation allowance may need to
be adjusted downward. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has no unreserved U.S. deferred tax
assets.
The provision for the six months ended June 30, 2016 has been calculated based on the actual
tax expense incurred for those periods. Given the current uncertainty in expected income
generated in various foreign jurisdictions, where tax rates can vary greatly, the Company’s actual
tax rate is the best estimate of year-to-date tax expense. The Company’s effective tax rates for the
three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were (9.8)% and 0.9%, respectively, and for the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were (4.4)% and 85.5% respectively. The Company’s
effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was impacted by the change
in valuation allowance related to operating losses for which the Company cannot currently
recognize a tax benefit. The Company’s income tax expense for the six months ended June 30,
2016 of $2.5 million primarily relates to income from the Company’s non-U.S. businesses. This
foreign tax expense has not been offset by the tax benefits on losses within the U.S. and other
jurisdictions, from which the Company cannot currently benefit; therefore negatively impacting
the Company’s effective tax rate.
The Company has approximately $1.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits and does not expect
to recognize significant increases in unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12-month period.
Interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax
expense.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company’s U.S. federal tax returns for 2012 and subsequent years
remain subject to examination by tax authorities. The Company is no longer subject to U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) examination for periods prior to 2012, although carryforward
attributes that were generated prior to 2012 may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS if
they either have been or will be used in an open year. In the Company’s foreign tax jurisdictions,
tax returns for 2010 and subsequent years generally remain open to examination.

(7)    Litigation
WesternGeco
In June 2009, WesternGeco L.L.C. (“WesternGeco”) filed a lawsuit against the Company in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. In the lawsuit,
styled WesternGeco L.L.C. v. ION Geophysical Corporation, WesternGeco alleged that the
Company had infringed several method and apparatus claims contained in four of its United
States patents regarding marine seismic streamer steering devices.
The trial began in July 2012. A verdict was returned by the jury in August 2012, finding that the
Company infringed the claims contained in the four patents by supplying its DigiFIN® lateral
streamer control units and the related software from the United States and awarded
WesternGeco the sum of $105.9 million in damages, consisting of $12.5 million in reasonable
royalty and $93.4 million in lost profits.
In June 2013, the presiding judge entered a Memorandum and Order, ruling that WesternGeco is
entitled to be awarded supplemental damages for the additional DigiFIN units that were supplied
from the United States before and after the trial that were not included in the jury verdict due to
the timing of the trial. In October 2013, the judge entered another Memorandum and Order, ruling
on the number of DigiFIN units that are subject to supplemental damages and also ruling that the
supplemental damages applicable to the additional units should be calculated by adding
together the jury’s previous reasonable royalty and lost profits damages awards per unit,
resulting in supplemental damages of $73.1 million.
In April 2014, the judge entered another Order, ruling that lost profits should not have been
included in the calculation of supplemental damages in the October 2013 Memorandum and
Order and reducing the supplemental damages award in the case from $73.1 million to $9.4
million. In the Order, the judge also further reduced the damages award in the case by $3.0
million to reflect a settlement and license that WesternGeco entered into with a customer of the
Company that had purchased and used DigiFIN units that were also included in the damage
amounts awarded against the Company.
In May 2014, the judge signed and entered a Final Judgment in the amount of $123.8 million
related to the case. The Final Judgment also included an injunction that enjoins the Company, its
agents and anyone acting in concert with it, from supplying in or from the United States the
DigiFIN product or any parts unique to the DigiFIN product, or any instrumentality no more than
colorably different from any of these products or parts, for combination outside of the United
States. The Company has conducted its business in compliance with the district court’s orders in
the case, and the Company has reorganized its operations such that it no longer supplies the
DigiFIN product or any parts unique to the DigiFIN product in or from the United States.
The Company and WesternGeco each appealed the Final Judgment to the United States Court
of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. On July 2, 2015, the Court of Appeals
reversed in part the judgment, holding the district court erred by including lost profits in the Final
Judgment. Lost profits were $93.4 million and prejudgment interest was approximately $10.9
million of the $123.8 million Final Judgment. Pre-judgment interest on the lost profits portion will
be treated in the same way as the lost profits. Post-judgment interest will likewise be treated in
the same fashion. On July 29, 2015, WesternGeco filed a petition for rehearing en banc before
the Court of Appeals. On October 30, 2015 the Court of Appeals denied WesternGeco’s petition
for rehearing en banc.
On February 26, 2016, WesternGeco filed a petition for writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court.
The Company filed its response on April 27, 2016. On June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court refused
to disturb the Court of Appeals ruling finding no lost profits as a matter of law.  Separately, in light
of the changes in case law regarding the standard of proof for willfulness in the Halo and Stryker
cases, the Supreme Court indicated that the case should be remanded to the Federal Circuit for a
determination of whether or not the willfulness determination by the District Court was
appropriate.
On May 4, 2016, after referral from the district court, a Magistrate Judge issued an order and
report and recommendation in the litigation.  The order and report recommended entry of a final
judgment against the Company on the royalty obligation plus interest, subject to final calculation
upon entry of judgment, which is expected to be approximately $22 million and recommended
the district court deny our motion to stay any obligation to pay the remaining $22 million that is
not related to lost profits. The district court has not yet decided whether to adopt the
recommendation of the magistrate.  The Company will pursue all available objections and
appeals to the order and report and recommendation.
As previously disclosed, the Company had taken a loss contingency accrual of $124 million. As
a result of the reversal by the Court of Appeals, as of June 30, 2015, the Company reduced the
loss contingency accrual to its current amount of $22 million. The Company’s assessment of its
potential loss contingency may change in the future due to developments in the case and other
events, such as changes in applicable law, and such reassessment could lead to the
determination that no loss contingency is probable or that a greater or lesser loss contingency is
probable. Any such reassessment could have a material effect on the Company’s financial
condition or results of operations.
14
Prior to the reduction in damages by the Court of Appeals, the Company arranged with sureties
to post an appeal bond at the trial court. The appeal bond is uncollateralized, but the terms of the
appeal bond arrangements provide the sureties the contractual right for as long as the bond is
outstanding to require the Company to post cash collateral. The Company has received a
request for $11 million in collateral and has exchanged correspondence with the sureties in
connection with this request. In July 2016, the sureties renewed their request for collateral and
the Company is continuing to discuss terms and options with them. The appeal bond will remain
outstanding during the pendency of appeals.
Other
The Company has been named in various other lawsuits or threatened actions that are incidental
to its ordinary business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Any claims against the Company,
whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, cause the Company to incur costs and
expenses, require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of
significant operational resources. The results of these lawsuits and actions cannot be predicted
with certainty. Management currently believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not
have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the
Company.

(12)    Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Authoritative guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and stipulates the related disclosure requirements. The Company
follows a three-level hierarchy, prioritizing and defining the types of inputs used to measure fair
value.
The carrying amounts of the Company’s long-term debt as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 were $165.5 million and $183.0 million, respectively, compared to its fair values of $95.6
million and $104.3 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair
value of the long-term debt was calculated using an active market price, based on Level 1 inputs
defined as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments. Due to their highly liquid nature, the amount of the
Company’s other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts and
unbilled receivables, notes receivable, accounts payable, and accrued multi-client data library
royalties, represent their approximate fair value.
(13)    Stock-based Compensation and Repurchase Plan
Stock Appreciation Rights
16
On March 1, 2016, the Company issued 1,210,000 Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”) awards to
15 individuals with an exercise price of $3.10. The vesting of these SARs is achieved through
both a market condition and a service condition. The market condition is achieved, in part or in
full, in the event that during the four-year period beginning on the date of grant the 20-day trailing
volume-weighted average price of a share of common stock is (i) greater than 120% of the
exercise price for the first 1/3 of the awards, (ii) greater than 125% of the exercise price for the
second 1/3 of the awards and (iii) greater than 130% of the exercise price for the final 1/3 of the
awards. The exercise condition restricts the ability of the holders to exercise awards until certain
service milestones have been reached such that (i) no more than 1/3 of the awards may be
exercised, if vested, on and after the first anniversary of the date of grant, (ii) no more than 2/3 of
the awards may be exercised, if vested, on and after the second anniversary of the date of grant
and (iii) all of the awards may be exercised, if vested, on and after the third anniversary of the
date of grant. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded $0.2 million of
share-based compensation expense attributable to SAR awards.
Pursuant to ASC 718, “Compensation – Stock Compensation,” the SARs are considered liability
awards and as such, these amounts are accrued in the liability section of the balance sheet. The
70.99%
March 1, 2016
Company calculated the fair value of each SAR award on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo
simulation model. The following assumptions were used:
 
Risk-free interest rates 1.81%
Expected lives (in years)4.0
Expected dividend yield —%
Expected volatility
Stock Repurchase Program
On November 4, 2015, the Company’s board of directors approved a stock repurchase program
authorizing the Company to repurchase, from time to time from November 10, 2015, through
November 10, 2017, up to $25.0 million in shares of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
The stock repurchase program may be implemented through open market repurchases or
privately negotiated transactions, at management’s discretion. The actual timing, number and
value of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by management at its
discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the shares of the
Company’s common stock and general market and economic conditions, applicable legal
requirements and compliance with the terms of the Company’s outstanding indebtedness. The
repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common
stock and may be modified or suspended at any time and could be terminated prior to
completion. Since the program’s inception on November 10, 2015, through June 30, 2016, the
Company had repurchased 451,792 shares of its common stock under the repurchase program
at an average price per share of $6.54, and the Company has approximately $22.0 million of
remaining authorized capacity available pursuant to the repurchase program. The number of
shares repurchased and the average price per repurchased share have been retroactively
adjusted to reflect the one-for-fifteen reverse stock split completed on February 4, 2016. On June
30, 2016, the closing sale price for the Company’s common stock was $6.23 on the NYSE.
(14)    Related Party Transactions
BGP Inc. (“BGP”) owned approximately 13.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as
of June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded
revenues from BGP of $2.0 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Total receivables from BGP
were $0.3 million at June 30, 2016.
(15)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Revenue Recognition — In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards
Board (“IASB”) jointly issued new accounting guidance for recognition of revenue. This new
guidance replaces virtually all existing U.S. GAAP and IFRS guidance on revenue recognition.
On July 9, 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date for its new revenue standard for
public and nonpublic entities reporting under U.S. GAAP by one year. As a result, the new
guidance is now effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. This new guidance
applies to all periods presented. Therefore, when the Company issues its financial statements on
Forms 10-Q and 10-K for periods included in its year ended December 31, 2018, its comparative
periods that are presented from the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 must be
retrospectively presented in compliance with this new guidance. The new guidance requires
companies to make more estimates and use more judgment than under current accounting
guidance. Public entities will be permitted to adopt the standard as early as the original public
entity effective date (i.e., annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim
periods therein). Early adoption prior to that date will not be permitted.
17
The FASB and IASB (collectively, the “Boards”) have discussed clarifying the guidance in their
new revenue standards for: (1) licenses of intellectual property, (2) identifying performance
obligations, (3) noncash consideration and (4) collectability. The Boards have also discussed
whether to add practical expedients for the accounting for contract modifications at transition and
the presentation of sales taxes, and the FASB separately discussed several technical
corrections. The FASB and the IASB did not agree on the nature and breadth of all of the
changes to be proposed. The Boards are expected to issue separate exposure drafts later this
year.
The Company continues to evaluate (i) the two allowed adoption methods to determine which
method it plans to use for retrospective presentation of comparative periods, (ii) the impact of
proposed clarifications to the guidance on timing of the recognition of revenue within the
Company’s various revenue streams, (iii) the Company’s option to adopt the new guidance either
as of the originally proposed effective date or the proposed deferred effective date and (iv)
whether the implementation of this new guidance will have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial position or results of operations for the periods presented.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” which introduces the
recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as
operating leases under previous guidance. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years with
early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-002 on our consolidated
financial statements.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," that will change how
companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Entities will be
required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the statement of income when the
awards vest or are settled, the guidance on employers’ accounting for an employee’s use of
shares to satisfy the employer’s statutory income tax withholding obligation and for forfeitures is
changing and the update requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating
activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. The amendments in this
update will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim
periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect of
ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments” that will change how companies measure credit losses for most financial assets and
certain other instruments that aren’t measured at fair value through net income. The standard will
replace today’s “insured loss” approach with and “expected loss” model for instruments
measured at amortized cost. For available-for-sale debt securities, entities will be required to
record allowances rather than reduce the carrying amount. It also simplifies the accounting model
for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. The amendments in this update will be
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2018. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements.
(16) Acquisition of In-process Research and Development
In March 2016, the Company acquired Global Dynamics Incorporated, an Ontario-based
company that designs and develops marine towing systems and equipment, including its
proprietary SailWings technology. SailWings configurations are designed to optimize towed
source arrays and augment towed streamer deployment systems, and yield significantly less
drag, faster towing, improved fuel efficiency, and safer operations through their flexible and
smaller footprint.
The Company acquired the SailWings technology (in-process R&D) for a one-time expenditure
of $1.0 million, which was recorded as a research, development and engineering expense within
operating expenses. The acquisition agreement also contemplates cash payments (earn-outs) up
to a total of $2.3 million for successful commercialization of this technology over the next ten
years.

(18)    Subsequent Events
•
On August 4, 2016, the Company announced it plans to realign its four business segments into
three. The new segments will be E&P Operations Optimization, E&P Technology and Services,
and Ocean Bottom Services. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, the Company changed its
reportable segments as described below:
E&P Operations Optimization will now be comprised of Systems (to be renamed Devices), and
Software. The manufacturing, engineering, research and development of ocean bottom systems
will no longer be a part of Devices, and they will be within Ocean Bottom Services as noted
below.
E&P Technology and Services, formerly Solutions, will continue to be comprised of the groups
that support our New Venture and Data Library (together multi-client) revenues and Imaging
Services group (Data Processing revenues).
Ocean Bottom Services (currently OceanGeo) will also include: the manufacturing, engineering,
research and development of ocean bottom systems.
This realignment of the business segments will allow the Company to better direct its resources
and simplify its operations. The Company will recast 2015 segment results on a quarterly basis
for comparability purposes starting in the third quarter of 2016.

Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
Executive Summary
Our Business
In this Form 10-Q, “ION Geophysical,” “ION,” “the company” (or, “the Company”), “we,” “our,”
“ours” and “us” refer to ION Geophysical Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, except
where the context otherwise requires or as otherwise indicated.
The information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains references to
trademarks, service marks and registered marks of ION and our subsidiaries, as indicated.
Except where stated otherwise or unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “DigiFIN,”
“VectorSeis,” “Orca,” “GATOR,” “Calypso,” and “WiBand,” refer to DigiFIN®, VECTORSEIS®,
ORCA®, GATOR®, Calypso® and WiBand® registered marks owned by ION, and the terms
“VSO,” “Narwhal,” “Marlin” and “MexicoSPAN” refer to VSO™, Narwhal™, Marlin™ and
MexicoSPAN™ trademarks and service marks owned by ION.
We provide geoscience technology, services and solutions to the global oil and gas industry. Our
offerings are designed to allow oil and gas companies to obtain higher resolution images of the
Earth’s subsurface to reduce their risk and optimize assets across the exploration and production
lifecycle. Seismic imaging plays a fundamental role in hydrocarbon exploration and reservoir
development by delineating structures, rock types and fluid locations in the subsurface. The high-
resolution images of the Earth’s subsurface can be used to reduce uncertainty associated with
identifying sources of hydrocarbons and pinpointing drilling locations for wells, which can be
costly and risky.
We acquire and process seismic data on a proprietary or multi-client basis. The multi-client
seismic surveys for our data library business are pre-funded, or underwritten, in part by our
customers, and, with the exception of our ocean bottom seismic (“OBS”) data acquisition
company, OceanGeo B.V. (“OceanGeo”), we utilize an “asset lite” strategy by contracting with
third party seismic data acquisition companies to acquire the seismic data, all of which is
intended to minimize our risk exposure. We serve customers in most major energy producing
regions of the world from strategically located offices across six continents.
We provide our services and products through four business segments – Solutions, Systems,
Software and Ocean Bottom Services. Our Ocean Bottom Services segment is comprised of
OceanGeo, in which we increased our ownership to 100% in 2014. In addition, we have a 49%
ownership interest in our INOVA Geophysical Equipment Limited joint venture (“INOVA
Geophysical,” or “INOVA”). As of December 31, 2014, we wrote down our investment in INOVA
Geophysical to zero, and therefore no longer record our share of losses in the joint venture. For
details of our suspension of recording equity method losses, see Footnote 3 “Segment
Information” of Footnotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On August 4, 2016, the we announced our plans to realign our four business segments into three.
See further discussion at Footnote 18 “Subsequent Event” of Footnotes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.”
For decades, we have provided innovative seismic data acquisition technology, such as
multicomponent imaging with VectorSeis products, the ability to record seismic data from basins
below ice, and cableless seismic techniques. The advanced technologies we currently offer
include our Orca and Gator command and control software systems, WiBand broadband data
processing technology, Calypso OBS acquisition system, and other technologies, each of which
is designed to deliver improvements in both image quality and productivity. In 2015, we
introduced our Marlin solution for optimizing simultaneous operations offshore. We have
approximately 500 patents and pending patent applications in various countries around the
world. Approximately 49% of our employees are involved in technical roles and over 25% of our
employees have advanced degrees.
Solutions. Our Solutions business provides three distinct service activities that often work
together.
Our Solutions business focuses on providing services for challenging environments, such as the
Arctic frontier; complex and hard-to-image geologies, such as deepwater subsurface salt
formations in the Gulf of Mexico and offshore West Africa and Brazil; unconventional reservoirs,
such as those found in shale, tight gas and oil sands formations; and offshore basin-wide seismic
data and imaging programs. Since 2002, our basin exploration seismic data programs have
resulted in a substantial data library that covers significant portions of many of the frontier basins
in the world, including offshore East and West Africa, India, South America, the Arctic, the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Australia.
Our Ventures services are designed to manage the entire seismic process, from survey planning
and design to data acquisition and management, to final subsurface imaging and reservoir
characterization. Our Ventures group focuses on the technologically intensive components of the
image development process, such as survey planning and design, and data processing and
interpretation, outsourcing the logistics components (such as field acquisition) to experienced
seismic and other geophysical contractors.
25
Our Imaging Services group offers data processing and imaging services designed to help our
E&P customers reduce exploration and production risk, evaluate and develop reservoirs, and
increase production. Imaging Services develops a series of subsurface images by applying its
processing technology to data owned or licensed by its customers. We maintain approximately
15 petabytes of digital seismic data information storage in 4 global data centers, including two
core data centers located in Houston and in the U.K.
Our E&P Advisors group partners with operators, energy industries and capital institutions to
capture and monetize E&P opportunities worldwide. This group provides technical, commercial
and strategic advice across the E&P value chain, working at basin, prospect and field scales.
Software. Our Software business provides command and control software systems, related
software and services for towed marine streamer and seabed operations, as well as survey
design. Our Orca software is installed on towed streamer marine vessels worldwide, and our
Gator software is used by many re-deployable and permanent seabed acquisition systems.
Systems. Our Systems business is engaged in the manufacture and repairs of (i) re-deployable
ocean bottom cable seismic data acquisition systems and shipboard recorders (for OceanGeo’s
use in OBS data acquisition); (ii) marine towed streamer positioning and control systems; and
(iii) analog geophone sensors.
Ocean Bottom Services. Through our experienced OceanGeo team, we offer a fully integrated
OBS solution that includes survey design, planning, and acquisition services to maximize image
quality, operational efficiency and safety. In addition, our team provides superior imaging via
OceanGeo’s exclusive use of our seabed acquisition systems; and data processing,
interpretation and reservoir services, by our Imaging Services group.
INOVA Geophysical. Historically, we have conducted our land seismic equipment business
through INOVA Geophysical, which is a joint venture with BGP Inc. (“BGP”). BGP is a subsidiary
of China National Petroleum Corporation, and is generally regarded as the world’s largest land
geophysical service contractor. BGP owns a 51% equity interest in INOVA Geophysical, and we
own the remaining 49% interest. INOVA manufactures cable-based and cableless seismic data
acquisition systems, digital sensors, vibroseis vehicles (i.e., vibrator trucks) and source
controllers for energy source business lines. As of December 31, 2014, we wrote down our
investment in INOVA Geophysical to zero.
Macroeconomic Conditions
Demand for our services and products is cyclical and dependent on activity levels in the oil and
gas industry, particularly our customers’ willingness to invest capital in the exploration for oil and
gas. Our customers’ capital spending programs are generally based on their outlook for near-
term and long-term commodity prices, which are impacted by a number of factors including
economic growth, commodity supply and demand, and geopolitical developments. As a result,
demand for our services and products is largely sensitive to expected oil and gas prices.
In the past few years, crude oil prices have been volatile due to global economic uncertainties.
Significant downward crude oil price volatility began early in the fourth quarter of 2014 and prices
declined through the first quarter of 2015, followed by a partial recovery during the second
quarter of 2015. Oil prices continued to decline from the third quarter of 2015 through the first
quarter of 2016, before improving to approximately $50 per barrel by the end of the second
quarter of 2016 followed by modest declines in July 2016. The material decrease in crude oil
prices can be attributed principally to high levels of global crude oil inventories resulting from
significant production growth in the U.S. shale plays, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative
to other foreign currencies, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Companies (OPEC)
increasing its production. OPEC has demonstrated throughout 2015 and to date in 2016 an
unwillingness to cut its production. The current collapse represents a devaluation of over
investment in unconventional oil because of cheap capital, a classic bubble scenario. It is part of
a larger structural adjustment of the global economy to unprecedented debt levels and prolonged
low interest rates. After a period of decline in the first quarter of 2016, oil and gas prices improved
during the second quarter of 2016 caused by unexpected supply outages from Nigeria, Canada,
Libya and Venezuela. However, uncertainty about demand in China, surging oil exports in Iran
and lower than expected recent draws on oil inventories have stalled further improvements to oil
prices heading into July 2016. The average prices for West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) and
Intercontinental Exchange Brent (“Brent”) crude oil increased to an average of $45 per barrel and
$46 per barrel, respectively, in the second quarter of 2016 from an average of $33 per barrel and
$34 per barrel, respectively, in the first quarter of 2016. These data points compare to an average
of $49 per barrel and $52 per barrel, respectively, for the full year 2015, and an average price of
$101 per barrel and $109 per barrel, respectively, in the first nine months of 2014.
26
Given the historical volatility of crude prices, there is a continued risk that prices could remain low
or continue to deteriorate due to high levels of crude oil production, slowing growth rates in
various global regions and/or the potential for ongoing supply/demand imbalances. Alternatively,
if the global supply of oil were to decrease due to reduced capital investment by E&P companies,
government instability in a major oil-producing nation or energy demand continues to increase in
the U.S. and countries such as China and India, a recovery in WTI and Brent crude oil prices
could occur. Regardless of the driver, crude oil price improvements will not occur without a re-
balancing of global supply and demand, the timing of which is difficult to predict. If commodity
prices do not improve or if they decline further, demand for our services and products could
continue to decline.
Prices for natural gas in the U.S. averaged $2.06 per mmBtu in the first half of 2016 compared to
$2.62 per mmBtu for the full year 2015 and $4.57 per mmBtu in the first nine months of 2014.
Natural gas prices declined due to strong production and a mild winter this year as compared to
last year resulting in significant increases in natural gas inventories in the U.S. during 2016. As a
result of natural gas production growth outpacing demand in the U.S., natural gas prices continue
to be weak relative to prices experienced from 2006 through 2008 and are expected to remain
below levels considered economical for new investments in numerous natural gas fields. For the
first half of 2016, natural gas inventories ended this winter withdrawal season at a near record
high of 3,179 Bcf, however, US producers removed another 29 rigs from service during the
quarter, bringing the total US rig count to 78% below the peak of 1931 rigs in the fourth quarter of
2014.  The US rig count declined from 450 to 421 during June 2016.  If natural gas production
continues to surpass U.S. natural gas demand, prices could remain constrained for an extended
period.
Impact to Our Business
During 2015, E&P capital expenditures remained low as budgets were approximately 25% lower
than the previous year, and E&P capital expenditures declined an additional 25% during 2016,
as a result of the steep oil price decline that began in the fourth quarter of 2014. These declines
in capital expenditure budgets are the first back-to-back declines of this magnitude since the
1980s. Certain E&P companies are evaluating near-term oil prices, and how these prices will
affect their return on new and existing projects before committing to spend substantial sums from
their capital expenditure budgets. We believe E&P companies perceive projects with a longer
time to payback, or profitability, as less attractive in the short-term. E&P companies have
announced their intention to protect dividend payments even if that means reducing capital
expenditures. Therefore, E&P companies are increasingly likely to reduce capital expenditures
for projects in the early stages, or exploration phase, of the E&P lifecycle. In low oil price
environments, oil companies tend to prioritize production-related activities and existing assets
over exploration, and disproportionately cut spending on seismic services and products, which
has a negative impact on the seismic industry, including our Company.
The sustained reduction in exploration spending has had a significant impact on our results of
operations for the first half of 2016 in all of our segments. In our Solutions segment, we have
seen continued softness in customer underwriting of our new venture programs and reductions in
our data processing business. We continue to maintain high standards for underwriting new
projects, and have delayed certain new venture programs accordingly. We invested $8.6 million
in our multi-client data library during the first half of 2016, compared to $13.6 million in the same
period in 2015.
Our business has traditionally been seasonal, with the strongest demand for our services and
products often in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. As of June 30, 2016, our Solutions segment
backlog, which consists of commitments for (i) data processing work and (ii) both multi-client new
venture projects and proprietary projects by our Ventures group underwritten by our customers,
was $29.9 million, compared with backlog of $19.2 million at December 31, 2015 and $54.1
million at June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016 our Ocean Bottom Services segment backlog,
which consists of ocean bottom proprietary projects, was $28.6 million compared to a backlog of
zero at both December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015. As a result of the weakness in exploration
spending by E&P companies, our backlog over the last four quarters has been lower than
historical levels, however, backlog has increased a combined $39.8 million since the first quarter
2016 due to several new-multi client new venture projects and an OBS survey, which began
acquiring data offshore Nigeria during the second quarter. We anticipate that the majority of our
current backlog will be recognized as revenue in the remainder of 2016. We expect our full year
investment in our multi-client data library to be in the range of $10 to $20 million in 2016.
For the majority of the first half of 2016, our OBS segment was affected by potential E&P
customers delaying or canceling decisions to commit capital to OBS projects, causing our
vessels to remain idle.  However, as communicated previously, we mobilized our ocean bottom
vessels and crew during the second quarter of 2016 to conduct an OBS survey offshore Nigeria.
We began acquiring data in late June and expect to complete demobilization by late third quarter
of 2016. Despite the extended market downturn and uncertainty, we see significant long-term
potential for OceanGeo and our technologies to improve ocean bottom survey productivity, and
we expect long-term demand for ocean bottom surveys to increase. We believe that our
technology is well suited for additional opportunities in West Africa, and we continue to pursue
active tenders and leads for projects in the area.
27
Our traditional seismic contractor customers are also experiencing weakened demand due to the
reduction in seismic spending by their customers. Since early 2014, seismic contractors have
taken 35 seismic vessels, or about 29% of the fleet, out of the market. As a result, our Systems
segment continued to experience weak year-over-year sales as our revenues fell due to lower
demand for spare parts and repairs.
The marine seismic vessel market contraction has also negatively impacted the vessel software
market. Our Software segment net revenues decreased for the first half of 2016 compared to the
same period of 2015, primarily driven by reduced sales of Orca software licenses.
We continue to monitor the global economy, the demand for crude oil and natural gas and the
resulting impact on the capital spending plans and operations of our E&P customers to plan our
business. We remain confident that, despite current marketplace challenges described above,
we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of the next upturn in the energy cycle by
reducing our cost structure, shifting our focus toward E&P solutions and away from equipment
sales, and by diversifying our offerings across the E&P lifecycle.
It is our view that technologies that provide a competitive advantage through improved imaging,
lower costs or higher productivity will continue to be valued in our marketplace. We believe that
our newest technologies, such as Calypso, WiBand, and Marlin, will continue to attract customer
interest, because those technologies are designed to deliver enhanced image quality, efficiency,
and cost savings.
Cost Reduction Initiatives
During the second quarter of 2016, we implemented additional cost saving initiatives by reducing
our current workforce by over 12%. Additional reductions were needed to further streamline our
organization and right-size our company to bring it in line with our current revenue stream, while
maintaining the necessary core capabilities to continue our operations and strategic initiatives.
These additional reductions are expected to result in approximately $15.0 million of annualized
savings, (an estimated $9.0 million in 2016), in addition to the $80.0 million of expected annual
savings from prior cost reduction initiatives. We expect to begin realizing the vast majority of
these savings in the third quarter of this year.
WesternGeco Litigation
On July 2, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C.
reversed in part the district court’s judgment, holding the district court erred by including lost
profits in the Final Judgment. Lost profits were $93.4 million and prejudgment interest was
approximately $10.9 million of the $123.8 million Final Judgment. Pre-judgment interest on the
lost profits portion will be treated in the same way as the lost profits. Post-judgment interest will
likewise be treated in the same fashion. On July 29, 2015, WesternGeco filed a petition for
rehearing en banc before the Court of Appeals. On October 30, 2015 the Court of Appeals denied
WesternGeco’s petition for rehearing en banc.
On February 26, 2016, WesternGeco filed a petition for writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court.
We filed our response on April 27, 2016. On June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to disturb
the Court of Appeals ruling finding no lost profits as a matter of law.  Separately, in light of the
changes in case law regarding the standard of proof for willfulness in the Halo and Stryker cases,
the Supreme Court indicated that the case should be remanded to the Federal Circuit for a
determination of whether or not the willfulness determination by the District Court was
appropriate.
On May 4, 2016, after referral from the district court, a Magistrate Judge issued an order and
report and recommendation in the litigation.  The order and report recommended entry of a final
judgment against us on the royalty obligation plus interest, subject to final calculation upon entry
of judgment, which is expected to be approximately $22 million and recommended the district
court deny our motion to stay any obligation to pay the remaining $22 million that is not related to
lost profits. The district court has not yet decided whether to adopt the recommendation of the
magistrate.  We will pursue all available objections and appeals to the order and report and
recommendation.
As a result of the reversal by the Court of Appeals, as of June 30, 2015, we reduced our prior loss
contingency accrual by approximately $102 million, resulting in a current loss contingency
accrual of $22 million. Prior to the reduction in damages by the Court of Appeals, we arranged
with sureties to post an appeal bond at the trial court. The appeal bond is uncollateralized, but
the terms of the appeal bond arrangements provide the sureties the contractual right for as long
as the bond is outstanding to require us to post cash collateral. We have received a request for
$11 million in collateral and have exchanged correspondence with the sureties in connection
with this request. In July 2016, the sureties renewed their request for collateral and we are
continuing to discuss terms and options with them. The appeal bond will remain outstanding
during the pendency of appeals. See Footnote 7 “Litigation” of Footnotes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Exchange Offer
On April 28, 2016, we successfully completed an exchange offer (the “Exchange Offer”) and
consent solicitation (the “Consent Solicitation”) related to the Third Lien Notes. The Company did
not receive any cash proceeds in connection with the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation.
Under the terms of the Exchange Offer, for each $1,000 principal amount of Third Lien Notes
validly tendered for exchange and not validly withdrawn by an eligible holder (an “Exchange
Participant”) prior to 11:59 P.M., New York City time, on April 25, 2016, and accepted for
exchange by us, we offered the consideration (the “Exchange Consideration”) of (i) $1,000
principal amount of our new 9.125% Senior Secured Second Priority Notes due 2021 (the
“Second Lien Notes” and collectively with the Third Lien Notes, the “Notes”) plus (ii) either (a) for
Third Lien Notes tendered at or prior to 4:59 P.M., New York City time, on Friday, April 15, 2016
(the “Extended Early Tender Deadline”), ten (10) shares of our common stock (the “Early Stock
Consideration”), or (b) for Third Lien Notes tendered after the Extended Early Tender Deadline,
seven (7) shares of our common stock (the “Stock Consideration”) (such shares issued as the
Early Stock Consideration or the Stock Consideration, together with the Second Lien Notes, the
“Exchange Securities”), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in our confidential
Offer to Exchange and related Consent and Letter of Transmittal, each dated March 28, 2016 (the
“Offer Documents”).
As part of the Exchange Offer, each Exchange Participant had the opportunity to tender all or a
portion of its Third Lien Notes for a cash payment in lieu of the Exchange Consideration upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer Documents (the “Cash Tender Option”).
The aggregate amount of cash consideration that could be paid by us for tendered Third Lien
Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Cash Tender Option was approximately $15.0
million plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date of the
Exchange Offer (collectively, the “Cash Tender Cap”).
Concurrently with the Exchange Offer, we solicited consents from eligible holders to proposed
amendments to the Third Lien Notes Indenture (the “Proposed Amendments”). The Proposed
Amendments, among other things, provide for the release of the second priority security interest
in the collateral securing the Third Lien Notes and the grant of a third priority security interest in
the collateral, subordinate to liens securing all our senior and second priority indebtedness,
including the Credit Facility (as defined below) and the Second Lien Notes, and eliminate
substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default pertaining to the Third
Lien Notes.
The Exchange Offer, including the Cash Tender Option, and the Consent Solicitation expired at
11:59 P.M., New York City time, on April 25, 2016. In total, we accepted for exchange
approximately $146.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Third Lien Notes, or
approximately 83.72% of the $175.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Third
Lien Notes, validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Exchange Offer. The Third Lien Notes
validly tendered and not withdrawn in the Exchange Offer were accepted by us.
Because we received the necessary consents to effect the Proposed Amendments, any Third
Lien Notes not validly tendered pursuant to the Exchange Offer remain outstanding and the
holders are subject to the terms of the supplemental indenture implementing the Proposed
Amendments. No consideration was paid to holders of Third Lien Notes in connection with the
Consent Solicitation. After giving effect to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, the
aggregate principal amount of the Third Lien Notes remaining outstanding was approximately
$28.5 million as of April 28, 2016, and such Third Lien Notes are secured on a third priority basis
subordinated to the liens securing all senior and second priority indebtedness of the Company,
including under the Credit Facility and Second Lien Notes.
In exchange for approximately $120.6 million in aggregate principal amount of Third Lien Notes,
we issued approximately $120.6 million aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes and
1,205,477shares of our common stock, including 1,204,980 shares issued as Early Stock
Consideration and 497 shares issued as Stock Consideration. The Company utilized 508,464 of
treasury shares towards the total 1,205,477 shares issued. The securities issued in the
Exchange Offer were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration set forth in Section
4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company received no cash consideration in exchange for the
issuance of the Exchange Securities.
The Cash Tender Option was fully subscribed. Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Offer, we
accepted for purchase tendered Third Lien Notes at the lowest bid prices until the Cash Tender
Cap was reached, subject to proration. In exchange for aggregate cash consideration totaling
approximately $15.0 million, we purchased approximately $25.9 million in aggregate principal
amount of Third Lien Notes. We also paid in cash accrued and unpaid interest on Third Lien
Notes accepted for purchase in the Exchange Offer from the applicable last interest payment date
to, but not including, April 28, 2016.

Key Financial Metrics
Our results of operations have been materially affected by, restructuring charges and other
special charges and credits, which affect the comparability of certain of the financial information
contained in this Form 10-Q. In order to assist with the comparability to our historical results of
operations, certain of the financial metrics tables and the discussion below exclude charges and
credits related to restructuring and other special items. The gross profit (loss), income (loss) from
operations, costs and expenses below that are identified as “As Adjusted” reflect the exclusion of
the restructuring and other charges shown and described in the tables below. We believe that the
non-GAAP presentation of results of operations excluding these items provides a more
meaningful comparison of reporting periods.
The table below provides an overview of key financial metrics for our company as a whole and
our four business segments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the
same period of 2015 (in thousands).

We intend that the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations will
provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements, the
changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, and the primary
factors that accounted for those changes.
For a discussion of factors that could impact our future operating results and financial condition,
see (i) Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015, and (ii) Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in Part II of this Form 10-Q.
Results of Operations
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
Our consolidated net revenues of $36.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 (the
“Current Quarter”) decreased by $0.6 million, or (2)%, compared to total net revenues of $36.8
million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 (the “Comparable Quarter”). Our overall gross
profit (loss) percentage was 13% in the Current Quarter, as compared to (28)% in the
Comparable Quarter. For the Current Quarter, our loss from operations was $16.6 million,
compared to loss from operations of $40.7 million for the Comparable Quarter.
Net loss for the Current Quarter was $25.3 million, or $(2.22) per share, compared to net income
of $56.1 million, or $5.11 per diluted share, for the Comparable Quarter. The Current Quarter
result was negatively impacted by special items totaling $4.2 million which included severance
expense and a loss on the bond exchange. The Comparable Quarter results were positively
impacted by special items totaling $100.8 million, primarily related to an additional partial
reversal of a litigation reserve. Excluding these impacts, our net loss for the Current Quarter was
$21.2 million or $(1.85) per share, as adjusted and our net loss for the Comparable Quarter was
$44.7 million, or $(4.07) per share, as adjusted.
32
Net Revenues, Gross Profits and Gross Margins
Solutions — Net revenues for the Current Quarter decreased by $3.8 million, or (17)%, to $18.6
million, compared to $22.4 million for the Comparable Quarter. The decrease in revenues was
primarily due to continued slowdown in customers’ exploration spending impacting all
businesses within the Solutions segments. Despite the decrease in our revenues, gross loss
decreased by $4.4 million to $(3.5) million, representing a (19)% gross margin, compared to
$(7.9) million, which represented a (35)% gross margin in the Comparable Quarter due to our
cost control initiative implemented in 2014 and continued through 2016.
Systems — Net revenues for the Current Quarter decreased by $1.1 million, or (14)%, to $6.6
million, compared to $7.7 million for the Comparable Quarter. The decrease in revenues in the
Current Quarter was principally due to reduced activity by seismic contractors as they have taken
vessels out of service resulting in reduced demand for repairs and spare parts. Gross profit
decreased by $0.1 million to $1.4 million, representing a 20% gross margin for the Current
Quarter, compared to $1.5 million, representing a 20% gross margin, for the Comparable Quarter.
The decrease in gross profit and margin was the result of lower revenues and the change in the
sales mix of products sold during the Current Quarter, partially offset by our cost control initiative
implemented in 2014 and continued through 2016.
Software — Net revenues for the Current Quarter decreased $2.3 million, or (34)%, to $4.5
million, compared to $6.8 million for the Comparable Quarter. The decrease in revenues was due
to a decrease in Orca licensing revenues as a result of a low utilization rate for vessels deploying
our command and control software and unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates
impacted by Brexit. Gross profit for the Current Quarter decreased $(1.4) million to $2.8 million,
compared to $4.2 million, for the Comparable Quarter. The decrease in Gross profit was due to
declines in revenue partially offset by our cost control initiative implemented in 2014 and
continued through 2016. Gross margin was 62% in the Current and Comparable Quarter.
Ocean Bottom Services — Net revenues for the current period increased $6.4 million, or 100%,
as compared to the Comparable Quarter. Gross profit for the Current Quarter was $4.3 million,
representing a 66% gross margin for the Current Quarter, compared to a gross loss of $8.0
million, representing 0% gross margin for the Comparable Quarter. Gross margin for the current
period was favorably impacted by lease amendments executed with the vessel owners which
reduced a portion of our idle vessel expenses previously accrued. During the second quarter of
2016, our ocean bottom vessels and crew began acquiring data for an OBS survey offshore
Nigeria which generated $6.4 million of revenue during the current period.   During 2015, our
ocean bottom vessels and crew were idle. 
Operating Expenses
Research, Development and Engineering — Research, development and engineering expense
decreased $2.4 million, or (33)%, to $4.8 million, for the Current Quarter, compared to $7.2 million
for the Comparable Quarter. During the current down-cycle in E&P exploration spending, we
have been selective in spending on research and development (“R&D”) projects in order to
reduce expenses without sacrificing our ability to develop our technologies. As discussed above,
despite the extended market downturn and uncertainty, we see significant long-term potential for
OceanGeo and our technologies to improve ocean bottom survey productivity, and we expect
long-term demand for ocean bottom production surveys (4D) to increase.
Marketing and Sales — Marketing and sales expense decreased $3.9 million, or (45)%, to $4.7
million, for the Current Quarter, compared to $8.6 million, for the Comparable Quarter. During the
current down-cycle in oil and gas exploration spending, we have also reduced our payroll and
marketing expenses.
General, Administrative and Other Operating Expenses — General, administrative and other
operating expenses decreased $2.7 million, or (18)%, to $12.0 million, for the Current Quarter,
compared to $14.7 million for the Comparable Quarter. This decrease was primarily related to
reduced expenses in the Current Quarter due to restructuring actions taken in 2014 and
continued through 2016.
Other Items
Interest Expense, net — Interest expense, net, was $4.7 million for the Current Quarter consistent
with $4.6 million for the Comparable Quarter. Interest expense in both quarters is primarily
related to the Notes. For additional information, please refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources
— Sources of Capital” below.
Income Tax Expense — Income tax expense for the Current Quarter was $2.3 million compared
to $0.5 million for the Comparable Quarter. Our effective tax rates for the Current Quarter and
Comparable Quarter were (9.8)% and 0.9%, respectively. Income tax expense incurred for the
Current Quarter primarily relates to taxable income generated by our non-U.S. businesses, which
we are not able to offset with U.S. sourced operating losses. The effective tax rate was also
negatively impacted by the change in valuation allowance related to operating losses for which
we cannot currently recognize a tax benefit.
33
Other Income (Expense), Net — Other expense for the Current Quarter was $1.7 million
compared to other income of $102 million for the Comparable Quarter. This difference was
primarily related to a loss of $2.2 million on the exchange of bonds during the Current Quarter
compared to a reduction in our loss contingency accrual related to the WesternGeco legal
proceedings recorded in the Comparable Quarter.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015
Our consolidated total net revenues of $58.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 (the
“Current Period”) decreased by $18.6 million, or 24%, compared to total net revenues of $77.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 (the “Comparable Period”). Our overall gross
profit (loss) percentage for the Current Period was (7)%, compared to (34)%, for the Comparable
Period. For the Current Period, our income (loss) from operations was $(46.7) million, compared
to $(87.4) million, for the Comparable Period.
Net loss for the Current Period was $60.4 million, or $(5.48) per share, compared to a net income
of $0.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the Comparable Period. The Current Period results
were negatively impacted by special items totaling $4.2 million which included severance
expense and a loss on exchange of bonds. The Comparable Period results were positively
impacted by special items totaling $97.0 million, primarily related to an additional partial reversal
of a litigation reserve. Excluding the impact of these special items, adjusted net loss for Current
Period was $56.2 million, or $(5.10) per share compared to adjusted net income of $96.2 million,
or $(8.77) per share, in the Comparable Period.
Net Revenues, Gross Profits and Gross Margins
Solutions — Net revenues for the Current Period decreased by $9.7 million, or 23%, to $31.6
million, compared to $41.3 million for the Comparable Period. Revenues for our multi-client
businesses within Solutions decreased due to the continued softness of exploration spending.
Despite the decrease in our revenues, gross loss decreased by $4.9 million to a gross loss of
$(13.3) million, representing a (42)% gross margin, compared to a gross loss of $(18.2) million,
representing a (44)% gross margin, in the Comparable Period due to our cost control initiatives
started in 2014 and continued in 2016.
Systems — Net revenues for the Current Period decreased by $8.4 million, or 41%, to $12.0
million, compared to $20.4 million for the Comparable Period. Gross profit decreased by $3.4
million to $2.7 million, representing a 23% gross margin, for the Current Period compared to $6.1
million, representing a 30% gross margin, for the Comparable Period. This decrease in revenues
in the Current Period was principally due to reduced activity by seismic contractors as they have
taken vessels out of service resulting in a reduction in repairs and purchases of spares. Gross
profits and gross margin decreased due to the significant reduction in revenues in the Current
Period compared to the Comparable Period, partially offset by our cost control initiatives started
in 2014 and continued in 2016.
Software — Net revenues for the Current Period decreased by $6.8 million, or 44%, to $8.8
million, compared to $15.6 million for the Comparable Period. Gross profit for the Current Period
decreased by $4.5 million to $5.3 million, compared to $9.8 million in the Comparable Period.
The decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in Orca licensing revenues occurring in the
Current Period and, and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates impacted by
Brexit. Gross margin of 60% in the Current Period decreased from the 63% gross margin in the
Comparable Period primarily due to the decline in revenues in the Current Period, partially offset
by our cost control initiatives started in 2014 and continued in 2016.
Ocean Bottom Services — Net revenues for the Current Period increased $6.4 million, or 100%
compared to zero for the Comparable Period. Gross profit for the Current Period was $1.2 million
compared to gross profit of $(23.5) million for the Comparable Period. During the second quarter
of 2016, our ocean bottom vessels and crew began acquiring data for an OBS survey offshore
Nigeria which generated $6.4 million of revenue during the current period.   During 2015, our
ocean bottom vessels and crew were idle.
34
Operating Expenses
Research, Development and Engineering — Research, development and engineering expense
was $10.4 million for the Current Period, a decrease of $4.6 million, or (31)%, compared to $15.0
million for the Comparable Period. During the current down-cycle in E&P exploration spending,
we have been selective in spending on research and development (“R&D”) projects in order to
reduce expenses without sacrificing our ability to develop our technologies, including a one-time
spend of $1.0 million related to the acquisition of Sailwings (in-process R&D). As discussed
above, despite the extended market downturn and uncertainty, we see significant long-term
potential for OceanGeo and our technologies to improve ocean bottom survey productivity, and
we expect long-term demand for ocean bottom production surveys (4D) to increase.
Marketing and Sales — Marketing and sales expense was $8.7 million for the Current Period, a
decrease of $7.8 million, or (47)%, compared to $16.5 million, for the Comparable Period. During
the current down-cycle in E&P exploration spending, we have also reduced our payroll and
marketing expenses.
General, Administrative and Other Operating Expenses — General, administrative and other
operating expenses were $23.6 million for the Current Period, a decrease of $6.4 million, or
(21)%, compared to $30.0 million for the Comparable Period. This decrease was primarily the
result of the restructuring actions taken in 2014 and 2015 that reduced expenses in the Current
Period.
Other Items
Interest Expense, net — Interest expense, net, was $9.4 million for the Current Period compared
to $9.2 million for the Comparable Period. Interest expense in both quarters is primarily related to
the Notes. For additional information, please refer to “— Liquidity and Capital Resources —
Sources of Capital” below.
Other Income, Net — Other expense for the Current Period was $1.6 million compared to other
income of $98.4 million for the Comparable Period. This difference was primarily related to a loss
of $2.2 million on the exchange of bonds during the Current Period compared to a $102.0 million
reduction in our loss contingency accrual related to the WesternGeco legal proceedings, partially
offset by $1.9 million of facility restructuring charges recorded in the Comparable Quarter.

Comparable Period were (4.4)% and 85.5%, respectively. Our income tax expense for the
Current Period primarily relates to income from our non-US businesses. Our effective tax rate for
the Current Period was negatively impacted by the change in valuation allowance related to
operating losses for which we cannot currently recognize a tax benefit. See further discussion of
establishment of the deferred tax valuation allowance at Footnote 6 “Income Taxes” of Notes to

Liquidity and Capital Resources
Sources of Capital
As of June 30, 2016, we had $52.4 million of cash on hand and $11.9 million of undrawn
borrowing base availability under the Credit Facility. Our cash requirements include working
capital requirements and cash required for our debt service payments, multi-client seismic data
acquisition activities and capital expenditures. As of June 30, 2016, we had working capital of
$40.6 million. Working capital requirements are primarily driven by our investment in our (i) multi-
client data library ($8.6 million in the Current Period) and, (ii) working capital requirements on our
OBS survey in our Ocean Bottom Services segment, and (iii) our inventory purchase obligations.
Also, our headcount has traditionally been a significant driver of our working capital needs.
Because a significant portion of our business is involved in the planning, processing and
interpretation of seismic data services, one of our largest investments is in our employees, which
involves cash expenditures for their salaries, bonuses, payroll taxes and related compensation
expenses. As previously noted, since December 2014, we have reduced our workforce by over
50%, and reduced salaries by 10% for a majority of our employees and closed selected facilities.
These actions to result in annualized cash savings of approximately $80.0 million which we
began to fully benefit from these savings in the fourth quarter of 2015. In April, 2016, we
implemented additional cost saving initiatives by reducing our current workforce by over 12%.
These further reductions are expected to result in approximately $15.0 million of additional
annualized savings, with an estimated $9.0 million in 2016. We expect to begin realizing the vast
majority of these savings in the third quarter of this year.
Our working capital requirements may change from time to time depending upon many factors,
including our operating results and adjustments in our operating plan in response to industry
conditions, competition and unexpected events. In recent years, our primary sources of funds
have been cash flows generated from operations, existing cash balances, debt and equity
issuances and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.
Credit Facility, including Revolving Line of Credit
In August 2014, we and our material U.S. subsidiaries, GX Technology Corporation, ION
Exploration Products (U.S.A.), Inc. and I/O Marine Systems, Inc. (collectively, the “Subsidiary
Borrowers”) entered into a Revolving Credit and Security Agreement with PNC Bank, National
Association (“PNC”), as agent (the “Original Credit Agreement”), which was amended by the First
Amendment to Revolving Credit and Security Agreement in August 2015 (the “First Amendment”)
and the Second Amendment to Revolving Credit and Security Agreement in April 2016 (the
“Second Amendment”; the Original Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment and
the Second Amendment, the “Credit Facility”).
The Credit Facility is available to provide for the Borrowers’ general corporate needs, including
working capital requirements, capital expenditures, surety deposits and acquisition financing.
The maximum amount of the revolving line of credit under the Credit Facility is the lesser of $40.0
million and a monthly borrowing base (which may be recalculated more frequently under certain
circumstances).
The borrowing base under the Credit Facility will increase or decrease monthly using a formula
based on certain eligible receivables, eligible inventory and other amounts, including a
percentage of the net orderly liquidation value of our multi-client data library (not to exceed $15.0
million for the multi-client data library data component). As of June 30, 2016, the borrowing base
under the Credit Facility was $26.9 million, and there was $15.0 million of outstanding
indebtedness under the Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility requires us to maintain compliance with various covenants. At June 30, 2016,
we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Credit Facility. For further information
regarding our Credit Facility, see Footnote 4 “Long-term Debt” of Footnotes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.
Senior Secured Notes
In May 2013, we sold $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 8.125% Senior Secured
Second-Priority Notes due 2018 (the “Third Lien Notes”) in a private offering pursuant to an
indenture dated as of May 13, 2013 (the “Third Lien Notes Indenture”). Prior to the completion of
the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation on April 28, 2016, the Third Lien Notes were our
senior secured second-priority obligations. After giving effect to the Exchange Offer and Consent
Solicitation, the remaining aggregate principal amount of approximately $28.5 million of
outstanding Third Lien Notes became our senior secured third-priority obligations subordinated
to the liens securing all of our senior and second priority indebtedness, including under the
Credit Facility and Second Lien Notes.
Pursuant to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, we (i) issued approximately $120.6
million in aggregate principal amount of our new Second Lien Notes and 1,205,477 shares of
common stock, (utilizing 508,464 of treasury shares) in exchange for approximately $120.6
million in aggregate principal amount of Third Lien Notes, and (ii) purchased approximately
$25.9 million in aggregate principal amount of Third Lien Notes in exchange for aggregate cash
consideration totaling approximately $15.0 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Third
Lien Notes from the applicable last interest payment date to, but not including, April 28, 2016.
36
After giving effect to the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation, the aggregate principal
amount of the Third Lien Notes remaining outstanding was approximately $28.5 million and the
aggregate principal amount of Second Lien Notes outstanding was approximately $120.6 million.
See Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Exchange Offer” in Part II of this Form 10-Q.
The Third Lien Notes are guaranteed by our material U.S. subsidiaries, GX Technology
Corporation, ION Exploration Products (U.S.A.), Inc. and I/O Marine Systems, Inc. (the
“Guarantors”). The Third Lien Notes mature on May 15, 2018. Interest on the Third Lien Notes
accrues at the rate of 8.125% per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and
November 15 of each year during their term. In May 2014, the holders of the Third Lien Notes
exchanged their Third Lien Notes for a like principal amount of registered Third Lien Notes with
the same terms. For a complete discussion of the terms and security of the Third Lien Notes in
effect prior to the completion of the Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation on April 28, 2016,
see Footnote 6 to the Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015.
On or after May 15, 2015, we may on one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the Third Lien
Notes at the redemption prices set forth below, plus accrued and unpaid interest and special
interest, if any, on the Third Lien Notes redeemed during the twelve-month period beginning on
May 15th of the years indicated below:

The Third Lien Notes Indenture requires us to maintain compliance with various covenants. At
June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the Third Lien Notes
Indenture. For further information regarding the Third Lien Notes, see Footnote 3 “Long-term
Debt” of Footnotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
The Second Lien Notes are senior secured second-priority obligations guaranteed by the
Guarantors. The Second Lien Notes mature on December 15, 2021. Interest on the Second Lien
Notes accrues at the rate of 9.125% per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on June
15 and December 15 of each year during their term, beginning June 15, 2016, except that the
interest payment otherwise payable on June 15, 2021 will be payable on December 15, 2021.
The indenture dated April 28, 2016 governing the Second Lien Notes (the “Second Lien Notes
Indenture”) contains certain covenants that, among other things, limits or prohibits our ability and
the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to take certain actions or permit certain conditions to exist
during the term of the Second Lien Notes, including among other things, incurring additional
indebtedness, creating liens, paying dividends and making other distributions in respect of our
capital stock, redeeming our capital stock, making investments or certain other restricted
payments, selling certain kinds of assets, entering into transactions with affiliates, and effecting
mergers or consolidations. These and other restrictive covenants contained in the Second Lien
Notes Indenture are subject to certain exceptions and qualifications. At June 30, 2016, we were
in compliance with all of the covenants under the Second Lien Notes Indenture. All of our
subsidiaries are currently restricted subsidiaries.
On or after December 15, 2019, we may on one or more occasions redeem all or a part of the

Meeting our Liquidity Requirements
As of June 30, 2016, our total outstanding indebtedness (including capital lease obligations) was
approximately $165.5 million, consisting of approximately $120.6 million outstanding Second
Lien Notes, $28.5 million Third Lien Notes, $15.0 million outstanding indebtedness under our
Credit Facility, $6.1 million of equipment capital leases, and $0.7 million of other debt. In
addition, we have recorded an unamortized debt issuance costs of $5.3 million related to the
Second and Third Lein Notes.
For the Current Period, total capital expenditures, including the investments in our multi-client
data library, were $8.9 million. We began investing in MexicoSPAN early in the third quarter of
2015. This project is well funded by several of our major E&P customers. We expect investments
in our multi-client data library this year to be in the range of $10.0 million to $20.0 million. Our full
year investment in our multi-client data library has been significantly reduced in 2016 compared
to 2015 due to the uncertainty in the E&P industry and their reduced capital expenditures
budgets for 2016.
In late April, we completed our Exchange Offer, retiring approximately $25.9 million of our $175.0
million Third Lien Notes, using approximately $15.0 million of our cash. We believe that the
consummation of the Exchange Offer will ultimately improve our liquidity position and give us
more flexibility in how we invest cash into our businesses. See “Executive Summary –
Macroeconomic Conditions” above.
Subject to a payment obligation in the amount of the loss contingency we have established with
respect to our ongoing WesternGeco litigation (as discussed below), we believe that our existing
cash balance, and positive cash to be generated from operations through increased revenues
expected in the second half of 2016 and our borrowing availability under our Credit Facility will
be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, as set
forth below, a potential future requirement to satisfy a payment obligation with respect to the
WesternGeco litigation in excess of our loss contingency accrual could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Loss Contingency – WesternGeco Lawsuit
As of June 30, 2016, we have a loss contingency of $22 million accrued related to the legal
proceedings with WesternGeco. As described at Part II, Item 1. “Legal Proceedings,” there are
possible scenarios involving an outcome in the WesternGeco lawsuit that could materially and
adversely affect our liquidity. Prior to the reduction in damages by the Court of Appeals, we
arranged with sureties to post an appeal bond at the trial court. The appeal bond is
uncollateralized, but the terms of the appeal bond arrangements provide the sureties the
contractual right for as long as the bond is outstanding to require us to post cash collateral. We
have received a request for $11 million in collateral and have exchanged correspondence with
the sureties in connection with this request.
On May 4, 2016, after referral from the district court, a Magistrate Judge issued an order and
report and recommendation in the litigation.  The order and report recommended entry of a final
judgment against us on the royalty obligation plus interest, subject to final calculation upon entry
of judgment, which is expected to be approximately $22 million and recommended the district
court deny our motion to stay any obligation to pay the remaining $22 million. The district court
has not yet decided whether to adopt the recommendation of the magistrate.  We will pursue all
available objections and appeals to the order and report and recommendation.
We may not ultimately prevail in the final appeals process and we could be required to pay
damages up to the amount of the loss contingency accrual plus any additional amount ordered
by the court. Our assessment of our potential loss contingency may change in the future due to
developments at the appellate court and other events, such as changes in applicable law, and
such reassessment could lead to the determination that no loss contingency is probable or that a
greater loss contingency is probable, which could have a material effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Amounts of estimated loss contingency accruals as
disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or elsewhere are based on currently available
information and involve elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Actual losses may
exceed or be less than these accrual amounts.
38
Cash Flow from Operations
In the six months ended June 30, 2016 (the “Current Period”), we consumed $12.3 million of cash
from operating activities compared to a net consumption of $22.5 million for the six months ended
June 30, 2015 (the “Comparable Period”). The decrease in net cash used in operations was due
to improved operating results. Although revenues declined 24% as compared to prior year, the
impact of our cost reduction measures helped reduce our loss from operations by 59% as
compared to the prior year period. In addition, cash from operations received during the Current
Quarter also benefited from collections of cash from our accounts receivable generated in the
fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by payments of accounts payable.
Cash Flow from Investing Activities
Cash used in investing activities was $9.0 million, in Current Period compared to $30.6 million
for the Comparable Period. The principal uses of cash in our investing activities during the
Current Period were $8.6 million invested in our multi-client data library and $0.3 million of
capital expenditures on property, plant, equipment and seismic rental equipment.
The principal use of cash in our investing activities during the Comparable Period were $13.6
million invested in our multi-client data library, and $17.2 million for capital expenditures related
to property, plant and equipment.
Cash Flow from Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities was $11.9 million, in the Current Period, compared to $3.5
million of cash used in the Comparable Period. The primary use of cash in our financing activities
during the Current Period were $4.8 million for payments on equipment capital leases, $6.2
million of debt issuance costs and $1.0 million of stock repurchases. In addition, we borrowed
$15.0 million on our revolving line of credit offset by a payment of $15.0 million to repurchase
bonds.
The net cash used in financing activities during the Comparable Period was primarily related to
$3.6 million of repayments of long-term debt.
Inflation and Seasonality
Inflation in recent years has not had a material effect on our costs of goods or labor, or the prices
for our products or services. Traditionally, our business has been seasonal, with strongest
demand often occurring in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a complete
discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates. There have been no material
changes in the Current Period regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates. For
discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Footnote 15 “Recent Accounting
Pronouncements” of Footnotes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
Foreign Sales Risks
The majority of our foreign sales are denominated in United States dollars. Product revenues are
allocated to geographical locations on the basis of the ultimate destination of the equipment, if
known. If the ultimate destination of such equipment is not known, product revenues are
allocated to the geographical location of initial shipment. Service revenues, which primarily relate
to our Ventures and Data Processing divisions, are allocated based upon the billing location of
the customer. For the Current Period and Comparable Period, international sales comprised 79%
and 78%, respectively, of total net revenues. The total percentage of sales from foreign countries
increased in the Current Period compared to the Comparable Period due to our revenues in
North America decreasing at a higher rate than the decrease in revenues that we experienced in
the international markets.

accounts and unbilled receivable balances.
The loss of either of these customers or deterioration in our relationship with these customers
could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk
Refer to Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a
discussion regarding our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk. There have
been no material changes to those disclosures during the Current Period.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file with or submit to the SEC under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time period specified by the SEC’s rules and forms.
Disclosure controls and procedures are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, and
they include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. There was not any change in our internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended June 30, 2016,
which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

PART II — OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1. Legal Proceedings
WesternGeco
In June 2009, WesternGeco L.L.C. (“WesternGeco”) filed a lawsuit against us in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. In the lawsuit, styled
WesternGeco L.L.C. v. ION Geophysical Corporation, WesternGeco alleged that we had
infringed several method and apparatus claims contained in four of its United States patents
regarding marine seismic streamer steering devices.
The trial began in July 2012. A verdict was returned by the jury in August 2012, finding that we
infringed the claims contained in the four patents by supplying our DigiFIN® lateral streamer
control units and the related software from the United States and awarded WesternGeco the sum
of $105.9 million in damages, consisting of $12.5 million in reasonable royalty and $93.4 million
in lost profits.
In June 2013, the presiding judge entered a Memorandum and Order, ruling that WesternGeco is
entitled to be awarded supplemental damages for the additional DigiFIN units that were supplied
from the United States before and after the trial that were not included in the jury verdict due to
the timing of the trial. In October 2013, the judge entered another Memorandum and Order, ruling
on the number of DigiFIN units that are subject to supplemental damages and also ruling that the
supplemental damages applicable to the additional units should be calculated by adding
together the jury’s previous reasonable royalty and lost profits damages awards per unit,
resulting in supplemental damages of $73.1 million.
In April 2014, the judge entered another Order, ruling that lost profits should not have been
included in the calculation of supplemental damages in the October 2013 Memorandum and
Order and reducing the supplemental damages award in the case from $73.1 million to $9.4
million. In the Order, the judge also further reduced the damages award in the case by $3.0
million to reflect a settlement and license that WesternGeco entered into with a customer of ours
that had purchased and used DigiFIN units that were also included in the damage amounts
awarded against us.
In May 2014, the judge signed and entered a Final Judgment in the amount of $123.8 million.
The Final Judgment also included an injunction that enjoins us, our agents and anyone acting in
concert with us, from supplying in or from the United States the DigiFIN product or any parts
unique to the DigiFIN product, or any instrumentality no more than colorably different from any of
these products or parts, for combination outside of the United States. We have conducted our
business in compliance with the district court’s orders in the case, and we have reorganized our
operations such that we no longer supply the DigiFIN product or any part unique to the DigiFIN
product in or from the United States.
We and WesternGeco each appealed the Final Judgment to the United States Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. On July 2, 2015, the Court of Appeals reversed in part
the district court’s judgment, holding the district court erred by including lost profits in the Final
Judgment. Lost profits were $93.4 million and prejudgment interest was approximately $10.9
million of the $123.8 million Final Judgment. Pre-judgment interest on the lost profits portion will
be treated in the same way as the lost profits. Post-judgment interest will likewise be treated in
the same fashion. On July 29, 2015, WesternGeco filed a petition for rehearing en banc before
the Court of Appeals. On October 30, 2015 the Court of Appeals denied WesternGeco’s petition
for rehearing en banc.
On February 26, 2016, WesternGeco filed a petition for writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court.
We filed our response on April 27, 2016. On June 20, 2016, the Supreme Court refused to disturb
the Court of Appeals ruling finding no lost profits as a matter of law.  Separately, in light of the
changes in case law regarding the standard of proof for willfulness in the Halo and Stryker cases,
the Supreme Court indicated that the case should be remanded to the Federal Circuit for a
determination of whether or not the willfulness determination by the District Court was
appropriate.
On May 4, 2016, after referral from the district court, a Magistrate Judge issued an order and
report and recommendation in the litigation.  The order and report recommended entry of a final
judgment against us on the royalty obligation plus interest, subject to final calculation upon entry
of judgment, which is expected to be approximately $22 million and recommended the district
court deny our motion to stay any obligation to pay the remaining $22 million that is not related to
lost profits. The district court has not yet decided whether to adopt the recommendation of the
magistrate. We will pursue all available objections and appeals to the order and report and
recommendation.
As previously disclosed, we had taken a loss contingency accrual of $124 million. As a result of
the reversal by the Court of Appeals, as of June 30, 2015, we have reduced our loss contingency
accrual to its current amount of $22 million as of June 30, 2015. Our assessment of our potential
loss contingency may change in the future due to developments in the case and other events,
such as changes in applicable law, and such reassessment could lead to the determination that
no loss contingency is probable or that a greater or lesser loss contingency is probable. Any such
reassessment could have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.
41
Prior to the reduction in damages by the Court of Appeals, we arranged with sureties to post an
appeal bond at the trial court. The appeal bond is uncollateralized, but the terms of the appeal
bond arrangements provide the sureties the contractual right for as long as the bond is
outstanding to require us to post cash collateral. We have received a request for $11 million in
collateral and have exchanged correspondence with the sureties in connection with this request.
In July 2016, the sureties renewed their request for collateral and we are continuing to discuss
terms and options with them. The appeal bond will remain outstanding during the pendency of
appeals.
For additional discussion about the effect of posting an appeal bond on our liquidity, financial
condition and results of operations, see Item 2. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Loss
Contingency – WesternGeco Lawsuit” in Part I of this Form 10-Q.
Other Litigation
We have been named in various other lawsuits or threatened actions that are incidental to our
ordinary business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. Any claims against us, whether
meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, cause us to incur costs and expenses, require
significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational
resources. The results of these lawsuits and actions cannot be predicted with certainty. We
currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

On November 4, 2015, our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing
us to repurchase, from time to time from November 10, 2015 through November 10, 2017, up to
$25.0 million in shares of our outstanding common stock. The stock repurchase program may be
implemented through open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions, at
management’s discretion. The actual timing, number and value of shares repurchased under the
program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of
factors including the market price of the shares of our common stock and general market and
economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and compliance with the terms of our
outstanding indebtedness. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any
particular amount of common stock and may be modified or suspended at any time and could be
terminated prior to completion. Since the program’s inception on November 10, 2015 through
June 30, 2016, we had repurchased 451,792 shares our common stock at an average price per
share of $6.54, and we have approximately $22.0 million of remaining authorized capacity
available pursuant to the repurchase program. The number of shares repurchased and the
average price per repurchased share has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the one-for-fifteen
reverse stock split completed on February 4, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the closing sale price for
our common stock was $6.23 on the NYSE.
For additional information regarding the issuance and sale of unregistered securities pursuant to
the exchange offer we completed on April 28, 2016, see our Current Report on Form 8-K filed
with the SEC on April 28, 2016.
