PW5 visited the scene of accident and drew a rough sketch plan and took all necessary measurements.

4. The first offence describe in section 105 of the Land Transport Act says; 

"105. - (1) No person who is a holder of learner's permit, provisional licence, heavy goods vehicle driver's licence or public service vehicle driver's licence shall, whilst the concentration of alcohol in the blood of that person is more than 0.00 grams per 100 millilitres of blood, drive or attempt to drive -

(a) in the case of a holder of a learner's permit or provisional licence, any motor vehicle; or

(b) in the case of a holder of a heavy goods vehicle licence or public service vehicle licence, a heavy goods vehicle or public service vehicle.

(2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable on conviction to the prescribed penalty.

(3) Where a person is found guilty under this section and the person has no previous conviction for an offence under this section the court may, having regard to the circumstances of the case, discharge the person without conviction, or substitute any lesser penalty than that prescribed."

5. The penalty for first offence is mentioned in section 114 of Land Transport Act. That is;


	105(2)	Breach of zero alcohol limit	Same penalties as under section 103(1)(a)
	"103(1)(a)	Driving or attempting to drive with excess alcohol in the blood.	(a) First offence - $2,000/2 years and mandatory disqualification for from 3 months to 2 years (b) Second offence - $5,000/5 years and mandatory disqualification for from 6 months to 4 years. (c) Offence if 2 or more convictions for similar offence within the 5 years preceding the offence is $10,000/10 years and mandatory disqualification for from 12 months to 5 years"


6. Second Offence described in section 98(1) of the said Act. It says;

	98(1)	Reckless or dangerous driving	(a) First offence - $1000/12 months and disqualification for 6 months (b) Second or subsequent offence - $2000/2 years and disqualification for 12 months


8. I now turn to your mitigation. You have pleaded guilty and save court's time and resources. I am mindful of that. In your mitigation you said that you are 66 years of retired divorcee. You are a holder of clean driving licence for past 25 years. You are an Australian citizen. You asked forgiveness and leniency of this court. You are remorseful of your offence. You promise that you will not re offend. You asked non conviction as you are a first offender. 

9. You have asked non conviction and absolute discharged. The absolute discharge must be sparingly used. In State -v- Nand Kumar Crim. App. No. HAA0014.2000L, Gates J ( As he then was) said:

"Absolute discharges are appropriate only in a limited number of circumstances, such as where no moral blame attaches (R -v- O=Toole (1971) 55 Cr. App. R. 206) or where a mere technical breach of the law has occurred, perhaps by imprudence without dishonesty (R -v- Kavanagh (unreported) May 16th 1972CA)"

10. In this case, summary of facts indicates you were drunk and drove a vehicle. On top of that you met with an accident. You were out of control. You may have taken granted for Fiji road rules. Though you have a clean licence, you do not deserve non conviction or absolute discharge. Drunken behind the wheel creates serious repercussions some may lose their life even. Thus, I do not consider non conviction. 

11. In State v Ratuvou [2002] FJHC 140; HAA0060J.2002S (2 August 2002) her Ladyship Justice Nazhat Shameem differentiates the disqualification of Driving License under section 103(1) and 98(1) as follows;

"What is mandatory is a period of disqualification. The minimum mandatory term of disqualification (on first conviction) is 3 months. The Magistrate has a discretion to impose more than 3 months but may not impose-less.

12. However, you are a first offender. In sentencing, I draw my attention to sentencing principles which set out in Sentencing and Penalty Decree 2009.
 Section 4(2) provides;"In sentencing offenders a court must have regard to  

(a) the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence; 

(b) current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;

(c) the nature and gravity of the particular offence;

(d) the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;

(e) the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 

(f) whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so; 

(g) the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;

(h) any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;

(i) the offender's previous character;

(j) the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and 

(k) any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option." 

13. I now draw my attention to Section 15(3) of SENTENCING AND PENALTIES DECREE 2009 no: 42 of 2009

 "As a general principle of sentencing, a court may not impose a more serious sentence unless it is satisfied that a lesser or alternative sentence will not meet the objectives of sentencing stated in section 4, and sentences of imprisonment should be regarded as the sanction of last resort taking into account all matters stated in this Part."

Now I turn to the Case law in this regard. 

14. In Prasad v The State [1994] FJHC 132; Haa0032j.94s (30 September19994) S W Kepa J enunciated that the fact that Appellants arefirst offendersought to be a very strong mitigating factor in their favour. A prison sentence ought to be the last resort after the court has explored and exhausted all other alternative sentences. (Emphasize is mine)

15. In Prasad v State [1994] FJCA 19; Aau0023u.93s (24 May 1994), Fiji Court of Appeal held that ".... Courts ought to bend backwards to avoid immediate custodial sentence forfirst offenders."

16. It has been noted in Prasad v The State [1994] FJHC 132 (Supra) that criminologists recognise that a prison sentence should be the last resort especially where afirst offenderis concerned unless the charge is very serious or the offender is dangerous and imprisonment is called for in the public interest or in the interest of the offender himself. (Emphasize is mine). 

17. Thus according to the Sentencing Principles, you could be sentence to 2 years imprisonment for count one and 12 months for count two. The intention of legislature is clear that no one able to control a vehicle under the influence of liquor. To protect innocent pedestrians and property, deterrent sentence is enacted by the legislation. In that sense you attract custodial sentence. But you are a first offender and save court's time and resources. I therefore think you should be given another chance. 

18. In considering all these facts and law I impose following sentence on you. 

Count 1: $500 fine in default 50 days in imprisonment 

Count 2:$250 fine, In default of fine 25 days imprisonment for both counts. 

Driving License is disqualified for 3 months. 

The accused travel ban will be lifted after payment of full payment of fine( altogether $750). If payment is done, Senior Court Officer to inform the lifting travel ban. 

19. 28 days to appeal.
