
The profit before tax of $159.1 million was a $34.1 million (27%) increase on 2015. This was 
largely the result of an 8% increase in the delivered gold price ($1,600/oz) and a 7% decline 
in all in sustaining costs to $927/oz as further cost efficiencies were achieved across the 
business at the Duketon Gold Project. 
The profit after tax of $111.8 million was up $24.8m (29%) on the 2015 result.  Earnings per 
share also increased by 29% to 22.37 cents per share.
  EBITDA  increased  from  $181  million  in  FY2015  to  $234  million  in  FY2016  and  cost
efficiencies saw the EBITDA margin increase strongly from 39.0% to 46.7%. 
The  Board  of  Directors  has  declared  a  final  dividend  of  9  cents  per  share,  fully  franked 
payable on 31 August 2016.  The full year dividend of 13 cents per share represents a payout 
ratio of 13% of revenue and 58% of profit after tax for FY2016.

  Ongoing  optimisations  of  the  processing  plant  and  ore  blend  at  the  Duketon  South
Operations saw throughput increase 4% to 10.25 million tonnes for FY2016.
  Milled grade for the whole Duketon operation of 1.03g/t in FY2016 was lower than the grade 
of 1.11g/t in FY2015 primarily due to lower head grade at the Moolart Well mine which was 
as expected and reflective of the ore scheduled to be mined during the year.
  Gold  production  at  Duketon  of  305,084  ounces  for  FY2016  exceeded  the  upper  end  of 
annual guidance of 275-305koz.  All-in sustaining costs of $927 per ounce were 7% lower 
than the previous year due to ongoing cost efficiencies and were below the lower end of 
annual guidance. 
The 31 March 2016 Ore Reserves update saw reserves increase to 2.13 million ounces for 
the  Duketon  project  and  Regis  successfully  more  than  replaced  FY16  production.  The 
445,000 ounce (22%) increase in Ore Reserves in FY2016 net of depletion was the result of 
maiden reserves at Gloster and Baneygo and additions to existing reserves at Rosemont 
and Moolart Well.

Cashflow 
  Net  cash  from  operating  activities  for  the  year  was  $204.0  million,  up  44%  from  $142.0 
million  in  the  previous  year  reflecting  the  strong  operating  performance  and  gold  price 
environment.
  Cash and gold bullion holdings increased to $122.3 million as at 30 June 2016 (30 June 
2015: $64.5 million), an increase of $57.8 million after repayment of $20 million of bank debt, 
payment of $50 million in dividends and $1.8 million invested in equity investments. 
The full repayment of bank debt of $20 million during the year has resulted in Regis being 
debt free other than normal trade creditors and leasing arrangements.

Regis Managing Director, Mr Mark Clark commented: 
 
“It  is  pleasing  that  the  strong  operating  performance  at  Duketon  has  been  reflected  in  a  29% 
increase in 2016 earnings to $112 million.  The robust cash operating margin has seen cash on 
the balance sheet build and has underpinned the payment of 13cps in dividends for the year.  It is 
also exciting that our organic growth strategies are delivering opportunities to increase reserves 
and a higher medium term production outlook.”

Performance relative to the previous financial year 
Regis achieved an after tax profit of $111.8 million for the full year to 30 June 2016 which represents an improvement of 29% compared to 
the previous corresponding year result of $86.9 million. The strong Australian dollar gold price and commitment to maximising operational 
efficiencies and controlling costs are the key drivers in the current year result.
Sales 
Sales  revenue  for  the  year  ended  30  June  2016  increased  by  $35.3  million  (8%)  compared  to  the  previous  corresponding  period.  Gold 
production from the Company’s Duketon Gold Project remained steady for the year with production totalling 305,084 ounces (2015: 310,204 
ounces) however the average price of gold sold during the current year was $1,600 per ounce or 8% up on the previous year’s average sale 
price of $1,488 per ounce.
Cost of sales 
Cost of sales including royalties, but before depreciation and amortisation decreased by 6% to $260.0 million.
Depreciation and amortisation 
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased by $21.7 million or 41% over the previous corresponding period as the Company’s assets 
mature and depreciation and amortisation rates based on the units of production method increase as reserves are depleted.
Cash flow from operating activities 
Cash inflow from operating activities was $204.0 million, up 44% on the previous year due to the improved gold price achieved for ounces sold 
and the reduced cost base of those ounces. During the current year, the Company paid $22.9 million of income taxes. 
 
The Company has used this strong cash flow from operations to repay the debt owed under the Macquarie Bank financing facility ($20 million) 
and return $50 million to shareholders through two fully franked dividend payments. The early repayment of the loan means Regis is debt free 
other than normal trade creditors and leasing arrangements.
Gold Forward Contracts 
At the end of the financial year the Company had a total hedging position of 433,770 ounces, comprising 80,000 ounces of flat forward 
contracts with a delivery price of $1,454 per ounce and 353,770 ounces of spot deferred contracts with a weighted average forward price of 
$1,581 per ounce.  
 
Operational statistics have been condensed to report on Duketon North Operations (“DNO”) and Duketon South Operations (“DSO”). This is 
due to the plan to commence a number of new mining operations at satellite pits at the Duketon Gold Project in the next several years. DNO 
will include Moolart Well, Gloster, Dogbolter, Petra and Anchor pit as all are processed through the Moolart Well processing plant. In the 
current financial year, DNO operations were solely related to Moolart Well. DSO will include Garden Well, Rosemont, Erlistoun, Baneygo and 
the other satellite projects in that region all processed through the Garden Well processing plant (leaching circuit). During the current financial

year, DSO operations only included production from Garden Well and Rosemont. This grouping aligns with the operating segments reported 
in note 1.

DNO produced 76,139 ounces of gold for the year at an all-in sustaining cost of $934 per ounce. Although production was in line with annual 
guidance it was 23% lower than the previous year due to a 21% decline in the head grade of the ore being milled. The lower head grade was 
expected and reflective of the ore scheduled to be mined during the year. Production at DNO in the 2017 financial year is expected to increase 
with the inclusion of higher grade ore from the Gloster deposit. Mining commenced at Gloster in the September 2016 quarter with first gold 
expected to be produced in the December 2016 quarter.

Production  at  DSO  for  the  year was  228,945  ounces  of  gold  at  an  all-in  sustaining  cost  of  $924  per  ounce  which  was  above  the  annual 
production guidance and an 8% increase on the previous year. Production benefited from improvements to the processing facility during the 
year with both gold recoveries and mill throughput rates increasing at the DSO.
Production Guidance 
Regis is expecting operation in the 2017 financial year to build on the strong performance of the Duketon project in the current year where 
production of 305,084 ounces at AISC of $927 per ounce was achieved against guidance of 275-305,000 ounces at AISC of $970-1,070 per 
ounce. Gold production for the next financial year is expected to be in the following guidance range: 
-  Gold production:  300,000 – 330,000 ounces 
- 
-  All-in sustaining cost: $980 – 1,050 per ounce 
 
Forecast 2017 production growth is the result of the positive grade impact from new satellite projects at Gloster and Erlistoun, and the 
optimisation of steady state of the open pit operations at Moolart Well, Garden Well and Rosemont.
Cash cost per ounce – incl. royalties: $840 – 910 per ounce

Baneygo Gold Project 
The 100% owned Baneygo gold project is located 12 kilometres south of the Rosemont gold mine and is hosted in a quartz dolerite unit believed 
to be the same unit hosting gold at Rosemont. Regis has been drilling around the four known small deposits at Baneygo and along strike since 
June 2015 completing 35,820 metres of RC and diamond drilling. An additional discovery in Idaho has also been made along this Rosemont to 
Baneygo trend as announced on the ASX on 14 January 2016. 
 
In March 2016, Regis announced a maiden Ore Reserve at Baneygo of 3.6 million tonnes at 1.16g/t Au for 136,000 ounces of gold. The quoted 
Reserve does not include Idaho, the southern extremity of which is only 700 metres along strike from the northern end of Baneygo, or the 
sparsely drilled but mineralised 4 kilometres along strike to the south of Baneygo.  
 
Further drilling programmes are planned to test along strike extensions. Mining at the Baneygo deposit will be scheduled along with the other 
satellite deposits in the vicinity of the Duketon South Operations.
Gloster Gold Project 
The 100% owned Gloster gold deposit is located 26km west of Moolart Well and was acquired by Regis in June 2015. Gloster was historically 
mined from 1902-1908 and was extensively drilled from 1984-1996. A Resource estimate was completed in 1997 (in compliance with the 1996 
JORC Code and Guidelines) for 8.28MT at a grade of 1.37g/t gold for 365,000 ounces. 
 
During the year, Regis completed an extensive RC drilling programme to infill the existing gold Resource and to test for extensions of gold 
mineralisation below the current historical level of drilling in the fresh rock zone. A total of 177 RC holes were drilled for 21,287 metres which 
enabled an updated Mineral Resource estimate of 21.3 million tonnes at a grade of 0.77 g/t gold for 528,000 ounces. The Resource estimate 
was completed in-house using the Ordinary Kriging estimation technique based on 73,253 metres of drilling of which approximately 30% was 
completed  by  the recent infill  drill  program.  This  estimate  has  been  validated  by  an independently  completed  calculation  using Multiple 
Indicator Kriging. 
 
In March 2016, Regis announced a maiden Ore Reserve at Gloster of 7.0 million tonnes at 1.00g/t Au for 226,000 ounces of gold.  
A Mining Lease was granted over the Gloster gold deposit during the period and final statutory approvals were received in July 2016. It is 
projected that mining should commence later in the September 2016 quarter with first gold production in the December 2016 quarter. The 
Gloster deposit will be mined with ore hauled overland to the 2.5-3 million tonne per annum DNO processing plant and is expected to produce 
in the order of 70,000 ounces of gold per annum for approximately 3 years.

Directors’ Report (continued) 
 
Tooheys Well 
The Tooheys Well gold prospect is located on a granted Mining Lease, 2.5km south of the Garden Well gold mine. Gold mineralisation was 
previously defined in two north-south trending Western and Eastern shear zones, 100 metres apart hosted in chert and fine grained sediments. 
Total RC drilling of 120 holes for 19,336 metres and 7 diamond holes for 720 metres were carried during the period to follow up anomalous 
gold mineralisation in the Eastern and Western shear zones. 
 
This drilling has demonstrated gold mineralisation continuity both along strike and at depth in the Eastern shear zone which is now mineralised 
over a strike length in excess of 500 metres from 690900mN to 6909500mN based on a 40m x 20m drilling pattern. Subsequent to year end, 
the Company announced a Maiden Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate at Tooheys Well of 14.6 million tonnes at 1.16g/t gold for 547,000 
ounces at a 0.4 g/t gold cut-off grade. 
 
Infill resource drilling and extensional drilling both immediately north and south of the more than 750 metres of strike covered by the Mineral 
Resource Estimate is being expedited with a view to including the results in an update to the Resource estimate to be used as the basis for a 
maiden Ore Reserve estimate.
Coopers 
The Coopers gold prospect is located on a granted Mining Lease, 11 kilometres south of Moolart Well and 600 metres north of Dogbolter, and 
is located on the same shear zone hosting those two deposits. Earlier extensive Aircore drilling and a limited 10 hole RC drilling programme by 
Regis on 40 metre and 80 metre spaced east-west traverses defined gold mineralisation in the oxide zone over a strike distance of 400 metres.  
 
Regis drilled 40 Aircore holes and 62 RC holes for 8,687 metres during the period to test the strike continuation and follow up anomalous gold 
mineralisation at Coopers. Analytical results have been received and provide enough data to complete a Resource estimation. A diamond 
drilling programme is also planned to determine bulk densities and metallurgical and geotechnical work to enable a Reserve estimate to be 
completed.
Russell’s Find 
The Russell’s Find deposit is located 6.5km south of the Garden Well pit.  
 
Gold mineralisation at Russell’s Find is contained in steep east dipping quartz-carbonate-biotite veins contained in a package of moderate east 
dipping carbonated ultramafic with a footwall sequence of chert, BIF and fine grained silicified shale.  
 
An RC drilling programme was carried out during the year to validated and extend the current JORC 2004 gold resource of 0.4 million tonnes 
at 3.86g/t gold for 55,000 ounces of gold using a 1g/t cut-off grade. The results from the drilling programme were used in the updated Mineral 
Resource estimate released to the ASX in July 2016 of 2.4 million tonnes at 1.05g/t gold for 81,000 ounces of gold using a 0.4g/t cut-off.
Duketon Gold Exploration Joint Venture  
Regis is spending $1 million in the joint venture area over a two year period to earn a 75% interest in any mining project that is confirmed by 
a Regis decision to mine. A total of 9,516 first pass lag soil samples were collected on the Duketon Mining JV tenements to date to complete 
the first pass programme. This reconnaissance lag sampling was completed on a 400m x 100m grid, and lag sampling across mineralised trends 
was completed on a 200m x 50m grid. Gold and pathfinder element results have been received for all of the samples collected and contouring 
of gold results has been completed. Numerous +75ppb gold anomalies of interest have been defined and require further investigation prior to 
follow up infill lag sampling/mapping and subsequent air core drilling.  
 
The Petra North project is located in the joint venture area immediately adjacent to Regis’ 100% owned Petra project which has a reported 
JORC 2012 Resource of 44,000 ounces. A preliminary air core drill programme was designed to test for extensions of the known mineralisation 
at Petra into the JV tenement. Drilling commenced in April 2016 and by year end, 86 AC holes were completed for 7,266 metres. Gold results 
from this drilling programme include encouraging intercepts that will be followed up with an infill drilling programme.
Moolart Well Gold Project 
An RC drill programme was planned at the southern end of the Stirling pit at Moolart Well looking for extensions of known mineralisation 
encountered during mining that may extend outside of current pit designs. Drilling commenced in April 2016 and by the end of the year, 27 
RC holes for 2,616 metres and 9 AC holes for 611 metres had been completed. Encouraging results were returned and follow up drilling is 
planned.
McPhillamys Gold Project 
The McPhillamys Gold Project is located approximately 35 kilometres south east of the town of Orange and 30 kilometres west of the town of 
Bathurst in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia.  The project is approximately 250 kilometres west of Sydney. 
 
The project area consists of four granted exploration permits covering 477 square kilometres in two discrete locations approximately 25 
kilometres  apart.  Early  stage  feasibility  work  continued  during  the  year,  particularly  focussed  on  the  key  infrastructure  requirements  for 
development of the project. A 26,000 metre infill drilling programme is scheduled to commence in August 2016 aimed at Resource definition 
and metallurgical studies.

Shares Issued as a Result of the Exercise of Options 
During the financial year, employees exercised unlisted options to acquire 72,546 fully paid ordinary shares in Regis Resources Limited at a 
weighted average exercise price of $2.40 per share.
Indemnification and Insurance of Directors and Officers 
The Company has entered into an Indemnity Deed with each of the directors which will indemnify them against liabilities incurred to a third 
party (not being the Company or any related company) where the liability does not arise out of negligent conduct including a breach of good 
faith.  The Indemnity Deed will continue to apply for a period of 10 years after a director ceases to hold office. The Company has entered into 
a Director’s Access and Insurance Deed with each of the directors pursuant to which a director can request access to copies of documents 
provided to the director whilst serving the Company for  a period of 10 years after the director ceases to hold office.   There are  certain 
restrictions on the directors’ entitlement to access under the deed.  In addition the Company will be obliged to use reasonable endeavours to 
obtain and maintain insurance for a former director similar to that which existed at the time the director ceased to hold office. 
 
The Company has, during or since the end of the financial year, paid an insurance premium in respect of an insurance policy for the benefit of 
the directors, secretaries, executive officers and employees of the Company and any related bodies corporate as defined in the insurance 
policy.  The insurance grants indemnity against liabilities permitted to be indemnified by the Company under Section 199B of the Corporations 
Act 2001.  In accordance with commercial practice, the insurance policy prohibits disclosure of the terms of the policy including the nature of 
the liability insured against and the amount of the premium.

Principles of Remuneration  
The  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  is  charged  with  formulating  the  Group’s  remuneration  policy,  setting  each  director’s 
remuneration and reviewing the Executive Chairman’s remuneration recommendations for KMPs to ensure compliance with the Remuneration 
Policy  and  consistency  across  the  Group.  Recommendations  of  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  are  put  to  the  Board  for 
approval.   
 
Remuneration  levels  for  KMP  are  set  to  attract,  retain  and  incentivise  appropriately  qualified  and  experienced  directors  and  executives. 
Decisions as to the appropriateness of remuneration packages are based on: 
 
- 
-
the state of the employment market (using independently sourced market surveys);  
the  capability  and  experience  of  the  relevant  employee,  their  relativity  within  the  Group  and  their  ability  to  influence  the  Group’s 
performance;  
the Group’s overall operating and financial performance, and;  
total returns to shareholders on an absolute and comparative basis.
- 
- 
 
Various short and long-term performance hurdles and maximum achievable remuneration levels are set for each financial year to provide 
guidance for management and employees.

Historical  and  current  earnings  are  one  of  a  number  of  criteria  used  by  the  Remuneration  and  Nomination  Committee  to  assess  the 
performance  of  directors  and  executives.  Other  criteria  used  in  this  assessment  include  gold  production  and  operating  costs,  safety 
performance,  execution  of  development  projects,  exploration  success,  growth  of  business  through  acquisitions  and  effectiveness  of 
communications with regulators, shareholders, investors and other stakeholders. 
 
During the year Ernst & Young (EY) were engaged to provide advice on implementing remuneration structures in the form of Short Term 
Incentives  (STI)  and  Long  Term  Incentives  (LTI)  for  KMP  going  forward  and  to  benchmark  current  remuneration  against  the  industry.  No 
remuneration recommendations, as defined by the Corporations Act, were provided by EY.  
 
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee consider the advice from EY along with other factors, in making its remuneration decisions.
Fixed Remuneration 
Fixed remuneration consists of base remuneration (including any fringe benefit tax charges related to employee benefits), as well as employer 
contributions to superannuation funds.  The Group allows KMP to salary sacrifice superannuation for additional benefits (on a total cost basis). 
 
Remuneration levels are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Nomination Committee through a process that considers individual and 
overall  performance  of  the  Group.    In  addition,  external  consultants  may  provide  analysis  and  advice  to  ensure  the  key  management 
personnel’s remuneration is competitive in the market place, as required.
Performance-Linked Remuneration  
Performance linked remuneration includes both long-term and short term incentives and is designed to reward key management personnel 
for meeting or exceeding their objectives.
Short-term incentives 
Each year the Executive Chairman reviews the performance of the KMPs and makes recommendations to the Remuneration and Nomination 
Committee in relation to the awarding of any short-term incentives.   
 
In addition, the Remuneration and Nomination Committee assess the actual performance of the Group, the separate departments and the 
individuals’ personal performance. A STI may be recommended at the discretion of the Remuneration and Nomination Committee where 
Group and department objectives have been met or exceeded. 
 
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee recommends the cash incentive to be paid to the executive directors for approval by the Board. 
No such STIs have been recommended for the 2016 financial year.
Long-term incentives 
Options have been issued under the Regis Resources Limited 2014 Share Option Plan (the “Option Plan”). The objective of the Option Plan was 
to link the achievement of the Group’s operational targets with the remuneration received by the key management personnel charged with 
meeting those targets. The total potential long-term incentive available was set at a level so as to provide sufficient incentive to the KMP to 
achieve the operational targets such that the cost to the Group was reasonable in the circumstances. 
 
The Option Plan provided for key management personnel and employees to receive a set amount of options over ordinary shares for no 
consideration. The ability to exercise the options is conditional upon the employee remaining with the Group throughout the vesting period. 
There are no other performance criteria that must be met. 
 
The details of options issued to executive directors and KMP’s for the 2016 financial year are listed in Table 3. No new benefits under the 
Option Plan will be issued to executive directors or other KMP’s in the 2017 financial year.

Remuneration Report (Audited) (Continued)
2017 Executive Remuneration Incentive Plan 
For the 2017 and subsequent financial years, the Company has implemented an Executive Remuneration Incentive Plan for executive directors 
and other KMPs which sets out the performance hurdles for both STI and LTI and replaces share options with performance rights as the LTI 
compensation methodology. The Fixed Remuneration and STI will remain as cash payments. The objectives and principles of the Company’s 
new remuneration policy include: 
 
- 
- 
-
To align the objectives of executive directors and other KMP’s with the interests of shareholders and reflect Company strategy; 
To provide competitive rewards to attract, retain and incentivise high calibre executives; and 
For total remuneration to include a competitive fixed component and an “at risk” component based on performance hurdles and key 
performance indicators.
The STI is the annual component of the “at risk” reward opportunity which is payable in cash upon the successful achievement of work related 
financial and non-financial key performance indicators. These KPI’s are chosen to represent the key drivers of short term success for the 
Company with reference to Regis’ long term strategy. 
 
The LTI refers to the “at risk” reward opportunity which takes the form of performance rights, being the issue of shares in Regis in the future, 
subject to meeting predetermined performance and vesting conditions. 
 
Subsequent to the end of the financial year, the Board set the following STI key performance indicators and LTI performance hurdles based 
upon recommendations from the Remuneration and Nomination Committee.

Salaries awarded effective 1 July used as a base for determining value component for 2017 STI’s and LTI’s 
 
An overarching review by the board of each individual’s performance against agreed performance 
measures and a review of quantitative factors around the Company’s performance and the macro 
economic environment will determine the achievable percentage (between 0%-100%) of the maximum 
potential STI and LTI available to be awarded, subject further to the level of achievement against detailed 
KPI’s listed below. 
 
This maximum achievable STI and LTI percentage will automatically be 0% in a given financial year in the 
event of a workplace fatality at any of the Company’s operations in that year. 
 
Combination of specific Company Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
- 
- 
- 
 
Vesting may occur after year 2 subject to the following performance hurdles measured at 30 June 2018: 
-
KPI 1: EBITDA relative to internal targets (35%(i)); 
KPI 2: Production relative to stated guidance (35%(i)); and 
KPI 3: Safety and environmental performance targets (30%(i)).
Relative Total Shareholder Return (25%(i)) measured on a sliding scale against a select peer group of 
comparator companies. (ASX code: AQG, BDR DRM, EVN, KRM, MML, MOY, NCM, NST, OGC, PRU, RMS, 
RSG, SAR, SBM, SLR, TGZ, TRY);
-  Absolute Total Shareholder Return (25%(i)); 
-  Absolute earnings per share (“EPS”) (25%(i)) measured against a pre-determined target(ii) set by the
board (as an average across two 12 month periods); and 
Reserve growth and production replacement over the two year vesting period (25%(i))
-
(i)  Represents the maximum award if stretch targets are met. 
(ii)  Targets and actual outcomes for each of the STI and LTI performance measures will be disclosed in the relevant remuneration report in
the year the award may vest. This is to recognise commercial sensitivity of disclosing key organisational metrics.
To  maximise  engagement  of  executives  and  align  with  the long-term  interests  of  shareholders,  the  initial  grant  of  LTI’s  have  a  two  year 
performance/vesting period with a one year holding lock restricting trading on any shares issued under the plan. Subsequent grants of rights 
will apply a performance/vesting period after three years.  
 
EY also provided market data to assist the board in establishing the appropriate remuneration levels for the Company’s executive directors 
and other KMP’s.

Service Contracts  
The Group has entered into service contracts with each KMP. The service contract outlines the components of remuneration paid to each key 
management person but does not prescribe how remuneration levels are modified year to year. Remuneration levels are reviewed each year 
to take into account cost-of-living changes, any change in the scope of the role performed by the key management person and any changes 
required to meet the principles of the remuneration policy. No service contract specifies a term of employment or entitlement to performance 
based incentives, except as detailed below for the Executive Chairman. 
 
Mr Mark Clark, the Company’s Executive Chairman, is employed under a fixed term contract, with the following significant terms: 
- 
- 
-  Opportunity to earn a performance based STI determined by the Board. 
 
Each key management person, except as specified below, is subject to a notice period of 1 month which the Company may pay in part or full 
of  the  required  notice  period.    The  key  management  personnel  are  also  entitled  to  receive,  on  termination  of  employment,  statutory 
entitlements of accrued annual and long service leave, and any accrued superannuation contributions would be paid to their fund.  In the case 
of a genuine redundancy, executives would receive their statutory entitlements based on completed years of service. 
 
The Executive Chairman’s termination provisions are as follows:
Current contract has a three year term to 3 May 2018; 
Fixed remuneration of $650,000 per annum before superannuation (2015: $550,000) subject to annual review; and

Notes to the Financial Statements: Basis of preparation | 30 June 2016
Basis of preparation 
Regis Resources Limited (“Regis” or the “Company”) is a for profit company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia, whose 
shares are publicly traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. Its registered office and principal place of business is: 
 
Regis Resources Limited 
Level 1 
1 Alvan Street 
Subiaco  WA  6008 
 
A description of the nature of operations and principal activities of Regis and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) is included in the 
Directors’ Report, which is not part of these financial statements. 
 
The financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 26 August 2016. 
 
The financial report is a general purpose financial report which: 
-
has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  requirements  of  the  Corporations  Act  2001,  Australian  Accounting  Standards  and  other 
authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) and complies with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB); 
has been prepared on a historical cost basis except for assets and liabilities and share-based payments which are required to be measured 
at fair value. The basis of measurement is discussed further in the individual notes; 
is presented in Australian dollars with all values rounded to the nearest thousand dollars ($’000) unless otherwise stated, in accordance

Principles of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group. A list of controlled entities (subsidiaries) at year end is 
contained in note 25.  
 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the parent company, using consistent accounting 
policies. Adjustments are made to bring into line any dissimilar accounting policies that may exist. 
 
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, all intercompany balances and transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses 
resulting from intra-group transactions have been eliminated. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is obtained to the 
date on which control is disposed. The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. 
 
Foreign currencies 
Both the functional currency of each entity within the Group and the Group’s presentation currency is Australian dollars.  
 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in Australian dollars at the exchange rate on that day. Foreign currency monetary assets 
and  liabilities  are  translated  to  Australian  dollars  at  the  reporting  date  exchange  rate.  Foreign  currency  gains  and  losses  are  generally 
recognised in profit or loss.  
 
Other accounting policies 
Significant and other accounting policies that summarise the measurement basis used and are relevant to an understanding of the financial 
statements are provided throughout the notes to the financial statements. Where possible, wording has been simplified to provide clearer 
commentary on the financial report of the Group. Accounting policies determined non-significant are not included in the financial statements. 
There have been no changes to the Group’s accounting policies that are no longer disclosed in the financial statements.

Notes to the Financial Statements: Performance for the year | 30 June 2016
Segment Information
Performance for the year 
This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group. This covers both profitability and the resultant return to shareholders via 
earnings per share combined with cash generation and the return of cash to shareholders via dividends. 
 
1. 
Operating  segments  are  reported  in  a  manner that is  consistent  with the  internal reporting  provided  to the Executive  Chairman  and  his 
executive management team (the chief operating decision makers). The Group has two reportable segments which comprise the Duketon 
Gold  Project;  being Duketon  North  Operations  (“DNO”),  currently  only  comprising  Moolart  Well  and  Duketon  South  Operations  (“DSO”), 
currently incorporating Garden Well and Rosemont.  Other than the name, the segments are unchanged from those reported at 30 June 2015. 
A number of new mining operations at satellite pits will commence in the next several years. In addition to Moolart Well, DNO will include 
Gloster, Dogbolter, Petra and Anchor pits as all will be processed through the Moolart Well processing plant. DSO will add Erlistoun, Baneygo 
and the other satellite projects in that area to the Garden Well leaching circuit. 
 
Unallocated items comprise corporate administrative costs (including personnel costs, share based payments, occupancy costs and investor 
and corporate costs), interest revenue, finance costs, net gains and losses on derivatives, exploration and evaluation assets relating to areas 
of interest where an economically recoverable reserve is yet to be delineated, cash, derivative assets and income tax assets. 
 
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire property, plant and equipment, conduct exploration and 
evaluation activities and develop mine properties.  
 
The following table presents financial information for reportable segments for the years ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015:

Accounting Policies 
Gold sales 
Revenue is recognised and measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, when the amount of revenue can be reliably 
measured and it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Group. The specific recognition criteria for the Group’s gold sales is 
upon dispatch of the gold bullion from the mine site as this is the point at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership and control of 
the product passes to the customer. Adjustments are made for variations in gold price, assay and weight between the time of dispatch and 
the time of final settlement. 
 
Interest 
Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest method.

Gold forward contracts 
As part of the risk management policy of the Group and in compliance with the conditions required by the Group’s financier, the Group enters 
into gold forward contracts to manage the gold price of a proportion of anticipated gold sales. The counterparty to the gold forward contracts 
is Macquarie Bank Limited (“MBL”).  
 
It is management’s intention to settle each contract through physical delivery of gold and as such, the gold forward sale contracts disclosed 
below do not meet the criteria of financial instruments for accounting purposes. This is referred to as the “normal purchase/sale” exemption. 
Accordingly, the contracts will be accounted for as sale contracts with revenue recognised once the gold has been delivered to MBL or its 
agent. 
 
Open contracts at balance date are summarised in the table below:

The net gain on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss relates to sold gold call options that do not qualify for hedge accounting. 
During the current financial year, the Group sold gold call options for 73,000 ounces with a weighted average exercise price of A$1,700/oz 
(2015: 7,000 ounces at A$1,409/oz).  Offsetting the premium income received during the current year is the fair value of open contracts at 
balance date, recognised on the balances sheet as “derivative liabilities”. In the prior year, there were no open contracts at balance date and 
the net gain reflected premiums received. For more information on the measurement and recognition of derivatives, refer to note 21.

Depreciation  
Depreciation of mine specific plant and equipment and buildings and infrastructure is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on 
a unit-of-production basis over the economically recoverable reserves of the mine concerned, except in the case of assets whose useful life is 
shorter than the life of the mine, in which case the straight-line method is used. The unit of account is tonnes of ore milled. 
 
Depreciation of non-mine specific plant and equipment is charged to the statement of comprehensive income and exploration and evaluation 
assets on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of plant and equipment in current and comparative periods 
as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
 
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date. 
 
Amortisation 
Mine properties are amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the economically recoverable reserves of the mine concerned. The unit of 
account is tonnes of ore milled.
Plant and equipment: 3 - 20 years

Key estimates and assumptions 
Unit-of-production method of depreciation/amortisation 
The Group uses the unit-of-production basis when depreciating/amortising life of mine specific assets which results in a 
depreciation/amortisation charge proportionate to the depletion of the anticipated remaining life of mine production. Each item’s 
economic life, which is assessed annually, has due regard for both its physical life limitations and to present assessments of economically 
recoverable reserves of the mine property at which it is located.

Earnings per Share
Notes to the Financial Statements: Performance for the year | 30 June 2016 
 
4. 
 
Accounting Policy 
Earnings per share (“EPS”) is the amount of post-tax profit attributable to each share. The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for 
ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
 
Diluted EPS takes into account the dilutive effect of all potential ordinary shares, being unlisted employee share options on issue.

This section shows the assets used to generate the Group’s trading performance and the liabilities incurred as a result. Liabilities relating to 
the Group’s financing activities are addressed in the capital structure and finance costs section on page 45. 
 
8.  Gold Bullion Awaiting Settlement 
 
Accounting Policy 
Bullion awaiting settlement comprises gold that has been received by the refiner prior to period end but which has not yet been delivered into 
a sale contract. Bullion awaiting settlement is initially recognised at the expected selling price and adjustments for variations in the gold price 
are made at the time of final settlement. 
 
Due to the short-term nature of the bullion awaiting settlement, the carrying value is assumed to approximate fair value. The maximum 
exposure to credit risk is the fair value.

Gold bullion awaiting settlement 
 
At balance date, gold bullion awaiting settlement comprised 12,538 ounces valued at a weighted average realisable value of $1,815/oz (2015: 
8,158 ounces at $1,558/oz). 
 
9. 
 
Accounting Policy 
Receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at the amounts considered receivable (financial assets at amortised cost). 
Balances within receivables do not contain impaired assets, are not past due and are expected to be received when due. 
 
The Group does not have trade receivables in relation to gold sales. The only material receivables at year end are for GST and fuel tax credits 
receivable from the Australian Taxation Office and therefore, the Group is not generally exposed to credit risk in relation to its receivables. 
 
Due to the short-term nature of these receivables, their carrying value is assumed to approximate fair value.

Inventories
Notes to the Financial Statements: Operating assets and liabilities | 30 June 2016 
 
10. 
 
Accounting Policy 
Gold bullion, gold in circuit and ore stockpiles are physically measured or estimated and valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Cost is determined by the weighted average method and comprises direct purchase costs and an appropriate portion of fixed and variable 
overhead costs, including depreciation and amortisation, incurred in converting ore into gold bullion. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and costs of selling the final product, including royalties. 
 
Consumable stores are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of consumable stores is measured on a first-in first-out 
basis. 
 
Inventories expected to be sold (or consumed in the case of stores) within 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified as current 
assets, all other inventories are classified as non-current.

Ore stockpiles 
 
During the year ended 30 June 2015, a portion of ore stockpiles were reclassified as non-current as a result of the annual update of life of mine 
plans. These stockpiles continue to be classified as non-current as at 30 June 2016, which reflects the expected timing for the conversion to 
bullion and subsequent sale. 
 
At 30 June 2016, all inventory is carried at cost. At the prior year end, all inventory was carried at cost, except for the non-current ore stockpile 
which was held at net realisable value. During the current year, there was no expense recognised in costs of goods sold for inventories carried 
at net realisable value (2015: $1,810,000 expense recognised).

Key estimates and assumptions 
Inventories 
Net realisable value tests are performed at each reporting date and represent the estimated future sales price of the product based on 
prevailing spot metals process at the reporting date, less estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale. 
 
Stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile, the number of contained gold 
ounces based on assay data, and the estimated recovery percentage. Stockpile tonnages are verified by periodic surveys.

Notes to the Financial Statements: Operating assets and liabilities | 30 June 2016 
 
11.  Property, Plant and Equipment 
 
Accounting Policy 
The value of property, plant and equipment is measured as the cost of the asset, less accumulated depreciation and impairment. The cost of 
the asset also includes the cost of replacing parts that are eligible for capitalisation, the cost of major inspections and an initial estimate of the 
cost of dismantling and removing the item from site at the end  of its useful life (rehabilitation provisions). Changes in the rehabilitation 
provisions resulting from changes in the size or timing of the cost or from changes in the discount rate are also recognised as part of the asset 
cost. 
 
Derecognition 
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised when it is sold or otherwise disposed of, or when its use is expected to bring no 
further economic benefits. Any gain or loss from derecognising the asset (the difference between the proceeds on disposal and the carrying 
amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the period the item is derecognised.

12.  Exploration and Evaluation Assets 
 
Accounting Policy 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is accumulated on an area of interest basis. Exploration and evaluation assets include the costs of 
acquiring  licences,  costs  associated  with  exploration  and  evaluation  activity,  and  the  fair  value  (at  acquisition  date)  of  exploration  and 
evaluation assets acquired in a business combination. Expenditure is carried forward when incurred in areas for which the Group has rights of 
tenure and where economic mineralisation is indicated, but activities have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of 
the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves and active and significant operations in, or in relation to, the area of interest 
are  continuing.  Costs  incurred  before  the  Group  has  obtained  the  legal  rights  to  explore  an  area  are  recognised  in  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income. 
 
Once  the  technical  feasibility  and  commercial  viability  of  the  extraction  of  mineral  resources  in  an  area  of  interest  are  demonstrable, 
exploration and evaluation assets attributable to that area of interest are first tested for impairment and then reclassified to mine properties 
under development. No amortisation is charged during the exploration and evaluation phase.

Acquisition of tenements 
The Group made an up-front payment of $100,000 as part of an agreement to enter into an exploration joint venture with Duketon Mining 
Limited (“DKM”) on four of DKM’s exploration licences which are in proximity to the Moolart Well project.   
 
Impairment 
Exploration and evaluation assets are assessed for impairment if (i) sufficient data exists to determine technical feasibility and commercial 
viability, and (ii) facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. For the purposes of impairment 
testing, exploration and evaluation assets are allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”) to which the exploration activity relates. The CGU is 
not larger than the area of interest.

Key estimates and assumptions 
Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets 
The future recoverability of capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is dependent upon a number of factors, including whether 
the Group decides to exploit the related lease itself or, if not, whether it successfully recovers the related exploration and evaluation asset 
through sale. 
 
Factors that could impact future recoverability include the level of reserves and resources, future technological changes which could 
impact the cost of mining, future legal changes (including changes to environmental restoration obligations) and changes to commodity 
prices. 
 
To the extent that capitalised exploration and evaluation expenditure is determined not to be recoverable in the future, profits and net 
assets will be reduced in the period in which the determination is made.

Notes to the Financial Statements: Operating assets and liabilities | 30 June 2016 
 
Exploration expenditure commitments 
Exploration expenditure commitments represent tenement rentals and expenditure requirements that may be required to be met under the 
relevant legislation should the Group wish to retain tenure on all current tenements in which the Group has an interest. 
 
The terms and conditions under which the Group retains title to its various mining tenements oblige it to meet tenement rentals and minimum 
levels of exploration expenditure as gazetted by the Western Australian and New South Wales state governments, as well as local government 
rates and taxes. 
 
The exploration commitments of the Group not provided for in the consolidated financial statements and payable are as follows:

The tenement commitments shown above represent the minimum required to be spent on all granted tenements as at reporting date. Actual 
expenditure will vary as a result of ongoing management of the tenement portfolio including reductions and relinquishment of tenements not 
considered prospective, in whole or in part. 
 
Tenement commitments are shown gross of exemptions that are likely to be available in the ordinary course of business as the financial impact 
of potential exemptions cannot be measured reliably in advance. 
 
13.  Mine Properties under Development 
 
Accounting Policy 
Mine properties under development represents the costs incurred in preparing mines for production and includes plant and equipment under 
construction and operating costs incurred before production commences. These costs are capitalised to the extent they are expected to be 
recouped  through  the  successful  exploitation  of  the  related  mining  leases.  Once  production  commences,  these  costs  are  transferred  to 
property, plant and equipment and mine properties, as relevant, and are depreciated and amortised using the units-of-production method 
based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate or are written off if the mine property is abandoned.

Accounting Policies 
Production stripping costs 
Once access to the ore is attained, all waste that is removed from that point forward is considered production stripping activity. The amount 
of production stripping costs deferred is based on the extent to which the current period cost per tonne of ore mined exceeds the expected 
cost per tonne for the life of the identified component. A component is defined as a specific volume of the ore body that is made more 
accessible by the stripping activity, and is identified based on the mine plan.  
 
The production stripping asset is initially measured at cost, which is the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity 
that improves access to the identified component of the ore body. The production stripping asset is then carried at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and any impairment losses. 
 
The production stripping asset is amortised over the expected useful life of the identified component (determined based on economically 
recoverable reserves), on a unit of production basis. The unit of account is tonnes of ore mined.
40
Notes to the Financial Statements: Operating assets and liabilities | 30 June 2016 
 
Pre-strip costs 
In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and waste materials to access the ore. This process is referred to as 
stripping and the Group capitalises stripping costs incurred during the development of a mine (or pit) as part of the investment in constructing 
the mine (“pre-strip”).  These costs are subsequently amortised over the life of mine on a units of production basis, where the unit of account 
is tonnes of ore milled. 
 
Other mine properties 
Other mine properties represents expenditure in respect of exploration, evaluation, feasibility and pre-production operating costs incurred by 
the Group previously accumulated and carried forward in mine properties under development in relation to areas of interest in which mining 
has now commenced. Other mine properties are stated at cost, less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. 
 
Other mine properties are amortised on a unit-of-production basis over the economically recoverable reserves of the mine concerned. The 
unit of account is tonnes of ore milled.

Key estimates and assumptions 
Production stripping costs 
The Group capitalises mining costs incurred during the production stage of its operations in accordance with the accounting policy 
described above. The identification of specific components will vary between mines as a result of both the geological characteristics and 
location of the ore body. The financial considerations of the mining operations may also impact the identification and designation of a 
component.  
 
The expected cost per tonne is a function of an individual mine’s design and therefore changes to that design will generally result in 
changes to the expected cost. Changes in other technical or economic parameters that impact reserves will also have an impact on the 
expected costs per tonne for each identified component. Changes in the expected cost per tonne are accounted for prospectively from 
the date of change.
41
Impairment of Non-Financial Assets
Notes to the Financial Statements: Operating assets and liabilities | 30 June 2016 
 
15. 
 
Accounting policy 
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Where an indicator of impairment 
exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of recoverable amount. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount the 
asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.  
 
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the 
time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable 
amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
 
Impairment losses are reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has been a change in the 
estimate used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does 
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been 
recognised. 
 
Total impairment losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the year were as follows:

during the year. There were no other indicators of impairment identified.

Key judgements 
Determination of mineral resources and ore reserves 
The determination of mineral resources and ore reserves impacts the accounting for asset carrying values. The Group estimates its 
mineral resources and ore reserves in accordance with the Australian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and 
Ore Reserves 2012 (the “JORC” Code). The information on mineral resources and ore reserves was prepared by or under the supervision 
of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC Code. The amounts presented are based on the mineral resources and ore reserves 
determined under the JORC Code. 
 
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and ore reserves, and assumptions that are valid at the time 
of estimation may change significantly when new information becomes available. 
 
Changes in the forecast prices of commodities, exchange rates, production costs or recovery rates may change the economic status of 
reserves and may ultimately result in reserves being restated.
42
Notes to the Financial Statements: Operating assets and liabilities | 30 June 2016 
 
16.  Trade and Other Payables 
 
Accounting Policies 
Trade payables 
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at the value of the invoice received from a supplier and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost. They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise 
when the Group becomes obliged to make future payments in respect of the purchase of these goods and services. The amounts are unsecured 
and generally paid within 30 days of recognition. 
 
Employee entitlements 
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid to an employee for annual leave they are presently entitled to as a result of past 
service. The liability includes allowances for on-costs such as superannuation and payroll taxes, as well as any future salary and wage increases 
that the employee may be reasonably entitled to.

17.  Provisions 
 
Accounting Policies 
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost. Refer to note 18. 
 
Site rehabilitation 
In  accordance  with  the  Group’s  published  environmental  policy  and  applicable  legal  requirements,  a  provision  for  site  rehabilitation  is 
recognised in respect of the estimated cost of rehabilitation and restoration of the areas disturbed by mining activities up to the reporting 
date, but not yet rehabilitated.  
 
When the liability is initially recorded, the estimated cost is capitalised by increasing the carrying amount of the related mining assets. At each 
reporting date the site rehabilitation provision is re-measured to reflect any changes in discount rates and timing or amounts to be incurred. 
Additional  disturbances  or  changes  in  rehabilitation  costs  will  be  recognised  as  additions  or  changes  to  the  corresponding  asset  and 
rehabilitation provision, prospectively from the date of change. For closed sites, or where the carrying value of the related asset has been 
reduced to nil either through depreciation and amortisation or impairment, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in the 
statement of comprehensive income. 
 
Long service leave 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return 
for their service up to reporting date, plus related on costs. The benefit is discounted to determine its present value and the discount rate is 
the yield at the reporting date on high-quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group’s obligations

The  nature  of  rehabilitation  activities  includes  dismantling  and  removing  structures,  rehabilitating  mines,  dismantling  operating  facilities, 
closure of plant and waste sites and restoration, reclamation and re-vegetation of affected areas. Typically the obligation arises when the asset 
is installed at the production location.

Key estimates and assumptions 
Rehabilitation obligations 
The Group assesses site rehabilitation liabilities annually. The provision recognised is based on an assessment of the estimated cost of 
closure and reclamation of the areas using internal information concerning environmental issues in the exploration and previously mined 
areas, together with input from various environmental consultants, discounted to present value. Significant estimation is required in 
determining the provision for site rehabilitation as there are many factors that may affect the timing and ultimate cost to rehabilitate sites 
where mining and/or exploration activities have previously taken place. These factors include future development/exploration activity, 
changes in the cost of goods and services required for restoration activity and changes to the legal and regulatory framework. These 
factors may result in future actual expenditure differing from the amounts currently provided.

Notes to the Financial Statements: Capital structure and risk | 30 June 2016
Capital structure, financial instruments and risk 
This section outlines how the Group manages its capital, related financing costs and its exposure to various financial risks. It explains how these 
risks affect the Group’s financial position and performance and what the Group does to manage these risks. 
 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide 
returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
 
The Board’s policy in relation to capital management is to regularly and consistently monitor future cash flows against expected expenditures 
for a rolling period of up to 12 months in advance. The Board determines the Group’s need for additional funding by way of either share issues 
or loan funds depending on market conditions at the time. The Board defines working capital in such circumstances as its excess liquid funds 
over liabilities, and defines capital as being the ordinary share capital of the Company, plus retained earnings, reserves and net debt. In order 
to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Board may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, 
issue new shares or reduce debt. 
 
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital management during the year. 
 
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
 
18.  Net Debt and Finance Costs 
 
Accounting Policies 
Loans and borrowings 
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After 
initial  recognition,  interest-bearing  loans  and  borrowings  are  subsequently  measured  at  amortised  cost  using  the  effective  interest  rate 
method.  
 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 
months after the reporting date. 
 
Finance Leases – Group as a lessee 
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership for the lease item, are capitalised at 
the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments 
are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are recognised as an expense in profit or loss. 
 
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term if there is no reasonable 
certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. 
 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s current and non-current borrowings approximate their fair value.

Secured bank loan 
At balance date, the Group has less than $1,000 (2015: $20 million) outstanding on the secured bank loan provided by Macquarie Bank Limited 
(“MBL”) which is due for repayment on 30 June 2017. 
 
The loan attracted a variable interest rate which ranged between 4.395% and 4.730% in the current year (2015: 4.655% and 5.255%). 
 
Finance lease commitments 
During the current year, the Group entered into a new hire purchase agreement for the acquisition of a Komatsu WA600 loader (2015: Komatsu 
WA900 loader). The agreement incorporates a fixed interest rate of 3.19% (2015: 3.35%), monthly repayments and an expiry date of 27 May 
2019 (2015: 29 May 2018). Ownership of the loaders passes to the Group once all contractual payments have been made. Refer to note 27.

Borrowing costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset (i.e. an asset that necessarily takes a 
substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale) are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. All other borrowing costs 
are expensed as part of  finance  costs in the period incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in 
connection with the borrowing of funds. 
 
Unwinding of discount on provisions 
The unwinding of discount on provisions represents the cost associated with the passage of time. Rehabilitation provisions are recognised at 
the discounted value of the present obligation to restore, dismantle and rehabilitate each mine site with the increase in the provision due to 
the passage of time being recognised as a finance cost in accordance with the policy described in note 17.

Notes to the Financial Statements: Capital structure and risk | 30 June 2016 
 
19.  Financial Assets 
 
Accounting Policy 
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition and subsequently 
measured at amortised costs or fair value depending on the business model for those assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics.  
 
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments are normally measured at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) unless the Group chooses, on an instrument-by-
instrument basis on initial recognition, to present fair value changes in other comprehensive income (“FVOCI”). This option is irrevocable and 
only applies to equity instruments which are neither held for trading nor are contingent consideration in a business combination. Gains and 
losses on equity instruments measured at FVOCI are not recycled through profit and loss or disposal and there is no impairment accounting. 
All gains and losses are recorded in equity through other comprehensive income.

Financial assets at fair value through OCI 
During the year, the Group made a strategic investment in Capricorn Metals Limited (“CMM”) which owns the Karlawinda Gold Project. The 
Group held a non-controlling interest of 9% at balance date which is carried at its fair value determined with reference to the published price 
quoted on the ASX, an active market (“Level 1” fair value measurement). 
 
20.  Financial Risk Management 
 
The Group holds financial instruments for the following purposes: 
 
-
Financing: to raise finance for the Group’s operations or, in the case of short-term deposits, to invest surplus funds. The principal types 
of instruments used include bank loans, cash and short-term deposits.
-
-  Operational: the Group’s activities generate financial instruments, including cash, receivables and trade payables. 
-
Strategic: one of the Group’s objectives is to actively pursue growth opportunities. During the current year, this has led to the acquisition 
of a strategic investment in a listed company, which is classified as a financial asset at fair value through OCI. 
Risk management: to reduce risks arising from the financial instruments described above, including commodity swap contracts and gold 
call options.
-
Credit risk 
Liquidity risk
It is, and has been throughout the year, the Group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. 
 
The Group’s holding of these financial instruments exposes it to the following risks: 
 
- 
- 
-  Market risk, including interest rate, commodity price and equity price risk 
 
This note presents information about the Group’s exposure to each of the above risks and its objectives, policies and processes for measuring 
and  managing  risk.  These  risks  affect  the  fair  value  measurements  applied  by  the  Group.  Further  quantitative  disclosures  are  included 
throughout this financial report. 
 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the risk management framework. The Audit and Risk 
Management Committee is responsible for developing and monitoring risk management policies. The committee reports regularly to the Board 
of Directors on its activities. 
 
Risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and 
to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions 
and the Group’s activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and 
constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
47
Notes to the Financial Statements: Capital structure and risk | 30 June 2016 
 
 
The Group’s Audit and Risk Management Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management 
policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 
 
Credit Risk 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if the counterparty to a financial asset fails to meet its contractual obligation. Credit risk 
arises from cash and cash equivalents. The Group has adopted the policy of dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating 
the risk of financial loss from defaults. Cash is deposited only with institutions approved by the Board. The Group has determined that it 
currently has no significant exposure to credit risk as at reporting date. 
 
Liquidity Risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach to managing 
liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed 
conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk damage to the Group’s reputation. 
 
The Group uses weekly and monthly cash forecasting to monitor cash flow requirements. Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash 
on demand to meet expected operational expenses, including the servicing of financial obligations; this excludes the potential impact of 
extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. 
 
The following table analyses the Group’s financial liabilities, including net and gross settled financial instruments, into relevant maturity periods 
based on the remaining period at the reporting date to the contractual maturity date. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows and hence will not necessarily reconcile with the amounts disclosed in the balance sheet. 
 
For derivative liabilities (sold gold call options), the amounts disclosed are the net amounts that would need to be paid if the option expired 
out of the money. Due to their short term nature, the amounts have been estimated using the gold spot price applicable at reporting date.

Notes to the Financial Statements: Capital structure and risk | 30 June 2016 
 
Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and equity prices will 
affect the Group’s income or value of its holdings of financial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control 
market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return.  
 
-
Foreign currency risk: The Group is occasionally exposed to foreign currency risk when long lead items are purchased in a currency other 
than Australian dollars. The Group maintains all of its cash in Australian dollars and does not currently hedge these purchases. There is no 
significant exposure to foreign currency risk at reporting date. 
 
Interest rate risk: Since repayment of substantially all of the principal outstanding on the secured project loan facility with Macquarie Bank 
Limited (“MBL”) during the current year, the Group is only exposed to interest rate risk through its cash deposits, which attract variable 
interest rates. The Group regularly reviews its current working capital requirements against cash balances and the returns available on 
short term deposits. There is no significant exposure to interest rate risk at reporting date. 
 
Commodity price risk: The Group’s exposure to commodity price risk is purely operational and arises largely from gold price fluctuations 
or in relation to the purchase of inventory with commodity price as a significant input, such as diesel. The Group’s exposure to movements 
in the gold price is managed through the use of gold forward contracts (note 2) and sold call options (note 21). The gold forward sale 
contracts do not meet the criteria of financial instruments for accounting purposes on the basis that they meet the normal purchase/sale 
exemption because physical gold will be delivered into the contract. No sensitivity analysis is provided for these contracts as they are 
outside the scope of AASB 9 Financial Instruments (2014). The sold call options are classified as derivative financial instruments at fair 
value through profit or loss. Refer to note 21 for sensitivity and other analysis. 
 
The Group implemented a medium term risk management strategy during the current year to take advantage of historically low oil prices 
by entering into commodity swap transactions on gasoil to hedge exposure to movements in the Australian dollar price of diesel. Regis 
considers the gasoil component to be a separately identifiable and measurable component of diesel. This hedge arrangement fixes a 
significant proportion (approximately two thirds) of the total estimated annual diesel usage at the Group’s Duketon operations. Sensitivity 
of the Group’s profit or loss to the hedged exposures is analysed in note 21. 
 
Equity price risk: The Group acquired shares in Capricorn Metals Limited, an ASX listed entity, during the current year and as such is 
exposed to market price risk arising from uncertainties about future values of the investment. At the reporting date, the investment was 
measured at its fair value of $6,442,000.  The Group has elected to present fair value changes through other comprehensive income. 
Accordingly, an increase or decrease of 10% in the value of the investment would only impact equity and not profit or loss.

-
-
Interest rate risk 
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments was:

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed rate instruments 
The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore a change at reporting 
date would not affect profit or loss. 
 
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments 
A sensitivity analysis has not been disclosed in relation to the variable interest rate cash on deposit and secured bank loan as the results have 
been determined to be immaterial to the statement of comprehensive income for both the current and prior financial years.

Fair Values 
The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of all of the Group’s financial instruments recognised in the financial statements are materially 
the same. The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments are disclosed in the respective notes. 
 
Valuation of financial instruments 
For all fair value measurements and disclosures, the Group uses the following to categorise the method used: 
 
-
Level 1: the fair value is calculated using quoted prices in active markets. The Group’s investment in Capricorn Metals Limited is classified 
as Level 1, as it is valued based on a price quoted in an active market. 
Level 2: the fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, 
either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices). The Group’s derivative liabilities (sold gold call options) and derivative assets 
(cash flow hedges) are classified as Level 2, as they were valued using valuation techniques that employ the use of market observable 
inputs. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models using present value calculations. The 
models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, and spot and 
forward  rate  curves  of  the  underlying  commodity.  The  changes  in  counterparty  credit  risk  had  no  material  effect  on  the  hedge 
effectiveness assessment for the commodity swaps designated in hedge relationships and the sold gold call options recognised at fair 
value. 
Level 3: the fair value is estimated using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data. The Group does not 
have any financial assets or liabilities in this category.
-
-
For financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between 
Levels in the hierarchy by reassessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a 
whole) at the end of each reporting period. There were no transfers between levels during the year. 
 
21.  Derivatives and Hedging 
 
Accounting policy 
Recognition 
Derivative  financial  instruments  are  initially  recognised  at  fair  value  on  the  date  on  which  a  derivative  contract  is  entered  into  and  are 
subsequently remeasured to fair value as per note 20. The method of recognising any re-measurement gain or loss depends on the nature of 
the item being hedged. Any changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised 
immediately in the income statement. For hedge instruments, any hedge ineffectiveness is recognised directly in the income statement in the 
period in which it is incurred. There was no ineffectiveness on the diesel swap contracts in the current year (2015: nil). 
 
Hedge accounting 
At the start of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship, including the risk management 
strategy for undertaking the hedge. This includes identification of the hedge instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk 
being hedged and how the entity will assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness. Hedge accounting is only applied where effective tests 
are met on a prospective basis.  
 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: 
-
fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset, liability or firm commitment that could 
affect profit or loss; or  
cash flow hedges when they hedge a particular risk associated with the cash flows of recognised assets and liabilities and highly probable 
forecast transactions.
-
Regis  will  discontinue  hedge  accounting  prospectively  only  when  the  hedging  relationship,  or  part  of  the  hedging  relationship  no  longer 
qualifies for hedge accounting, which includes where there has been a change to the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking 
the hedge and instances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. For this purpose, the replacement or rollover 
of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an expiration or termination if such a replacement or rollover is consistent 
with our documented risk management objective.

Hedges that meet the criteria for hedge accounting are classified and accounted for as follows: 
 
Cash flow hedges 
The Group uses cash flow hedges to mitigate the risk of variability of future cash flows attributable to diesel price fluctuations over the hedging 
period associated with our operations at the Duketon Gold Project, where it has highly probable purchases of diesel. For cash flow hedges, the 
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is effective is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion is recognised 
in profit or loss.  
 
Amounts recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when 
hedged expenses are recognised or when the asset is consumed. When the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.

If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement. If 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or roll over, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, 
amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. There were no such events during the current 
or prior year.

23.  Deferred Income Tax 
 
Accounting Policy 
Deferred tax balances are determined using the balance sheet method, which provides for temporary differences at the balance sheet date 
between accounting carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. 
 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, other than for the exemptions permitted under accounting 
standards. At 30 June 2016 there are no unrecognised temporary differences associated with the Group’s investment in subsidiaries (2015: 
$nil). 
 
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, 
to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available to utilise these deductible temporary differences. Deferred tax 
assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be 
realised. 
 
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the temporary differences when they 
reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only 
offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and liabilities 
relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. 
 
Deferred income tax at 30 June relates to the following:
Deferred tax liabilities 
Receivables 
Prepayments 
Financial assets 
Exploration and evaluation expenditure 
Mine properties under development 
Mine properties 
Gross deferred tax liabilities

Key judgements 
Recovery of deferred tax assets 
Judgement is required in determining whether deferred tax assets are recognised on the balance sheet. Deferred tax assets, including 
those arising from unutilised tax losses, require management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in 
future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows 
from operations and the application of existing tax laws in Australia.  
 
To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Group to realise the net 
deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws in Australia could limit the 
ability of the Group to obtain tax deductions in future periods.
Tax consolidation 
The  Company  and  its  wholly-owned  Australian  resident  entities  became  part  of  a  tax-consolidated  group  on  14  December  2006.  As  a 
consequence,  all  members  of  the  tax-consolidation  group  are  taxed  as  a  single  entity  from  that  date.  The  head  entity  within  the  tax-
consolidation group is Regis Resources Limited.  
 
The head entity, in conjunction with other members of the tax-consolidated group, have entered into a tax funding arrangement which sets 
out the funding obligations of members of the tax-consolidated group in respect of tax amounts. Any current tax liabilities (or assets) and 
deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses of the subsidiaries are assumed by the head entity and are recognised by the Company as 
intercompany receivables (or payables). Contributions to fund the current tax liabilities are payable as per the tax funding arrangement and 
reflect the timing of the head entity’s obligation to make payments for tax liabilities to the relevant tax authorities. 
 
The Company recognises deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses of the tax-consolidated group to the extent that it is probable that 
future taxable profits of the tax-consolidated group will be available against which asset can be utilised. 
 
Any subsequent period adjustment to deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses as a result of revised assessments of the probability 
of recoverability is recognised by the head entity only. 
 
The head entity in conjunction with other members of the tax-consolidated group has also entered into a tax sharing agreement. The tax 
sharing agreement provides for the determination of the allocation of income tax liabilities between the entities should the head entity default 
on its tax payment obligations. No amounts have been recognised in the financial statements in respect of this agreement as payment of any 
amounts under the tax sharing agreement is considered remote.
55
Notes to the Financial Statements: Other disclosures | 30 June 2016 
 
24.  Share-based Payments 
 
Accounting Policy 
The value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period 
that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options (the vesting period), ending on the date on which the relevant employees 
become fully entitled to the option (the vesting date).  
 
At each subsequent reporting date until vesting, the cumulative charge to the statement of comprehensive income is the product of: 
- 
-
The grant date fair value of the option; 
The current best estimate of the number of options that will vest, taking into account such factors as the likelihood of employee turnover 
during the vesting period and the likelihood of non-market performance conditions being met; and 
The expired portion of the vesting period.
- 
 
Until an option has vested, any amounts recorded are contingent and will be adjusted if more or fewer awards vest than were originally 
anticipated to do so.

Employee share option plan (ESOP) 
The Company has one ESOP, being the Regis Resources Limited 2014 Share Option Plan (the “Option Plan”). The objective of the Option Plan 
is  to  assist  in  the  recruitment,  reward,  retention  and  motivation  of  eligible  persons  of  the  Group.  Under  the  Option  Plan,  the  board  or 
Remuneration and Nomination Committee may issue eligible employees with options to acquire shares in the future at an exercise price fixed 
by the board or Remuneration and Nomination Committee on grant of the options. 
 
The vesting of all options is subject to service conditions being met whereby the recipient must meet the eligible employee criteria as defined 
in the Option Plan.

Option pricing model 
The fair value of the equity-settled share options granted under the ESOP is estimated as at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option 
pricing model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.  The following table lists the inputs to the 
model used for the years ended 30 June 2016 and 30 June 2015: 
 
Dividend yield (%) 
Expected volatility (%) 
Risk free interest rate (%) 
Expected life of the option (years) 
Option exercise price ($)

Key estimates and assumptions 
Share-based payments

payments to employees in accordance with the requirements of AASB 2 Share–based payment. The accounting estimates and 
assumptions relating to equity-settled share-based payments would have no impact on the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities 
within the next annual reporting period but may impact expenses and equity.

Notes to the Financial Statements: Other disclosures | 30 June 2016 
 
31.  New Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
 
Changes in accounting policy 
The Group has adopted the following new and revised accounting standards, amendments and interpretations as of 1 July 2015: 
-  AASB 2013-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Conceptual Framework, Materiality and Financial Instruments 
-  AASB 2015-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards arising from the Withdrawal of AASB 1031 Materiality 
 
The adoption of these new and revised standards did not have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.  
 
The following Australian Accounting Standard was early adopted by the Group from 1 July 2015: 
 
AASB 9 Financial Instruments (2014) 
Regis has early adopted and applied all of the requirements of AASB 9 (2014), including consequential amendments to other standards, on 1 
July 2015. The adoption of AASB 9 (2014) has allowed Regis to apply hedge accounting to the diesel swap contracts entered into during the 
current financial year. 
 
On adoption of AASB 9 (2014) Regis has reclassified its financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost or fair value depending on 
the business model for those assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics. There was no change in the classification or measurement 
of financial liabilities. The principal impact on Regis’ financial assets at 1 July 2015 is the reclassification of cash and cash equivalents and trade 
and other receivables from ‘loans and receivables’ under AASB 139 to ‘financial assets at amortised cost’ under AASB 9 (2014). 
 
In  relation  to  the  reclassification  of  financial  assets  and  liabilities,  there  was  no  impact  on  the  income  statement,  the  statement  of 
comprehensive income, balance sheet or statement of changes in equity on adoption of AASB 9 (2014). 
 
As a result of adopting AASB 9 (2014), the accounting policies for cash and cash equivalents (note 7), trade and other receivables (note 9) and 
derivative financial instruments and hedging (note 21) have been updated and are applicable from 1 July 2015. 
 
The terminology in the above policies has been updated in accordance with the requirements of AASB 9 (2014). There has been no material 
change to the measurement and recognition of these items. 
 
New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective 
The following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been identified as those which may impact the entity in the period 
of initial application.  They are available for early adoption at 30 June 2016, but have not been applied in preparing this financial report. Except 
where noted, the Group has evaluated the impact of the new standards and interpretations listed below and determined that the changes are 
not likely to have a material impact on its financial statements. 
 
AASB 2014-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Accounting for Acquisitions of Interests in Joint Operations [AASB 1 & AASB 
11] 
AASB 2014-3 amends AASB 11 Joint Arrangements to provide guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of interests in joint operations in 
which the activity constitutes a business. The amendments require: 
-
The acquirer of an interest in a joint operation in which the activity constitutes a business, as defined in AASB 3 Business Combinations, 
to apply all of the principles on business combination accounting in AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards except for those 
principles that conflict with the guidance in AASB 11. 
The acquirer to disclose the information required by AASB 3 and other Australian Accounting Standards for business combinations.
- 
 
This Standard also makes an editorial correction to AASB 11.
Application date of Standard:
1 January 2016
Application date for Group:
1 July 2016
AASB 2014-4 Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation and Amortisation (Amendments to AASB 116 and AASB 138) 
AASB  116  Property,  Plant  and  Equipment  and  AASB  138  Intangible  Assets  both  establish  the  principle  for  the  basis  of  depreciation  and 
amortisation as being the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits of an asset. 
 
The IASB has clarified that the use of revenue-based methods to calculate the depreciation of an asset is not appropriate because revenue 
generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset generally reflects factors other than the consumption of the economic benefits 
embodied in the asset. 
 
The amendment also clarified that revenue is generally presumed to be an inappropriate basis for measuring the consumption of the economic 
benefits embodied in an intangible asset. This presumption, however, can be rebutted in certain limited circumstances.

AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers replaces the existing revenue recognition standards AASB 11 Construction Contracts, AASB 
118 Revenue and related Interpretations (Interpretation 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes, Interpretation 15 Agreements for the Construction 
of Real Estate, Interpretation 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and Interpretation 131 Revenue – Barter Transactions Involving Advertising 
Services and Interpretation 1042 Subscriber Acquisition Costs in the Telecommunications Industry). AASB 15 incorporates the requirements of 
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and developed jointly with the 
US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). 
 
AASB 15 specifies the accounting treatment for revenue arising from contracts with customers (except for contracts within the scope of other 
accounting standards such as leases or financial instruments). The core principle of AASB 15 is that an entity recognises revenue to depict the 
transfer of promised good or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 
exchange for those good or services. An entity recognises revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: 
 
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer 
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price 
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract 
Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation 
 
AASB 2014-5 incorporates the consequential amendments to a number of Australian Accounting Standards (including Interpretations) arising 
from the issuance of AASB 15. 
 
The Group has evaluated the impact of the new standard and determined that the changes are not likely to have a material impact on the 
amount of revenue recognised from gold sales, nor is it expected that significant changes to disclosures will be required. The Group is still 
assessing whether the timing of revenue recognition will be materially impacted on adoption of the new standard.

AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards 
This Standard lists the application paragraphs for each other Standard (and Interpretation), grouped where they are the same. Accordingly, 
paragraphs  5  and  22  respectively  specify  the  application  paragraphs  for  Standards  and  Interpretations  in  general.  Differing  application 
paragraphs are set out for individual Standards and Interpretations or grouped where possible. The application paragraphs do not affect 
requirements in other Standards that specify that certain paragraphs apply only to certain types of entities.

The amendment clarifies that the high quality corporate bonds used to estimate the discount rate for post-employment benefit obligations 
should be denominated in the same currency as the liability. Further it clarifies that the depth of the market for high quality corporate bonds 
should be assessed at the currency level. 
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting 
The changes to AASB 134 clarify the meaning of ‘disclosure of information elsewhere in the interim financial report’ and require the inclusion 
of a cross-reference from the interim financial statements to the location of this information.

1 January 2016
Application date for Group:

AASB 2015-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure Initiative: Amendments to AASB 101 
The Standard makes amendments to AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements arising from the IASB’s Disclosure Initiative project. The 
amendments are designed to further encourage companies to apply professional judgment in determining what information to disclose in the 
financial statements. For example, the amendments make clear that materiality applies to the whole of financial statements and that the 
inclusion of immaterial information can inhibit the usefulness of financial disclosures.  The amendments also clarify that companies should use 
professional judgment in determining where and in what order information is presented in the financial disclosures.

This Standard inserts scope paragraphs into AASB 8 and AASB 133 in place of application paragraph text in AASB 1057. This is to correct 
inadvertent  removal  of  these  paragraphs  during  editorial  changes  made  in  August  2015.  There  is  no  change  to  the  requirements  or  the 
applicability of AASB 8 and AASB 133.

AASB 16 Leases 
The key features of AASB 16 (for lessee accounting) are as follows: 
-
Lessees are required to recognise assets and liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlying asset is of 
low value.
-  A lessee measures right-of-use assets similarly to other non-financial assets and lease liabilities similarly to other financial liabilities. 
-  Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. The measurement includes non-cancellable lease 
payments (including inflation-linked payments), and also includes payments to be made in optional periods if the lessee is reasonably 
certain to exercise an option to extend the lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate the lease.
-  AASB 16 contains disclosure requirements for lessees. 
 
AASB  16  supersedes  AASB  17  Leases,  Interpretation  4  Determining  whether  an  Arrangement  contains  a  Lease,  SIC-15  Operating  Leases-
Incentives, and SIC-27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease. The new standard will be effective for 
annual reporting periods beginning on after 1 January 2019. Early application is permitted, provided the new revenue standard, AASB 15 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, has been applied, or is applied at the same date as AASB 16. The Group is currently assessing the 
impact of the new standard on its financial statements.

Independent auditor’s report to the members of Regis Resources Limited 
Report on the financial report 
We have audited the accompanying financial report of Regis Resources Limited (the company), 
which comprises the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2016, and consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated 
statement of cash flows for the year ended on that date, the notes comprising a summary of 
significant accounting policies and other explanatory information and the directors’ declaration 
of the Group comprising the company and the entities it controlled at the year’s end or from time 
to time during the financial year. 
Directors’ responsibility for the financial report  
The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation of the financial report that gives 
a true and fair view in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations 
Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the 
preparation of the financial report that is free from material misstatement whether due to fraud or 
error. In the notes, the directors also state, in accordance with Australian Accounting Standard 
AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, that the financial statements of the Group 
comply with International Financial Reporting Standards.
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial report based on our audit. We 
conducted our audit in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards. These Auditing 
Standards require that we comply with relevant ethical requirements relating to audit 
engagements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial 
report is free from material misstatement.  
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial report. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, 
including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial report, whether 
due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control 
relevant to the entity’s preparation of the financial report that gives a true and fair view in order 
to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of 
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes 
evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting 
estimates made by the directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial 
report.  
We performed the procedures to assess whether in all material respects the financial report 
presents fairly, in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001 and Australian Accounting 
Standards, a true and fair view which is consistent with our understanding of the Group’s 
financial position and of its performance.  
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a 
basis for our audit opinion.

Professional Standards Legislation.
Independence 
In conducting our audit, we have complied with the independence requirements of the 
Corporations Act 2001.
Auditor’s opinion  
In our opinion: 
(a) the financial report of the Group is in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, including:   
(i)  giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 30 June 2016 and of
its performance for the year ended on that date; and
(ii)  complying with Australian Accounting Standards  and the Corporations Regulations
2001.
(b) the financial report also complies with International Financial Reporting Standards as
disclosed in the basis of preparation. 
Report on the remuneration report 
We have audited the Remuneration Report included in pages 13 to 20 of the directors’ report for 
the year ended 30 June 2016. The directors of the company are responsible for the preparation 
and presentation of the remuneration report in accordance with Section 300A of the 
Corporations Act 2001. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the remuneration report, 
based on our audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards.
