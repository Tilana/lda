</p>
<p>Nations, to discuss the fundamental question of the role of the State as holder of the 
</p>
<p>monopoly of the use of force, with the objective of facilitating a critical understanding 
</p>
<p>of the responsibilities of the different actors, including private military and security 
</p>
<p>companies, in the current context, and their respective obligations for the protection
