<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Government of Rwanda must be commended for many of its initiatives and 
positive practices that have contributed towards social healing, development and growth. 
Importantly, the Government acknowledges that many challenges remain, including to fully 
establish and maintain conditions for lasting stability and peace. 
</p>
<p> Efforts on the part of the Government to forge unity and social cohesion behind a 
Rwandan national identity and to diminish ethnicity as a destructive force in society are 
praiseworthy. Given the country&#8223;s history of ethnic-based violence, the degree of progress 
to date is impressive. Nevertheless, popular notions of ethnicity still exist in Rwandan 
society. As long as that is the case, candid discussions of those issues should not be 
considered taboo. A process of promoting national unity is not incompatible with the rights 
of individuals and communities to freedom of expression and to freely identify as 
belonging to an ethnic group. Laws and policies that prohibit incitement to ethnic hatred or 
genocide must at the same time be fully compatible with freedom of expression as 
protected by international human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p> There are numerous communities in Rwanda that identify themselves as Batwa. The 
Government has categorized them as &#8220;historically marginalized people&#8221;. They currently 
live in conditions of great hardship and poverty on the margins of mainstream society. As a 
population group, they have extremely low levels of education and health care, live in

absent from the public life of the country. They were removed from their ancestral forests 
without consent or compensation, face widespread discrimination, particularly in 
employment, and have no viable means of livelihood. While the Government has instituted

whole.

than elected by the Batwa themselves. There are no Batwa in the Chamber of Deputies. The 
independent expert visited Batwa communities during local elections and was informed that 
Batwa candidates rarely achieve the required support since non-Batwa are unlikely to vote 
for them. Candidates are required to have six years of education which effectively excludes 
many Batwa. Batwa representatives claim that out of approximately 3,<footnote name="5">. The independent expert does not rely solely on numerical factors in her assessment

including minority rights to the fullest. In some countries, a distinct group constituting a 
numerical majority may be oppressed by a smaller group which is using its political or

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The independent expert conducted an official visit to Rwanda from 31 January to 7 
February 2011. She consulted with senior representatives of the Ministries of Foreign 
Affairs and International Cooperation, Justice, Local Government, Community 
Development and Social Affairs, and Education. She met with the National Unity and 
Reconciliation Commission, the National Commission for the Fight against Genocide and 
the Commission in charge of Social Affairs, Human Rights and Social Issues in the 
Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. In addition she met with the Rector and faculty from 
the National University of Rwanda, the Ombudsman, the National Human Rights 
Commission, the Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission, and IBUKA, an 
umbrella organization for genocide survivor associations. The independent expert was 
honoured to visit the Gisozi Memorial Centre and pay her respects to the victims of 
genocide. 
</p>
<p>2. The independent expert thanks the Government of Rwanda for extending an 
invitation to her and for its cooperation with her mandate in the preparation and conduct of 
her visit. The independent expert also wishes to thank the numerous non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs), both national and international, academic institutions, and others 
that have provided information and assistance to her. 
</p>
<p>3. The independent expert travelled to Kigali and to different regions where she 
consulted with people in their communities, some of whom self-identify as Batwa and 
others formerly recognized as Hutu and Tutsi. She visited villages in the vicinity of Kigali, 
near Musanze in the Northern Province, and around Butare in the Southern Province. At the 
invitation of the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, she visited a community 
in Gahini in the Eastern Province. At the invitation of the National Human Rights 
Commission, she visited another community in Muhanga in the Southern Province. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Methodology 
</b></p>
<p>4. The independent expert&#8223;s evaluation of minority issues in Rwanda is based on the 
1992 Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and 
Linguistic Minorities and other relevant international standards, from which she has 
identified four broad areas of concern. These are: (a) the protection of a minority&#8223;s survival, 
</p>
<p>through combating violence against them and preventing genocide; (b) the protection and 
promotion of the cultural identity of minority groups and the right of national, ethnic, 
religious or linguistic groups to enjoy their collective identity and to reject forced 
assimilation; (c) the guarantee of the rights to non-discrimination and equality, including 
ending structural or systemic discrimination and the promotion of affirmative action when 
required; and (d) the guarantee of the right to effective participation of members of 
minorities in public life, especially with regard to decisions that affect them. She applies a 
gender perspective in all areas of her work. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>5 
</p>
<p>6. In the following report, the independent expert details relevant information that she 
gained from her consultations in-country and additional research and information from 
credible sources. She has tried to record faithfully the views of the Government, to the 
extent permitted by restrictions on the length of this report. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Protection of the right to cultural and ethnic identity 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government views on ethnicity and the root causes of the 1994 genocide 
</b></p>
<p>7. According to the Government of Rwanda,1 during the pre-colonial era, Rwandans 
swore allegiance to the same monarch, had the same culture, the same language, 
&#8220;Kinyarwanda&#8221;, and lived together on the same territory. At that time, Rwandan identity 
was closely related to clans. Belonging to the same clan implied that the persons concerned 
were of the same origin. The Government claims that myths related to the origin of the 
Hutu, the Tutsi and the Batwa contradict the fact that all shared the same ancestral father, 
&#8220;Kanyarwanda&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>8. In the pre-colonial era, &#8220;Tutsiness&#8221; and &#8220;Hutuness&#8221; were social classifications or 
classes that were not static. For example, mechanisms existed for social promotion 
(Tutsification) for Hutus and for the Batwa, including through the acquisition of a herd of 
cows. Equally, &#8220;Tutsification&#8221; could result from a decision by the King, marriage with a 
</p>
<p>Tutsi or adoption by a Tutsi. The reverse phenomenon, &#8220;Hutufication&#8221;, considered a kind of 
social demotion, could occur if, for example, a Tutsi person was deprived by some means 
of their cattle herds. Therefore &#8220;Tutsiness&#8221; and &#8220;Hutuness&#8221; did not have a genetic 
dimension. 
</p>
<p>9. The Government maintains that distinct ethnic groups exist only when they each 
belong to a different community of language, culture, history or territory. It claims, 
however, such differences have never existed in Rwanda. Therefore it concludes that only 
one ethnic group exists in Rwanda &#8211; the Banyarwanda.  
</p>
<p>10. The colonial period was characterized by a strategy of divide and rule. Ethnic 
identity was highly manipulated and institutionalized in administrative organs during the 
colonial era. The population became indoctrinated with colonialists&#8223; theories of ethnicity. 
Even in post-colonial Rwanda, divisionism and discriminatory practices were further 
entrenched. Identification cards had ethnic classifications. Access to Government services, 
such as education and service employment, was based on an ethnic-quota system. Ethnic 
divisions were made a part of daily lessons in schools. Corrupt leaders exploited the system 
for political gains. The ultimate result was the 1994 genocide. 
</p>
<p>11. Current-day Government officials consistently repeat this ethno-historical analysis. 
It underpins the national legislative and policy framework implemented by the current 
Government for the promotion of a single Rwandese national identity, unity and 
reconciliation. Under this framework, ethnic minorities are not recognized as existing in 
Rwanda, the use of terminology that refers to different ethnic groups is strongly 
discouraged and all references to Bahutu, Batutsi or Batwa are banned from official 
documents. 
</p>
<p>  
 1  The following information is summarized from analysis provided by the Government in its thirteenth 
</p>
<p>to seventeenth periodic report to the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
(CERD/C/RWA/13-17). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. International law and identity in Rwanda 
</b></p>
<p>12. While the independent expert recognizes the unique history of Rwanda, the policies 
of the Government must be assessed as against the State&#8223;s obligations under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
establishes that &#8220;in those States in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, 
persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right, in community with the 
other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own 
religion, or to use their own language&#8221;. The question of the existence of minorities is 
addressed by the Human Rights Committee in its general comment No. 23 (1994) on the 
rights of minorities, which elaborates that &#8220;the existence of an ethnic, religious or linguistic 
minority in a given State party does not depend upon a decision by that State party but 
requires to be established by objective criteria&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>13. Considering identification with particular racial or ethnic groups, the Committee on 
the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has stated in its general recommendation No. 8 
(1990) on identification with a particular racial or ethnic group (art. 1, paras. 1 and 4) that 
&#8220;such identification shall, if no justification exists to the contrary, be based upon self-
identification by the individual concerned&#8221;. Furthermore, the African Commission on 
Human and Peoples&#8223; Rights, at its thirty-fourth Session, in November 2003, recalled &#8220;the 
emphasis given in international law to self-identification as the primary criterion for the 
determination of who constitutes a minority or indigenous person&#8221;.<footnote name="2">3 Established by the 2003 Constitution in its article 182 and by law No. 25/2003 of 15th August 2003. </footnote> International Labour 
Organization (ILO) Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in 
Independent Countries also recognizes the principle of self-identification. Article 1, 
paragraph 2, states that &#8220;self-identification as indigenous or tribal shall be regarded as a 
fundamental criterion for determining the groups to which the provisions of this 
Convention apply&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. The right of individuals to freely identify themselves as belonging to an ethnic, 
religious or linguistic group is therefore well-established in international law. It is also 
notable that the existence of a common language or culture does not necessarily negate the 
possibility of ethnic difference, but may rather be evidence of assimilation of different 
population groups over generations. Domestic law relevant to ethnicity, identity, minority 
status, equality and non-discrimination should recognize such rights and ensure that no 
individual or group suffers from any disadvantage or discriminatory treatment on the basis 
of their freely chosen identity as belonging to (or not belonging to) an ethnic, religious, 
linguistic or any other group. 
</p>
<p>15. The country&#8223;s National Unity and Reconciliation Commission undertook a survey 
and produced a report in October 2010 entitled <i>Rwanda Reconciliation Barometer</i>.3 The 
survey revealed that some 60 per cent of people consider themselves Rwandans not 
identified along ethnic lines and indicates that ethnicity is increasingly less relevant in post-
genocide Rwanda. Some 97 per cent of respondents exhibited a strong preference for a 
national Rwandan identity and national values. It is nevertheless acknowledged in the

</p>
<p>report that &#8220;many research participants indicated that they believed that references to 
ethnicity or ethnic groups are prohibited in Rwanda&#8221;.<footnote name="4">2. The Office of the Ombudsman23 has a mandate to fight against injustices and 
corruption, which includes obligations under the International Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It receives from individuals or 
independent associations complaints made against public officials or organs and private 
institutions. It can request explanations, carry out investigations, review laws and submit 
cases to concerned institutions for settlement. The Government notes that the Commission 
and the Ombudsman&#8223;s office play important roles in the country&#8223;s non-discrimination 
policy. Other important steps also have been taken by the Government to decrease the 
salience of ethnic categories, such as eliminating the requirement to state ethnicity on 
identity cards.  
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>16. The Institute of Research and Dialogue for Peace, a Kigali-based social research 
institution, also conducted research on social cohesion in 2010 to evaluate the impact of 
ethnicity on social life, using a quantitative and qualitative approach.5 While noting that 
&#8220;strictly speaking, ethnic groups do not exist in Rwanda&#8221;,6 it continues: &#8220;however, the 
social reality of the ethnic group is there and influences life in society, the political 
decisions and the quality of social life&#8230;the ethnic logic can also become a mechanism of 
reasoning which consists in thinking and acting as a member of an ethnic group&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>Consequently, &#8220;it would be nonsense to declare that there are no ethnic groups in Rwanda 
&#8230; every Rwandan is able to tell you his/her ethnic group but on the other side, everybody 
hesitates to discuss the ethnic issues except within the ethnic group where he/she belongs. 
The ethnic consciousness has become a reality over the years&#8221;.<footnote name="7">4. The Government reports that all Rwandans are fully represented in the national 
governance structures and the judiciary. Under article 9, paragraph 4, of the Constitution, 
women are granted at least 30 per cent of posts in decision-making organs. In 2003, women 
occupied slightly above 48 per cent of parliamentary seats, while, in the 2008 parliamentary 
elections, women won over 56 per cent of seats. However, since no ethnically 
disaggregated data exists and discussion of ethnicity is taboo, it is difficult to assess the 
extent to which significant ethnic diversity exists within decision-making bodies, 
particularly with respect to the leadership within those bodies. 
</footnote> 
</p>
<p>17. The Institute emphasized that inter-ethnic relationships have improved. However, 
while 53 per cent of people assessed the relations between Rwandans as &#8220;good&#8221; or &#8220;very 
good&#8221;, some 46.9 per cent of the population remains cautious about social harmony and 
considers that major challenges to social cohesion remain. According to the Institute, the 
underlying mistrust among ethnic groups remains and building a strong national identity 
requires long-lasting solutions regarding secondary identities, particularly ethnic identity. 
According to the Institute&#8223;s report, the &#8220;challenges to social cohesion include extremist 
</p>
<p>speeches by some politicians, the murders of some genocide survivors during <i>gacaca</i> trials, 
the lack of opportunities to organize a constructive debate around ethnic issues, and 
persisting ethnic bias in the management of public affairs&#8221;.8 
</p>
<p>18. Several NGOs have expressed concern regarding the Government&#8223;s position on 
ethnicity and noted that refusal to acknowledge ethnic difference and monitor relative 
equality effectively allows discrimination in any sphere of society to continue unimpeded. 
One international NGO states that: &#8220;The current government&#8223;s policy that everyone is 
</p>
<p>Rwandan and no minority ethnic groups exist in the country does not address the deep-
rooted tensions that continue to exist in Rwandan society. Moreover, it allows a situation to 
develop in which a group can enjoy a de facto position of privilege, while others are 
forbidden to challenge it&#8221;.9 
</p>
<p>19. In its May 2009 concluding observations on Rwanda, the Human Rights Committee 
stated: &#8220;the Committee is concerned about the non-recognition of the existence of 
minorities and indigenous peoples in Rwanda&#8221; (CCPR/C/RWA/CO/3, para. 22). Equally, 
the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed concern in its March 
2011 concluding observations on Rwanda that the Government&#8223;s priority of national unity 
was likely to ignore the specificities of certain groups, including the Batwa 
(CERD/C/RWA/CO/13-17, para. 9). The Committee urged the Government to take into 
account the specificities of each of the groups that make up its population. 
</p>
<p>  
 4 The report notes that this perception is incorrect. The report states that, contrary to popular belief, it is 
</p>
<p>not ethnic, but rather economic cleavages that are most divisive in Rwandan society today.

</p>
<p><b> IV. Protection of distinct groups and prevention of genocide 
</b></p>
<p>20. Understandably, one of the highest priorities of the Government has been to 
guarantee security and prevent a recurrence of genocide or ethnic-based violence. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Domestic law 
</b></p>
<p>21. Article 9 of the 2003 Constitution commits the Government to &#8220;fighting the 
ideology of genocide and all its manifestations, eradication of ethnic, regional and other 
divisions and promotion of national unity&#8221;. Law No. 18/2008 of 23 July 2008 relating to 
the Punishment of the Crime of Genocide Ideology was promulgated in October 2008. 
Under the law, the crime of genocide ideology is defined as: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Behaviour manifested by facts aimed at dehumanizing a person or a group of 
persons with the same characteristics in the following manner:  
</p>
<p>1. threatening, intimidating, degrading through defamatory speeches, 
documents or actions which aim at propounding wickedness or inciting hatred;  
</p>
<p>2. marginalising, laughing at one&#8223;s misfortune, defaming, mocking, boasting, 
despising, degrading, creating confusion aiming at negating the genocide which 
occurred, stirring up ill feelings, taking revenge, altering testimony or evidence for 
the genocide which occurred;  
</p>
<p>3 illing, planning to kill or attempting to kill someone for purposes of 
furthering genocide ideology.&#8221;  
</p>
<p>The sentence for genocide ideology is imprisonment for 10&#8211;25 years and a fine of up to 1 
million Rwandan francs. 
</p>
<p>22. According to article 1 of Law No. 47/2001 on Prevention, Suppression and 
Punishment of the crime of Discrimination and Sectarianism, sectarianism is defined under 
the law as &#8220;the use of any speech, written statement or action that divides people, that is 
</p>
<p>likely to spark conflicts among people, or that causes an uprising which might degenerate 
into strife among people based on discrimination&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>23. The laws of Rwanda on genocide ideology, sectarianism and divisionism have been 
severely criticized by NGOs, including on the grounds that it is unclear what acts constitute 
crimes under the laws and that they violate the right to freedom of expression. Amnesty 
International has described the laws as &#8220;broad and ill-defined&#8221; and stated that &#8220;the vague 
wording of the laws is deliberately exploited to violate human rights&#8221;.10 Other human rights 
groups maintain that the laws could be used to prosecute those who make benign references 
to ethnic identity or who seek to advocate for ethnic rights. Credible allegations have been 
made that charges of &#8220;divisionism&#8221; and &#8220;genocide ideology&#8221; have been used to silence 
dissent and obstruct the activities of legitimate political opposition (see chapter VI on 
political participation below). Government-sponsored surveys have revealed that it is 
commonly understood by Rwandans that references to ethnicity or ethnic groups are 
prohibited by law.11 In April 2010, the Government announced a review of the law on 
genocide ideology to respond to these criticisms and pertinent recommendations by the 
country&#8223;s development partners.

<p>24. The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination recommended that &#8220;the 
State party contemplate revising Law No. 18/2008 &#8230; with a view to making the definition 
of &#8222;the ideology of genocide&#8223; in article 2 more specific, and to include intention as one of 
the constituent elements of this crime listed in article 3, and thus to provide all the 
guarantees of predictability and legal security required of a criminal law and prevent any 
arbitrary interpretation or application of this law&#8221; (CERD/C/RWA/CO/13-17, para. 14). 
</p>
<p><b> B. Institutional initiatives 
</b></p>
<p>25. The independent expert met with the National Commission for the Fight Against 
Genocide created under the 2003 Constitution but active only since 2008. The mandate of 
the Commission requires it to, inter alia, design and implement strategies for fighting 
genocide and its ideology; coordinate remembrance activities and preserve memorial sites; 
and provide assistance to genocide survivors. Its mandate allows the Commission to 
undertake educational activities in schools and to work to preserve the memory of the 
genocide among new generations. 
</p>
<p>26. <i>Ingando</i>, a practice which originated in pre-colonial Rwanda, refers to ceasing 
normal activities in order to reflect on and find solutions to national challenges.12 The 
National Unity and Reconciliation Commission formally reintroduced <i>Ingando</i> as a tool to 
foster peaceful coexistence within post-genocide communities. The first participants were 
ex-combatants returning from the Democratic Republic of Congo, followed by students, 
genocide survivors, prisoners, community leaders and women. <i>Ingandos</i> are now carried 
out countrywide and frequently co-facilitated with communities. <i>Ingandos</i> entail 
participation at residential camps for up to two months&#8223; duration. Five central themes are: 
analysis of the country&#8223;s problems; history; political and socio-economic issues; rights; 
obligations; and leadership. 
</p>
<p>27. Historically, <i>Itorero </i>ry&#8217;igihugu13 was a national educational and mentoring 
institution for leadership with lessons including history, philosophy, sociology, oral 
literature, ethics, theology, political and military sciences, law, and patriotism. In 2007, the 
<i>Itorero</i> system was reintroduced to encourage people from different social groups to 
discuss issues such as good governance, national unity, reconciliation, justice, economic 
development and social problems. Government officials state that more than 87,000 people 
have participated in this civic education and training.14 Plans exist to extend the programme 
throughout the country. 
</p>
<p>28. The National Service of Gacaca Jurisdictions highlighted that the Rwandan judicial 
system was overwhelmed by the aftermath of the genocide and had itself been decimated. 
Over 120,000 prisoners alleged to have committed genocide needed to be processed 
through the conventional judicial system. The capacity to investigate and prosecute was 
severely limited. Confronted by the need to speed up the justice process, avoid impunity 
and find a solution that also contributed to strengthening unity and reconciliation, the 
Government looked to a traditional system of conflict resolution and participatory justice at 
the community level. The <i>gacaca</i> system was introduced and modernized in 2001.15 
</p>
<p>29. The Government highlights that, since <i>gacaca</i> courts commenced work in 2002, 
1,211,<footnote name="41">. The National Human Rights Commission was established under the constitution 
with a mandate to, inter alia, examine human rights violations committed by any person on 
Rwandan territory, with special emphasis on violations by Government bodies and agents. 
The Commission is required to raise awareness of human rights among the Rwandan 
population and organize relevant training programmes, prepare and disseminate annual and 
human rights reports and initiate legal proceedings against anyone who commits human 
rights violations. The Commission reports are transmitted to the parliament and other State 
bodies and are available to the public. 
</footnote>2 cases have been tried and completed throughout the country. Emphasis was 
placed on confessions and reduced or community-based sentences were offered to those 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b> 
</p>
<p>pleading guilty. A survey reported that over 80 per cent of Rwandans believed that <i>gacaca</i> 
courts made positive contributions in terms of facilitating the successful reconciliation of 
Rwandans and delivering justice.16 
</p>
<p>30. Criticisms levelled at the <i>gacaca</i> system included that: it did not meet international 
due process standards; judges had little or no legal training being appointed only as &#8220;people 
of integrity&#8221;; no defence counsel was available to offenders; the process lacked safeguards 
</p>
<p>to prevent false accusations; some judges, survivors and witnesses were threatened or 
killed; some judges were corrupt or themselves implicated in crimes; and the sentences 
were not proportionate to the crimes. International experts questioned the degree to which 
the process fulfilled obligations to prosecute genocide perpetrators. 
</p>
<p>31. The Government has responded that <i>gacaca</i> judges did receive training and 
technical assistance provided by legal experts of the National Service of <i>gacaca</i> Courts. 
Incompetent or corrupt judges were denounced and expelled. In the Government&#8223;s view, it 
was most important that <i>gacaca</i> courts were &#8220;mainly a conciliatory justice&#8221; with simple 
procedures and the active participation of the concerned population. 
</p>
<p>32. Now that the <i>gacaca</i> process has ended, there are concerns over how new returnees 
will be reintegrated into their former communities and how tensions arising from their 
return will be handled. Many Rwandans refugees, including ex-Rwandan Armed Forces 
(ex-FAR) combatants and members of the <i>interahamwe</i> militia, have returned to Rwanda 
and tensions around their return have been processed through the <i>gacaca</i> village-level 
courts. The independent expert visited the Mutobo demobilization camp, where returnees 
from the Democratic Republic of Congo to Rwanda are following reintegration 
programmes before return to their old communities. She met former combatants of the 
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda recently returned from years spent in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, who indicated that there are many others who wish to 
return. The winding-up of the <i>gacaca</i> courts may leave a crucial gap in the punishment and 
reintegration process. 
</p>
<p>33. With regard to <i>gacaca</i>, the Institute of Research and Dialogue for Peace states that: 
&#8220;this popular and proximity justice has inevitably hurt many people who need to be healed 
in order to achieve social cohesion&#8221;.17 The Institute nevertheless concludes that it: 
&#8220;responds clearly to the need for justice and launches a debate on ethnic issues &#8230; it opens 
the wounds that need to be healed in order to achieve social cohesion. Politically speaking, 
it would not be fair to leave the pending post-Gacaca conflict without creating a mechanism 
to bring people together. The framework of debate that has been created by Gacaca is very 
relevant and creates opportunities to solve ethnic conflicts.&#8221;18 The Government emphasizes 
that a strategy to deal with any problems that may result from the conclusion of the <i>gacaca</i> 
courts is being formulated by the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, which 
has started a programme known as &#8220;community dialogue&#8221; meant to deal with such issues. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Gender-based crimes 
</b></p>
<p>34. It is estimated that in the region of 250,000&#8211;500,000 mostly minority Tutsi women 
and girls were raped during the genocide. This led to groundbreaking jurisprudence 
developed by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons 
Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law

<p>Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide 
and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 
January and 31 December 1994 that recognized that rape could be a constituent element in 
the crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity. The Tribunal secured important 
convictions in this regard and documented a more detailed picture of the Rwandan genocide 
than had previously existed of any such events.19 
</p>
<p>35. The country&#8223;s domestic genocide law recognizes rape and sexual torture as category 
one crimes &#8211; acts of genocide and crimes against humanity. The <i>gacaca</i> courts were able to 
consider rape cases following an amendment to the genocide law in 2008. Cases of sexual 
violence involving some 6,808 persons were transferred to <i>gacaca</i> courts. Specialist 
training was provided to <i>gacaca</i> judges and such cases were required to be considered in 
closed sessions to protect survivors. Trauma counsellors were also made available. 
However, according to Human Rights Watch, &#8220;rape victims uniformly expressed 
disappointment at having to appear in <i>gacaca</i> rather than conventional courts, as <i>gacaca</i> 
proceedings &#8211; even behind closed doors &#8211; failed to protect their privacy.&#8221;20 
</p>
<p>36. In September 2009, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against 
Women noted its concern that &#8220;equal access to justice and appropriate protection and 
support may not be guaranteed for all women and girl [rape] victims within the framework 
of the comprehensive process of prosecution of perpetrators that is ongoing at international 
and national levels&#8221; (CEDAW/C/RWA/CO/6, para. 23). The Committee urged Rwanda to 
continue to ensure appropriate protection, support and equal access to justice for the women 
victims of sexual violence during the genocide. 
</p>
<p>37. Genocide survivors constitute a group with particular challenges that must be 
addressed with sensitivity. While most belong to the formerly recognized Tutsi minority, 
moderate Hutu and Batwa were also victims. Credible evidence indicates that survivors 
continue to face harassment, violence and trauma. Many women survivors live with 
HIV/AIDS as a result of rape. The independent expert met with IBUKA (which means 
&#8220;remember&#8221; in Kinyarwanda), which represents genocide survivors and works to protect 
their rights and address their needs. 
</p>
<p>38. Estimates suggest that as many as 70 per cent of the rape survivors are HIV-
positive.21 In a 2004 report, African Rights, a human rights organization, detailed the fact 
that the majority were lacking basic needs such as shelter, adequate food and medication.22 
African Rights stated, &#8220;we find that genocide rape victims in Rwanda lead a uniquely 
troubled existence&#8221;. Their research revealed that &#8220;most genocide rape victims suggest that 
they will never feel comfortable in groups where there is a possibility of meeting relatives 
of the men who raped them, or simply of exposing themselves to a community they believe 
betrayed them&#8221;. Survivors of sexual violence reportedly continue to experience significant 
gaps in access to healthcare and only an estimated 28 per cent of households affected by 
HIV/AIDS are able to afford treatment. Organizations such as the Association of the 
Widows of the Genocide (AVEGA AGAHOSA) provide support networks for women, 
improve their living conditions and provide medical and psychological support.

</p>
<p><b> V. Protection of the rights to non-discrimination and equality</b> 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal framework and institutions 
</b></p>
<p>39. Rwanda is a party to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial 
Discrimination and other core human rights treaties mandating non-discrimination. Under 
article 1 of the 2003 Constitution, &#8220;all Rwandans are born and remain free and equal in 
rights and duties. Discrimination of whatever kind based on, inter alia, ethnic origin, tribe, 
clan, colour, sex, region, social origin, religion or faith, opinion, economic status, culture, 
language, social status, physical or mental disability or any other form of discrimination is 
prohibited and punishable by law.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>40. The Criminal Code establishes penalties for hate speech, discriminatory acts of 
public officials, discrimination in the supply of public goods and services, employment 
discrimination, and physical attacks. There are also anti-discrimination provisions in the 
Labour Code, the General Statute of Public Service, Organic Law No. 20/2003 concerning 
Education in Rwanda and legislation relating to the justice sector, including the police. 
Furthermore, according to the Government, Law No. 47/2001 on Prevention, Suppression 
and Punishment of the Crime of Discrimination and Sectarianism has been instrumental in 
the fight against discrimination in post-genocide Rwanda. Thereunder, discrimination is 
defined as any speech, writing, or actions based on ethnicity, region or country of origin, 
the colour of the skin, physical features, sex, language, religion or ideas aimed at depriving 
a person or group of persons of their rights as provided by Rwandan law and the 
international conventions to which Rwanda is party. 
</p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>13 
</p>
<p>44. The absence of complaints to Government bodies cannot be interpreted as an 
absence of discrimination. A survey by the Institute of Research and Dialogue for Peace 
indicates that ethnic-based discrimination remains a problem in Rwandan society.24 Some 
36.5 per cent of interviewees believed that ethnic-related injustices exist in the labour 
market, justice system, public administration and service sector. The Government&#8223;s own 
</p>
<p>research documented in the <i>Rwanda Reconciliation Barometer</i> notes that 31.5 per cent of 
respondents &#8220;agreed&#8221; or &#8220;strongly agreed&#8221; with the statement: &#8220;although ethnic 
discrimination is banned in Rwanda, it still occurs&#8221;. Some 30.5 per cent of respondents 
</p>
<p>&#8220;agreed&#8221; or &#8220;strongly agreed&#8221; that &#8220;Rwandans still judge each other on the basis of ethnic 
stereotypes&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>45. Although Kinyarwanda, English and French are all official languages of Rwanda, 
some sources noted that the Government was pursuing a policy to promote the use of 
English, which favours those members of the population who lived in Anglophone 
countries while in exile. A 2008 Government decree to replace French with English25 in 
2010 as the language of instruction from elementary school grade three had a significant 
impact on French-speaking teachers and administration staff. The Government states that 
there is no discrimination on the basis of language and that promotion of English in 
education and Government affairs is for economic reasons and to facilitate Rwandan 
membership in Anglophone regional integration organizations. 
</p>
<p>46. Numerous non-governmental sources contend that independent research and 
qualitative data reveal that persons belonging to certain identifiable groups face 
disadvantages or inequalities. Official population surveys, census or other data 
disaggregated on the basis of ethnicity are not available in Rwanda because of the 
Government&#8223;s policy to not recognize ethnic categories. At least one Government body, 
</p>
<p>however, has decided there is a need for disaggregated data in ensuring access of some 
vulnerable groups to services and in monitoring that access. The 2011 Ministry of Local 
Government&#8223;s National Social Protection Strategy26 notes that &#8220;when undertaking 
monitoring we will ensure that data is disaggregated so that we can effectively track the 
inclusion of priority vulnerable categories in social protection programmes&#8221;. It is notable 
that this report states that &#8220;disaggregation of data will take place by, for example, sex, age, 
disability, ethnicity and status as genocide survivors&#8221;, which appears to be inconsistent with 
the Government position of non-recognition of ethnicity and consequently ethnic data. 
</p>
<p>47. The Constitution allows for consideration of affirmative action, however not 
explicitly based on ethnicity. Article 14 states that: &#8220;the State shall, within the limits of its 
capacity, take special measures for the welfare of the survivors of genocide &#8230; the disabled, 
the indigent and the elderly as well as other vulnerable groups&#8221;. In addition, under article 9, 
paragraph 4, of the Rwandan constitution, women are granted at least 30 per cent of posts 
in decision-making organs. In the <i>National Social Protection Strategy</i>, the Ministry of 
Local Government states that it seeks to help historically marginalized peoples in Rwanda 
and, &#8220;in particular, we will enable them to overcome their disadvantages by providing 
positive discrimination in terms of access to benefits from public services&#8221; (p. 33). Batwa 
and NGO representatives nevertheless emphasize that, while some groups, including 
women and genocide survivors, are afforded special measures, other highly disadvantaged 
groups are not.

</p>
<p>48. Government representatives noted that pre-genocide policies had been based on an 
ethnic quota system for access to secondary and higher education, training and Government 
employment, based on the percentage of each ethnic group in the general population. That 
quota-based system was instituted by the Hutu-led Government in reaction to the privileges 
previously afforded to those identified as Tutsi. The post-genocide Government, in its effort 
to eliminate ethnicity as a basis for privileges, made a strong commitment to a merit-based 
system based solely on test scores. There are currently no affirmative action programmes 
for those who may have in the past faced disadvantage or discrimination. 
</p>
<p><b> B. The situation of Batwa communities in Rwanda 
</b></p>
<p>49. While the Constitution rejects ethnic classifications, it does recognize an undefined 
group referred to as &#8220;historically marginalized people&#8221;. The 2011 National Social 
Protection Strategy states that: &#8220;historically marginalised people &#8211; who number around 25-
30,000 in total &#8211; are believed to experience higher levels of poverty and worse social 
indicators than the general population, although little objective data is available&#8221; (p. 13). 
While the Batwa are considered to be in the category of &#8220;historically marginalized people&#8221;, 
there is a lack of clarity with regard to the category&#8223;s precise official definition. It is evident 
that the Government also includes other vulnerable groups among the category. 
</p>
<p>50. The Senate Commission in charge of Social Affairs, Human Rights and Social 
Issues published the <i>Report on the Conditions of Some Rwandans Disadvantaged 
Throughout History</i> (the Senate Report), widely understood to be focused on the Batwa. 
This report highlighted that: &#8220;some people still have the attitude of despising them, of not 
seeing them as genuine human beings, and they address them in words fuelling 
discrimination&#8221;.27   
</p>
<p>51. The Senate Report concluded that &#8220;these Rwandans have special and serious 
problems to be solved as a matter of urgency&#8221;, including: &#8220;not seeing themselves as people 
</p>
<p>with importance and rights; living like animals, as they have no adequate accommodation; 
not having any land to cultivate or to be used for development activities; not having 
property or crafts to help them earn a living; not utilizing healthcare services; lacking 
income and jobs; not having their children in school; early marriage or promiscuity; 
ignorance; and not socializing with other Rwandans&#8221;. NGOs that the independent expert 
consulted stated that these findings remain accurate and little progress has been made in 
improving the situation of the Batwa. 
</p>
<p>52. The lack of disaggregated official statistics means that problems, including poor 
socio-economic conditions and declining Batwa numbers, are not apparent in official data. 
Disaggregated data would help reveal the full extent of such problems and allow informed 
and targeted policy and programme responses. Batwa representatives emphasize that a 
Government policy to treat all as equal has as a consequence the failure of national 
Government and local authorities to acknowledge or respond to their particular economic 
and social circumstances. 
</p>
<p>53. In May 2009 the Human Rights Committee stated its concern regarding reports that 
members of the Batwa community are victims of marginalization and discrimination (art. 
27 of the Covenant). The Committee recommended that Rwanda: &#8220;should take steps to 
</p>
<p>ensure that members of the Batwa community are protected against discrimination in every

<p>field, that they are provided with effective remedies in that regard and that they take part in 
public affairs&#8221; (CCPR/C/RWA/CO/3, para. 22). 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Identity 
</b></p>
<p>54. Batwa representatives emphasize their ethnic and cultural distinctiveness.28 It was 
noted by Batwa NGOs that Batwa have distinctive dialects and intonation comprehensible 
only to other Batwa, and unique elements of culture and customs. In contrast to the 
Government&#8223;s official version of the country&#8223;s ethnic history, Batwa historical narrative 
maintains that they were the original inhabitants of Rwandan forests following hunter-
gatherer subsistence livelihoods. As other ethnic groups encroached onto their territories 
bringing livestock farming and cultivation, the Batwa were forced to move to ever more 
remote areas of forest. In the modern era, widespread subsistence and commercial 
agriculture, national parks and tourism development have forced Batwa to leave the 
remaining areas of forest which they occupied. 
</p>
<p>55. Community representatives in the vicinity of Musanze near the Volcanoes National 
Park stated that they were forced from the forests to areas on the lower slopes of the 
volcanoes after 1994. Some community members stated that they wished to return to the 
forest and traditional hunter-gatherer ways of life, but could no longer access the forests 
and their forest-based food and medicinal sources. The distinct hunter-gatherer identities of 
the Batwa and their deep knowledge of the forests have undoubtedly been lost by new 
generations. 
</p>
<p>56. NGOs working on Batwa rights note that, after the 2003 Constitution and the 
legislation and national policy which followed came into force, they faced accusations of 
&#8220;divisionism&#8221; when using the term Batwa, making claims for distinct Batwa identity or 
advocating for Batwa rights as such. 
</p>
<p>57. In 2011, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination expressed 
regret at the Government&#8223;s policy of not recognizing the Batwa community as an 
indigenous people (CERD/C/RWA/CO/13-17, para. 11). The African Peer Review 
Mechanism of the African Union produced a country report in November 2005,29 which 
stated: &#8220;with respect to the Batwa minority, the approach adopted by the authorities was 
based on a policy of assimilation. There appears to be a desire to obliterate distinctive 
identities and to integrate all into some mainstream socio-economic fabric of the country&#8221;. 
The Government was called upon to initiate an in-depth dialogue with the Batwa. 
</p>
<p>58. The Government stated in response that, &#8220;the Batwa community continues to have a 
disproportionate number of vulnerable members, and seem not to benefit sufficiently from 
the ongoing social economic integration of all Rwandans &#8230; the Government has never had 
a policy of assimilation, since that is comparable to socio-cultural genocide ... it is clear that 
a targeted response to their specific problems is recommended and shall be reflected in the 
plan of action&#8221;.30 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Housing, land and income 
</b></p>
<p>59. In most Batwa communities visited by the independent expert, housing conditions 
were far below minimum standards and frequently not suitable for human habitation. 
</p>
<p>  
 28 The independent expert visited Batwa communities near Kigali, Musanze in the Northern Province 
</p>
<p>and outside Butare in the Southern Province.

</b></p>
<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>Shelters were commonly small and fragile constructions of sticks, grass, plastic sheeting 
and/or pieces of textile. They provided little protection from the elements, including 
frequent heavy rainfall. These communities were commonly located on steeply sloping 
hillsides that were not conducive to anything but small-scale shelters, but frequently housed 
whole families including children. 
</p>
<p>60. In December 2010, the Government&#8223;s &#8220;Bye Bye Nyakatsi&#8221; programme required 
demolition of thatched roofed homes (<i>nyakatsi</i>) to be replaced by iron-roofed structures. 
NGOs are concerned that local authorities have demolished the houses of Batwa before any 
replacement houses or appropriate assistance has been provided. While the programme is 
not solely for the Batwa, the Batwa may be disproportionately affected, since they 
commonly live in rudimentary thatched shelters, exist in conditions of disadvantage and 
vulnerability and are poorly equipped to respond to difficulties created by the premature 
dismantling of their homes. 
</p>
<p>61. In one community near Butare, community members spoke from the remains of their 
homes, which they said had been demolished just prior to the independent expert&#8223;s visit, 
leaving them without shelter and forced to rely on neighbours. A plot had been cleared for 
construction, but no houses had been provided. In every Batwa community visited with 
national NGOs, communities asked her to convey their plight to the Government and 
request urgent provision of adequate housing. 
</p>
<p>62. The Ombudsman&#8223;s office stated that Batwa benefit equally from Government 
programmes to provide housing and iron roofing, but frequently sell the roofing provided or 
knock down the walls of houses to create a single room. Batwa were frequently referred to 
as &#8220;ignorant&#8221; and not capable of benefiting from Government assistance. Officials stated 
</p>
<p>that they had received no complaints from Batwa, but undertook to assess the situation of 
the communities identified. Batwa representatives told the independent expert that 
discriminatory treatment and lack of confidence created barriers to their filing complaints 
with authorities. 
</p>
<p>63. Many Batwa are land-less agricultural labourers or, lacking paid employment, exist 
through begging or charity. Batwa-rights NGOs noted that Batwa were not used to land 
ownership or managing finances and often lacked cultivation skills enabling them to adapt 
to life outside of the forest. In recent years, pottery has become an important source of 
income and a significant aspect of Batwa identity. However, lack of access to clay and 
cheap modern alternatives to traditionally crafted pots have limited income from this 
activity. Many Batwa today live in extreme poverty. 
</p>
<p>64. The Ombudsman stated that under a Government public works programme, people 
without income are given work by the district authorities including cleaning and road 
maintenance. While Batwa should have access to this programme, it was evident that some 
communities were living in remote areas and under conditions of extreme hardship and that 
such Government assistance was failing to reach them. 
</p>
<p>65. The &#8220;Girinka&#8221; programme, a &#8220;One Cow per Poor Family&#8221; programme, aims to 
provide poor families occupying more than 0.7 hectares of land with a cow. NGOs point 
out that many Batwa do not have land that is suitable for livestock, and often lack animal 
husbandry skills, making them largely unable to meet the criteria for participating in or 
benefit from this programme. 
</p>

</p>
<p>frequently experiencing hunger and children showed obvious signs of malnutrition. Poor 
shelters and exposure to cold and rain have negative implication for Batwa health along 
with limited sources of drinking water. 
</p>
<p>67. According to representatives of the Community of Potters of Rwanda,31 their 
research had demonstrated that the percentage of Batwa who had health-insurance coverage 
was declining. In Bwiza, community members said that the Batwa in that community had 
not benefited from the Government programme of subsidized insurance cards for the 
poorest members of society. Certain individuals displayed wounds clearly requiring 
medical treatment. The Government that &#8220;all indigents and other vulnerable persons have 
their health insurance paid by Government (Some 650,000 to 700,000 persons, including 
the historically marginalized people)&#8221;.32 
</p>
<p>68. Batwa representatives emphasized the effects of poverty on the lives and health of 
Batwa women. Women in extreme poverty and with poor education and health information 
may be vulnerable to high rates of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. Poor levels 
of education and medical information also play a role. Very high infant mortality rates are a 
manifestation of poor living conditions and lack of access to adequate maternal health care. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Education 
</b></p>
<p>69. Research indicates that Batwa children experience significant obstacles to their right 
to education relative to other population groups, including low levels of enrolment, 
particularly at the post-primary level, very high dropout rates and poor education outcomes. 
According to a survey conducted by the Community of Potters of Rwanda,33 only 23 per 
cent of Batwa can read and write. Very few Batwa proceed to higher education institutions. 
Research34 in 2008 and 2009 revealed that 54 per cent of Batwa women and girls 
interviewed had not been to school. 
</p>
<p>70. The Government and NGOs highlighted that the Ministry of Education had initiated 
a policy of free primary and secondary education for children from marginalized and other 
vulnerable families in State schools in 2008/9.The Government has achieved commendable 
successes in the field of education and notes that Rwanda is close to reaching universal 
education in primary and secondary school. Primary school enrolment stands at 94 per cent 
for boys and 96.5 per cent for girls. However, the poor living conditions of some Batwa 
families are clearly affecting the ability of Batwa children to attend school or achieve good 
education outcomes. In one community visited near Musanze, hunger was highlighted as 
the primary factor contributing to poor school attendance. Batwa representatives also stated 
that children face discrimination in school and are often &#8220;chased away&#8221; from the classroom. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Government responses 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Government states that it &#8220;doesn&#8223;t deny the existence of a people called Batwa 
[but] refutes the tendency to allege that the Batwa population of Rwanda constitutes an 
</p>
<p>  
 31 In 2007, the principal organization representing the Batwa had to change its name from Community 
</p>
<p>of Indigenous People of Rwanda to Community of Potters of Rwanda to adhere to Government 
regulations not allowing formal recognition of distinct ethnic or indigenous groups. See

</p>
<p>ethnic group or an indigenous people&#8221;.35 It acknowledged that, in accordance with the 
policy on rural settlement and programme of natural forests and national parks, Batwa and 
other Rwandans were removed from forests and relocated to organized settlements across 
the country through a consultative process. The Government asserts that by living in 
organized settlements, historically marginalized people have greater access to essential 
services and are better able to benefit from socio-economic opportunities and assistance 
programmes. 
</p>
<p>72. The Government notes that historically marginalized people benefit from a variety 
of Government programmes such as universal education for all, the &#8220;One Cow per Poor 
Family&#8221; programme and other programmes as set out in Rwanda&#8223;s vision 2020 Umurenge 
Programme and Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper, among others (see CERD/C/RWA/13-
17, paragraph 192). The independent expert visited villages, including Gahini in the Eastern 
Province and in Muhanga in the Southern Province, with the National Human Rights 
Commission and the National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, in which Batwa 
individuals and families appeared well-integrated into wider communities. They had 
housing on a par with other families in the community, plots of land and were pursuing 
activities such as pottery and small-scale cultivation. 
</p>
<p>73. Batwa community members in those villages stated that they had received 
Government support to build tin-roofed housing. Some families had also benefited from the 
&#8220;One Cow per Poor Family&#8221; programme. They expressed general satisfaction with service 
provision including education and health care. However these examples stand in marked 
contrast to the situation of Batwa communities visited by the independent expert with 
NGOs. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Protection of the right to effective political participation 
</b></p>
<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>19 
</p>
<p>more effectively to local circumstances, the needs of certain excluded groups such as the 
Batwa are not being met due to their poor participation and representation in political life 
even at the local level. 
</p>
<p>77. The Senate Report of 2007 stated: &#8220;it is noticeable that leaders do not go up to them 
in order to know their problems &#8230; do not go and see them so as to listen to their concerns 
&#8230; [and) are not sufficiently concerned about their problems&#8221;.36 It was evident from the 
independent expert&#8223;s consultations that local authorities continue to pay insufficient 
attention to Batwa issues. 
</p>
<p>78. The independent expert was informed that some political parties had been banned 
and certain opposition politicians arrested and detained. A 2010 Amnesty International 
report37 states, &#8220;political opposition groups were intimidated, harassed and prevented from 
registering in the run-up to the 2010 presidential elections, as happened during the 2003 
presidential elections and 2008 legislative elections. A 2009 Media Law placed undue 
restrictions on press freedom &#8230; Restrictions on freedom of expression and association, 
compounded by ambiguous &#8222;genocide ideology&#8223; and &#8222;sectarianism&#8223; laws &#8230; have a 
cumulative effect in silencing dissent in Rwandan society.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>79. The Government states that some political parties have been lawfully refused 
registration on the grounds that they contravene the Constitutional prohibition of political 
parties based on race, ethnic group or tribe and that do not reflect the unity of the people of 
Rwanda. It notes, however, that the law governing political parties is under review. A draft 
new law provides that registration will be administered by an independent institution, the 
Rwanda Governance Board. It has also informed the independent expert of other planned 
reforms in the regulation of media and access to information. 
</p>
<p>80. Two opposition parties, PS-Imberakuri and FDU-Inkingi, reportedly with a support 
base among the Hutu, have allegedly faced restrictions and their respective leaders, Bernard 
Ntaganda and Victoire Ingabire, were imprisoned and unable to contest 2010 elections. Mr. 
Ntaganda is accused of divisionism and genocide ideology and Ms. Ingabire faces 
accusations of links with a terrorist group in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Such 
activities may serve to fuel perceptions, conveyed to the independent expert by sources 
inside and outside Rwanda, that political freedoms are restricted and that an ethnic-based 
political elite exists, and is resistant to meaningful democratic reforms. 
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>81.<b> The Government of Rwanda must be commended for many of its post-genocide 
initiatives and positive practices to promote healing and transformation, development 
</b></p>
<p><b>and growth. It is now a country that is unrecognizable in comparison to 1994 </b>&#8211;<b> a 
</b></p>
<p><b>country of increasing opportunity, prosperity and stability. Importantly, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government also acknowledges that many challenges remain, including to fully 
</b></p>
<p><b>establish and maintain the conditions for lasting stability and peace based on equality 
</b></p>
<p><b>for all. 
</b></p>
<p>82.<b> The 1994 genocide decimated Rwanda along ethnic lines. Group identity and 
divisions, whether real, perceived, or socially constructed, nevertheless existed and 
</b></p>
<p><b>were tragically deepened by those shocking events. Seventeen years after the genocide, 
</b></p>
<p><b>it is difficult for an outside observer to fully assess the extent to which different ethnic 
</b></p>
<p>

 37 Amnesty International, <i>Safer to Stay Silent</i>, p. 12. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b> 
</p>
<p><b>identities remain salient. However, 17 years is too short a period for such tragic 
</b></p>
<p><b>memories to be erased. 
</b></p>
<p>83.<b> Efforts by the Government to forge unity through a national Rwandan identity 
and to diminish the role of ethnicity as a destructive force are laudable. It is also 
</b></p>
<p><b>important to guarantee the rights of individuals and communities to freely express 
</b></p>
<p><b>their ethnic identity and culture. These are not incompatible, but Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>suppression of identity is inconsistent with this second value. In fact, rather than 
</b></p>
<p><b>suppressing discussion of ethnicity, at crucial points, Government may need to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>explicit in demonstrating that all people are equal regardless of ethnicity by 
</b></p>
<p><b>deliberately including members of all groups in every Government decision-making 
</b></p>
<p><b>body, as has been done to recognise the equality of women. 
</b></p>
<p>84.<b> In order to achieve the goals of social cohesion, unity and reconciliation, 
legitimate group-based concerns need to be expressly addressed and those rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>fulfilled. Where inequalities based on ethnicity have existed, whether intentionally or 
</b></p>
<p><b>de facto, corrective special measures must be undertaken to establish equal enjoyment 
</b></p>
<p><b>of rights. A critical tool to implement this policy is the collection and publication of 
</b></p>
<p><b>data regarding all aspects of the socio-economic situation in the country and political 
</b></p>
<p><b>participation that is disaggregated along ethnic and socio-religious lines. 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> Social cohesion, particularly in States with a history of ethnic-based violence, is 
a long-term goal that is best achieved through dialogue; open and constructive 
</b></p>
<p><b>discussion and uncensored debate that allows grievances to be aired and solutions to be 
</b></p>
<p><b>sought transparently and collectively. In this respect, the national dialogues on issues 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant to ethnicity, national identity and reconciliation undertaken by the Institute of 
</b></p>
<p><b>Research and Dialogue for Peace, in collaboration with government, are highly 
</b></p>
<p><b>commendable. It is a public process which has been useful to assess progress, identify 
</b></p>
<p><b>challenges, and build confidence. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Reconciliation mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> An important part of the difficult healing process achieved to date has been 
brought about through dialogue and the courage to come together </b>&#8211;<b> victims and 
</b></p>
<p><b>perpetrators </b>&#8211;<b> to confront the past. Despite enormous challenges and significant 
</b></p>
<p><b>deficiencies, the <i>gacaca</i> court system has been instrumental in creating a pathway for 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities to move forward. An in-depth analysis of the <i>gacaca</i> court process and 
</b></p>
<p><b>its outcomes is beyond the scope of this report. 
</b></p>
<p>87.<b> Nevertheless, the independent expert urges the Government, as it brings the 
<i>gacaca</i> process to a close, to put in place a long-term strategy that recognizes the 
</b></p>
<p><b>continuing need for community-centred reconciliation mechanisms. Reconciliation 
</b></p>
<p><b>must be considered to be an ongoing process. Alleged perpetrators of genocide 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue to return to Rwanda from neighbouring countries and settle back into 
</b></p>
<p><b>communities where their crimes were committed. Returns open wounds in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>community that must be addressed through a community process. Furthermore, 
</b></p>
<p><b>precautions must be taken to ensure the security of individuals and the community as 
</b></p>
<p><b>a whole. 
</b></p>
<p>88.<b> The situation and needs of women who suffered rape and other sexual violence 
and who may be living with HIV/AIDS must be given high priority, including to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure their access to life-saving medication. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>21 
</p>
<p><b> B. Laws relating to genocide ideology and divisionism 
</b></p>
<p>89.<b> The current wording of Rwandan laws relating to genocide ideology, 
divisionism and sectarianism is problematic and ill-defined. Equally, implementation 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the laws has gone considerably beyond the limits to freedom of expression 
</b></p>
<p><b>envisaged in article 20, paragraph 2, of the International Covenant on Civil and 
</b></p>
<p><b>Political Rights and article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All 
</b></p>
<p><b>Forms of Racial Discrimination. These laws must be revised as a matter of urgency 
</b></p>
<p><b>and safeguards should be implemented to guarantee that they are not used to silence 
</b></p>
<p><b>dissent or restrict the legitimate activities of political opposition. Limitations on 
</b></p>
<p><b>freedom of expression should be strictly necessary and proportionate to the aims 
</b></p>
<p><b>envisaged under the law. Additionally, the legal standard of intentionality must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>reflected clearly in the legislation. The independent expert is encouraged that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Government has stated its plan to re-draft the laws to respond to criticisms.  
</b></p>
<p>90.<b> While there are important anti-discrimination provisions in the Criminal Code 
and other legislation, Rwanda should adopt comprehensive anti-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation, which should include measures to prohibit discrimination and establish 
</b></p>
<p><b>effective civil penalties for discriminatory acts by both State and private actors. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation should provide for effective, transparent enforcement mechanisms which 
</b></p>
<p><b>can be accessed easily by all. 
</b></p>
<p><b> C. Political participation 
</b></p>
<p>91.<b> The effective and meaningful participation of all groups in the political arena 
can be a pivotal element in avoiding violent conflict. In post-conflict and post-genocide 
</b></p>
<p><b>societies this can be particularly important, demonstrating that all groups within 
</b></p>
<p><b>society, both those who previously held power and those who may have faced 
</b></p>
<p><b>exclusion from political structures, are represented and can play a full role in shaping 
</b></p>
<p><b>decisions affecting them. Perceptions that political power is dominated by members of 
</b></p>
<p><b>one group can lead to tensions and instability. 
</b></p>
<p>92.<b> Rwanda must be commended for successes in incorporating women into the 
political leadership positions at the national and local levels. It is equally important 
</b></p>
<p><b>that individuals who may self-identify as belonging to different ethnic backgrounds 
</b></p>
<p><b>also feel effectively represented in national and local Government and in senior 
</b></p>
<p><b>positions in the civil service. It is important to ensure that the judiciary and the civil 
</b></p>
<p><b>service, including the police and military, reflect the full diversity within Rwandan 
</b></p>
<p><b>society. The independent expert urges the Government to consider implementation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>relevant recommendations of the second session of the Forum on Minority Issues on 
</b></p>
<p><b>the thematic subject of minorities and effective political participation (contained in 
</b></p>
<p><b>document A/HRC/13/25). 
</b></p>
<p><b> D. The situation of the Batwa 
</b></p>
<p>93.<b> The Batwa people face discrimination in Rwandan society. They have been 
forcibly removed from their ancestral forest lands without consent or compensation 
</b></p>
<p><b>and deprived of their traditional livelihoods. Many are living in extreme hardship and 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty on the margins of mainstream society. Irreversible damage has been caused to 
</b></p>
<p><b>the distinct lifestyles, livelihoods, cultures and traditional practices of communities by 
</b></p>
<p><b>their displacement.  </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p>94.<b> The Government should acknowledge the Batwa as a distinct population group 
and put focused energy into designing and implementing targeted programmes to 
</b></p>
<p><b>improve their conditions. The Batwa should participate in a meaningful way in all 
</b></p>
<p><b>stages of policy formulation, programme design and implementation of decisions that 
</b></p>
<p><b>affect them. 
</b></p>
<p>95.<b> The Government should compensate displaced Batwa communities and, 
pursuant to effective consultation with those communities, develop initiatives to 
</b></p>
<p><b>reconnect them with their ancestral habitats and cultural practices, recognize their 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights to the natural resources of the forests, and develop programmes that value and 
</b></p>
<p><b>preserve the traditional practices of their forest livelihoods. 
</b></p>
<p>96.<b> The Government must be commended for the programmes that it has instituted 
to date that are targeted to benefit those who are considered the poorest people in 
</b></p>
<p><b>every community, </b>such as the &#8220;One Cow per Poor Family&#8221; programme, work relief 
</p>
<p><b>for those who are unemployed and subsidies for housing, health insurance, and school 
</b></p>
<p><b>costs, and initiatives that it outlines in its National Social Protection Strategy of 2011. 
</b></p>
<p>97.<b> However, many Batwa communities are failing to benefit fully from 
Government initiatives and, in some instances, are facing negative impacts as a result 
</b></p>
<p><b>of the manner in which certain initiatives are implemented at the local level. While not 
</b></p>
<p><b>discriminatory per se, some policies and programmes may have a disproportionate 
</b></p>
<p><b>negative impact on Batwa due to their disadvantaged situation. Equally, due to their 
</b></p>
<p><b>social distance from and relative lack of contact with the mainstream society, Batwa 
</b></p>
<p><b>are failing to take advantage of positive policies. 
</b></p>
<p>98.<b> Batwa families should be allocated land sufficient for them to engage in 
agriculture or livestock farming and should receive the necessary training. Targeted 
</b></p>
<p><b>poverty alleviation programmes should be developed with vocational training 
</b></p>
<p><b>specifically targeted to their particular needs as a population group transitioning from 
</b></p>
<p><b>a hunter-gathering livelihood and assistance to find employment. 
</b></p>
<p>99.<b> Specific programmes to encourage and enable greater enrolment of Batwa 
children in primary and secondary schools are critical. A holistic approach must be 
</b></p>
<p><b>taken that addresses the stigma that confronts Batwa children in schools. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent expert draws the G</b>overnment&#8217;s attention to the recommendations of the 
</p>
<p><b>first session of the Forum on Minority Issues and the right to equal quality education 
</b></p>
<p><b>and encourages implementation of those recommendations relevant to the situation of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Batwa. 
</b></p>
<p>100.<b> The Government programme to demolish all <i>nyakatsi</i> houses should be 
reviewed urgently to ensure that it has not impacted negatively on vulnerable 
</b></p>
<p><b>individuals, families or communities. Local authorities should act only according to 
</b></p>
<p><b>strict guidelines ensuring that no person is left without shelter due to their actions. 
</b></p>
<p>101.<b> Batwa women and children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of 
discrimination, social exclusion and poverty and their situation merits particular 
</b></p>
<p><b>focused attention including ensuring adequate maternal and infant health care, access 
</b></p>
<p><b>to education, adequate housing, food security, access to water and sanitation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>protection from violence, including sexual violence and exploitation. The Government 
</b></p>
<p><b>should undertake research and formulate specific, targeted programme responses as 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate. 
</b></p>
<p>102.<b> The Government should acknowledge the stigma attached to and 
discrimination against Batwa that exists in Rwandan society and assess the ways in 
</b></p>
<p><b>which that stigma may be creating obstacles to the successful impact of programmes 
</b></p>
<p><b>to address the inadequate living conditions faced by Batwa. That analysis should </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/56/Add.1 
</b></p>
<p><b> </b>23 
</p>
<p><b>inform the redesign of programme initiatives in order to improve effectiveness. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Additionally, the Government should undertake a national public education campaign 
</b></p>
<p><b>to combat stigma against the Batwa in consultation with and involving the Batwa 
</b></p>
<p><b>themselves. 
</b></p>
<p>103.<b> There is a lack of detailed information available regarding the overall situation 
of Batwa, their population, the location of distinct communities and their socio-
</b></p>
<p><b>economic position. To fully understand their problems and respond appropriately, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>is necessary for the Government to undertake further research of both a quantitative 
</b></p>
<p><b>and qualitative nature. The plan (part of the National Social Protection Strategy) to 
</b></p>
<p><b>tabulate socio-economic data by ethnicity should be implemented urgently and the 
</b></p>
<p><b>results made widely accessible. 
</b></p>
<p>104.<b> The Government should act on the analysis and recommendations contained in 
the Senate</b>&#8217;s<b> <i>Report on the Living Conditions of Some Rwandans Disadvantaged 
</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Throughout History</i> and other relevant Government and civil society reports.
