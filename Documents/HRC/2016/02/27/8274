<p> The Special Rapporteur on the right to food visited Mexico from 13 to 20 June 
</p><p>2011. In sections II and III of the present report, he reviews the current situation of food 
insecurity and the legal and policy framework. In section IV (food availability), he 
identifies the need to target agricultural support programmes to the needs of small-scale 
farmers in disadvantaged areas, then in section V (food accessibility) he explores the efforts 
made to strengthen social programmes; to ensure a decent living for workers, including 
agricultural day labourers; to ensure adequate protection against the effects of major 
development projects; and to improve access to services for remote rural communities 
through &#8220;sustainable rural towns&#8221;. In section VI (food adequacy), he addresses the growing 
problem of overweight and obesity and its relationship with food and nutrition policies. In 
section VII (sustainability), he comments on the introduction of transgenic maize and on 
the need for a more sustainable use of water resources. The Special Rapporteur concludes 
the report with recommendations (section VIII) for the Government of Mexico. </p>

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the right to food, Olivier De Schutter, conducted a 
mission to Mexico from 13 to 20 June 2011, at the invitation of the Government. The 
Special Rapporteur would like to express his appreciation for the high degree of 
cooperation of the Government and the remarkable degree of preparation of the authorities, 
thanks to the dedication of the Directorate of Human Rights and Democracy of the Ministry 
of External Relations and of the Subsecretary on multilateral affairs and human rights, 
Ambassador Juan Manuel Gomez Robledo.  
</p>
<p>2.  During his mission, the Special Rapporteur met with a wide range of authorities, 
including the Office of the Presidency of the Republic, the Ministry of Social Development, 
the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food, the 
Ministry of Agrarian Reform, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, the 
Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the Ministry of the Economy, the Ministry of 
Health, the National Agency for Family Development and the Ministry of Public 
Education. He expresses his thanks in particular to the Minister for Agrarian Reform, 
Abelardo Escobar Prieto; the Minister for Labour, Javier Lozano; the Minister for 
Agriculture, Francisco Mayorga Casta&#241;eda; and the Coordinator of the Office of the 
Presidency of the Republic, Sofia French Lopez Barro.  
</p>
<p>3.  The Special Rapporteur also met with members of the Senate and of the Chamber of 
Deputies of the Federal Congress, under the chairmanship of Senator Zoreda Novelo, and 
with presidents of State Congresses. He visited the Fideicomisos Instituidos en Relaci&#243;n 
con la Agricultura, which guarantees loans to agricultural producers. Lastly, he met with 
representatives of the United Nations agencies present in Mexico, of a number of non-
governmental organizations and of indigenous peoples, and with academic experts.  
</p>
<p>4. The mission included visits to the States of Chiapas and Jalisco. In Chiapas, the 
Special Rapporteur held meetings in the rural sustainable towns of Nuevo Juan de Grijalva 
and Santiago el Pinar and in San Crist&#243;bal de Las Casas. He met with members of the 
Government of Chiapas, as well as with Governor Juan Sabines Guerrero, and with a wide 
range of civil society organizations from the States of Chiapas, Guerrero and Oaxaca. In 
Jalisco, the Special Rapporteur met with members of the Government, as well as with 
representatives of civil society organizations from Jalisco, Nayarit and San Luis Potosi. He 
held a meeting at the newly established National Centre for Genetic Resources. He also 
visited the village of Temacapul&#237;n and the neighbouring town of Talicoyunque, which 
included meetings both with the communities concerned by the building of the dam of El 
Zapatillo and with a representative of the State Water Commission (CONAGUA).  
</p>
<p><b> II. Food insecurity 
</b></p>
<p>5. Mexico has made significant progress in improving a key indicator for the 
realization of the right to food, namely, achieving the Millennium Development Goal of 
reducing the national average of children under 5 years who are underweight (target 1.8) 
from 14.2 per cent in 1988 to 5 per cent in 2006. Progress has, however, been uneven and 
deprivation levels in enjoyment of the right to food remain dramatic for a large part of the 
population. The National Council on the Evaluation of Social Development Policy 
(CONEVAL) estimates that 18.2 per cent of the population (19.5 million people) lived in 
&#8220;food poverty&#8221; in 2008, up from 13.8 per cent (14.4 million people) in 2006. The situation 
</p>
<p>has remained largely unchanged since 1992, with a drastic deterioration in 1996, when the 
number of people living in food poverty almost doubled to reach 37.4 per cent and a short-
lived drop in food poverty in 2006. According to the most recent official figures, in 2010, a </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>total of 52 million people (46.2 per cent of the population) lived in poverty while 28 million 
(24.9 per cent) had insufficient access to food. 
</p>
<p>6. These national averages cover significant disparities between deprivations in access 
to adequate food between urban and rural areas as well as between States in North, South 
and Central Mexico. Of the 18.1 million people living in municipalities considered to have 
a high or very high degree of marginalization, 80.6 per cent live in rural areas.  
</p>
<p>7. There are also marked differences in relevant right to food indicators between 
indigenous and non-indigenous populations. For both groups, child malnutrition rates have 
gradually decreased. Nevertheless, one in three (33.2 per cent) indigenous children under 
the age of 5 years suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2006, compared with one in 10 
(10.6 per cent) non-indigenous children. National statistics also show that women and the 
elderly are particularly vulnerable to deprivations in access to adequate food.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and policy framework 
</b></p>
<p>8. As a party to all nine core international human rights treaties, Mexico has the legal 
obligation to respect, protect and fulfil the right to adequate food, as set out in the 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other human rights 
treaties. Recent reforms of the Constitution underline the commitment of Mexico to 
strengthen the protection of right to food. On 13 October 2011, a constitutional reform 
process was completed, involving the inclusion of the right to food in articles 4 and 27 of 
the Constitution. In addition, article 1 of the Constitution now stipulates that all persons 
enjoy the human rights recognized in the international treaties to which Mexico is a party. 
Prior to these amendments, the Constitution already referred to the right of children to 
satisfy their dietary needs (art. 4) and to the obligation of States to support the nutrition of 
indigenous peoples through food programmes (art. 2 (B) (III and VIII)). 
</p>
<p>9. With the recent constitutional reforms, Mexico has joined a small but rapidly 
growing group of States that are making the right to adequate food explicit in their national 
Constitution, thus empowering courts to ensure that this right is fulfilled with. The legal 
framework could be further improved, however, by the adoption on a framework legislation 
on the right to food, as has been done in a number of other countries in the region and as 
recommended by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and under the 
Voluntary Guidelines to Support the Progressive Realization of the Right to Adequate Food 
in the Context of National Food Security of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the 
United Nations.1 In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes with interest the draft bill on 
planning for agricultural, food and nutritional sovereignty and security (Proyecto de Ley de 
Planeaci&#243;n para la Seguridad y la Soberan&#237;a Agroalimentaria y Nutricional) initially 
introduced in Congress on 11 November 2005 and still under discussion.  
</p>
<p>10. While considering that the current bill could be improved in the light of 
recommendations made in the present report, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the fact that 
it seeks to improve consistency between various national institutions and programmes 
aimed at protecting the right to food. Building on the work of CONEVAL, a framework law 
on the right to food could define how emerging threats to the right to adequate food will be 
identified at the earliest possible stage by adequate monitoring systems and how the data 
collected by CONEVAL will feed into public policies to make them more evidence-based. 
The framework law could also create a forum in which civil society organizations, 
including farmers&#8217; organizations and representatives of indigenous peoples, could have a 
</p>
<p>  
 1 E/C.12/1999/5, para. 21. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>regular dialogue with the representatives of the Government, allowing a permanent 
evaluation of the policies in place by those whom these policies are intended to benefit. It 
could provide a proper legislative foundation for existing social programmes, including the 
programmes providing food aid, as well as for programmes that support agricultural 
producers. This can significantly enhance the effectiveness of such programmes; the clear 
definition of beneficiaries in legislation &#8211; making access to programmes a right for the 
beneficiaries &#8211; could limit the risk of resources being diverted as a result of corruption or 
clientelism, and improve accountability of the administration responsible for 
implementation, particularly if courts are empowered to monitor implementation.2  
</p>
<p>11. Most importantly, such framework legislation should lead to the adoption of a 
national strategy for the realization of the right to food. Such a national strategy would have 
four major advantages: 
</p>
<p>(a)  First, it could improve coordination between the different relevant ministries 
and between national and subnational levels of government. At present, there are 
inconsistencies across the various sectoral policies. For instance, some programmes in 
support of agricultural production disproportionately benefit the wealthiest producers in the 
wealthiest part of the country, increasing inequality in the rural areas, which social 
programmes in turn are supposed to address. Trade policies provide another example. The 
liberalization of agricultural trade, launched in the mid-1980s and completed in 2008 under 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, created opportunities for some agricultural 
producers oriented towards exporting commodities, while the import of certain low-cost 
products benefited the livestock industry and poor consumers. The gradual liberalization of 
agricultural trade also had, however, a severe negative impact on some of the most 
vulnerable producers as a result of the dumping in local markets of often heavily subsidized 
products from the United States of America. It also encouraged the development of export-
led agriculture, which is generally less pro-poor and contributes less to rural development. 
A third example is the impact of agricultural and trade policies on the adequacy of diets. As 
detailed below, the overweight and obesity emergency that Mexico is facing could have 
been avoided, or largely mitigated, if the health concerns linked to shifting diets had been 
integrated into the design of those policies. A national strategy coordinating the action of 
various ministries and aligning sectoral policies with the realization of the right to food 
should serve to avoid such inconsistencies;  
</p>
<p>(b) Second, a national strategy could help to identify complementarities between 
different instruments that currently serve to improve food security, in order to achieve 
multiplier effects. In particular, measures aimed at supporting food producers and measures 
aimed at improving the accessibility of adequate food to consumers should be made 
mutually supportive rather than designed in isolation from each other. For instance, such 
food aid programmes as Diconsa and Liconsa could be encouraged to source more of their 
food supplies from small-scale local producers in order to improve access to markets for 
these producers and ensure a certain stability of income, while ensuring that consumers are 
provided with fresh and nutritious foods ;  
</p>
<p>(c)  Third, owing to their multi-year nature, national strategies can help to address 
the tension between short-term objectives (such as ensuring the supply of low-priced 
products to urban populations or boosting levels of agricultural production) and long-term 
objectives (such as increasing the incomes of small-scale farmers and inclusive rural 
development, or encouraging the sustainable use of natural resources) because they define 
not only a set of benchmarks to be achieved (the &#8220;what&#8221;) but also a pathway (the &#8220;how&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>  
 2 See also A/HRC/12/31, para. 28. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b> 
</p>
<p>National strategies can help to make transitions and to avoid the trap of path-dependency in 
public policies;  
</p>
<p>(d)  Fourth, a national strategy would improve accountability by clearly allocating 
responsibilities across various branches of government and by setting precise time frames 
for the adoption of measures that will ensure the progressive realization of the right to food. 
An independent body, such as the National Commission of Human Rights, could contribute 
to the monitoring of strategy implementation by using appropriate indicators. Alternatively, 
CONEVAL could play this role, building on its existing methodology to measure the 
effectiveness of poverty-reduction strategies.  
</p>
<p>12. A range of national policies and programmes, including the National Development 
Plan 2007-2012 and the Sectoral Programme for Social Development 2007-2012, set out 
objectives relevant to the right to food. Mexico does not, however, currently have a 
comprehensive national strategy for the realization of the right to food. In the remainder of 
the present report, based on his assessment of the challenges facing the country, the Special 
Rapporteur identifies the issues that such a national strategy could address under the four 
dimensions of the human right to adequate food.  
</p>
<p><b> IV. Food availability: supporting agricultural production  
</b></p>
<p>13. Different models of farming coexist in Mexico. The challenge for the country is to 
ensure a coexistence of these models through policies that reduce poverty in rural areas, 
where 23.2 per cent of the population currently resides.  
</p>
<p>14. Between 1991 and 1996, Mexico implemented what could be called a &#8220;second 
agrarian reform&#8221; in order to prepare its agricultural sector for the liberalization of 
</p>
<p>agriculture markets envisaged by the North American Free Trade Agreement. The three 
programmes that formed the basis of this reform remain the backbone of the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>agricultural policies: the Programa de Apoyos a la Comercializaci&#243;n, an output-based 
subsidy programme, the main instrument of which is Ingreso Objetivo; the Programa de 
Apoyos Directos al Campo (Procampo), a per hectare direct transfer programme decoupled 
from production and commercialization established by the Decree regulating (21 July 
1994); and the Alianza para el Campo, which includes a range of investment support 
programmes (including the Programa de Desarrollo Rural, the Programa de Fomento 
Agr&#237;cola and the Programa de Fomento Ganadero).  
</p>
<p>15. The 2001 Ley de Desarrollo Social Sustentable, an umbrella law for rural 
development, created the Programa Especial Concurrente para el Desarrollo Rural 
Sustentable (PEC), a coordinating framework for agricultural research and development 
expenditures. However, while they are important steps in improving rural policies, neither 
the law itself nor the Programa Especial have had a major impact on the allocation of 
resources for research and development. The Special Rapporteur believes that a review of 
how these resources are spent would be warranted. 
</p>
<p>16. The resources allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural 
Development, Fisheries and Food significantly increased throughout the 2000s, rising from 
47.9 billion pesos to an estimated 73.9 billion pesos in the 2011 budget. New and promising 
programmes have been introduced, such as the MasAgro, Promaf and Tropico humedo 
programmes, as well as the Proyecto Estrat&#233;gico de Seguridad Alimentaria (PESA). 
Agricultural production, including fisheries, increased at an average annual rate of 2.4 per 
cent during the period 2000-2010, improving food availability in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>17. Mexican agricultural policies could, however, be improved in two ways in order to 
make a more significant contribution to the realization of the right to food. Firstly, the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>beneficiaries of the various support programmes listed above should be identified, and they 
should have access to recourse mechanisms to claim their rights. The current instruments 
still leave too much room for political pressure from various interest groups to capture State 
resources. Secondly, most agricultural programmes fail to target the poor: taken as a whole, 
agricultural public expenditures are highly regressive. The Special Rapporteur is struck by 
the contrast between the absence of adequate targeting of agricultural policies and the very 
high targeting of social policies: more than 95 per cent of expenditure of social programmes 
included in the PEC target the poor, while less than 8 per cent of expenditure in agricultural 
programmes are similarly targeted. Some of the latter programmes are particularly 
promising in this regard: the PESA in particular focuses on capacity-building in rural areas 
of high to very high deprivation.3 Yet, in a country made up by 80 per cent of farmers with 
less than 5 hectares, it would appear desirable to consider allocating more resources to 
supporting small-scale farmers in disadvantaged areas, as the programmes in place 
currently fail to address rural poverty effectively.4  
</p>
<p>18. Although non-targeted programmes may partly benefit the poor, recent studies 
would indeed indicate that agricultural policies favour the wealthiest States, municipalities 
and producers/households.5 In 2005, the six poorest States received only 7 per cent of total 
agricultural public expenditures despite the fact that they were home to 55 per cent of the 
extreme poor. Poor States such as Chiapas or Oaxaca obtain only just a tenth of the per 
capita support that the large agricultural States of Tamaulipas, Sinaloa, Chihuahua and 
Sonora receive. In 2006, the poorest 70 per cent of municipalities received only 40 per cent 
of Procampo expenditures and only 6 per cent of Ingreso Objetivo. The impact of 
agricultural policies on producers and households is as regressive as that at the State and 
municipality level. In 2005, the poorest 10 per cent of producers (in terms of land) received 
a tenth of a percentage point of Ingreso Objectivo, while the richest 10 per cent received 45 
per cent of Procampo aid, 55 per cent of Alianza PDR, 60 per cent of energy and 
hydrological subsidies and 80 per cent of Ingreso Objetivo transfers.  
</p>
<p>19. The above pattern of agricultural spending stands in sharp contrast with rural 
development policies, which are clearly redistributive, with the poorest 20 per cent of rural 
households obtaining 33 per cent of transfers. The World Bank noted the contradiction 
between the two policies: &#8220;agricultural spending is so regressive that it cancels out about 
</p>
<p>half the redistributive impact of rural development spending. Rural development 
programmes decrease the Gini coefficient (reduce inequality) by about 14.2 per cent, while 
agricultural spending increases the Gini coefficient (raises inequality) by about 6.7 per 
cent&#8221;.6  
</p>
<p>20. Under articles 2(1) and 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, Mexico should dedicate the maximum of available resources to the 
progressive realization of the right to food. This requires focusing efforts on the most 
vulnerable segments of the population.7 In its general comment No. 20, the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights also has noted that the requirement of non-
discrimination under article 2 (2) of the Covenant may require devoting greater resources to 
</p>
<p>  
 3 The programme reaches 1.7 million beneficiaries, 46.4 per cent of them indigenous and 51 per cent 
</p>
<p>women.

</p>
<p>traditionally neglected groups.8 In addition to more equitable distribution of support, small-
scale farmers can be the primary beneficiaries of investments in certain public goods that 
allow them to overcome the disadvantages that result from the lack of economies of scale.9 
</p>
<p><b> V. Food accessibility: fighting rural and urban poverty  
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Social programmes 
</b></p>
<p>21. Mexico has been a pioneer in conditional cash-transfer programmes. In 1997, it 
established Progresa, which was renamed Oportunidades in 2002 when it was extended to 
urban households. Oportunidades currently covers 5.85 million households throughout the 
country, and the coverage is particularly impressive in the poorest States, such as Chiapas 
(where 61.3 per cent of the population benefits from the programme), Oaxaca (52.6 per 
cent) and Guerrero (51.5 per cent). It helps poor families in rural and urban communities to 
improve the education, health and nutrition of their children by cash transfers (generally 
delivered to women and mothers), educational grants, basic health-care services and food 
supplements. These advantages are linked to certain conditionalities, in particular regular 
school attendance and health clinic visits.  
</p>
<p>22. The independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty noted that &#8220;prior to 
attaching conditionalities to cash transfers, States and policymakers must undertake in-
depth analyses of the programmes&#8217; capacity to properly monitor compliance and 
simultaneously provide social services that correspond to the needs of the population living 
in extreme poverty.&#8221;10 Indeed, because conditional cash-transfer programmes by definition 
cannot reach families who are unable to comply with the conditions attached for reasons 
beyond their control, they should not be seen as a substitute for unconditional forms of 
social protection, in accordance with the human right to social security. Since 2008, in 
order to provide support for families who could not comply with the conditionalities of 
Oportunidades, Mexico has introduced the Programa de Apoyo Alimentario (PAL). This 
food-aid programme benefited 677,027 families in 2010. In June 2008, in order to protect 
the poorest families covered under Oportunidades and PAL (representing in total 6.4 
million families) from food price increases, the Government decided to provide these 
beneficiaries with an additional cash transfer. In addition, the social milk programme 
Liconsa provides milk fortified with iron, zinc, folic acid and vitamins at below market 
prices for children aged from 6 months to 12 years, adolescent girls from 13 to 15 years, 
pregnant or nursing women, women aged between 45 and 59 years, chronically ill and 
disabled persons older than 12 years, and adults over 60 years of age. As at September 
2011, the programme covered almost 5.9 million individuals. Moreover, programmes under 
the Sistema Nacional para el Desarrollo Integral de la Familia  and the Estrategia Integral 
de Asistencia Social Alimentaria provide vulnerable groups with food aid , benefitting, in 
2011, 6,030,996 children of school age, 384,818 children under 5 years of age, 644,672 
families in extreme poverty or emergency conditions caused by a natural disaster, and 
772,983 pregnant or breastfeeding women, older persons and people with a disability. 
</p>
<p>23. Lastly, the Rural Food Support Programme (Abasto Rural Programme, implemented 
through Diconsa) has 23,301 stores across the country. The stores sell basic food products 
at affordable prices (approximately 5.5 per cent below the market price), benefiting an 
estimated 29 million people. In 2,164 localities, the Diconsa store is the only store where 
</p>
<p>  
 8 E/C.12/GC/20, para. 39.  
 9 A/HRC/16/49, para. 37. 
 10 A/HRC/11/9, para. 99 (c). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>food supplies can be bought. The localities where the Diconsa stores are present (and where 
the Abasto Rural Programme is thus implemented) are disadvantaged rural localities with 
between 200 and 2,500 inhabitants. These marginalized localities are identified by the 
National Council of Population (CONAPO) and which lack basic social infrastructure (inter 
alia, drinking water, sewerage and electricity) and are poorly connected to urban centres, 
thus affecting the inhabitants&#8217; access to goods and basic services. The Diconsa stores sell 
</p>
<p>foods at subsidized rates to all, not only to households below the poverty threshold; the 
targeting is therefore exclusively geographical.  
</p>
<p>24. These programmes demonstrate the commitment of Mexico to ensure economic 
accessibility for the population. According to Government estimates that, without these 
social programmes, 2.6 million additional people would be in poverty representing 13.5 per 
cent of the population. Oportunidades alone protects 9.6 per cent of the population from the 
risk of falling beneath the poverty line. Assessments of Oportunidades demonstrate that the 
programme has had a significant impact on the growth, health and development outcomes 
of children living in extreme poverty, in part because of the increased use of the preventive 
services mandated by the programme,11 and in part because the additional income for the 
family allows parents to purchase more or higher quality food or medicines when 
necessary. In addition, the improved psychological well-being of the family may in turn 
improve the care, support and nurture provided to the children in the household.12 
</p>
<p>25. In their sourcing policies, the above-mentioned programmes should be seen as an 
opportunity to contribute to rural development and to increase the incomes of the poorest 
farmers: by buying a minimum proportion of their food from local small-scale farmers, to 
whom a minimum price could be guaranteed, these programmes could reduce the volatility 
of prices for all local producers (including but not limited to those supplying the 
programmes), possibly resulting in significant multiplier effects . Liconsa thus supports 
small and medium-sized producers in the country from whom it purchased 700 million 
litres in 2011, a significant increase over previous years. Through the Abasto Rural 
Programme, Diconsa supports small producers: in 2011, 31.5 per cent of purchases were 
from such suppliers, exceeding the target of 25 per cent set by the Federal Government. 
</p>
<p>26. Certain improvements could be made, however. First, the definition of the 
beneficiaries of the programmes targeting the poorest households (Oportunidades, PAL and 
Liconsa) should be more clearly provided for in relevant legislation, thus making it easier 
for households who are unjustifiably excluded to file claims against such exclusion, as 
provided for under article 10 of the 2004 General Social Development Law. Defining 
beneficiaries as rights-holders &#8211; and strengthening accountability mechanisms, as suggested 
below &#8211; would improve the quality of targeting and reduce the risk of under-inclusiveness. 
Currently, the beneficiaries are households located in certain areas considered to be 
disadvantaged on the basis of mapping established by CONEVAL, and that qualify as 
deprived based on a questionnaire (the Cuestionario &#218;nico de Informaci&#243;n 
Socioecon&#243;mica) that they are asked to fill in, providing information about their socio-
economic status. While the Special Rapporteur was impressed by the high quality of the 
work of CONEVAL, he notes that its geographical targeting is not consistent with a rights-
based approach. A social support programme grounded in human rights would either

<p>provide for universal coverage or define for the country as a whole, in legislation, the 
conditions of socio-economic deprivation that make a household or an individual eligible 
for support as a matter of right. The Government of Mexico informed the Special 
Rapporteur that 31.26 per cent of the 140,659 applications for Oportunidades in 2010 were 
the result of households applying for inclusion in the programme because they considered 
themselves eligible. While those unable to receive support under Oportunidades or PAL 
may file claims either with the instances in charge of implementing the programmes or with 
the Secretariat for Social Development or the Presidency of the Republic, no effective 
remedy before courts or quasi-judicial bodies &#8211; independent and having the power to order 
the granting of benefits &#8211; is available. 
</p>
<p>27. Second, it is important that these programmes pay greater attention to the adequacy 
of the food provided. Families benefiting from Oportunidades spend an average of 70 per 
cent of the cash transfer on so-called &#8220;better quality&#8221; calories, including greater expenditure 
on meat, fruit and vegetables, which reduced the risks of children becoming overweight or 
obese in families benefiting from this support.13 Doubts have more recently been expressed, 
however, about the benefits of the papilla (Nutrisano) for infants of 6 to 23 months of age 
included in Oportunidades,14 although this seems to be attributable to the fact that the iron 
contained in the supplement was not easily fixed by the organism. More importantly, for 
families depending on Diconsa stores, it is essential that these stores &#8211; particularly in 
localities where they are the only way for families to have access to food &#8211; provide a wide 
range of fresh foods, including fruit and vegetables, for healthy diets. Raising awareness of 
the importance of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months and continued 
breastfeeding up to 24 months is also essential. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Worker</b>s&#8217; rights<b> 
</b></p>
<p>28. The programmes cited above are not substitutes, of course, for ensuring a living 
wage to the working population of Mexico. The Special Rapporteur is concerned in this 
regard that the constitutional mandate according to which the minimum wage should be 
aligned with the cost of the <i>canasta basica</i> is not complied with: the cross-regional average 
minimum wage is currently 58 pesos per day, which is less than half what is required to rise 
above the poverty line and is well below what would represent a living wage. A living wage 
should provide an income &#8220;allowing workers to support themselves and their families&#8221;, as 
</p>
<p>required under articles 6 and 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights.15 The Special Rapporteur fully acknowledges that raising the minimum 
wage could encourage employers not to register the workers they hire. Nonetheless, he 
concludes that the tripartite national commission on minimum wages in charge of setting 
the minimum wage for various levels of qualification is in violation of both of its 
constitutional duties and of international human rights, for which the failure of the Ministry 
of Labour and Social Welfare to ensure an adequate compliance with the requirements of 
the labour legislation cannot be a justification.  
</p>
<p>29. The situation of day labourers (<i>jornaleros</i>) raises specific concerns. According to a 
survey conducted in 2009, there were 2.4 million agricultural day workers employed on 
large agricultural plantations. At least one fifth of the <i>jornaleros</i> are migrant workers,

<p>travelling from the poor States of Guerrero, Chiapas and Oaxaca, or from Puebla, Hidalgo 
and Veracruz in search of employment in the richest agricultural regions of the northern 
part of the country, particularly Sinaloa and Sonora. A majority of them move with their 
families.16 This situation raises a number of challenges, linked to the need to provide 
continued education to the children and to ensure that they will not be employed on the 
plantations;17 to ensure access to basic health services in the region to which the <i>jornaleros</i> 
migrate; and, of course, in the absence of unionization and in a context where about 90 per 
cent of day labourers have no formal contract of employment, to the protection of the basic 
rights of the <i>jornaleros</i>, including their right to a living wage and to health and safe 
conditions of work. These challenges are compounded by the fact that, among migrant 
workers, between one third and one half are members of indigenous groups, often with no 
or little knowledge of Spanish. 
</p>
<p>30. The Ministry of Health has sought to improve the housing conditions of day 
labourers and to enable them to use the national health card. The Ministry of Labour and 
Social Prevention has also made an impressive series of efforts to address this issue over 
the past few years. On 22 November 2007, an interdepartmental coordination body was 
established to address the various issues raised by the situation of the <i>jornaleros</i>, involving 
a range of governmental agencies. A number of good practices have since been developed. 
Although labour inspectorates are clearly understaffed and lack capacity (there are 376 
labour inspectors for the whole country), the number of plantations inspected has been 
rising over the years, from 102 in 2008 to 139 in 2009, and the objective of the Ministry is 
to arrive at 255 in 2011. Although the law in principle requires prior notification of 48 
hours to be given to the employer, the labour inspectorates have actually developed a 
practice of unannounced visits, although these may be opposed by the employer. Day 
labourers are also delivered certificates allowing them to prove their qualifications, which 
improve their ability to have access to employment and obtain a more decent wage; the 
amount of evaluations that were carried out under this scheme tripled between 2009 and 
2011. The number of registered workers has risen significantly since the new strategy was 
put in place: in 2010, a record number of 170,276 <i>jornaleros</i> were registered for social 
security. In order to favour continued education of children, a scorecard (<i>boleta &#250;nica</i>) 
following them from school to school has been created. In order to overcome the barrier 
language or the obstacles resulting from the poor literacy rate of day labourers, specific 
information brochures are prepared to inform them about their rights. 
</p>
<p>31. Even more could be done. The labour inspectorates should be strengthened, and the 
existing legal restrictions to the conduct of unannounced visits on plantations should be 
abolished immediately. Day labourers and the unions active in the agricultural sector should 
be informed about their right to report abuses anonymously to the Ministry of Labour and 
Social Prevention; to provide an incentive to report such abuses, the employer found in 
violation of their obligation to register the workers employed should be subjected to both 
fines and the obligation to pay salaries back to the workers employed.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Large-scale development projects and the right to food 
</b></p>
<p>32. During his visit, the Special Rapporteur heard testimonies from people from 
different regions of the country who faced the threat of expropriation of land or 
</p>
<p>  
 16 According to SEDESOL, the number of agricultural day labourers (including their family members) 
</p>
<p>amounted to more than 9 million in 2009. Some 40 per cent of day labourers were indigenous 
peoples, while 21.3 per cent (434,000) were migrants.

</p>
<p>resettlement because of major development projects, such as the construction of dams (for 
example, La Parota and the Paso de la Reyna) large-scale infrastructure projects (for 
example highways, as in the case of the Proyecto Carretero de Huejuquilla El Alto) and 
mining, as in Cerro de San Pedro, San Luis Potosi. 
</p>
<p>33. International human rights law establishes safeguards that protect people against 
arbitrary displacement from their homes or provide certain guarantees in the resettlement 
phase; these safeguards are restated in particular in the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement18 and in the basic principles and guidelines on development-based evictions 
and displacement.19 While the full set of norms applicable to evictions or displacements 
cannot be repeated here, the basic requirements may be briefly summarized.  
</p><p>34.  First, in assessing whether or not displacement can be justified, States must assess 
adequately the impact on affected communities and bear the burden of demonstrating that 
evictions have been undertaken solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare 
after the full range of alternatives has been explored with the communities concerned and 
on the basis of all information available, and after taking all necessary measures that could 
minimize any negative impact on the persons displaced.  
</p>
<p>35. Second, States must ensure that all potentially affected persons are fully consulted. 
In order for such consultations to be effective, the persons concerned must receive all 
information available; indeed, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has noted that the 
right of access to information in such circumstances was implied by article 13 of the 
American Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to freedom of thought 
and expression.20 Consultation should not simply serve to discuss the modalities of 
evictions or compensation with the communities concerned; it must also allow discussion 
about whether or not evictions should take place, and whether the planned project should 
indeed go ahead. In addition, the right of the people affected to be consulted will ensure 
that, consistent with the right to development, development projects will &#8220;aim at the 
constant improvement of the well-being of the entire population and of all individuals, on 
the basis of their active, free and meaningful participation in development and in the fair 
distribution of the benefits resulting therefrom&#8221;.21  
</p>
<p>36. With regard to indigenous peoples, the right to full and prior informed consent 
regarding relocation is explicitly provided for in the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples 
Convention, 1989 (No. 169) of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which Mexico 
has ratified, as well as in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous 
Peoples, which provides that &#8220;States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the 
</p>
<p>indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to 
obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their 
lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, 
utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources.&#8221;22 Although the right to free, 
prior and informed consent is specific to the case of indigenous peoples, the principle is 
increasingly seen as central to all local populations.  
</p>
<p>37. Third, where resettlement is unavoidable, the people concerned must be provided 
with fair compensation and not be deprived of their sources of livelihood. People who are

</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>resettled should be compensated with land commensurate in quality, size and value, or 
better.  
</p>
<p>38. In the testimonies presented to the Special Rapporteur by communities affected by 
large-scale development projects, a common concern expressed was the lack of both 
adequate consultation and efforts to ensure free and prior informed consent by the relevant 
authorities. Another common concern was the lack of fair compensation and excessive 
delays in its provision. The testimonies showed that courts and administrative tribunals can 
protect communities against arbitrary resettlement that would have an adverse impact on 
their right to food and other human rights. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur 
received information according to which court orders were in some cases not complied 
with. The Special Rapporteur visited the community of Temacapul&#237;n, where, since 2006, 
inhabitants have tried to stop the construction of El Zapatillo Dam, a project worth 10 
billion pesos that would inundate their town of about 400 inhabitants, but that is designed to 
improve the supply of water to the Guadalajara metropolitan area and to serve the 
development of Los Altos de Jalisco and the city of Le&#243;n, Guanajuato. Following his 
discussions with a representative of the State Water Commission and people living in 
Temacapul&#237;n, he noted the strong opposition to the resettlement expressed by the 
community and expressed his concern that the land offered as compensation was dry and 
arid, and would not allow the inhabitants of Temacapul&#237;n to continue growing the crops on 
which the livelihood of many depended. 
</p>
<p>39. The above-mentioned case illustrates what appears to be a larger problem. The 
attention of the Special Rapporteur was drawn to the consultations that took place, in 
Temacapul&#237;n and in other localities affected by large-scale development projects, in 
accordance with section VI of the Reglamento de la Ley General del Equilibrio Ecol&#243;gico y 
la Protecci&#243;n al Ambiente en Materia de evaluaci&#243;n del Impacto Ambiental that concerns 
&#8220;public participation and the right to information&#8221;. He also noted how article 27 of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution, which allows for expropriation in the public interest, was implemented. It is 
not up to the Special Rapporteur, in the context of the mission, to assess whether an 
adequate balance was made between the public interest and the rights and interests of the 
communities affected, either for the construction of El Zapatillo Dam or in other projects; 
however, it appears from all the information collected or provided that a comprehensive 
review of the procedures in place, and followed by bodies such as the State Water 
Commission, should take place without delay. This review should ensure that the 
procedures comply fully with international treaties that are binding on Mexico and with 
international standards.  
</p>
<p>40. The Special Rapporteur is especially concerned by three issues, which such a 
comprehensive review should serve to examine in detail. First, the consultations that are 
organized with the population who may have to be resettled in the implementation of 
development projects should take place at the initial stage of the feasibility study of the 
project, not during the final phases where only issues of compensation or relocation remain 
to be discussed. The communities concerned must be given a real possibility to influence 
the decision of the authorities on whether to implement the project in the light of all 
alternatives to displacement that the consultations may have served to identify. In the case 
of Temacapul&#237;n, while one consultation did take place early in the project (on 21 April 
2006), most meetings were organized in March and April 2011, when the project was far 
too advanced for these meetings to be meaningful. 
</p>
<p>41. Second, contrary to what seems the purpose of articles 40 to 43 of the Reglamento 
de la Ley General del Equilibrio Ecol&#243;gico y la Protecci&#243;n al Ambiente en Materia de 
evaluaci&#243;n del Impacto Ambiental, the consultations should not serve only to identify 
which measures could be taken to mitigate the negative environmental impact on the </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p>communities affected. They should be comprehensive in scope, and cover all the issues 
relevant to the communities affected by the project, including livelihood options. 
</p>
<p>42. Third, the identified relocation sites must fulfil the criteria for adequate housing. 
Such criteria include, in particular, access to employment options, health-care services, 
schools, childcare centres and other social facilities, whether in urban or rural areas, and 
culturally appropriate housing.23 
</p>
<p>43. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the need for a comprehensive review of the 
procedures in place, which do not appear adequate in practice. Such procedures should 
serve to build trust, when in fact he could witness a high level of mistrust. Consultations 
should allow for solutions to be identified with the communities concerned, when in fact 
they appear more as a means to inform communities about the solutions proposed to them. 
And where, following a fair, inclusive and well-informed consultation, resettlement appears 
unavoidable, it must not infringe on the right of the communities to the continuous 
improvement of their living conditions.24  
</p>
<p>44. Finally, it was brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur that, in a number of 
cases, people engaged in social protests related to the expropriation of land and loss of 
livelihoods were subject to threats or prosecuted. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur 
recalls the Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs 
of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental 
Freedoms,25 and underlines the importance of ensuring adequate protection of human rights 
defenders, including those who seek to defend the right to a clean and healthy environment 
and the right not to be deprived of their livelihoods.  
</p>
<p><b> D. </b>&#8220;<b>S</b>ustainable rural towns&#8221; <b> 
</b></p>
<p>45. The relatively high degree of dispersion of the rural population, in part attributable 
to the policy of agrarian reform dating from the 1917 Constitution, makes it difficult to 
provide rural households with adequate basic services, including, in particular, health care 
and education, and to promote off-farm rural employment. The concept of &#8220;sustainable 
rural towns&#8221; (<i>ciudades rurales sustenables</i>) is seen as an answer to this challenge. This 
concept is being tested in the State of Chiapas with support of a number of United Nations 
agencies, including in particular the United Nations Development Programme. The Special 
Rapporteur visited the two existing &#8220;sustainable rural towns&#8221; of Nuevo Juan de Grijalva 
</p>
<p>and Santiago el Pinar. Nuevo Juan de Grijalva was established after a flood accompanied 
by a landslide destroyed a number of properties in the region in December 2007. 
</p>
<p>46. In principle, sustainable rural towns should improve access to health care, including 
sexual health counselling, and to education, as women and children will not have to travel 
to centres in order to visit health-care centres and attend school. In addition, it should allow 
the development of small processing facilities and permit rural communities, including 
women, to have access to employment outside agriculture.  
</p>
<p>47. Nevertheless, the Special Rapporteur calls for a thorough assessment of the 
experiments of Nuevo Juan de Grijalva and Santiago el Pinar prior to the establishment of 
any more such towns. At least at present, the cooperatives he found operating in the 
localities he visited are hardly viable, owing to the absence of adequate training on 
marketing and of adequate support in the negotiation of contracts with potential buyers.

<p><b>A/HRC/19/59/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>15</b> 
</p>
<p>While important investments were made by the authorities, with the support of the 
international community, to support production, this has not been matched by appropriate 
capacity-building to improve access to markets on equitable terms. Furthermore, while 
subsistence farming may represent an essential safety net for the poorest rural households &#8211; 
which are otherwise fully dependent on market prices for their access to food &#8211; and may 
contribute to the diversity of diets, some residents of the newly established rural sustainable 
towns may not be able to continue to farm their land, because of either the geographical 
distance separating them from their new homes or the absence of support for the 
rehabilitation of their land. Lastly, the costs and benefits of establishing sustainable rural 
towns should be assessed against any other ways in which access to schools and health 
care, as well as new forms of off-farm employment, could be ensured for the rural 
households concerned, including through the improvement of transport infrastructures and 
the provision of school buses and itinerant health-care centres.  
</p>
<p><b> VI. Food adequacy: healthy diets 
</b></p>
<p>48. Since April 2010, the General Law on Health (Ley General de Salud) refers to &#8220;the 
promotion of a balanced diet low in fats and sugar, which allows for healthy development&#8221; 
</p>
<p>(art. 65, II) and seeks to ensure that &#8220;food provided in schools has a higher nutritional value 
and does not include processed foods high in fats and sugars&#8221; (art. 66, IV). This 
</p>
<p>demonstrates a growing awareness about the state of emergency that Mexico is facing with 
regard to overweight and obesity. Some 35 million adult Mexicans (7 out of 10) are 
overweight or obese; these people will live ill, on average, for 18.5 years during their 
lifetime. Overweight and obesity are increasing at all income levels, although even faster 
within the poorest quintile, which remains comparatively less affected (the obesity rate in 
the lowest quintile is 28 per cent). The consequences are considerable. Overweight and 
obesity lead to type 2 diabetes, different forms of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The 
Ministry of Health has calculated that this phenomenon cost Mexico 42,246 billion pesos 
($1.822 billion) in medical care in 2008, representing 0.3 per cent of GDP, and 25,099 
billion pesos ($3.067 billion), or 0.2 per cent of GDP, in premature deaths. By 2017, the 
direct costs of obesity will rise to 78 billion pesos ($5.65 billion); already today, 15 per cent 
of total health-care expenses in Mexico are for the treatment of diabetes.26  
</p>
<p>49. Mexico has not been inactive in this area. In January 2010, a national agreement for 
nutritional health was reached between a large number of ministerial departments and other 
public authorities, non-governmental organizations, unions, the media and the agri-food 
sector, in order to address the problem. The aim of the agreement is to bring the prevalence 
of overweight and obesity in infants aged from 2 to 5 years to levels lower than those of 
2006; to stop the increase of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents (ages 5 
to19 years); and to slow the growth of overweight and obesity prevalence in adults. A range 
of 117 actions are listed to achieve these objectives, ranging from the promotion of more 
physical activity in schools and in workplaces to increasing accessibility, availability and 
consumption of water, and from influencing diets to promoting breastfeeding during the 
first six months of life. The adoption of binding guidelines for the distribution of food and 
beverages in schools, published in the Official Journal on 23 August 2010, is a step in this 
direction. 
</p>
<p>50.  The Special Rapporteur believes, however, that more structural actions are needed. 
Owing to the pressure of the agri-food industry, represented by Conm&#233;xico, some important

<p><b>16</b> 
</p>
<p>tools to influence consumer behaviour, including the raising of taxes on soda drinks and 
foods rich in transfats or in sugars, were not made part of the national agreement, despite 
the fact that, between 1999 and 2006, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverage doubled 
and that, today, about 10 per cent of Mexicans&#8217; total energy intake comes from these 
</p>
<p>beverages.27 The agreement itself is a soft-policy instrument, without binding targets being 
set out in legislation. It locates the problem of overweight and obesity in consumers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>behaviour, when in fact this problem stems from the food system as a whole. Agricultural 
policies currently encourage the production of grains, rich in carbohydrates but relatively 
poor in micronutrients, at the expense of the production of fruit and vegetables; the result is 
that, for many Mexicans, particularly in urban areas or in the States of the northern part of 
the country, switching to more healthy diets is becoming increasingly difficult. The trade 
policies currently in place also favour greater reliance on heavily processed and refined 
foods with a long shelf life rather than on the consumption of fresh and more perishable 
foods, particularly fruit and vegetables.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Sustainability: the future of food in Mexico 
</b></p>
<p>51. Any national strategy for the realization of the right to food should take into account 
the long-term consequences of responses to short-term needs. Mexico is indeed highly 
vulnerable to such natural disasters as earthquakes, flooding and hurricanes as well as 
drought or other climate shocks.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Transgenic crops and biodiversity 
</b></p>
<p>52. During his mission, the Special Rapporteur studied the latest scientific evidence on 
possible ecological risks of cultivating transgenic corn in Mexico, as well as the legal and 
policy developments since the Law on the Biosecurity of Genetically Modified Organisms 
of 2005. It is unclear whether the transgenic corn cultivars currently being tested in the field 
trials permitted between 2009 and 2011 are relevant to the country&#8217;s main agronomical 
</p>
<p>problems, as these cultivars do little to address the main problems, such as resistance to 
drought or the ability to flourish on poor soils. A number of other points seem, however, 
established.  
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur notes first that the cultivation of transgenic maize in Mexico 
poses acute risks to the diversity of native maize landraces, given the unknown effects of 
genetically modified maize coexisting with non-genetically modified maize in the country&#8217;s 
complex environmental conditions.28 These risks are largely due to the gene flow 
characteristics of maize, the pollen of which is able to travel over long distances, but also 
from the seed exchange habits of Mexican farmers. Indeed, the exchange of seeds from one 
farmer to another accounts for more than 85 per cent of the sources of maize seed at the 
national level (the seed industry accounting for 5.2 per cent).29 The combination of natural 
gene flow and human seed exchange practices mean that it would be close to impossible to 
maintain the coexistence of native landraces of maize with transgenic maize being planted

</p>
<p>Biodiversity (CONABIO) in its study &#8220;Organismos vivos modificados en la agricultura mexicana:

<p>on a commercial scale. The potential loss of agro-biodiversity that would result from this is 
a serious liability, as diversity is a crucial asset in the face of future threats and 
unpredictable changes brought about by climate change. In the long term, the continuous 
improvement of landraces by farmers&#8217; practices of saving, resowing and exchanging seeds 
best suited to specific environments is crucial to ensure adaptation to unpredictable climate 
disruptions.30 Even the remarkable initiative of establishing the National Centre for Genetic 
Resources in the State of Jalisco, ensuring the preservation <i>ex situ</i> of genetic resources, is 
not a substitute for the permanent enhancement of agrobiodiversity. 
</p>
<p>54. Second, if the current field trials are to lead to the commercialization of transgenic 
maize on a large scale, this could further increase their concentration in the seeds market. 
Monsanto's recent investment in the Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Ma&#237;z y 
Sorgo in El Tizate (Nayarit State) highlights the fact that field trials are not merely a 
scientific venture, but a component in a strategy to gain market shares in Mexico. The 
expansion of transgenic maize crops on a commercial scale and the potential resulting 
gradual disappearance of landraces could increase the dependency of farmers on a 
technology that would transfer resources to the seed companies holding the patents on these 
varieties, and thus increase the risks of small-scale farmers falling in debt. Furthermore, 
farmers cultivating native landraces of maize may find that their crops contain genes from 
transgenic plants, which could result in liability for infringing property rights of patent 
holders.31  
</p>
<p>55. In sum, the Special Rapporteur considers that the introduction of transgenic maize in 
Mexico may not be in the country's best interest, and that indeed it diverts the attention of 
policymakers away from more vital issues, such as soil erosion or resilience to climate 
change. The real question to be asked is whether this agricultural development path can 
reduce rural poverty and inequality, and whether it is sustainable in the long term. The 
answer is far from clear for the moment.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Water use, soil erosion and resilience to climate change  
</b></p>
<p>56. Access to water is vital in Mexico for those who rely directly on agricultural 
production for their right to food. The country&#8217;s &#8220;water crisis&#8221; is characterized by the 
overexploitation of key aquifers in the country, which is fuelled by <i>Tarifa 9</i>, an important 
subsidy on electricity use for agriculture (as groundwater is mainly pumped from wells) 
that leads to farmers paying only 23 per cent of the cost of pumping and utilizing.32 The 
Special Rapporteur also notes that the public authorities devote significant resources to 
hydrological infrastructure (3.3 billion pesos in 2006) and to irrigation (the area covered by 
modern irrigation increased from 1.3 million hectares in 2006 to an estimated 1.8 million 
hectares in 2011). At the same time, programmes to develop soil and water conservation 
techniques as well water collecting and storage constructions have been launched more 
recently, such as the Programme for the Sustainability of Natural Resources (COUSSA), 
</p>
<p>  
 30 Indeed, a $1.5 million programme financed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural 
</p>
<p>Development, Fisheries and Food, the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources and the 
Inter-Ministerial Commission for Biosafety of Genetically Modified Organisms recently led to the 
discovery of new maize landraces, demonstrating that smallholder farmers (the plots of whom 
represent 86 per cent of maize cultivation land in Mexico) were actively contributing not only to 
maintaining maize diversity but also to improving it. It also led to the discovery of new populations of 
teocinte, the most probable progenitor of maize.

Insurance scheme (on 8.115 billion hectares).  
</p>
<p>57. It is the view of the Special Rapporteur that the opportunity costs of large-scale 
hydrological infrastructure should be further investigated, given that the potential of 
programmes to scale up rainwater harvesting techniques has been insufficiently explored, 
despite recent programmes. Moreover, there are important drawbacks to large-scale 
hydrological infrastructure such as dams, which displace people, disrupt livelihoods and 
have a high cost for public authorities. Launching massive investments in rainwater 
harvesting techniques in dry-land areas would allow for the cultivation of formerly 
abandoned and degraded lands and recreate adequate conditions for agricultural production 
in semi-arid areas. These methods include permeable rock dams, zais, contour ridges, 
runoff strips and semi-circular bunds, which slow down runoff water, improving soil 
moisture that make the cultivation of trees, shrubs and herbs feasible in semi-arid areas and 
creates grazing areas in more arid ones.  
</p>
<p>58. Moreover, such systems halt land degradation and desertification. Soil erosion is a 
major issue in Mexico, with 60 per cent of the territory being affected by soil degradation, 
and 70 per cent of the 1.15 million livestock farms affected by overgrazing. The Special 
Rapporteur commends the Mexican authorities for the ambitious ProArbol Programme 
conducted by the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, as reforestation is 
vital for Mexico. He encourages both the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural 
Development, Fisheries and Food and the Ministry of the Environment and Natural 
Resources to launch a joint programme to develop agro-forestry systems and water 
harvesting techniques on the basis of the successful principles of the ProArbol programme, 
including participation of local communities and payments for ecological services in order 
to stop soil erosion and land degradation, to improve water retention and the replenishment 
of aquifers, and to increase the resilience of agricultural systems to climate change.

<p><b> VIII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>59.<b> Now that the right to food is recognized as a constitutional right in Mexico, it 
should strengthen its legislative and institutional framework by adopting a framework 
</b></p>
<p><b>law on the right to food and, on the basis of a participatory dialogue with all 
</b></p>
<p><b>stakeholders and a national strategy, move towards the full realization of the right to 
</b></p>
<p><b>food. The Special Rapporteur makes the recommendations below, which could inform 
</b></p>
<p><b>such a strategy.  
</b></p>
<p>60.<b> The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Government of Mexico:  
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Ensure that its agricultural policies make a more effective contribution 
</b></p>
<p><b>to combating rural poverty, by: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Identifying in a law the beneficiaries of all agricultural policies and 
</b></p>
<p><b>programmes, in order to improve transparency and accountability in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>allocation of resources;  
</b></p>
<p><b>(ii) Reorienting a significant fraction of agricultural public expenditures 
</b></p>
<p><b>towards the poor via targeted programmes such as the Proyecto Estrat&#233;gico de 
</b></p>
<p><b>Seguridad Alimentaria</b> <b>and Alianza PDR, for example by adopting a rule 
according to which at least 50 per cent of the resources allocated to agricultural 
</b></p>
<p><b>support go to the poorest 25 per cent of farmers or localities, as defined by the 
</b></p>
<p><b>CONAPO marginality index;
