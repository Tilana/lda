<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The present document is submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of association pursuant to Human Rights Council 
resolution 15/21. The document provides observations on the communications addressed by 
the Special Rapporteur to States, and on the replies received. 
</p>
<p>2. The cases raised by the Special Rapporteur in this addendum include 
communications sent between 1 May 2011 when the Special Rapporteur took up his 
functions and 15 March 2012. The addendum contains observations on these 
communications and on responses received from States until 15 May 2012. 
</p>
<p>3. For ease of reference, communications have been grouped by country, with 
countries listed alphabetically according to their names in English. Each communication is 
referenced as urgent appeal (UA), allegation letter (AL), joint urgent appeal (JUA) and 
joint allegation letter (JAL). This is followed by the date the communication was issued, as 
well as the case number and the State reply. The electronic version of the present document 
has both of these items hyperlinked, and clicking on them will open the communication 
sent and the reply from the concerned State, respectively, as uploaded on the OHCHR 
website. Finally, a summary of the allegations contained in the communication has been 
inserted in the language of submission. All communications are available in full in the 
Special Procedures&#8223; joint communication reports. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur expresses his gratitude to all States which have transmitted 
responses to communications sent. He considers response to his communications an 
important part of cooperation by States with his mandate. In this context, the Special 
Rapporteur recalls paragraph 6 of the Human Rights Council resolution 15/21 which calls 
upon States &#8220;to cooperate fully with and assist the special rapporteur in the performance of 
</p>
<p>his or her tasks, to provide all necessary information requested by him or her, to respond 
promptly to his or her urgent appeals and other communications.&#8221; He therefore urges all 
</p>
<p>States which have not yet replied to his communications to do so as soon as possible. 
</p>

<p>8. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial remercie le Gouvernement de l&#8223;Alg&#233;rie pour les r&#233;ponses 
qu&#8223;il a apport&#233;es &#224; deux de ses communications,  mais regrette de ne pas avoir re&#231;u de </p>

</b></p>
<p>r&#233;ponse &#224; sa communication dat&#233;e du 13 d&#233;cembre 2011 relatif &#224; une nouvelle loi sur les 
associations. Etant donn&#233; les pr&#233;occupations formul&#233;es, il invite les autorit&#233;s &#224; fournir aussi 
t&#244;t que possible des r&#233;ponses d&#233;taill&#233;es aux inqui&#233;tudes soulev&#233;es dans sa communication, 
qui sont &#233;galement refl&#233;t&#233;es dans un communiqu&#233; de presse dat&#233; du 4 mai 2012.1 
</p>
<p>9. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial prend note de l&#8223;adoption de r&#233;formes l&#233;gislatives touchant 
notamment la libert&#233; d&#8223;association. Il est particuli&#232;rement pr&#233;occup&#233; par diff&#233;rentes 
</p>
<p>dispositions du nouveau cadre l&#233;gislatif r&#233;gulant les associations qui constituent un recul 
par rapport &#224; la l&#233;gislation ant&#233;rieure, et partage les inqui&#233;tudes formul&#233;es par le 
Rapporteur sp&#233;cial sur la promotion et la protection du droit &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8223;expression et 
</p>
<p>d&#8223;opinion dans son rapport de mission (A/HRC/20/17/Add.1). Il recommande au 
</p>
<p>Gouvernement de r&#233;viser cette loi de sorte qu&#8223;elle soit conforme aux meilleures pratiques 
relatives &#224; la libert&#233; d&#8223;association et de r&#233;union pacifique d&#233;taill&#233;es dans son rapport 
</p>
<p>th&#233;matique. Il est pr&#234;t &#224; fournir tout appui technique dont aurait besoin le Gouvernement &#224; 
cet &#233;gard. 
</p>
<p>10. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial a lu les assurances apport&#233;es par le Gouvernement dans sa 
r&#233;ponse concernant les all&#233;gations de recrudescence d&#8223;actes de harc&#232;lement judicaire contre 
</p>
<p>les membres associatifs et syndicalistes, mais reste pr&#233;occup&#233; par les informations qu&#8223;il 
</p>
<p>continue de recevoir confirmant les inqui&#233;tudes soulev&#233;es. Il recommande aux autorit&#233;s de 
prendre toutes les mesures n&#233;cessaires pour favoriser l&#8223;exercice de la libert&#233; d&#8223;association 
</p>
<p>des membres associatifs et de syndicalistes et de s&#8223;assurer que ceux-ci ne soient pas l&#8223;objet 
d&#8223;actes de harc&#232;lement et d&#8223;intimidation en relation avec l&#8223;exercice de leurs libert&#233;s 
</p>
<p>fondamentales. 
</p>
<p>11. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial r&#233;f&#232;re &#224; la r&#233;solution 15/21 du Conseil des droits de l&#8223;homme, 
en particulier son premier paragraphe qui &#171; [d]emande &#224; tous les &#201;tats de respecter et 
prot&#233;ger le droit de r&#233;union pacifique et de libre association dont jouissent tous les 
individus, y compris en ce qui concerne les &#233;lections et les personnes professant des 
opinions ou des croyances minoritaires ou dissidentes, ou d&#233;fendant la cause des droits de 
l&#8223;homme, des syndicalistes et de tous ceux, y compris les migrants, qui cherchent &#224; exercer 
ou promouvoir ce droit, et de faire en sorte que les restrictions &#233;ventuellement impos&#233;es au 
libre exercice du droit de r&#233;union et d&#8223;association pacifiques soient conformes aux 
obligations que leur impose le droit international relatif aux droits de l&#8223;homme &#187;. 
</p>
<p>12. Le Rapporteur sp&#233;cial rappelle au Gouvernement de l&#8223;Alg&#233;rie la demande de visite 
pays qu&#8223;il a formul&#233;e en d&#233;cembre 2011. Il remercie le Gouvernement d&#8223;avoir accus&#233; 
</p>
<p>r&#233;ception de sa demande et r&#233;it&#232;re sa disponibilit&#233; pour discuter des dates d&#8223;une visite en 
</p>
<p>Alg&#233;rie. Une telle visite pourrait permettre d&#8223;aborder la question de l&#8223;assistance technique 
</p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p><b>6  
</b></p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>15. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply has been received from the 
Government of Angola to the allegation letters sent during the reporting period. He 
considers responses to his communications as an important part of the cooperation of 
Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide as soon as possible 
detailed responses to all the concerns raised in these communications.  
</p>
<p>16. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to refrain from using force during 
peaceful demonstrations. A thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of 
excessive use of force and of torture and ill treatment, including against women, during 
peaceful demonstrations, should be conducted; those responsible should be held 
accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress. 
</p>
<p><b>  Armenia 
</b></p>
<p>17. JUA 22/08/2011. Case no. ARM 1/2011. State Reply: 31/01/2012. Alleged 
harassment and imprisonment of Jehovah&#8223;s Witnesses for their conscientious objection to 
</p>
<p>military service. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>18. The Special Rapporteur appreciates the response of the Government of Armenia in 
relation to the allegations contained in the joint communication dated 22 August 2011.  
</p>
<p>19. With regard to the fact Jehovah&#8223;s Witnesses community members could not 
assemble, allegedly due to pressure from Government officials and from priests of the 
Armenian Apostolic Church, the Special Rapporteur notes the response of the Government 
in which it explained that the rented facilities belonged to private persons. However, he 
recalls that the State has a positive obligation to take effective measures to ensure that the 
right of peaceful assembly is adequately protected in all spheres, both public and private.  
</p>
<p>20. The Special Rapporteur recommends to the authorities to intensify efforts to ensure 
that the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association continue to be genuinely 
protected in practice, without distinction of any kind including religion or belief. The 
Special Rapporteur underlines that the rights of peaceful assembly and of association are 
key for individuals espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Azerbaijan 
</b></p>
<p>21. JAL 24/08/2011. Case no. AZE 2/2011. State Reply: 08/09/2011. Arbitrary 
demolition of a building housing the Institute of Peace and Democracy. 
</p>
<p>22. JAL 27/09/2011. Case no. AZE 3/2011. State Reply: None to date. Arbitrary 
demolition of a building housing the Women&#8223;s Crisis Center, the first and only shelter 
available to women, including victims of violence.  
</p>
<p>23. JAL 05/03/2012. Case no. AZE 1/2012. State Reply: None to date.  Grave 
challenges faced by NGOs in the context of the provisions contained in the 2009 Law on 
Non-Governmental Organizations. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>24. The Special Rapporteur notes the responses to the communications he sent on 24 
August 2011 and on 27 September 2011. He regrets however that no reply has been 
received from the Government of Azerbaijan to the joint letter sent on 5 March 2012 </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/27/Add.3 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>concerning the 2009 Law on Non-Governmental Organizations and the grave challenges 
faced by NGOs as well as the de fato ban on peaceful assemblies in Baku. 
</p>
<p>25.  He recommends the Government to revise the aforementioned law to ensure its 
revised version complies with international human rights law. He is available to provide 
any technical assistance the Government might require in this regard. 
</p>
<p>26. With regard to the allegations of arbitrary demolishing of houses resided by NGOs, 
the Special Rapporteur remains concerned that the demolition of the building and the 
continuing harassment of its staff might be connected to their legitimate human rights 
activities.  
</p>
<p>27. In terms of the peaceful protests held in and around the city of Baku in March 2012, 
the Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned that the referred victims may have been 
subjected to acts of ill-treatment for exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of opinion 
and expression, and to peaceful assembly. While he notes the reply in which the 
Government details the procedure that was followed to detain those mentioned in the 
communication, the Government still needs to respond to the serious allegation of ill-
treatment of protesters.  He recommends the Government to put in place an enabling and 
safe environment that is conducive to the free expression of civil society allowing 
individuals to exercise their legitimate freedom of association without undue hindrances. A 
thorough, impartial and independent investigation into any allegation of human rights 
violations, including acts of intimidation or harassment committed against those exercising 
their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, should be conducted; those 
responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress. 
</p>
<p>28. The Special Rapporteur would like to refer  to Human Rights Council resolution 
15/21, and in particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[c]alls upon States to respect and fully 
protect the rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, including in 
the context of elections, and including persons espousing minority or dissenting views or 
beliefs, human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, including migrants, seeking to 
exercise or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary measures to ensure that any 
restrictions on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association are in accordance with their obligations under international human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>29. The Special Rapporteur reminds the Government of Azerbaijan of his country visit 
request sent in September 2011, to which a response is yet to be received.  In this 
connection, OP6 of resolution 15/21 states that the &#8220;Human Rights Council&#8230; [c]alls upon 
States to cooperate fully with and assist the Special Rapporteur in the performance of his or 
her tasks, to provide all necessary information requested by him or her, &#8230; and to consider 
</p>
<p>favourably his or her requests for visits&#8221;.

Sayed Yousif Al-Mahafdha. 
</p>
<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Bahrain for replying to all 
communications sent. He nevertheless remains gravely concerned about the significant 
number and the grave nature of the allegations received during the reporting period.  
</p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about the physical and psychological 
integrity of people exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association as well as of those who monitor such fundamental freedoms in Bahrain, 
including prominent human rights defenders. He urges the authorities to refrain from using 
force, including the use of indiscriminate tear gas, during peaceful demonstrations. He also 
urges the authorities to ensure that no one is criminalised for the peaceful exercise of the 
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association and to release immediately and 
unconditionally all persons convicted for exercising their legitimate rights. 
</p>
<p>38. The Special Rapporteur refers again to Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, and 
in particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[c]alls upon States to respect and fully protect the

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government of Belarus for the 
responses received. He regrets that the responses received on 10 June 2011 and 17 January 
2012, regarding the allegation of detention of human rights defenders and the adoption of 
restrictive legislative amendments, respectively, do not reflect on the allegations. He urges 
the authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in 
these communications.  
</p>
<p>51. The Special Rapporteur is gravely concerned about numerous provisions of the Law 
on Public Associations, the Law on Political Parties, the Law on Public Gatherings, the 
Criminal Code, the Election Code, and the Code of Administrative Violations and further 
recommends the Government to revise these laws to ensure compliance with international 
human rights law. The Special Rapporteur is available to provide any technical assistance 
the Government might require in this regard. 
</p>
<p>52. With regard to the detention of Mr. Ales Bialatski, the Special Rapporteur remains

agosto de 2011 relativa a alegaciones de uso excesivo de la fuerza por parte de las fuerzas y 
cuerpos de la seguridad del Estado contra manifestantes. En cuanto a las comunicaciones

responder a la mayor brevedad.  
</p>
<p>65. En lo que concierne a su respuesta con fecha 26 de octubre de 2011, se indica que 
las alegaciones de uso desproporcionado de la fuerza siguen preocupando al Relator, 
incluyendo el caso del Sr. Daniel Pantoja Quiroz. En este sentido, el Relator Especial 
quisiera recordar a sus autoridades que una reuni&#243;n no debe dejar de considerarse como 
pac&#237;fica en caso que se incurra espor&#225;dicamente a la violencia. De hecho, siempre y cuando 
los organizadores y participantes tengan intenciones pac&#237;ficas, las autoridades del Estado 
tienen la obligaci&#243;n de proteger a los manifestantes contra actos violentos que impidan 
indebidamente el ejercicio del derecho a la libertad de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica. 
</p>
<p>66. El Relator Especial quiere hacer un llamamiento al Gobierno de Chile a reconsiderar

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the People&#8223;s Republic of China 
for its response to the communication dated 10 February 2012. At the time of the 
finalization of this report, a translation of the reply was not available. He however regrets 
that the Government had not transmitted replies to the other communications sent. He urges 
the authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in 
the other communications due to the grave nature of the allegations received with respect of 
the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. 
</p>
<p>73. On 1 November 2011, the Special Rapporteur joined a press statement issued by 
several special procedures mandate holders, in which they voiced grave concern over 
reports of heavy security measures, in and around the area of the Tibetan Buddhist Kirti 
monastery - which houses some 2,500 monks- and other monasteries in Aba County, an 
area of Sichuan province with many ethnic Tibetans in south-west China. The Special 
Rapporteur warned that a series of measures, including security raids and surveillance 
within monasteries, with police presence inside and outside monasteries to monitor 
religious activities, seriously impeded the exercise of the right to association of members of 
the monastic community&#8221;.4 
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to refrain from using force during 
peaceful demonstrations. He reminds that the right to life is a non-derogable right in 
international human rights law, including in the context of assemblies. In this regard, he 
refers to Article 5 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention 
of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (1990), which provides that &#8220;whenever the lawful 
</p>
<p>use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall minimize damage 
and injury, and respect and preserve human life.&#8221; A thorough and independent investigation 
over any allegations of excessive use of force and of torture and ill treatment during 
peaceful demonstrations should be conducted, those responsible should be held 
accountable, and victims should be provided with full redress. He requests the Government 
to keep him informed about the investigations conducted in relation to the aforementioned 
cases.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>95. The Special Rapporteur would like to thank the Government for its response to his 
communication dated 20 July 2011, which sought to clarify the allegations concerning two 
parallel assemblies which ended with violence. 
</p>
<p>96. The Special Rapporteur would like to emphasize that assemblies should not be 
deemed peaceful if organizers and participants do not have peaceful intentions. Considering 
that the allegations that the march organized by the Greek Resistance Movement against the 
multicultural Rainbow Festival openly insulted other communities, including Turks, Jews, 
Muslims or Refugees are still credible, greater efforts are required to ensure adequate 
protection. In this connection, the State has a positive obligation to ensure that the right to 
peaceful assembly is protected against any disruptive or provocative agent. In the event of 
competing assemblies that do not constitute a risk for violence, the Special Rapporteur 
considers that the State has also a responsibility to promote tolerance and understanding 
among the different views.

respuesta a sus comunicaciones es una manera importante de cooperar con su mandato. En 
este sentido, el Relator Especial urge a las autoridades a que respondan detalladamente a las 
preocupaciones contenidas en esta comunicaci&#243;n. Asimismo, se expresa seria preocupaci&#243;n 
que los actos alegados en la carta de alegaci&#243;n puedan estar relacionados, de alg&#250;n modo,

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>110. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Egypt for its responses. He 
however regrets that at the time of the finalization of the present report, the Government 
had not transmitted replies to all his communications sent. He urges the authorities to 
provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in these other 
communications, which are also echoed in a press release dated 21 November 2011 issued 
by four special procedures mandate holders.5 
</p>
<p>111. The Special Rapporteur is very concerned about the context in which associations 
have had to operate during the reporting period where some NGOs&#8223; offices were raided; 
</p>
<p>their members stigmatised and some referred to Cairo&#8223;s Criminal Court under the 
</p>
<p>accusation of operating an illegal entity or of illegally receiving foreign funding. He takes 
note of the reply transmitted in relation to the difficulties faced by NGOs to operate within 
the context of the Law 84/2002, but he remains concerned that numerous provisions of this 
law do not meet international human rights standards. He calls upon the Government to 
ensure that no individual is criminalised for the peaceful exercise of their fundamental 
freedoms. He recommends the Government to adopt a new law on NGO to be in 
compliance with the best practices detailed in his thematic report and with the accepted 
recommendations issued within the context of the Universal Periodic Review of the Arab 
Republic of Egypt in March 2010 and, in particular, recommendations 95.88 and 95.106. 
He is available to provide any technical assistance the Government might require in this 
regard.  
</p>
<p>112. The Special Rapporteur refers again to Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, and 
in particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[c]alls upon States to respect and fully protect the 
rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, including in the context 
of elections, and including persons espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, 
human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, including migrants, seeking to exercise 
or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary measures to ensure that any restrictions 
on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are in 
accordance with their obligations under international human rights law&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>113. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to refrain from using force during 
peaceful demonstrations. A thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of 
any alleged human rights violations, including acts of intimidations or harassments, 
committed against those exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of 
association, particularly against women, should be conducted; those responsible should be 
held accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress.

<p><b>  Observations 
</b></p>
<p>117. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Ethiopia for its response to his 
communication dated 5 October 2011, but regrets that it did not respond to the other 
communication dated 9 December 2011. He urges the authorities to provide as soon as 
possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in the latter communication due to the 
grave nature of the allegations received with respect of the right to freedom of association. 
</p>
<p>118. The Special Rapporteur is deeply concerned by several provisions of the anti-terror 
legislation and the 2009 CSO law that unduly restrict the right to freedom of association. 
He is gravely concerned that the strict legal framework governing civil society has had a 
chilling effect on human rights associations that had, for most of them, to stop their 
activities. He is concerned about the frozen of all assets of the Ethiopian Human Rights 
Council association, which may force it to stop its human rights work. The mandate holder 
recommends to the Government to immediately revise the 2009 CSO law, notably with 
respect to access to funding; and to ensure that the revised version complies with the best 
practices detailed in his thematic report and with the accepted recommendations issued 
within the context of the Universal Periodic Review of Ethiopia and, in particular, 
recommendation 97.53. The Special Rapporteur is available to provide any technical 
assistance the Government might require in this regard. 
</p>
<p>119. The Special Rapporteur refers again to Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, and

his communications. He considers responses to his communications as an important part of 
the cooperation of Governments with his mandate, and urges the authorities to provide 
detailed answers to all the concerns raised in his communications. 
</p>
<p>124. The Special Rapporteur remains very preoccupied by the Decree entitled &#8220;Essential

</p>
<p>of unions in the country, and he recommends to the Government to revise thoroughly the 
aforementioned decree. 
</p>
<p>125. The Special Rapporteur urges the authorities to ensure that no individual is 
criminalised for the peaceful exercise of his fundamental freedoms. He recommends for the 
Government to put in place an enabling and safe environment that is conducive to the free 
expression of unionists, and to ensure that they are not subjected to any acts of harassment 
or intimidation in relation to the exercise of their fundamental freedoms. A thorough and 
independent investigation over any allegations of torture or ill treatment should be

<p>201. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Malaysia for having replied to all

repeated allegations that those peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful 
assembly and association face undue restrictions, as echoed in a press release dated 7 
December 2011 issued by four special procedures mandate holders.6

</b></p>
<p>202. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that, according to the Government&#8223;s response, 
a demonstration of members and supporters of the Coalition for Fair and Free Elections 
(Bersih) was prevented on the sole basis that an opposite group wanted to demonstrate on 
the same day and at the same location. When there is still credible information that a violent 
counter-demonstration may take place, greater efforts are required to ensure adequate 
protection for the members of the first assembly planned. In this connection, the State has a 
positive obligation to ensure that the right of peaceful assembly is protected against any 
disruption or provocation.  
</p>
<p>203. Given the repeated allegations of acts of harassment and intimidation, the Special 
Rapporteur recommends the Government to immediately put in place an enabling and safe 
environment allowing individuals to exercise their legitimate freedoms of peaceful 
assembly and association without undue hindrances. A thorough and independent 
investigation into any allegations of any alleged human rights violations, including acts of 
intimidations or harassments, committed against those exercising their rights to freedom of 
peaceful assembly and of association, should be conducted; those responsible should be 
held accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress.

<p>204. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the information it transmitted 
with regard to the new legislation. He nevertheless remains concerned about numerous 
provisions of this law, as identified in the communication he sent. He renews its 
availabilities to provide any technical support and assistance needed to ensure that the legal 
framework related to peaceful assemblies and its implementation meet international law 
standards. 
</p>

<p>209. The Special Rapporteur further urges the authorities to refrain from using force 
during peaceful demonstrations and to ensure that any individual and legal entity, including 
political parties, can peacefully exercise their right of freedom of peaceful assembly. A 
thorough and independent investigation into any allegations of excessive use of force and of 
torture and ill treatment, including against women, during peaceful demonstrations, should 
be conducted; those responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be 
provided with full redress. 
</p>
<p>210. The Special Rapporteur refers again  to Human Rights Council resolution 15/21, and 
in particular operative paragraph 1 that &#8220;[c]alls upon States to respect and fully protect the 
rights of all individuals to assemble peacefully and associate freely, including in the context 
of elections, and including persons espousing minority or dissenting views or beliefs, 
human rights defenders, trade unionists and others, including migrants, seeking to exercise 
or to promote these rights, and to take all necessary measures to ensure that any restrictions 
on the free exercise of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are in 
accordance with their obligations under international human rights law&#8221;.

</p>
<p>214. El Relator Especial toma debida nota del contenido de su carta en la que se indica

mayo de 2012 relativa a la carta de alegaci&#243;n relativa a las manifestaciones de estudiantes 
en Valencia. No obstante, se lamenta que no haya respondido a la totalidad de las 
alegaciones presentadas. En concreto, se reiteran los hechos alegados que durante las 
protestas en Valencia, las fuerzas y cuerpos de la seguridad del Estado no habr&#237;an hecho 
visibles sus placas de identificaci&#243;n personal con el correspondiente n&#250;mero de carnet 
profesional y de tarjeta de identidad profesional, tal y como exige la Instrucci&#243;n 13/2007

<p>270. El Relator Especial considera que una actuaci&#243;n policial debe basarse en una 
presunci&#243;n generalizada a favor de la celebraci&#243;n de dichas reuniones. En este sentido, si 
bien los manifestantes no deben recurrir a la violencia, tampoco procede categorizar como 
violenta a toda una manifestaci&#243;n por actos espor&#225;dicos de violencia perpetuados por un 
grupo reducido de personas. De hecho, una manifestaci&#243;n debe presumirse como pac&#237;fica 
siempre y cuando los organizadores y participantes tengan intenciones pac&#237;ficas. En este 
sentido, el Estado tiene una obligaci&#243;n positiva de tomar medidas para proteger el derecho 
de reuni&#243;n pac&#237;fica de los manifestantes frente a cualquier acto que impida indebidamente 
el leg&#237;timo ejercicio de este derecho.

<p>293. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for its 
responses. However, he deeply regrets that six communications he sent during the reported 
period are left unanswered. He remains gravely concerned about the significant number and 
the very grave nature of the allegations received during the reporting period. He urges the 
authorities to provide as soon as possible detailed responses to all the concerns raised in his 
communication. 
</p>
<p>294. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned about the physical and 
psychological integrity of people exercising their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly 
and association in the Syrian Arab Republic and further calls upon the authorities to release 
immediately and unconditionally all persons convicted for exercising their legitimate rights. 
</p>
<p>295. The Special Rapporteur reminds that the right to life is a non-derogeable right in 
international human rights law, including in the context of assemblies. In this regard, he 
refers to Article 5 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law 
Enforcement Officials Adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention 
of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (1990), which provides that &#8220;whenever the lawful 
</p>
<p>use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall minimize damage 
and injury, and respect and preserve human life.&#8221; He requests the Government to keep him 
informed about the investigations conducted in this regard. 
</p>
<p>296. He urges all parties to immediately end violence and he calls on the authorities to 
stop using force during peaceful demonstrations. A thorough and independent investigation 
regarding any allegations of excessive use of force and of torture and ill treatment, 
including against women, during peaceful demonstrations, should be conducted; those 
responsible should be held accountable; and victims should be provided with full redress. 
</p>
<p>297. The Special Rapporteur emphasises that &#8220;States Party shall ensure in its legal system 
that the victim of an act of torture obtains redress and has an enforceable right to fair and 
adequate compensation, including the means for as full rehabilitation as possible. In the 
event of the death of the victim as a result of an act of torture, his dependants shall be 
entitled to compensation.&#8221; (Article 14 of the UN Convention against Torture and Other

is a State party). </p>

after the Government extended an invitation for such a visit to take place &#8220;during the first

to respect the rights of peaceful protesters against any disruptive or provocative act.

to all the concerns raised in other communications. 
</p>
<p>326. The Special Rapporteur notes the reply transmitted by the Government in relation to 
the suspension of activities of 29 NGOs in the Masvingo province. He remains concerned 
on allegations that the decision taken may be illegal as domestic laws do not provide the 
Governor with the authority to suspend the activities of any NGOs, nor do they oblige NGO
