CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
Dear Shareholders,
This is the first interim report since the change in our accounting reference date which was
announced in March 2016 and covers the six-month period from January to June 2016.  The
Board considered that this change aligned with best practice amongst major UK listed
businesses and also provided greater timing flexibility for future financing execution for our North
Yorkshire polyhalite project (the Project).
This half-year has been focused on moving our Project closer towards construction.  We were
initially centred on the completion of the definitive feasibility study (DFS) and the publication of its
material findings in March, which defined a very attractive fertilizer business.  The Project's
business case is based on the ability to generate annual earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) ranging between US$1 billion and US$3 billion through
various volume and price outcomes.
The completion of the DFS allowed our team to move onto the next important stage of our Project
development which was to select preferred construction contractors.  These were announced in
June and were the culmination of a 19-month highly competitive tendering processes.  The
tenders ran in parallel with the preparation of the DFS and, on behalf of the Board and
management, I can say we were both impressed by the quality of the submissions and thankful
for the efforts of all the bidders.
In selecting both Associated Mining Construction (UK) and Hochtief Murphy joint ventures we are
confident that we have two excellent contractor teams that can help us successfully deliver the
Project.  During our discussions with both groups they have been able to refine their construction
methodologies, update their competitive tender rates and evolve their designs.
The outcomes of these processes has resulted in a total Project capital funding requirement of
US$2.91 billion and a Stage 1 capital funding requirement of US$1.09 billion.  The Project has a
net present value of $15 billion (assuming ultimate production levels of 20mtpa) rising to US$27
billion upon commencement of production.  The Project has an unlevered after tax internal rate of
return of 28%.
The period has also seen further progress with our customer commitments.  In addition to several
routine agronomy updates from our ongoing crop trial work, we announced a new take-or-pay
offtake agreement with Yunnan Dian Huang Peony Industrial Group Co. Ltd (Dian Huang).  This
replaced our previous offtake contract with Yunnan TCT and was facilitated by the latter.  It also
strengthened the Company's supply position in Yunnan province by supplying a customer closer
to the end user and also by removing the conditions that were included in the original TCT
agreement.
Away from development matters, and turning to governance issues, I can also reflect on the non-
executive director change we made in May when Louise Hardy replaced Stephen Pycroft on the
Sirius Minerals Board.  Stephen's increasing work commitments in his role as executive
chairman of Mace meant that it was a logical time for him to step down.  I would like to reiterate
the Board's thanks to him for his valuable involvement and support over the last few years.
Louise brings over 25 years' experience in the engineering sector to the Company.  In addition to
a previous part time executive role at Skanska, she currently holds non-executive director roles at
Ebbsfleet Development Corporation and Defence Infrastructure Organisation, both executive
non-departmental public bodies sponsored by government departments.  Her experience at
Aecom and particularly at Laing O'Rourke - where she worked as Infrastructure Director as part of
the consortium delivering the London 2012 Olympics - will be invaluable to us as we move
through the next phases of development.
During the period there have also been other significant developments for the Company.  In May
we announced an increase to our polyhalite probable reserve.  The reserve increased to 280
million tonnes at an average grade of 88.4% (up from the previous level of 250 million tonnes at a
grade of 87.8%).  This added further confirmation of the outstanding nature of this deposit, which
is already the world's largest and highest quality polyhalite reserve.
During the period we also announced details of a potential de-icing salt opportunity at our
Project.  Whilst the salt deposits within our area of interest (and in close proximity to the
polyhalite deposits) have been well known for some time, its extraction could be used in the
future as an opportunistic strategy to generate additional revenues in severe winters and if full
mine capacity is not being used for polyhalite.  We have defined an inferred resource of 550
million tonnes within the Project's area of interest.  The initiative, which is subject to approvals,
remains an optional and potential bolt-on to our main POLY4 business, but is nevertheless one
that could generate additional revenues and also help the UK, particularly in harsh winters.
During the six-month period ended 30 June 2016 the Group made a consolidated loss of £4.1
million compared to a loss of £4.7 million for the six-month period (April to September) last year. 
Cash resources at the end of June 2016 were £16.9 million compared to £29.1 million at 31
December 2015 and £25.1 million at 30 September 2015.
The Group's net assets at 30 June 2016 were £161.7 million compared to £165.2 million at 31
December 2015 and £153.4 million at 30 September 2015.
The condensed interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared under
the going concern assumption.  However, the directors recognise that there are a number of
material uncertainties inherent in the Project.  The impact of these uncertainties on the directors'
consideration of the going concern assumption is set out in note 1 to these financial statements.
The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group have not changed since the annual report
for the period ended 31 December 2015.  The principal risks are exploration and development,
reserves and resources estimates, mineral title risk, commodity price risk, liquidity risk, currency
risk, permits and licenses, community relations, competitors, operational delays, employer and
contractor relations and product risk.  In respect of the UK's vote in June 2016 to leave the EU,
we do not feel the risk to our business is great and there are also potential benefits for the
Project.  As an export-focused business, any consequent fall in the value of the pound sterling
could be beneficial.  Detailed explanations of these principal risks can be found in the
Company's last annual report.
The Company's Board and management remain focused on the efficient deployment of our
existing funds.  Together with our external finance and advisory groups, they also continue to
concentrate on the ongoing (and extensive) work to secure financing for the construction of our
Project.  The strategy is still to deliver the overall funding requirement through a range of
financing mechanisms, with debt funding making up as much of the overall requirement as
possible.
Post balance sheet events
On 20 July 2016 we announced an approvals update, confirming that we had received
government approval for the harbour facilities element of our Project.  This approval includes the
new berth, ship loading facilities and the conveyor linkage to the materials handling facility and
includes all the compulsory purchase powers needed to develop them.  This was the last major
approval needed for the Project and we were clearly delighted to have secured it.  This decision
provides a welcome prelude to the financing stages of the Project.
I thank all shareholders for their support for the Company and we look forward to an exciting year
ahead as we continue to develop our world-class polyhalite Project.
Kind regards
Russell Scrimshaw
Chairman

INDEPENDENT REVIEW REPORT TO SIRIUS
MINERALS PLC
Report on the condensed interim consolidated financial statements
Our conclusion
We have reviewed Sirius Minerals Plc's condensed interim consolidated financial statements
(the "interim financial statements") in the interim report of Sirius Minerals Plc for the six-month
period ended 30 June 2016.  Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes
us to believe that the interim financial statements are not prepared, in all material respects, in
accordance with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted
by the European Union and the AIM Rules for Companies.
Emphasis of matter
Without modifying our conclusion on the interim financial statements, we have considered the
adequacy of the disclosure made in note 1 to the financial statements concerning the Group's
ability to continue as a going concern.  The Group is involved in efforts to secure short and long-
term finance for its polyhalite project in North Yorkshire, the outcome of which is uncertain. 
These conditions indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which may cast significant
doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.  The Group financial statements
do not include the adjustments that would result if the Group were unable to continue as a going
concern.
What we have reviewed
The interim financial statements comprise:
·      The condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at 30 June 2016;
·      The condensed consolidated income statement and condensed consolidated statement of
comprehensive income for the period then ended;
·      The condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the period then ended;
·      The condensed consolidated statement of changes in equity for the period then ended; and
·      The explanatory notes to the interim financial statements.
The interim financial statements included in the interim report have been prepared in accordance
with International Accounting Standard 34, 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the
European Union and the AIM Rules for Companies.
As disclosed in note 1 to the interim financial statements, the financial reporting framework that
has been applied in the preparation of the full annual financial statements of the Group is
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union.
Responsibilities for the interim financial statements and the review
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
The interim report, including the interim financial statements, is the responsibility of, and has
been approved by, the directors.  The directors are responsible for preparing the interim report in
accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies which require that the financial information must
be presented and prepared in a form consistent with that which will be adopted in the company's
annual financial statements.
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the interim financial statements in the interim
report based on our review.  This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared for and
only for the company for the purpose of complying with the AIM Rules for Companies and for no
other purpose.  We do not, in giving this conclusion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
What a review of interim financial statements involves
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements
(UK and Ireland) 2410, 'Review of Interim Financial Information Performed by the Independent
Auditor of the Entity' issued by the Auditing Practices Board for use in the United Kingdom.  A
review of interim financial information consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review
procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) and, consequently, does not enable us to obtain
assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an
audit.  Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.
We have read the other information contained in the interim report and considered whether it
contains any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the information in the
interim financial statements.
