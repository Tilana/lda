Explanatory Note
Basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit and the pro forma disclosure related to common unit-
based compensation have been restated for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, as
discussed in Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1, Financial
Statements (Unaudited). We previously computed net income per limited partner unit without applying certain
provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03-6, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method
under FASB Statement No. 128.
We previously disclosed pro forma information under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, assuming compensation
expense for the non-vested restricted units granted would be different under our accounting method (the
intrinsic method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees)
and the provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Our previous disclosure has
been restated since compensation expense for the non-vested restricted units granted is the same under the
intrinsic method and the provisions of SFAS No. 123. For additional information regarding the restatements,
see “Notes 6, 7 and 12 to Financial Statements (Unaudited)” included in Item 1, Financial Statements
(Unaudited).
The restatements have no impact on previously reported income before income taxes, net income, limited
partners’ interest in net income, the condensed consolidated balance sheets, quarterly cash distributions paid
to common unitholders, or the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

ALLIANCE RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
1. ORGANIZATION AND PRESENTATION
Alliance Resource Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Partnership”), was formed in May 1999,
to acquire, own and operate certain coal production and marketing assets of Alliance Resource Holdings, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation (“ARH”) (formerly known as Alliance Coal Corporation), consisting of substantially all
of ARH’s operating subsidiaries, but excluding ARH.
The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the
Partnership and present the financial position as of September 30, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the
results of its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004. All
material intercompany transactions and accounts of the Partnership have been eliminated.
On September 15, 2005, the Partnership completed a two-for-one split of the Partnership’s common units,
whereby holders of record at the close of business on September 2, 2005 received one additional common
unit for each common unit owned on that date. The unit split resulted in the issuance of 18,130,440 common
units. All references to the number of units and per unit net income and distribution amounts included in this
report have been adjusted to give effect for this unit split for all periods presented.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are unaudited. However, in the opinion of
management, these financial statements reflect all adjustments (which include only normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. Results for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year.
These condensed consolidated financial statements and notes are prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim reporting and should be read in
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Partnership’s Annual Report
on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004.
2. CONTINGENCIES
The Partnership is involved in various lawsuits, claims and regulatory proceedings incidental to its business.
The Partnership provides for costs related to litigation and regulatory proceedings, including civil fines
issued as part of the outcome of these proceedings, when a loss is probable and the amount is reasonably
determinable. Although the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, in the
opinion of management, the outcome of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for or covered
under insurance, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Partnership’s business, financial
position or results of operations. Nonetheless, these matters or estimates that are based on current facts and
circumstances, if resolved in a manner different from the basis on which management has formed its opinion,
could have a material adverse effect on the Partnership’s financial position or results of operations.
Mettiki Coal (WV), LLC is developing an underground long-wall mining operation in Tucker County, West
Virginia (the “Mountain View Mine,” also known as the “E-Mine”), which will eventually replace the
Partnership’s Mettiki Coal, LLC’s existing long-wall mining operation at the D-Mine located in Garrett County,
Maryland. The Mountain View Mine is located approximately 10 miles from Mettiki Coal. In order to proceed
with development of the Mountain View Mine, Mettiki Coal (WV) submitted various permit applications to the
West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection (“WVDEP”), including an application for approval to
conduct underground mining. WVDEP issued the required permits in the spring of 2004. Certain
complainants appealed WVDEP’s decision issuing the underground mining permit to the West Virginia
Surface Mine Board (“SMB”), which held administrative hearings on the matter in late 2004 and early
Table of Contents
4
2005. On March 8, 2005, the SMB issued a final order concluding consideration of the appeal without
rendering a decision, which, by operation of West Virginia law, resulted in the affirmation of WVDEP’s
decision to issue the underground mining permit. The complainants appealed the SMB decision, but
subsequently voluntarily agreed to withdraw their appeal, which was dismissed with prejudice by the Tucker
County Circuit Court in West Virginia on April 26, 2005.
On April 19, 2005, these same complainants submitted a letter to the United States Department of the Interior’s
Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement (“OSM”), and the OSM’s regional field office in
Charleston, West Virginia, (“CHFO”), requesting federal monitoring and inspection of the Mountain View Mine
and alleging that operations at the mine would create acid mine drainage with no defined end point. By
written notice, dated April 21, 2005, the CHFO advised WVDEP that it would review the complainant’s
allegation that the Mountain View Mine would cause material harm to the hydrological balance within and
outside of the permit area. Following its initial review, on September 15, 2005, the CHFO notified WVDEP that
it intended to initiate a formal investigation into the issuance of the underground mining permit for the
Mountain View Mine. WVDEP requested an informal review of the CHFO decision by the OSM, and by two
letters, both dated October 21, 2005, (a) OSM reversed the decision of the CHFO concluding that the CHFO
lacked statutory authority to review the WVDEP’s issuance of the underground mining permit and (b) the
United States Department of the Interior advised the complainants that this was the Department of the
Interior’s final decision of the matters raised in their letter of April 19, 2005. The Partnership is presently
conducting mine development activities at the Mountain View Mine, and is not currently subject to any
pending or threatened agency or third-party claims.
On October 12, 2004, Pontiki Coal, LLC (“Pontiki”), one of the Partnership’s subsidiaries and the successor-
in-interest of Pontiki Coal Corporation as a result of a merger completed on August 4, 1999, was served with a
complaint from ICG, LLC (“ICG”) alleging breach of contract and seeking declaratory relief to determine the
parties’ rights under a coal sales agreement (the “Horizon Agreement”), dated October 3, 1998, as amended
on February 28, 2001, between Horizon Natural Resource Sales Company (“Horizon Sales”), as buyer, and
Pontiki Coal Corporation, as seller. ICG has represented that it acquired the rights and assumed the liabilities
of the Horizon Agreement effective September 30, 2004, as part of an asset sale approved by the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court supervising the bankruptcy proceedings of Horizon Sales and its affiliates.
The complaint alleges that from January 2004 to August 2004, Pontiki failed to deliver a total of 138,111 tons
of coal resulting in an alleged loss of profits for ICG of $4.1 million. The Partnership has been unable to
confirm ICG’s calculation of the alleged shortfall of coal deliveries. The Partnership is aware that certain
deliveries under the Horizon Agreement were not made during 2004 for reasons including, but not limited to,
force majeure events at Pontiki and ICG’s failure to provide transportation services for the delivery of coal as
required under the Horizon Agreement. This litigation is in the preliminary stage and, although Pontiki and
ICG have had continued discussions concerning the potential settlement of this litigation matter, the
Partnership does not believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred. The Partnership also does not
believe that this litigation has merit and intends to contest the litigation vigorously. The Partnership is
unable, however, to predict the outcome of the litigation or reasonably estimate a range of possible loss given
the current status of the litigation.
At certain of the Partnership’s operations, property tax assessments for several years are under audit by
various state tax authorities. The Partnership believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities based on
reasonable estimates of any property tax assessments that may be ultimately assessed as a result of these
audits.
3.
TUNNEL RIDGE ACQUISITION
In January 2005, the Partnership acquired 100% of the limited liability company member interests of Tunnel
Ridge, LLC for approximately $500,000 and the assumption of reclamation liabilities from ARH, a company
owned by management of the Partnership. Tunnel Ridge controls through a coal lease agreement with
Alliance Resource GP, LLC (the “Special GP”) approximately 9,400 acres of land located in Ohio County, West
Virginia and Washington County, Pennsylvania containing an estimated 70 million tons of high-sulfur coal in
the
Table of Contents
5
Pittsburgh No. 8 coal seam. Previously, in November 2004, the coal lease was amended to reduce the Tunnel
Ridge reserve area from 50,571 acres to 9,400 acres to reflect the original intent of the parties and to correct an
inadvertent mistake in the size of the leased reserve area. Under the terms of the coal lease, beginning on
January 1, 2005, Tunnel Ridge has paid and will continue to pay the Special GP an advance minimum royalty
of $3.0 million per year. The advance royalty payments are fully recoupable against earned royalties.
The acquisition described above was reviewed by the Board of Directors of Alliance Resource Management
GP, LLC (the “Managing GP”) and its Conflicts Committee. Based upon their reviews, it was determined that
this transaction reflected market-clearing terms and conditions. As a result, the Board of Directors of the
Partnership’s Managing GP and its Conflicts Committee approved the Tunnel Ridge acquisition as fair and
reasonable for the Partnership and its limited partners.
4. VERTICAL BELT FAILURE
On June 14, 2005, White County Coal, LLC’s Pattiki mine was temporarily idled following the failure of the
vertical conveyor belt system ( the “Vertical Belt Incident”) used in conveying raw coal out of the mine. White
County Coal surface personnel detected a failure of the vertical conveyor belt on June 14, 2005 and
immediately shut down operation of all underground conveyor belt systems. On July 20, 2005, White County
Coal’s efforts to repair the vertical belt system had progressed sufficiently to allow it to perform a full test of
the vertical belt system. After evaluating the test results, the Pattiki mine resumed initial production
operations on July 21, 2005. Production of raw coal has returned to levels that existed prior to the occurrence
of the Vertical Belt Incident. The majority of repairs to the vertical belt conveyor system and ancillary
equipment have been completed. The Partnership’s operating expenses were increased by $0.1 million and
$2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005, respectively, to reflect the estimated
direct expenses and costs attributable to the Vertical Belt Incident, which estimate included a $1.3 million
retirement of the damaged vertical belt equipment. The Partnership has not identified currently any significant
additional costs compared to the original cost estimates. The Partnership is conducting an analysis of all
possible alternatives to mitigate the losses arising from the Vertical Belt Incident. This analysis will include a
review of the Vertical Belt System Design, Supply, and Oversight of Installation Contract (“Installation
Contract”), dated December 7, 2000, between White County Coal, LLC and Lake Shore Mining, Inc.. Until such
analysis is completed, however, the Partnership can make no assurances of the amount or timing of
recoveries, if any. Concurrent with the renewal of the Partnership’s commercial property (including business
interruption) insurance policies concluded on October 31, 2005, White County Coal confirmed with the current
underwriters of the commercial property insurance coverage that it would not file a formal insurance claim for
losses arising from or in connection with the Vertical Belt Incident.
5. MINE FIRE INCIDENTS
MC Mining Mine Fire
On December 26, 2004, MC Mining, LLC’s Excel No. 3 mine was temporarily idled following the occurrence of
a mine fire (the “MC Mining Fire Incident”). The fire was discovered by mine personnel near the bottom of the
Excel No. 3 mine slope late in the evening of December 25, 2004. Under a firefighting plan developed by MC
Mining, in cooperation with mine emergency response teams from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Mine Safety
and Health Administration (“MSHA”) and Kentucky Office of Mine Safety and Licensing, the four portals at the
Excel No. 3 mine were temporarily capped to deprive the fire of oxygen. A series of boreholes was then drilled
into the mine from the surface, and nitrogen gas and foam were injected through the boreholes into the fire
area to further suppress the fire. As a result of these efforts, the mine atmosphere was rendered substantially
inert, or without oxygen, and the Excel No. 3 mine fire was effectively suppressed. MC Mining then began
construction of temporary and permanent barriers designed to completely isolate the mine fire area. Once the
construction of the permanent barriers was completed, MC Mining began efforts to repair and rehabilitate the
Excel No. 3 mine infrastructure. On February 21, 2005, the repair and rehabilitation efforts had progressed
sufficiently to allow initial resumption of production. Coal production has
Table of Contents

returned to near normal levels, but continues to be adversely impacted by inefficiencies attributable to or
associated with the MC Mining Fire Incident.
The Partnership maintains commercial property (including business interruption and extra expense)
insurance policies with various underwriters, which policies are renewed annually in October and provide for
self-retention and various applicable deductibles, including certain monetary and/or time element forms of
deductibles (collectively, the “2005 Deductibles”) and 10% co-insurance (“2005 Co-Insurance”). The
Partnership believes such insurance coverage will cover a substantial portion of the total cost of the
disruption to MC Mining’s operations. However, concurrent with the renewal of the Partnership’s commercial
property (including business interruption) insurance policies concluded on October 31, 2005, MC Mining
confirmed with the current underwriters of the commercial property insurance coverage that any negotiated
settlement of the losses arising from or in connection with the MC Mining Fire Incident would not exceed
$40.0 million (inclusive of co-insurance and deductible amounts). Until the claim is resolved ultimately,
through either the claim adjustment process, settlement, or litigation, with the applicable underwriters, the
Partnership can make no assurance of the amount or timing of recovery of insurance proceeds.
The Partnership made an initial estimate of certain costs primarily associated with activities relating to the
suppression of the fire and the initial resumption of operations. Operating expenses for the 2004 fourth
quarter were increased by $4.1 million to reflect an initial estimate of certain minimum costs attributable to
the MC Mining Fire Incident that are not reimbursable under the Partnership’s insurance policies due to the
application of the 2005 Deductibles and 2005 Co-Insurance.
Following the initial two submittals by the Partnership to a representative of the underwriters of its estimate of
the expenses and losses (including business interruption losses) incurred by MC Mining and other affiliates
arising from and in connection with the MC Mining Fire Incident (the “MC Mining Insurance Claim”), on
September 15, 2005, the Partnership filed a third partial proof of loss, with an update through July 31, 2005.
Partial payments of $4.2 million, $5.3 million, $1.5 million and $1.1 million were received from the
underwriters in June, August, October and November of 2005, respectively. The accounting for these partial
payments and future payments, if any, made to the Partnership by the underwriters will be subject to the
accounting methodology described below. Currently, the Partnership continues to evaluate its potential
insurance recoveries under the applicable insurance policies in the following areas:
1.
Fire Brigade/Extinguishing/Mine Recovery Expense; Expenses to Reduce Loss; Debris Removal Expenses;
Demolition and Increased Cost of Construction; Expediting Expenses; and Extra Expenses incurred as a
result of the fire – These expenses and other costs (e.g. professional fees) associated with extinguishing the
fire, reducing the overall loss, demolition of certain property and removal of debris, expediting the recovery
from the loss, and extra expenses that would not have been incurred by the Partnership but for the MC
Mining Fire Incident, are being expensed as incurred with related actual and/or estimated insurance
recoveries recorded as they are considered to be probable, up to the amount of the actual cost incurred.
2. Damage to MC Mining mine property – The net book value of property destroyed of $154,000, was written off
in the first quarter of 2005 with a corresponding amount recorded as an estimated insurance recovery, since
such recovery is considered probable. Any insurance proceeds from the claims relating to the MC Mining
mine property (other than amounts relating to the matters discussed in 1. above) that exceed the net book
value of such damaged property are expected to result in a gain. The anticipated gain will be recorded when
the MC Mining Insurance Claim is resolved and/or proceeds are received.
3. MC Mining mine business interruption losses – The Partnership has submitted to a representative of the
underwriters a business interruption loss analysis for the period of December 24, 2004 through July 31, 2005.
Expenses associated with business interruption losses are expensed as incurred, and estimated insurance
recoveries of such losses are
7
Table of Contents
recognized to the extent such recoveries are considered to be probable, up to the actual amount incurred.
Recoveries in excess of actual costs incurred will be recorded as gains when the MC Mining Insurance
Claim is resolved and/or proceeds are received.
Pursuant to the accounting methodology described above, the Partnership has recorded as an offset to
operating expenses, $9.2 million, $1.1 million and $0.3 million during the first, second, and third quarters of
2005, respectively, which amounts represent the current estimated insurance recovery of actual costs
incurred, net of the 2005 Deductibles and 2005 Co-Insurance. The Partnership continues to discuss the MC
Mining Insurance Claim and the determination of the total claim amount with representatives of the
underwriters. The MC Mining Insurance Claim will continue to be developed as additional information
becomes available and the Partnership has completed its assessment of the losses (including the
methodologies associated therewith) arising from or in connection with the MC Mining Fire Incident. At this
time, based on the magnitude and complexity of the MC Mining Insurance Claim, the Partnership is unable to
reasonably estimate the total amount of the MC Mining Insurance Claim as well as its exposure, if any, for
amounts not covered by its insurance program.
Dotiki Mine Fire
On February 11, 2004, Webster County Coal, LLC’s Dotiki mine was temporarily idled for a period of twenty-
seven calendar days following the occurrence of a mine fire that originated with a diesel supply tractor (the
“Dotiki Fire Incident”). As a result of the firefighting efforts of MSHA, the Kentucky Department of Mines and
Minerals, and Webster County Coal personnel, Dotiki successfully extinguished the fire and totally isolated
the affected area of the mine behind permanent barriers. Initial production resumed on March 8, 2004. For the
Dotiki Fire Incident, the Partnership had commercial property insurance that provided coverage for damage to
property destroyed, interruption of business operations, including profit recovery, and expenditures incurred
to minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations.
On September 10, 2004, the Partnership filed a final proof of loss with the applicable insurance underwriters
reflecting a settlement of all expenses, losses and claims incurred by Webster County Coal and other affiliates
arising from or in connection with the Dotiki Fire Incident in the aggregate amount of $27.0 million, inclusive
of a $1.0 million self-retention of initial loss, a $2.5 million deductible and 10% co-insurance.
At September 30, 2004, the Partnership (a) had recorded as an offset to operating expenses, $2.8 million and
$5.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004, respectively, and (b) in the third
quarter of 2004, recorded a combined net gain of approximately $15.2 million for damage to the property
destroyed, interruption of business operations (including profit recovery), and extra expenses incurred to
minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations.

(a) Basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004
have been restated to reflect application of Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) No. 03-6, Participating
Securities and the Two-Class Method Under FASB Statement No. 128. The dilutive effect of EITF No. 03-6 on
basic net income per limited partner unit was $0.22 and $0.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2005
and 2004, respectively, and $0.85 and $0.34 for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004,
respectively. The dilutive effect of EITF No. 03-6 on diluted net income per limited partner unit was $0.22 and
$0.15 for the three months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively and $0.84 and $0.34 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Notes 7 and 12 to the condensed financial
statements for further discussion of this matter.
The Partnership’s net income is allocated to the general partners and limited partners in accordance with their
respective partnership percentages, after giving effect to any priority income allocations, if any, to the
Partnership’s general partners, which are declared and paid following the close of each quarter. For purposes
of computing basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit, in periods when the Partnership’s
aggregate net income exceeds the aggregate distributions for such periods, an increased amount of net
income is allocated to the general partner for the additional pro forma priority income attributable to the
application of EITF No.03-6.
The Partnership’s Managing GP is entitled to receive incentive distributions if the amount the Partnership
distributes with respect to any quarter exceeds levels specified in the Second Amended and Restated
Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”). Under the quarterly incentive distribution
provisions of the Partnership Agreement, generally, the Managing GP is entitled to receive 15% of the amount
the Partnership distributes in excess of $0.275 per unit, 25% of the amount the Partnership distributes in
excess of $0.3125 per unit and 50% of the amount the Partnership distributes in excess of $0.375 per unit.

7. RESTRICTED UNIT-BASED COMPENSATION
The Partnership accounts for the compensation expense of the non-vested restricted units granted under the
Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) using the intrinsic value method prescribed in Accounting Principles
Board (“APB”) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and the related Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation Rights and
Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans. Compensation cost for the non-vested restricted units is
recorded on a pro-rata basis, as appropriate, given the cliff vesting nature of the grants, based upon the
current market value of the Partnership’s Common Units at the end of each period.
Consistent with the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”)
No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, and amendment of SFAS
No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the following table demonstrates that compensation cost
for the non-vested restricted units granted under the LTIP is the same under both the intrinsic value method
and the provisions of SFAS No. 123 (in thousands, except per unit data):
Net income, as reported
 
Add: compensation expenses related to Long-Term Incentive Plan

9. MINE DEVELOPMENT
The Partnership has mine development activities in progress at its Mountain View, Elk Creek and Pontiki
underground mines. Mine development costs are capitalized and represent costs that establish access to
mineral reserves and include costs associated with sinking or driving shafts and underground drifts,
permanent excavations, roads and tunnels.
10. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs. SFAS No. 151 is an amendment of
Accounting Research Bulletin (“ARB”) No. 43, Chapter 4, Paragraph 5 that deals with inventory pricing. SFAS
No. 151 clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs, and
spoilage. Under previous guidance, Chapter 4, Paragraph 5 of ARB No. 43, items such as idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and re-handling costs might be considered to be so abnormal, under
certain circumstances, as to require treatment as current period charges. SFAS No. 151 eliminates the
criterion of “so abnormal” and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges. Also, SFAS
No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. The Partnership is analyzing the requirements of SFAS No. 151 and believes that its adoption will not
have a significant impact on the Partnership’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes APB No. 25. Among other items,
SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of APB No. 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting, and requires
companies to recognize in their financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for
awards of equity instruments, based on the fair value of those awards on the grant date.
In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a rule that amends the implementation dates
for the Partnership’s adoption of SFAS No. 123R from the third quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006.
SFAS No. 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a “modified prospective” method,
or a “modified retrospective” method. Under the “modified prospective” method, compensation cost is
recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS
No. 123R, of all share-based payments granted after the effective date of the rule and based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R.
Under the “modified retrospective” method, the requirements are the same as under the “modified
prospective” method, but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on
pro forma
Table of Contents
11
disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123. The Partnership is in the process of finalizing its
evaluation of the appropriate transition method.
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Partnership currently accounts for unit-based payments to employees
using the APB No. 25 intrinsic method and related FASB Interpretation No. 28 based upon the current market
value of the Partnership’s Common Units at the end of each period. The Partnership has recorded
compensation expense of $5,728,000, $6,662,000, $9,565,000 and $15,385,000 for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
In March 2005, the FASB issued EITF No. 04-6 Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry and
concluded that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs
that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are
incurred. EITF No. 04-6 does not address the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the pre-
production phase of a mine. EITF No. 04-6 is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005 with early adoption permitted. The effect of initially applying this consensus would be
accounted for in a manner similar to a cumulative effect adjustment. Since the Partnership has historically
adhered to the accounting principles similar to EITF No. 04-6 in accounting for stripping costs incurred at the
Partnership’s surface operation, the Partnership does not believe that adoption of EITF No. 04-6, effective
January 1, 2006, will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
On October 23, 2005, the Partnership exercised its option to lease and/or sublease certain reserves from an
affiliate, SGP Land, LLC, a subsidiary of ARH, which is a company owned by management, which reserves are
contiguous to the Partnership’s Hopkins County Coal, LLC mining complex. Upon exercise of the option
agreement, Hopkins County Coal entered into a Coal Lease and Sublease Agreement as well as a Royalty
Agreement (collectively, the “Coal Lease Agreements”). The terms of the Coal Lease Agreements are through
December 2015, with the right to extend the term for successive one-year periods for as long as the
Partnership is mining within the coal field, as such term is defined in the Coal Lease Agreements.
The Coal Lease Agreements provide for five annual minimum royalty payments of $684,000 commencing in
January 2006. The annual minimum royalty payments, consistent with the option agreement, and cumulative
option fees of $3.4 million previously paid by the Partnership are fully recoupable against future tonnage
royalty payments. Under the terms of the Coal Lease Agreements, Hopkins County Coal will also reimburse
SGP Land for SGP Land’s base lease obligations.
On October 25, 2005, the Partnership’s Compensation Committee determined that the vesting requirement for
the 2003 LTIP grants of 278,710 restricted units (net of 3,700 restricted unit forfeitures) had been satisfied as of
September 30, 2005. As a result of this vesting, on November 1, 2005 the Partnership issued 165,426 Common
Units to LTIP participants. The remaining units were settled in cash primarily to satisfy individual tax
obligations of the LTIP participants.
On October 26, 2005, the Partnership declared a quarterly distribution for the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2005, of $0.4125 per unit, totaling approximately $17.6 million (which includes the Managing
GP’s incentive distributions), on all of its Common Units outstanding, payable on November 14, 2005, to all
unitholders of record as of November 4, 2005.
On October 31, 2005, the Partnership completed its annual property and casualty insurance renewal with the
various insurance coverages effective as of October 1, 2005. Available capacity for underwriting property
insurance has tightened as a result of recent events including insurance carrier losses associated with U.S.
gulf coast hurricanes, poor loss claims history in the underground coal mining industry and our recent loss
history (i.e., Vertical Belt Incident, MC Mining Fire Incident, and Dotiki Fire Incident). As a result, the
Partnership will retain a participating interest along with our insurance carriers at an average rate of
approximately 10% in the $75 million commercial property program. The aggregate maximum limit in the
12
Table of Contents
commercial property program is $75 million per occurrence of which we would be responsible for a
maximum amount of $7.75 million for each occurrence, excluding a $1.5 million deductible for property
damage and a 45-day waiting period for business interruption. As a result of the renewal for comparable
levels of commercial property coverage, premiums for the property insurance program increased by
approximately 130%. The Partnership can make no assurances that it will not experience significant insurance
claims in the future, which as a result of the participation in the commercial property program, could have a
material adverse effect on the business, financial conditions, results of operations and ability to purchase
property insurance in the future.
12. RESTATEMENTS
Net Income Per Limited Partner Unit
Subsequent to the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2004, the Partnership determined that in periods in which aggregate net income exceeds
the Partnership’s aggregate distributions, the Partnership is required to present earnings per unit as if all
earnings for the period were distributed, regardless of the pro forma nature of the allocation or whether the
earnings would actually have been distributed during the period. This requirement reflects a consensus
reached by the FASB in EITF No. 03-6. EITF No. 03-6 addresses the computation of earnings per share by
entities that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate
in dividends and earnings of the entity when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock. As a result,
basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2004
have been restated to reflect the pro forma distribution assumption required by EITF No. 03-6.
EITF No. 03-6 does not impact the Partnership’s overall net income or other financial results; however, for
periods in which aggregate net income exceeds the Partnership’s aggregate distributions for such period, it
will have the impact of reducing the earnings per limited partner unit. This result occurs as a larger portion of
the Partnership’s aggregate earnings, as if distributed, is allocated to the incentive distribution rights held by
the Managing GP, even though the Partnership makes cash distributions on the basis of cash available for
distribution, not earnings, in any given accounting period. In accounting periods in which aggregate net
income does not exceed the Partnership’s aggregate distributions for such period, EITF No. 03-6 does not
have any impact on the Partnership’s earnings per unit calculation.
Basic and diluted net income per limited partner unit is calculated by dividing net income after deducting the
amount allocated to the general partners’ interests, (which includes the Managing GP’s actual priority
allocations paid and the pro forma priority allocations required under EITF No. 03-6) by the weighted average
number of outstanding limited partner units during the period. Partnership net income is first allocated to the
Managing GP based on the amount of actual and pro forma priority allocations. The remainder is then
allocated between the limited partners and the general partners based on percentage ownership in the
Partnership.

Common Unit-Based Compensation
Subsequent to the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2004, the Partnership determined that the Partnership’s pro forma limited partner unit-
based compensation disclosure was incorrect. The original disclosure assumed compensation expense for
the non-vested Common Units would be calculated utilizing a fair value model. The amounts have been
restated to correctly calculate such common unit based compensation for non-vested Common Units based
on an intrinsic value model. The correction of the error affected the pro forma disclosure, which also
considers the impact of EITF No. 03-6 as follows:
As Previously Reported:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS
The financial statements in this Form 10-Q reflect restatements of basic and diluted net income per limited
partner unit and the pro forma disclosure related to common unit-based compensation for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2004.
We previously computed net income per limited partner unit without applying certain provisions of Emerging
Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-6, Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB
Statement No. 123. Our financial statements have been restated to adjust the historical presentation of net
income per limited partner unit. The restatement has no impact on previously reported income before income
taxes, net income, limited partners’ interest in net income, the condensed consolidated balance sheets or the
condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.
We previously disclosed pro forma information assuming compensation expense for the non-vested restricted
units granted would be different under our accounting method (the intrinsic method) and the provisions of
SFAS No. 123. Our previous disclosure has been restated since compensation expense for the non-vested
restricted units granted is the same under the intrinsic method and the provisions of SFAS No. 123.
For additional information regarding the restatements, see Notes 6, 7 and 12 to the Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements included in “Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited)”.
SUMMARY
We are a diversified producer and marketer of coal to major United States utilities and industrial users. We
began mining operations in 1971 and, since then, have grown through acquisitions and internal development
to become what we believe to be the fifth largest coal producer in the eastern United States. We
Table of Contents
15
currently operate eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West
Virginia and one surface operation in Kentucky.
We reported quarterly net income for the three months ended September 30, 2005 (the 2005 Quarter) of $34.5
million, an increase of 36.2% over the three months ended September 30, 2004 (the 2004 Quarter). Results for
the 2004 Quarter included the following unusual items: (1) a benefit of $18.0 million due to the final settlement
of insurance claims attributable to the Dotiki Mine Fire described below and (2) $3.2 million of expense due to
the buy-out of several coal sales contracts. There were no unusual items included in the results for the 2005
Quarter. During the 2005 Quarter, we continued to benefit from higher average sales prices reflecting the
continuation of favorable coal markets, which benefit was partially offset by increased production costs.
We have contractual commitments for substantially all of our remaining estimated 2005 production. We are
currently estimating 2006 production in the range of 24.0 to 24.5 million tons, of which approximately 69% is
committed under contracts with firm pricing, 19% is committed under contracts subject to market price
negotiations and 12% is anticipated to be sold under future coal supply agreements.
In response to demand in the Illinois Basin, we previously entered into a coal supply arrangement with a
third-party supplier. Our purchase tonnage requirements under this arrangement increased to 40,000 tons per
month beginning January 1, 2005 and continues through June 30, 2007.

Coal sales. Coal sales increased 29.6% to $189.6 million for the 2005 Quarter from $146.4 million for the 2004
Quarter. The increase of $43.2 million was a result of increased sales volumes and higher coal sales prices
reflecting continued strength in the coal markets. Tons sold increased 9.4% to 5.6 million tons for the 2005
Quarter from 5.1 million tons for the 2004 Quarter. Tons produced increased 9.5% to 5.4 million tons for the
2005 Quarter from 4.9 million for the 2004 Quarter.
Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 19.3% to $129.9 million for the 2005 Quarter from $108.9
million for the 2004 Quarter. The increase of $21.0 million resulted from higher operating expenses due to
increased coal sales volumes of 478,000 tons, higher labor and benefits costs, increased materials and supply
costs (particularly steel, power and fuel), maintenance and repair expenses and sales-related expenses.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses were comparable for the 2005 and 2004
Quarters at $12.8 million and $12.7 million, respectively.
Other sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues are principally comprised of service
revenue to coal synfuel production facilities and Mt. Vernon Transfer Terminal transloading fees. Other sales
and operating revenues increased 53.6% to $8.3 million for the 2005 Quarter from $5.4 million for the 2004
Quarter. The increase of $2.9 million was primarily attributable to rental and service fees associated with a
new third-party coal synfuel facility at the Gibson County Coal Operation, which began producing synfuel in
May 2005, in addition to increased volumes at a third-party coal synfuel facility at Warrior.

Table of Contents
Outside purchases. The increase in outside purchases to $3.5 million for the 2005 Quarter from $2.4 million in
the 2004 Quarter was primarily attributable to the previously described coal supply arrangement with a third-
party supplier, which also contributed to additional coal sales volumes at our Illinois Basin operations.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was comparable
at $13.8 million and $13.6 million for the 2005 and 2004 Quarters, respectively.
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased to $2.8 million for the 2005 Quarter from $3.7 million for the 2004
Quarter. The decrease of $0.9 million primarily resulted from increased interest income earned on marketable
securities which is netted against interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. We
had no borrowings under the credit facility during the 2005 or 2004 Quarters.
Transportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses increased to $9.1 million for
the 2005 Quarter compared to $6.5 million for the 2004 Quarter. The increase of $2.6 million was primarily
attributable to higher coal sales volumes for which we arrange transportation and increased shipments to
customers with higher transportation costs.
Income before income taxes. Income before income taxes increased to $35.2 million for the 2005 Quarter from
$25.9 million for the 2004 Quarter. The increase of $9.3 million was primarily attributable to increased sales
volumes and higher coal prices partially offset by higher operating expenses. Results for the 2004 Quarter
included the following unusual items: (1) a benefit of $18.0 million due to the final settlement of insurance
claims attributable to the Dotiki Mine Fire described below and (2) $3.2 million of expense due to the buy-out
of several coal sales contracts. There were no unusual items included in the results for the 2005 Quarter.
Income tax expense. Income tax expense was comparable for the 2005 and 2004 Quarters at $0.7 million and
$0.5 million, respectively.
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2005 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2004
We reported net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2005 (the 2005 Period) of $114.4 million, an
increase of 72.2% over the nine months ended September 30, 2004 (the 2004 Period). These results were
achieved despite lost production, continuing fixed expenses, and other expenses incurred as a result of the
MC Mining Fire and Pattiki Vertical Belt Incidents described below in the 2005 Period. The 2004 Period
includes the impact of lost production, continuing fixed expenses and other expenses incurred as a result of
the Dotiki Fire Incident, offset by the final settlement of an insurance claim with our insurance underwriters
relating to the Dotiki Fire Incident described below. We continue to benefit from higher average sales prices
reflecting the continuation of favorable coal markets partially offset by increased production costs.

Coal sales. Coal sales increased 27.3% to $560.6 million for the 2005 Period from $440.2 million for the 2004
Period. The increase of $120.4 million reflects increased sales volumes and higher coal sales prices. Tons
sold increased 10.1% to 17.0 million tons for the 2005 Period from 15.4 million tons in the 2004. Tons
produced increased 10.1% to 16.7 million tons for the 2005 Period from 15.2 million tons in the 2004 Period.

17
Operating Expenses. Operating expenses increased 19.4% to $377.4 million for the 2005 Period from $316.1
million for the 2004 Period. The increase of $61.3 million primarily resulted from an increase in operating
expenses associated with additional coal sales of 1.6 million tons, higher labor and benefits costs, increased
materials and supply costs (particularly steel, power and fuel), maintenance and repair expenses, and sales-
related expenses. The 2005 Period was further impacted by $2.9 million of expenses related to the Pattiki
Vertical Belt Incident along with expenses associated with the MC Mining Fire Incident, both of which are
described below. The 2004 Period includes a $3.2 million buy-out expense of several coal contracts that
allowed us to take advantage of higher spot coal prices in 2005 and out-of-pocket expenses related to the
Dotiki Fire not offset by proceeds from the final settlement with our insurance underwriters. See Dotiki Fire
Incident described below.
General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased to $29.1 million for the 2005
Period compared to $34.3 million for the 2004 Period. The decrease of $5.2 million primarily resulted from
lower incentive compensation expense due to a reduction in the number of restricted units outstanding due to
the vesting in November 2004 of the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) units for grant years 2000 to 2002.
Other sales and operating revenues. Other sales and operating revenues are principally comprised of service
revenue to coal synfuel production facilities and Mt. Vernon Transfer Terminal transloading fees. Other sales
and operating revenues increased 31.1% to $23.7 million for the 2005 Period from $18.1 million for the 2004
Period. The increase of $5.6 million was primarily attributable to rental and service fees associated with a new
third-party coal synfuel facility at the Gibson County Coal operation, which began producing synfuel in May
2005, in addition to increased volumes at a third-party coal synfuel facility at Warrior in addition to an
increase in transloading fees associated with the Mt. Vernon Transfer Terminal.
Outside purchases. The increase in outside purchases of $6.7 million to $11.0 million for the 2005 Period
compared to $4.3 million for the 2004 Period was primarily attributable to the previously described coal
supply arrangement with a third-party supplier, which also contributed to additional coal sales volumes at our
Illinois Basin operations.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was comparable
for the 2005 and 2004 Quarters at $40.8 million and $39.8 million, respectively.
Interest expense. Interest expense decreased to $9.7 million for the 2005 Period from $11.4 million for the 2004
Period. The decrease of $1.7 million resulted from increased interest income earned on increased marketable
securities which is netted against interest expense in the condensed consolidated statements of income. We
had no borrowings under the credit facility during the 2005 or 2004 Periods.
Transportation revenues and expenses. Transportation revenues and expenses increased to $27.1 million for
the 2005 Period from $20.4 million for the 2004 Period. The increase of $6.7 million was attributable primarily
to higher sales volumes for which we arrange transportation and increased shipments to customers with
higher transportation costs.
Income before income taxes. Income before income taxes increased to $116.6 million for the 2005 Period from
$68.4 million for the 2004 Period. The increase of $48.2 million is primarily attributable to increased sales
volumes, higher coal prices and reduced general and administrative expenses, primarily reflecting lower
incentive compensation expense, partially offset by higher operating expenses and expenses related to the
Pattiki Vertical Belt Incident and MC Mining Fire Incident described below. The 2004 Period includes a $3.2
million buy-out expense of several coal contracts which allowed us to take advantage of higher spot coal
prices in 2005 in addition to the impact of lost production, continuing fixed expenses and other expenses
incurred as a result of the Dotiki Fire Incident offset by the final settlement of an insurance claim with our
insurance underwriters relating to the Dotiki Fire Incident described below.

Income tax expense. Income tax expense was comparable at $2.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
On October 25, 2005, our compensation committee determined that the vesting requirements for the 2003 LTIP
grants of 278,710 restricted units (net of 3,700 restricted unit forfeitures) had been satisfied as of
September 30, 2005. As a result of this vesting, on November 1, 2005, we issued 165,426 common units to
LTIP participants. The remaining units were settled in cash primarily to satisfy individual tax obligations of
the LTIP participants.
Unit Split
On September 15, 2005, we completed a two-for-one split of our common units, whereby holders of record at
the close of business on September 2, 2005 received one additional common unit for each common unit
owned on that date. This unit split resulted in the issuance of 18,130,440 common units.
Pattiki Vertical Belt Incident
On June 14, 2005, our White County Coal, LLC’s Pattiki mine was temporarily idled following the failure of the
vertical conveyor belt system (the Vertical Belt Incident) used in conveying raw coal out of the mine. White
County Coal surface personnel detected a failure of the vertical conveyor belt on June 14, 2005 and
immediately shut down operation of all underground conveyor belt systems. On July 20, 2005, White County
Coal’s efforts to repair the vertical belt system had progressed sufficiently to allow it to perform a full test of
the vertical belt system. After evaluating the test results, the Pattiki mine resumed initial production
operations on July 21, 2005. Production of raw coal has returned to levels that existed prior to the occurrence
of the Vertical Belt Incident. The majority of repairs to the vertical belt conveyor system and ancillary
equipment have been completed. Our operating expenses were increased by $0.1 million and $2.9 million in
the 2005 Quarter and 2005 Period, respectively, to reflect the estimated direct expenses and costs attributable
to the Vertical Belt Incident, which estimate included a $1.3 million retirement of the damaged vertical belt
equipment. We have not identified currently any significant additional costs compared to the original cost
estimates. We are conducting an analysis of all possible alternatives to mitigate the losses arising from the
Vertical Belt Incident. This analysis will include a review of the Vertical Belt System Design, Supply, and
Oversight of Installation Contract (Installation Contract), dated December 7, 2000, between White County Coal,
LLC and Lake Shore Mining, Inc. Until such analysis is completed, however, we can make no assurances of
the amount or timing of recoveries, if any. Concurrent with the renewal of our commercial property (including
business interruption) insurance policies concluded on October 31, 2005, White County Coal confirmed with
the current underwriters of the commercial property insurance coverage that it would not file a formal
insurance claim for losses arising from or in connection with the Vertical Belt Incident.
MC Mining Mine Fire
On December 26, 2004, our MC Mining, LLC’s Excel No. 3 mine was temporarily idled following the
occurrence of a mine fire (the MC Mining Fire Incident). The fire was discovered by mine personnel near the
bottom of the Excel No. 3 mine slope late in the evening of December 25, 2004. Under a firefighting plan
developed by MC Mining, in cooperation with mine emergency response teams from the U.S. Department of
Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and Kentucky Office of Mine Safety and Licensing, the
four portals at the Excel No. 3 mine were temporarily capped to deprive the fire of oxygen. A series of
boreholes was then drilled into the mine from the surface, and nitrogen gas and foam were injected through
the boreholes into the fire area to further suppress the fire. As a result of these efforts, the mine atmosphere
was rendered substantially inert, or without oxygen, and the Excel No. 3 mine fire was effectively suppressed.
MC Mining then began construction of temporary and permanent barriers designed to completely isolate the
mine fire area. Once the construction of the permanent barriers was completed, MC Mining began efforts to
repair and rehabilitate the Excel No. 3 mine infrastructure. On February 21, 2005, the repair and rehabilitation
efforts
Table of Contents

had progressed sufficiently to allow initial resumption of production. Coal production has returned to near
normal levels, but continues to be adversely impacted by inefficiencies attributable to or associated with the
MC Mining Fire Incident.
We maintain commercial property (including business interruption and extra expense) insurance policies with
various underwriters, which policies are renewed annually in October and provide for self-retention and
various applicable deductibles, including certain monetary and/or time element forms of deductibles
(collectively, the 2005 Deductibles) and 10% co-insurance (2005 Co-Insurance). We believe such insurance
coverage will cover a substantial portion of the total cost of the disruption to MC Mining’s operations.
However, concurrent with the renewal of our commercial property (including business interruption) insurance
policies concluded on October 31, 2005, MC Mining confirmed with the current underwriters of the
commercial property insurance coverage that any negotiated settlement of the losses arising from or in
connection with the MC Mining Fire Incident would not exceed $40.0 million (inclusive of co-insurance and
deductible amounts). Until the claim is resolved ultimately, through either the claim adjustment process,
settlement, or litigation, with the applicable underwriters, we can make no assurance of the amount or timing
of recovery of insurance proceeds.
We made an initial estimate of certain costs primarily associated with activities relating to the suppression of
the fire and the initial resumption of operations. Operating expenses for the 2004 fourth quarter were
increased by $4.1 million to reflect an initial estimate of certain minimum costs attributable to the MC Mining
Fire Incident that are not reimbursable under our insurance policies due to the application of the 2005
Deductibles and 2005 Co-Insurance.
Following the initial two submittals by us to the a representative of the underwriters of our estimate of the
expenses and losses (including business interruption losses) incurred by MC Mining and other affiliates
arising from or in connection with the MC Mining Fire Incident (MC Mining Insurance Claim), on
September 15, 2005, we filed a third partial proof of loss, with an update through July 31 2005. Partial
payments of $4.2 million, $5.3 million, $1.5 and $1.1 million were received from the underwriters in June,
August, October and November 2005. The accounting for these partial payments and future payments, if any,
made to us by the underwriters will be subject to the accounting methodology described below. Currently, we
continue to evaluate our potential insurance recoveries under the applicable insurance policies in the
following areas:
1.
Fire Brigade/Extinguishing/Mine Recovery Expense; Expenses to Reduce Loss; Debris Removal Expenses;
Demolition and Increased Cost of Construction; Expediting Expenses; and Extra Expenses incurred as a
result of the fire - These expenses and other costs (e.g. professional fees) associated with extinguishing the
fire, reducing the overall loss, demolition of certain property and removal of debris, expediting the recovery
from the loss, and extra expenses that would not have been incurred by us, but for the MC Mining Fire
Incident, are being expensed as incurred with related actual and/or estimated insurance recoveries recorded
as they are considered to be probable, up to the amount of the actual cost incurred.
2. Damage to MC Mining mine property - The net book value of property destroyed of $154,000, was written off
in the first quarter of 2005 with a corresponding amount recorded as an estimated insurance recovery, since
such recovery is considered probable. Any insurance proceeds from the claims relating to the MC Mining
mine property (other than amounts relating to the matters discussed in 1. above) that exceed the net book
value of such damaged property are expected to result in a gain. The anticipated gain will be recorded when
the MC Mining Insurance Claim is resolved and/or proceeds are received.
3. MC Mining mine business interruption losses - We have submitted to a representative of the underwriters a
business interruption loss analysis for the period of December 24, 2004 through July 31, 2005. Expenses
associated with business interruption losses are expensed as incurred, and estimated insurance recoveries
of such losses are recognized to the extent such recoveries are considered to be probable, up to the actual
amount incurred. Recoveries in
20
Table of Contents
excess of actual costs incurred will be recorded as gains when the MC Mining Insurance Claim is resolved
excess of actual costs incurred will be recorded as gains when the MC Mining Insurance Claim is resolved
and/or proceeds are received.
Pursuant to the accounting methodology described above, we have recorded as an offset to operating
expenses, $9.2 million, $1.1 million, and $0.3 million during the first, second, and third quarters of 2005,
respectively, which amounts represent the current estimated insurance recovery of actual costs incurred, net
of the 2005 Deductibles and 2005 Co-Insurance. We continue to discuss the MC Mining Insurance Claim and
the determination of the total claim amount with representatives of the underwriters. The MC Mining Insurance
Claim will continue to be developed as additional information becomes available and we have completed our
assessment of the losses (including the methodologies associated therewith) arising from or in connection
with the MC Mining Fire Incident. At this time, based on the magnitude and complexity of the MC Mining
Insurance Claim, we are unable to reasonably estimate the total amount of the MC Mining Insurance Claim as
well as its exposure, if any, for amounts not covered by our insurance program.
Dotiki Mine Fire
On February 11, 2004, our Webster County Coal, LLC’s Dotiki mine was temporarily idled for a period of
twenty-seven calendar days following the occurrence of a mine fire that originated with a diesel supply tractor
(the Dotiki Fire Incident). As a result of the firefighting efforts of MSHA, the Kentucky Department of Mines and
Minerals, and Webster County Coal personnel, Dotiki successfully extinguished the fire and totally isolated
the affected area of the mine behind permanent barriers. Initial production resumed on March 8, 2004. For the
Dotiki Fire Incident, we had commercial property insurance that provided coverage for damage to property
destroyed, interruption of business operations, including profit recovery, and expenditures incurred to
minimize the period and total cost of disruption to operations.
On September 10, 2004, we filed a third and final proof of loss with the applicable insurance underwriters
reflecting a settlement of all expenses, losses and claims incurred by Webster County Coal and other affiliates
arising from or in connection with the Dotiki Fire Incident in the aggregate amount of $27.0 million, inclusive
of a $1.0 million self-retention of initial loss, a $2.5 million deductible and 10% co-insurance.
At September 30, 2004, we (a) had recorded as an offset to operating expenses, $2.8 million and $5.9 million
during the 2004 Quarter and 2004 Period, respectively, and (b) in the 2004 Quarter, recorded a combined net
gain of approximately $15.2 million for damage to the property destroyed, interruption of business operations
(including profit recovery), and extra expenses incurred to minimize the period and total cost of disruption to
operations.
Coal Supply Agreements
Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc.
On October 25, 2005, Seminole Electric Cooperative, Inc. (Seminole) and Webster County Coal, LLC
(successor-in-interest to Webster County Coal Corporation), White County Coal, LLC (successor-in-interest to
White County Coal Corporation), and Alliance Coal, LLC, as successor-in-interest to MAPCO Coal Inc. and
agent for Webster County Coal, LLC and White County Coal, LLC (Webster County Coal, LLC, White County
Coal, LLC and Alliance Coal, LLC are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Seller”) entered into an
agreement (Amendment No. 4 to the Coal Supply Agreement) to amend their Restated and Amended Coal
Supply Agreement between Seminole, Webster County Coal Corporation and White County Coal Corporation,
dated February 1, 1986, as amended (Coal Supply Agreement). The Coal Supply Agreement requires the Seller
to sell to Seminole, and Seminole to purchase, coal from the Seller’s mines for use in Seminole’s Plant Units
1 and 2 located in the State of Florida. The Coal Supply Agreement has a term beginning February 1, 1986 and
continuing through December 31, 2010.
Table of Contents
21
Amendment No. 4 to the Coal Supply Agreement amends certain provisions of the above-referenced Coal
Supply Agreement to:
(1) Effective September 1, 2005, terminate Amendment No. 3, dated January 1, 2003, to the Coal Supply
Agreement (Amendment No. 3);
(2) confirm, acknowledge and provide that the Coal Supply Agreement and Amendment No. 1, dated May 10,
1996, together contain the entire agreement between the parties as to coal produced, sold and delivered
pursuant to the Coal Supply Agreement and provide that there are no representations, undertakings, or
agreements, oral or written, which are not included in the Coal Supply Agreement and Amendment No. 1;
and
(3) confirm and acknowledge, to the best of Seller’s and Seminole’s respective knowledge and belief, that the
Guaranty, signed by MAPCO Inc., now a subsidiary of The Williams Companies, remains in full force and
effect.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Cash Flows
Cash provided by operating activities was $151.6 million for the 2005 Period compared to $125.9 million for
the 2004 Period. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to an
increase in net income partially offset by an increase in total working capital. Total working capital changes
include a sales driven increase in trade receivables, increased inventories due to increased production and a
decrease in the total accrued liability for the LTIP included in the current and long-term liability due to
affiliates resulting from the vesting in November 2004 of the 2000 to 2002 LTIP grants.
Net cash used in investing activities was $78.9 million for the 2005 Period compared to $29.1 million for the
2004 Period. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in capital expenditures associated with the
addition of a continuous mining unit at our Warrior mining complex and costs associated with the
development at the Elk Creek and Mountain View mines along with construction to transition the Pontiki mine
into a new coal seam. We are currently estimating total capital expenditures in 2005 to be approximately
$119.9 million. We expect to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and marketable securities on
hand, future cash generated from operations and/or borrowings available under the revolving credit facility.
The increase was further impacted by proceeds from marketable securities, net of purchases of marketable
securities, which occurred during the 2004 Period.
Net cash used in financing activities was $65.1 million for the 2005 Period compared to $34.2 million for the
2004 Period. The increase is attributable to a scheduled $18.0 million debt payment in August 2005 in addition
to increased distributions to partners in the 2005 Period.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures increased to $79.0 million in the 2005 Period from $40.3 million in the 2004 Period. See
discussion of “Cash Flows” above concerning the increase in capital expenditures.
Insurance
On October 31, 2005, we completed our annual property and casualty insurance renewal, with the various
insurance coverages effective as of October 1, 2005. Available capacity for underwriting property insurance
has tightened as a result of recent events including insurance carrier losses associated with U.S. gulf coast
hurricanes, poor loss claims history in the underground coal mining industry and our recent loss history (i.e.,
Vertical Belt Incident, MC Mining Fire Incident, and Dotiki Fire Incident described above). As a result, we will
retain a participating interest along with our insurance carries at an average rate of approximately 10% in our
$75 million commercial property program. The aggregate maximum limit in the commercial property program
is $75 million per occurrence of which we would be responsible for a maximum amount of $7.75 million for
each occurrence, excluding a $1.5 million deductible for property damage and a 45-day waiting

period for business interruption. As a result of the renewal for comparable levels of commercial property
coverage, premiums for our property insurance program increased by approximately 130%. We can make no
assurances that we will not experience significant insurance claims in the future, which as a result of our
participation in the commercial property program, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, results of operations and ability to purchase property insurance in the future.
Notes Offering and Credit Facility
Alliance Resource Operating Partners, L.P., our intermediate partnership, has $162 million principal amount
of 8.31% senior notes due August 20, 2014, payable in nine remaining equal annual installments of $18
million with interest payable semiannually (the Senior Notes). On August 22, 2003, our intermediate
partnership completed an $85 million revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility), which expires
September 30, 2006. The interest rate on the Credit Facility is based on either (i) the London Interbank Offered
Rate or (ii) the “Base Rate”, which is equal to the greater of the JPMorgan Chase Prime Rate or the Federal
Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, plus, in either case, an applicable margin. We incurred certain costs totaling $1.2
million associated with the Credit Facility. These costs have been deferred and are being amortized as a
component of interest expense over the term of the Credit Facility. In March 2005, our intermediate
partnership entered into Amendment No. 1 to our credit facility to increase the maximum capital expenditures
from $50,600,000 and $50,200,000 for the years ending December 31, 2005 and 2006, respectively, to
$125,000,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2006. We had no borrowings outstanding
under the Credit Facility at September 30, 2005. Letters of credit can be issued under the Credit Facility not to
exceed $30 million. Outstanding letters of credit reduce amounts available under the Credit Facility. At
September 30, 2005, we had letters of credit of $9.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility.
The Senior Notes and Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of the subsidiaries of our intermediate partnership.
The Senior Notes and Credit Facility contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants, including
restrictions on the amount of distributions by our intermediate partnership and the incurrence of other debt
exceeding $35 million. The Senior Notes restrictions on distributions are consistent with the Partnership
Agreement and the Credit Facility limit borrowings to fund distributions to $25,000,000. We were in
compliance with the covenants of both the Credit Facility and Senior Notes at September 30, 2005.
We have previously entered into and have maintained specific agreements with two banks to provide
additional letters of credit in an aggregate amount of $25.9 million to maintain surety bonds to secure our
obligations for reclamation liabilities and workers’ compensation benefits. At September 30, 2005, we had
$25.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under these agreements. Our special general partner guarantees
these outstanding letters of credit.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In January 2005, we acquired Tunnel Ridge, LLC from an affiliate, Alliance Resource Holdings, LLC, for
approximately $500,000 and the assumption of reclamation liabilities. The acquisition was reviewed by the
board of directors of our managing general partner and its conflicts committee. Based upon their reviews, it
was determined that this transaction reflected market-clearing terms and conditions. As a result, the board of
directors of our managing general partner and its conflicts committee approved the Tunnel Ridge acquisition
as fair and reasonable to us and our limited partners. Please see “Item 1, Financial Statements (Unaudited) –
Note 3. Tunnel Ridge Acquisitions.”
In October 2005, we exercised our option to lease and/or sublease certain reserves from an affiliate, SGP
Land, LLC, a subsidiary of ARH, which is a company owned by management, which reserves are contiguous
to our Hopkins County Coal, LLC mining complex. Upon exercise of the option agreement, Hopkins County
Coal entered into a Coal Lease and Sublease Agreement as well as a Royalty Agreement (collectively, the Coal
Lease Agreements). The terms of the Coal Lease Agreements are through December 2015, with the right to
extend the term for successive one-year periods for as long as we are mining within the coal field, as such
term is defined in the Coal Lease Agreements.
Table of Contents
23
The Coal Lease Agreements provide for five annual minimum royalty payments of $684,000 commencing in
January 2006. The annual minimum royalty payments, consistent with the option agreement and cumulative
option fees of $3.4 million previously paid by us are fully recoupable against future tonnage royalty payments.
Under the terms of the Coal Lease Agreements, Hopkins County Coal will also reimburse SGP Land for SGP
Land’s base lease.
We have continuing related party transactions with our managing general partner and our special general
partner, including our special general partner’s affiliates. These related party transactions relate principally to
the provision of administrative services by our managing general partner, mineral and equipment leases with
our special general partner and its affiliates, and guarantees from our special general partner for letters of
credit.
Please read our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004, “Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Related Party Transactions for
additional information concerning the related party transactions described above.
RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
In November 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs. SFAS No. 151 is an amendment of Accounting
Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 43, Chapter 4, Paragraph 5 that deals with inventory pricing. SFAS No. 151
clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expenses, freight, handling costs, and spoilage.
Under previous guidance, Chapter 4, Paragraph 5 of ARB No. 43, items such as idle facility expense,
excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs might be considered to be so abnormal, under
certain circumstances, as to require treatment as current period charges. SFAS No. 151 eliminates the
criterion of “so abnormal” and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges. Also, SFAS
No. 151 requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the
normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005. We are currently analyzing the requirements of SFAS No. 151 and believe that its adoption will not have
a significant impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share-Based Payment. SFAS No. 123R is a revision of
SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, and supersedes Accounting Principles Board
(APB) No. 25. Among other items, SFAS No. 123R eliminates the use of APB No. 25 and the intrinsic value
method of accounting, and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee
services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments, based on fair value of those awards on the
grant date.
In April 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued a rule that amends the implementation dates
for the Partnership’s adoption of SFAS No. 123R from the third quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2006.
SFAS No. 123R permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a “modified prospective” method,
or a “modified retrospective” method. Under the “modified prospective” method, compensation cost is
recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS
No. 123R for all share-based payments granted after the effective date of the rule and based on the
requirements of SFAS No. 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No. 123R.
Under the “modified retrospective” method, the requirements are the same as under the “modified
prospective” method, but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on
pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS No. 123. We are in the process of finalizing our
evaluation of the appropriate transition method.
As permitted by SFAS No. 123, we currently account for unit-based payments to employees using the APB
No. 25 intrinsic method and related FASB Interpretation No. 28 based upon the current market value of our
common units at the end of each period. We have recorded compensation expense of $5,728,000,
Table of Contents
24
$6,662,000, $9,565,000 and $15,385,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2005 and 2004,
respectively.
In March 2005, the FASB issued EITF No. 04-6 Accounting for Stripping Costs in the Mining Industry and
concluded that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of a mine are variable production costs
that should be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are
incurred. EITF No. 04-6 does not address the accounting for stripping costs incurred during the pre-
production phase of a mine. EITF No. 04-6 is effective for the first reporting period in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2005, with early adoption permitted. The effect of initially applying this consensus would
be accounted for in a manner similar to a cumulative-effect adjustment. Since we have historically adhered to
the accounting principles similar to EITF No. 04-6 in accounting for stripping costs incurred at our surface
operation, we do not believe that adoption of EITF No. 04-6, effective January 1, 2006, will have a material
impact on our consolidated financial statements.
RISK FACTORS
There were no significant changes in our risk factors as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the
year ended December 31, 2004 except as follows:
•  Non-conventional source fuel tax credits are subject to a pro-rata phase-out or reduction based on the annual
average wellhead price per barrel for all domestic crude oil (the reference price) as determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury. The reference price is not subject to regulation by the United States Government.
The reference price for a calendar year is typically published in April of the following year. For qualified fuel
sold during the 2004 calendar year, the reference price was $36.75. The pro-rata reduction of non-conventional
source fuel tax credits for 2004 would have begun if the reference price was approximately $51.00 per barrel,
with a complete phase-out or reduction of non-conventional synfuel tax credits if the reference price reached
approximately $64.00 per barrel. We could experience a reduction of revenues associated with non-
conventional source fuel facilities in the future if non-conventional source fuel tax credits become unavailable
to the owners of the non-conventional source fuel facilities we service as a result of the rise in the wellhead
price per barrel of crude oil above specified levels. At the present time, however, we have not been advised of
any reductions in coal feedstock supply requirements or related services provided to any of our non-
conventional source fuel facility customers.
•  Our profitability may decline due to unanticipated mine operating conditions and other factors that are not
within our control.
•  A shortage of skilled labor may make it difficult for ARLP to maintain labor productivity and competitive costs
and could adversely affect our profitability.
•  Expansions we have completed since our formation, as well as expansions that we may undertake in the
future, involve a number of risks, any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits.
•  The unavailability of an adequate supply of coal reserves that can be mined at competitive costs could cause
our profitability to decline.
•  Mining in Central and Northern Appalachia areas is more complex and involves more regulatory constraints
than mining in other areas of the United States, which could affect our operations and cost structures of these
areas.
•  Unexpected increases in raw material costs could significantly impair our operating profitability.
•  We may be unable to obtain and/or renew permits necessary for our mining operations, which could reduce
production, and negatively impact our cash flow and profitability.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
All of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars and, as a result, we do not have material exposure to
currency exchange-rate risks.
We did not engage in any interest rate, foreign currency exchange-rate or commodity price-hedging
transactions as of September 30, 2005.
Borrowings under the Credit Facility and the previous credit facility are and were at variable rates and, as a
result, we have interest rate exposure. Our earnings are not materially affected by changes in interest rates.
We had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility during the 2005 Quarter or at September 30, 2005.
As of September 30, 2005, the estimated fair value of the Senior Notes was approximately $176.3 million. The
fair value of long-term debt is based on interest rates that we believe are currently available to us for issuance
of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. There were no other significant changes in our
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2004.
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Restatement of Previous Filings
In August 2005, we identified adjustments that were required to be recorded in prior periods relating to the
way we (a) compute basic and diluted earnings per limited partner and (b) present the disclosures required by
SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation-Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123 that pertains to the accounting treatment for our Long Term Incentive Plan. Descriptions of
these adjustments follow:
The Partnership determined that in periods in which aggregate net income exceeds the Partnership’s
aggregate distributions, the Partnership is required to present net income per limited partner unit as if all the
earnings for the period were distributed, regardless of the pro forma nature of the allocation or whether the
earnings would or could actually have been distributed during the period. This requirement reflects a
consensus reached by the FASB in EITF No. 03-6, and addresses the computation of earnings per share by
entities that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate
in dividends and earnings of the entity when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock.
SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirement of SFAS No. 123 to require more prominent disclosures in
both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock-based employee
compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The Partnership’s previous disclosure
provided pro forma information assuming compensation expense for the non-vested restricted units granted
would be different under the intrinsic method and the provisions of SFAS No. 123.
After management’s initial review of our accounting under EITF No. 03-6 and SFAS No. 148, on August 13,
2005, management recommended to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Alliance Resource
Management GP, LLC that, upon completion of our analysis of the impact of the items described above, our
previously filed financial statements be restated to reflect the correction of these items. The Audit Committee
agreed with this recommendation. On August 15, 2005, upon completion of our analysis, the Board of
Directors approved our restated financial statements that were included in Amendment No. 1 to each of our
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2005, each of
which was filed with the SEC on August 15, 2005.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
In connection with the restatement of previous filings, we reevaluated our disclosure controls and
procedures. We concluded that the restatement of our financial statements to correctly apply EITF No. 03-6
and SFAS No. 148, constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Solely as a
result of this material weakness, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2005.
Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control
During August 2005, we performed an extensive review of our accounting under EITF No. 03-6 and SFAS
No. 148 in an effort to ensure that the restated financial statements reflect all necessary adjustments. We had
initially designed, and are continuing to evaluate new internal control procedures to help remediate these
issues and to ensure future compliance with accounting pronouncements. The new internal control
procedures will include (a) increasing the number of personnel responsible for financial reporting,
(b) renewing the emphasis on the review of recent accounting pronouncements and (c) providing financial
reporting personnel with additional research tools, including subscribing to a service that specializes in
providing alerts and information concerning developments in accounting pronouncements. These new
procedures will be implemented during the fourth quarter of 2005 with corresponding management testing of
their effectiveness as of December 31, 2005. We believe these steps will remediate this material weakness
relating to our compliance with accounting standards; however, we cannot confirm the effectiveness of our
internal controls with respect to our application of accounting standards until we have conducted sufficient
testing. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor vigorously the effectiveness of these processes, procedures
and controls and will make any further changes management deems appropriate.
Changes in Internal Controls.
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-
15(f) under the Exchange Act) identified in connection with the evaluation of our internal controls performed
during the third quarter of 2005 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our
beliefs as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, us. When used in this
document, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast”, “may,” “project”,
“will,” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current
views with respect to future events and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Specific
factors which could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements include:
•  competition in coal markets and our ability to respond to the competition;
•  fluctuation in coal prices, which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows;
•  risks associated with the expansion of our operations and properties;
•  deregulation of the electric utility industry or the effects of any adverse change in the domestic coal industry,
electric utility industry, or general economic conditions;
•  dependence on significant customer contracts, including renewing customer contracts upon expiration of
existing contracts;
•  customer bankruptcies and/or cancellations of, or breaches to existing contracts;
•  customer delays or defaults in making payments;
•  fluctuations in coal demand, prices and availability due to labor and transportation costs and disruptions,
equipment availability, governmental regulations and other factors;
•  our productivity levels and margins that we earn on our coal sales;
•  greater than expected increases in raw material costs;
•  greater than expected shortage of skilled labor;
•  any unanticipated increases in labor costs, adverse changes in work rules, or unexpected cash payments
associated with post-mine reclamation and workers’ compensation claims;
•  any unanticipated increases in transportation costs and risk of transportation delays or interruptions;
•  greater than expected environmental regulation, costs and liabilities;
•  a variety of operational, geologic, permitting, labor and weather-related factors;
•  risk of major mine-related accidents, such as mine fires, or interruptions;
•  results of litigation;
•  difficulty maintaining our surety bonds for mine reclamation as well as workers’ compensation and black lung
benefits;
•  a loss of the benefit from certain state tax credits;
•  difficulty obtaining commercial property insurance, and risks associated with our participation (excluding any
applicable deductible) in the commercial insurance property program; and
•  Non-conventional source fuel tax credits are subject to a pro-rata phase-out or reduction based on the annual
average wellhead price per barrel for all domestic crude oil (the reference price) as determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury. We could experience a reduction of revenues associated with non-conventional
source fuel facilities if non-conventional source fuel tax credits become unavailable to the owners of the non-
conventional source fuel facilities we service as a result of the rise in the wellhead price per barrel of crude oil
above specified levels.
If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove
incorrect, our actual results may differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statement.
When considering forward-looking statements, you should also keep in mind the risk factors described in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2004. The risk factors could also cause our
actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We disclaim any
obligation to update the above list or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to any of the forward-
looking statements to reflect future events or developments.
