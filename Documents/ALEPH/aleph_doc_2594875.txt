U.S. ENERGY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
1.ORGANIZATION, OPERATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Organization and Operations
U.S. Energy Corp. (collectively with its subsidiaries referred to as the “Company” or “U.S. Energy”) was
incorporated in the State of Wyoming on January 26, 1966. The Company’s principal business activities
are focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties in the United
States.
Basis of Presentation.
The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and have been prepared by the
Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”)
regarding interim financial reporting. Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures required
by GAAP for complete financial statements have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such
rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have
been included.
For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company’s
financial condition as of June 30, 2016, and operating results for the three and six months ended June
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the financial condition and results of operations that may be
expected for any future interim period or for the year ending December 31, 2016.
As discussed in Note 5, during the fourth quarter of 2015 the Company began accounting for its mining
operations as a Discontinued Operation. Accordingly, certain reclassifications have been made to the
prior period balances in order to conform to the current period presentation. These and other
reclassifications had no impact on working capital, net loss, shareholders’ equity or cash flows as
previously reported.
Reverse Stock Split
The Company held its annual meeting of shareholders on June 20, 2016. At the meeting, the Company’s
shareholders approved Articles of Amendment to Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to
effect a six shares for one share reverse stock split of the Company’s $0.01 par value common stock (the
“Reverse Stock Split”). The Amendment was filed with the Wyoming Secretary of State and was effective
on June 20, 2016.
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every six shares of issued and outstanding common stock were
automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of common stock, without any change in
the par value per share or the number of shares of common stock authorized. No fractional shares were
issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from
the Reverse Stock Split were paid in a proportionate amount based on the average closing price of $2.23
for the five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Reverse Stock Split. The aggregate
number of fractional shares canceled in the Reverse Stock Split was 1,245 shares, resulting in a total
cash payment of $3. All references in the accompanying financial statements to the number of shares of
common stock and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the Reverse
Stock Split.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include oil and gas reserves
that are used in the calculation of depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment of the carrying
value of evaluated oil and gas properties; production and commodity price estimates used to record
accrued oil and gas sales receivable; valuation of commodity derivative instruments; and the cost of
future asset retirement obligations. The Company evaluates its estimates on an on-going basis and
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions the Company believes to
be reasonable. Due to inherent uncertainties, including the future prices of oil and gas, these estimates
could change in the near term and such changes could be material.

U.S. ENERGY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned
subsidiaries Energy One, LLC (“Energy One”), Highlands Ranch LLC (“Highlands Ranch”) and
Remington Village, LLC (“Remington Village”). All inter-company balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current
period presentation of the accompanying financial statements.
Comprehensive Income (Loss)
Comprehensive income (loss) is used to refer to net income (loss) plus other comprehensive income
(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that
under GAAP are reported as separate components of shareholders’ equity instead of net income (loss).
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
The following recently issued accounting standards are not yet effective; the Company is assessing the
impact these standards will have on its consolidated financial statements, as well as the method of
adoption and period in which adoption is expected to occur:
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update
(“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. This comprehensive guidance, as
subsequently amended by the FASB, will replace all existing revenue recognition guidance and is
effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein.
In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, “Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability
to Continue as a Going Concern” that will require management to evaluate whether there are conditions
and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern
within one year after the financial statements are issued on both an interim and annual basis.
Management will be required to provide certain footnote disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt
exists or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern. This ASU becomes effective for annual periods beginning in 2016 and for interim reporting
periods starting in the first quarter of 2017.
In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and
Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This ASU is intended to improve the
recognition and measurement of financial instruments. Among other things, this ASU requires certain
equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which will supersede the existing guidance
for lease accounting. This ASU will require lessees to recognize leases on their balance sheets, and
leaves lessor accounting largely unchanged. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting. The core change with ASU 2016-09 is the simplification of several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classifications of awards
as either equity or liabilities, and classification in the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years, and
early adoption is permitted.
The following recently issued accounting standards were adopted effective January 1, 2016; the impact
of adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements:
In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16, “Derivatives and Hedging: Determining Whether the
Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to
Equity”. This ASU does not change the current criteria in GAAP for determining when separation of
certain embedded derivative features in a hybrid financial instrument is required, but clarifies how current
GAAP should be interpreted in the evaluation of the economic characteristics and risks of a host contract
in a hybrid financial instrument that is issued in the form of a share, reducing existing diversity in practice.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, “Income Statement—Extraordinary and Unusual
Items”, that simplifies income statement classification by removing the concept of extraordinary items
from GAAP. The separate disclosure of extraordinary items after income from continuing operations in
the income statement is no longer permitted.
In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, “Consolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation
Analysis”. The new standard is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal
entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures.
During 2015, the FASB issued ASUs No. 2015-03 and No. 2015-15 titled “Interest-Imputation of Interest”,
which generally requires the presentation of debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the carrying
amount of the related debt liabilities. However, for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit
arrangements, the Company is permitted to continue presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and
subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit
arrangement. The Company elected to continue to present its deferred line of credit fees as an asset in
its consolidated balance sheets.
2.LIQUIDITY
As of June 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $9,509 and an accumulated deficit of
$124,523. Additionally, the Company incurred a net loss of $14,818 for the six months ended June 30,
2016. During 2015 and 2016, compliance was not maintained with certain financial ratio covenants in the
credit agreement with Wells Fargo as discussed in Note 7. In July 2015, Wells Fargo agreed to enter into
a third amendment to the credit agreement and provided waivers for non-compliance with the financial
ratio covenants for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015.
Commencing in September 2015, the Company completed the following actions which are expected to
improve the Company’s operating results in 2016 and enable the Company to survive the current oil and
gas industry price environment:
During the third quarter of 2015, the Company began to implement restructuring actions to reduce
corporate overhead through a reduction in the size of the Company’s workforce from 14 employees at
the end of 2014 to one employee by January 2016. Additionally, in December 2015 the Company
completed a move of its corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado for better access to financial
·
services and to improve access to oil and gas deal flow. Management expects its restructuring and other
cost-cutting actions will result in an overhead reduction of approximately $4,000 on an annualized basis.
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company began to realize the benefits of these actions
as aggregate general and administrative expenses were reduced by more than 50% as compared to the
six months ended June 30, 2015.
As discussed in Note 5, in February 2016 the Company completed the disposition of its mining segment,
including the Keystone Mine, a related water treatment plant and other related properties. A significant
objective for completing the disposition was to improve future profitability through the elimination of the
obligations to operate the water treatment plant and mine holding costs, which are expected to result in
·
estimated annual cash savings of $3,000. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company
began to realize the benefits of this disposition as aggregate operating expenses associated with the
mining segment were reduced from $1,459 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $373 for the six
months ended June 30, 2016. Management believes the disposition of the Company’s mining segment
is a major step in the transformation of U.S. Energy to solely focus on its existing oil and gas business.
In April 2016, Wells Fargo provided a waiver for non-compliance with the covenants in the credit
agreement for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015. As discussed in Note 7, in August 2016
Wells Fargo agreed to enter into a fourth amendment to the credit agreement that provides for, among
other things, a limited waiver of the negative financial covenants as it relates to the fiscal quarters ended
March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. Management believes that Wells Fargo will not demand repayment
·
until an alternative lender can be obtained. However, no assurance can be provided and the entire
principal balance of $6,000 is classified as a current liability as of June 30, 2016, due to management’s
expectation that further non-compliance with the financial ratio covenants is likely for the third quarter of
2016. The ongoing availability of borrowings under this credit agreement through the maturity date of
July 30, 2017, or the receipt of funding from alternative sources, is critical to the Company’s ability to
survive until oil and gas prices recover.
-9-
U.S. ENERGY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
The Company expects that its share of the drilling and completion costs associated with proved
undeveloped oil and gas properties that it will be required to fund is approximately $1,000 in 2017 and
$3,800 in 2018. However, the specific timing and amount of these expenditures is controlled by the
operators of the respective properties and can change based on a variety of economic and operating
conditions. The Company’s ability to finance these planned capital expenditures is contingent upon its
ability to repay $6,000 of outstanding borrowings under the Wells Fargo credit agreement and to obtain
alternative sources of financing. In order to reduce the financing commitments, the Company intends to
pursue sales of non-core assets to generate near-term liquidity. Alternatives that may be pursued include
selling or joint venturing an interest in certain oil and gas properties, selling real estate assets in
Wyoming, selling marketable equity securities, issuing shares of common stock for cash or as
consideration for acquisitions, and other alternatives, as the Company determines how to best fund its
capital programs and meet its financial obligations.
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had cash and equivalents of $1,360. Management believes
approximately $7,000 of annualized overhead and mining expense reductions have poised the
Company to survive the current low commodity price environment. Management believes the Company’s
new singular industry focus, combined with attractive producing properties and a low-cost overhead
structure, makes the Company an attractive vehicle to partner with for potential investors and lenders
during this industry downturn and low commodity price environment. However, there can be no
assurance that the Company will be able to complete future financings, dispositions or acquisitions on
acceptable terms or at all.
3.OIL PRICE RISK DERIVATIVES
The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Energy One has entered into crude oil derivative contracts
(“economic hedges”) with Wells Fargo, the Company’s lender as discussed further in Note 7. The
derivative contracts are priced based on West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) quoted prices for crude oil. The
Company is a guarantor of Energy One’s obligations under the economic hedges. The objective of
utilizing the economic hedges is to reduce the effect of price changes on a portion of the Company’s
future oil production, achieve more predictable cash flows in an environment of volatile oil and gas prices
and to manage the Company’s exposure to commodity price risk. The use of these derivative instruments
limits the downside risk of adverse price movements. However, there is a risk that such use may limit the
Company’s ability to benefit from favorable price movements. Energy One may, from time to time, add
incremental derivatives to hedge additional production, restructure existing derivative contracts or enter
into new transactions to modify the terms of current contracts in order to realize the current value of its
existing positions. The Company does not engage in speculative derivative activities or derivative
trading activities, nor does it use derivatives with leveraged features. Presented below is a summary of
outstanding “costless collars” with Wells Fargo as of June 30, 2016 (which total an aggregate of 55,200
barrels of oil production during the last six months of 2016):
Settlement Period Quantity   Contract Price  
 
Begin  End
     
 
 
7/1/16  12/31/16    300
  $50.00  $65.25
(bbls/ day)  Put
Call
As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate fair value of oil derivative put contracts was an asset of $189 and the
aggregate fair value of oil derivative call contracts was a liability of $15. Since these contracts are with
the same counterparty, the Company recognizes the net asset of $174 in the accompanying balance
sheet as of June 30, 2016. Since all of the derivative contracts expire within six months of the balance
sheet date, the entire amount is included in current assets. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate fair
value of oil derivative put contracts was an asset of $1,674 and the aggregate fair value of oil derivative
call contracts was a liability of $40, resulting in a net asset of $1,634.
Unrealized gains and losses resulting from derivatives are recorded at fair value in the consolidated
balance sheet. Changes in fair value, as well as realized gains (losses) arising upon derivative contract
settlements are included in the “change in unrealized gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives” in the
consolidated statements of operations.

4.CEILING TEST FOR OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES
The reserves used in the Company’s full cost ceiling test incorporate assumptions regarding pricing and
discount rates over which management has no influence in the determination of present value. In the
calculation of the ceiling test as of June 30, 2016, the Company used a price of $43.12 per barrel for oil
and $2.24 per MMbtu for natural gas (as further adjusted for property specific gravity, quality, local
markets and distance from markets) to compute the future cash flows of the Company’s producing
properties. These prices compare to $50.28 per barrel for oil and $2.59 per MMbtu for natural gas used in
the calculation of the ceiling test as of December 31, 2015. The discount factor used was 10%.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, ceiling test impairment charges for the Company’s
oil and gas properties amounted to $2,611 and $3,208, respectively. For the six months ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, ceiling test impairment charges for the Company’s oil and gas properties amounted to
$9,568 and $22,448, respectively. These impairment charges were primarily related to (i) a decline in the
price of oil, (ii) reductions in the estimated quantities that are economically recoverable in the current low
oil price environment, and (iii) the transfer of approximately $1,000 of unevaluated properties during the
first quarter of 2016 to the full cost pool due to impairment.
5.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND PREFERRED STOCK ISSUANCE
Disposition of Mining Segment
In February 2006, the Company reacquired the Mt. Emmons molybdenum mining properties (the
“Property”). From the time of the Company’s reacquisition of the Property until its transfer as described
below, the Company did not conduct any extractive mining operations at the Property and was obligated
under existing permits to operate a water treatment plant (“WTP”) and to incur holding costs associated
with the retention of the mining properties, which resulted in aggregate annual expenses of
approximately $3,000 during each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.
The market price for molybdenum oxide was approximately $11 per pound during 2013 and 2014 with a
decrease to approximately $5 per pound by the fourth quarter of 2015. In light of the considerable
ongoing costs related to the Property and the deteriorating market for molybdenum, during 2015 the
Company began to explore the viability of alternative structures to the development of the Property that
could result in a sharing or elimination of the ongoing costs and liabilities. In February 2016, the
Company’s Board of Directors decided to dispose of the Property rather than continuing the Company’s
long-term development strategy whereby the Company entered into the following agreements:
A.
An Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) was entered into with Mt. Emmons Mining
Company, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (“MEM”), whereby MEM acquired the Property which
consists of the Mt. Emmons mine site located in Gunnison County, Colorado, including the Keystone
Mine, the WTP and other related properties. Under the Acquisition Agreement, MEM replaced the
Company as the permittee and operator of the WTP and will discharge the obligation of the Company
to operate the WTP from and after the closing in accordance with the applicable permits issued by the
Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. The Company did not receive any cash
consideration for the disposition; the sole consideration for the transfer was that MEM assumed the
Company’s obligations to operate the WTP and to pay the future mine holding costs for portions of the
Property that it desires to retain.
As a result of the February 2016 disposition of the Property, the Company determined that an impairment
charge of $22,620 was required to be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the disposal of the
Company’s mining segment was reported as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial
statements. Presented below are the assets and liabilities associated with the Company’s mining
segment as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

B.
Concurrent with entry into the Acquisition Agreement and as additional consideration for MEM to
accept transfer of the Property, the Company entered into a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement (the “Series A Purchase Agreement”) with MEM, whereby the Company issued
50,000 shares of newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”) in
exchange for (i) MEM accepting the transfer of the Property and replacing the Company as the
permittee and operator of the WTP, and (ii) the payment of approximately $1 to the Company. The
Series A Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties on the part of the
Company. As contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and the Series A Purchase Agreement and
as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Wyoming Articles of Amendment containing a Certificate of Designations with respect to the
Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”). Pursuant to the Certificate of Designations, the
Company designated 50,000 shares of its authorized preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock. The Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 12.25% per annum of the Adjusted
Liquidation Preference (as defined); such dividends are not payable in cash but are accrued and
compounded quarterly in arrears on the first business day of the succeeding calendar quarter. At
issuance, the aggregate fair value of the Preferred Stock was $2,000 based on the initial liquidation
preference of $40 per share. The “Adjusted Liquidation Preference” is initially $40 per share of
Preferred Stock, with increases each quarter by the accrued quarterly dividend. The Preferred Stock is
senior to other classes or series of shares of the Company with respect to dividend rights and rights
upon liquidation. No dividend or distribution will be declared or paid on junior stock, including the
Company’s common stock, (1) unless approved by the holders of Preferred Stock and (2) unless and
until a like dividend has been declared and paid on the Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis.
At the option of the holder, each share of Preferred Stock was initially convertible into approximately
13.33 shares of the Company’s $0.01 par value common stock (the “Conversion Rate”) for an aggregate
of 666,667 shares of common stock. The Conversion Rate is subject to anti-dilution adjustments for stock
splits, stock dividends, certain reorganization events, and to price-based anti-dilution protections if the
Company subsequently issues shares for less than 90% of fair value on the date of issuance. Each share
of Preferred Stock will be convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to the ratio of the
initial conversion value to the conversion value as adjusted for accumulated dividends multiplied by the
Conversion Rate. In no event will the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued upon
conversion be greater than approximately 793,000 shares. The Preferred Stock will generally not vote
with the Company’s common stock on an as-converted basis on matters put before the Company’s
shareholders. The holders of the Preferred Stock have the right to approve specified matters as set forth
in the Certificate of Designations and have the right to require the Company to repurchase the Preferred
Stock in connection with a change of control. However, the Company’s Board of Directors has the ability
to prevent any change of control that could trigger a redemption obligation related to the Preferred Stock.
During the first quarter of 2016, the Company recorded the fair value of the Preferred Stock based on the
initial liquidation preference of $2,000. Since the cash consideration paid by MEM for the Preferred Stock
was $1, the Company recorded a charge to discontinued operations of approximately $1,999 associated
with the issuance. This charge represents additional consideration to induce MEM to assume the
Company’s previous obligations to operate the WTP. As of June 30, 2016, the aggregate Adjusted
Liquidation Preference was $2,034 which was convertible into 678,009 shares of common stock, and
accrued dividends not yet included in the Adjusted Liquidation Preference amounted to $62.

C.
Concurrent with entry into the Acquisition Agreement and the Series A Purchase Agreement, the
Company and MEM entered into an Investor Rights Agreement, which provides MEM with the rights to
certain information and Board observer rights. MEM has agreed that it, along with its affiliates, will not
acquire more than 16.86% of the Company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In
addition, MEM has the right to request registration of the shares of common stock issuable upon
conversion of the Preferred Stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

6.ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
As of June 30, 2016, the Company owns three parcels of land in Wyoming for an aggregate of
approximately 13 acres of land with a carrying value of $653. This land is currently listed for sale and
management expects to sell the land within the following year at prices in excess of the carrying value.
7.DEBT
Energy One, a wholly-owned subsidiary the Company, has a credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association (“Wells Fargo”). As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, outstanding
borrowings under the credit agreement amounted to $6,000, which is also the maximum amount of the
borrowing base. Borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by Energy One’s oil and gas
producing properties and substantially all of the Company’s cash and equivalents. Each borrowing under
the agreement has a term of six months, but can be continued at the Company’s election through July
2017 if the Company is in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. The weighted
average interest rate on this debt is 3.19% as of June 30, 2016.
Energy One is required to comply with customary affirmative covenants and with certain negative
covenants. The principal negative financial covenants do not permit (i) the interest coverage ratio
(EBITDAX to interest expense) to be less than 3.0 to 1; (ii) total debt to EBITDAX to be greater than 3.5 to
1; and (iii) the current ratio to be less than 1.0 to 1.0. EBITDAX is defined in the Credit Agreement as
consolidated net income, plus non-cash charges. Additionally, the credit agreement prohibits or limits
Energy One’s ability to incur additional debt, pay cash dividends and other restricted payments, sell
assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, and to merge or consolidate with another company. The
Company is a guarantor of Energy One’s obligations under the credit agreement.
-13-
U.S. ENERGY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
On August 11, 2016, the Company and Wells Fargo entered into a fourth amendment (the "Fourth
Amendment") to the credit agreement. The Fourth Amendment provides for, among other things: (i) a
limited waiver of the negative financial covenants as it relates to the fiscal quarters ended March 31,
2016 and June 30, 2016, (ii) implementation of a new negative covenant that prohibits the Company’s
consolidated general and administrative expenses (as defined) from exceeding $3,000 for each of the
years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017, (iii) deferral of the next borrowing base redetermination until
December 1, 2016, and (iv) the pledge of additional collateral by U.S. Energy consisting of certain real
estate assets with a net carrying value of $1,860, and its shares of Anfield Resources, Inc., which had a
fair value of $1,147 as of June 30, 2016.
Because the Company projects that it is unlikely that Energy One will regain compliance with the
negative financial covenants for the entirety of the next 12 months, outstanding borrowings of $6,000 are
presented as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. In the event that Energy One is unable to obtain further waivers under the credit
agreement to address the anticipated future breaches of the negative financial covenants, and other
actual or potential future breaches that may occur, Wells Fargo could elect to declare some or all of the
Company’s debt to be immediately due and payable and could elect to terminate its commitment and
cease making further loans.
8.EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN
In October 2005, the Board of Directors adopted an Executive Retirement Policy (the “Retirement Plan”)
for the benefit of certain executive officers of the Company. To be eligible to participate in the Retirement
Plan, the executive officer was required to serve as one of the designated executive officers for at least
15 years, reached the age of 60, and been an employee of the Company on December 31, 2010. Upon
retirement, the executive was entitled to cash payments equaling 50% of the greater of (i) the amount of
compensation earned as base cash pay on the final regular pay check or (ii) the average annual pay,
less all bonuses, received over the last five years of employment with the Company. The Company
periodically engaged the services of a third party actuary to determine the estimated liability under the
Retirement Plan. In December 2015, the Company and the Retirement Plan participants mutually agreed
to terminate the Retirement Plan. As of December 31, 2015, the liability for retirement plan benefits was
$583 and this entire balance was paid to participants during the first quarter of 2016.
9.COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
From time to time, the Company is party to certain legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course
of business. While the outcome of these events cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not
expect these matters to have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or results of
operations. Following is updated information related to currently pending legal matters:
Arbitration of Employment Claim. A former at-will employee has asserted a claim that a change of control
occurred and he was involuntarily terminated without cause, thereby entitling him to compensation under
a purported Executive Severance and Non-Compete agreement (the “Agreement”). The Company claims
that the Agreement is invalid because it was never authorized by the Board of Directors or ratified by the
Company’s shareholders. Furthermore, the Company contends that no change of control occurred that
would entitle the former at-will employee to benefits under the Agreement. The former employee has
claimed that the Company owes up to $1,800 under the Agreement which requires that any disputes be
submitted to binding arbitration. A request for arbitration was submitted by the former employee in March
2016 and, on April 15, 2016, the Company filed a complaint in Denver District Court seeking a stay of the
arbitration and/or preliminary injunction against the employee from proceeding with the arbitration. As a
result, administration of the arbitration proceeding was suspended until the outcome of the Company’s
complaint could be resolved. On August 12, 2016, the Court refused to stay the arbitration or grant the
Company a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the Agreement had not been authorized by the
Board of Directors or ratified by the Company’s shareholders and the Court ordered the parties to
proceed with the arbitration.
Management does not believe there is any merit to the claim of termination without cause or that a
change of control occurred. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot presently be determined.
Accordingly, adjustments, if any, that may result from the resolution of this matter have not been reflected
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Contingent Ownership Interests. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had
recognized a contingent liability associated with uncertain ownership interests of $3,203 and $3,108,
respectively. This liability arises when the calculations of respective joint ownership interests by
operators differs from the Company’s calculations. These differences relate to a variety of matters,
including allocation of non-consent interests, complex payout calculations for individual wells and
groups of wells, along with the timing of reversionary interests. Accordingly, these matters are subject to
legal interpretation and the related obligations are presented as a contingent liability in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. While the Company has classified these amounts as
current liabilities, most of these issues are expected to be resolved through arbitration, mediation or
litigation; due to the complexity of the issues involved, there can be no assurance that the outcome of
these contingencies will be resolved in the next year.

As of June 30, 2016, an aggregate of approximately 351,000 shares are available for future grants under
the Company’s stock option plans. Based upon the closing price for the Company’s common stock of
$1.70 per share on June 30, 2016, there was no intrinsic value related to stock options outstanding as of
June 30, 2016.
Restricted Stock Grants
In January 2015, the Board of Directors granted 56,786 shares of restricted stock under the 2012 Equity
Plan to four officers of the Company. These shares originally vested annually over a period of three
years. However, during 2015 vesting was accelerated for three of the four officers in connection with
severance agreements for an aggregate of 40,119 shares. The remaining 16,667 shares vested for 5,556
shares in January 2016 and the remaining 11,111 shares will vest for 5,556 shares in January 2017 and
5,555 shares in January 2018. The fair market value of the 56,786 shares on the date of grant was
approximately $511. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, total stock-based
compensation expense related to restricted stock grants was $13 and $42, respectively. For the six
months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, total stock-based compensation expense related to restricted
stock grants was $25 and $84, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, there was $75 of unrecognized
expense related to unvested restricted stock grants, which will be recognized as stock-based
compensation expense through January 2018.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan
The Board of Directors of the Company adopted the U.S. Energy Corp. 1989 Employee Stock Ownership
Plan ("ESOP") in 1989, for the benefit of all the Company’s employees. Employees become eligible to
participate in the ESOP after one year of service which must consist of at least 1,000 hours worked.
Employees become 20% vested after three years of service and increase their vesting by 20% each year
thereafter until such time as they are fully vested after seven years of service.
An employee’s total compensation paid, which is subject to federal income tax (up to an annual limit of
$265 for the year ended December 31, 2015) is the basis for computing how much of the total annual
funding is contributed into each employee’s personal account. An employee’s compensation divided by
the total eligible compensation paid to all plan participants is the percentage that each participant
receives on an annual basis. All shares of the Company’s common stock contributed to the ESOP have
been allocated to specific employees and are vested. Total shares held by the ESOP at June 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 were 340,726 and 789,110, respectively.
For the three months ended June 30, 2015, total stock-based compensation expense related to the
ESOP was $23. No expense related to the ESOP has been recorded for the three months ended June
30, 2016 since the Company’s Board of Directors has not determined if a discretionary contribution will
be made for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
a mandatory contribution of $170 which is either payable in cash or may be settled through the issuance
of common stock at the election of the Company. On July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors elected to issue
65,748 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $2.58 per share to settle this
obligation. Accordingly, this liability is included in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying balance
sheet as of June 30, 2016.
11.INCOME TAXES
For Federal income tax purposes, as of December 31, 2015 the Company had net operating loss and
percentage depletion carryovers of approximately $57,000 and $7,000, respectively. The net operating
loss carryovers may be carried back two years and forward twenty years from the year the net operating
loss was generated. The net operating losses may be used to offset future taxable income and expire in
varying amounts through 2035. In addition, the Company has alternative minimum tax credit carry-
forwards of approximately $700 which are available to offset future federal income taxes over an
indefinite period. The Company has established a valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets
including the net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards discussed above since
the “more likely than not” realization criterion was not met as of June 30, 2016 and 2015. Accordingly, the
Company did not recognize an income tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015.
The Company recognizes, measures, and discloses uncertain tax positions whereby tax positions must
meet a “more-likely-than-not” threshold to be recognized. As of June 30, 2016, gross unrecognized tax
benefits are immaterial and there was no change in such benefits during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016. The Company does not expect a significant increase or decrease to the uncertain tax
positions within the next twelve months.
12.EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, common stock equivalents
excluded from the calculation of weighted average shares because they were antidilutive are as follows:

13.SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATIONS
The Company has exposure to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by the joint interest operators of the
Company’s oil and gas properties. Approximately 27% of the Company’s proved developed oil and gas
reserve quantities are associated with wells that are operated by a single operator (the “Major Operator”).
As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a liability to the Major Operator of
$3,302 and $4,159, respectively, for accrued operating expenses and overpayments of net revenues
when the Major Operator failed to recognize that the Company’s ownership interest reverted after payout,
which was achieved for certain wells during 2014 and 2015. Beginning in the second quarter of 2015,
the Major Operator began withholding the Company’s net revenues from all wells that it operates for the
Company and management expects the Major Operator will continue to withhold the Company’s net
revenues until this liability is paid in full. Based on the oil and gas prices and costs used to calculate the
Company’s estimated reserves as of June 30, 2016, this liability is not expected to be fully settled.
However, under higher pricing scenarios the Company expects the liability will be repaid from future
production. Accordingly, the aggregate balances are presented as current liabilities in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.
14.FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  In determining fair value, the
Company uses various methods including market, income and cost approaches. Based on these
approaches, the Company often utilizes certain assumptions that market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the
valuation technique. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally
unobservable inputs.  The Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  Based on the observability of the inputs used in the
valuation techniques the Company is required to provide the following information according to the fair
value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to
determine fair values. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value will be classified and disclosed
in one of the following three categories:
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities traded in active exchange markets, such as the
New York Stock Exchange.
Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities,
quoted prices in less active markets, or other observable inputs that can be corroborated by observable
market data.  Level 2 also includes derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model
with observable market inputs or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
data.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs supported by little or no market activity for financial instruments whose
value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as
well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment
or estimation; also includes observable inputs for nonbinding single dealer quotes not corroborated by
observable market data.

U.S. ENERGY CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, Continued
(Dollars in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)
The Company has processes and controls in place to attempt to ensure that fair value is reasonably
estimated. The Company performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in
order to support their use in the valuation process. Where market information is not available to support
internal valuations, independent reviews of the valuations are performed and any material exposures are
evaluated through a management review process.
While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market
participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain
financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. The following is
a description of the valuation methodologies used for complex financial instruments measured at fair
value:
Oil Price Risk Derivative Valuation Methodologies
The Company determines its estimate of the fair value of derivative instruments using a market approach
based on several factors, including quoted market prices in active markets, quotes from third parties, the
credit rating of the counterparty and the Company’s own credit rating. In consideration of counterparty
credit risk, the Company assessed the likelihood that the counterparty to the derivative would default by
failing to make any contractually required payments. Additionally, the Company considers that it is of
substantial credit quality and has the financial resources and willingness to meet its potential repayment
obligations associated with the derivative transactions. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
derivative instruments utilized by the Company consisted of crude oil costless collars. The crude oil
derivative markets are highly active. Although the Company’s derivative instruments are valued using
indices, the instruments themselves are traded with third-party counterparties and are not openly traded
on an exchange. As such, the Company has classified these instruments as Level 2.
Marketable Equity Securities Valuation Methodologies
The fair value of available for sale securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from
independent pricing services. In consideration of the increase in the trading volumes for the Company’s
investments in marketable equity securities, the Company determined that they should be classified in
Level 1 as of June 30, 2016.
Executive Retirement Liability Valuation Methodologies
The executive retirement program is a standalone liability for which there is no available market price,
principal market, or market participants. The Company records the estimated fair value of the long-term
liability for estimated future payments under the executive retirement program based on the discounted
value of estimated future payments associated with each individual in the program. The inputs available
for this estimate are unobservable and are therefore classified as Level 3 inputs.
Other Financial Instruments
The carrying amount of cash and equivalents, oil and gas sales receivable, other current assets,
accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of
those instruments. The recorded amounts for borrowings under the credit agreement discussed in Note 7
approximates the fair market value due to the variable nature of the interest rates, and the fact that market
interest rates have remained substantially the same since the latest amendment to the credit agreement.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
Recurring measurements of the fair value of assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 are as follows:

For the period from September 1, 2015 when the Company acquired its investment in Anfield
Resources, Inc. (“Anfield”) through March 31, 2016, average daily trading volume was approximately
10,000 shares and management concluded that the quoted marked price was not an accurate indicator
of fair value. Accordingly, alternative methods were used to determine fair value upon receipt of the
shares in September 2015, which required classification under Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
During the second quarter of 2016, average daily trading volume increased to more than 240,000
shares and management now classifies its investment in Anfield under Level 1 of the fair value
(1)
hierarchy. As a result of the reclassification of Anfield to Level 1, the Company recognized an
unrealized gain of $909 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016.
15.SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
As discussed in Note 10, on July 7, 2016, the Board of Directors elected to issue 65,748 shares of the
Company’s common stock with a fair value of $2.49 per share to settle the liability to fund the ESOP
contribution for 2015.
As discussed in Note 7, on August 11, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit
agreement with Wells Fargo which, among other things, provided limited waivers for financial ratio
covenant noncompliance for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.
In July 2016, the Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent with IronHorse Resources LLC
(“IronHorse”) pursuant to which the Company may obtain the right to acquire a 40% interest in a farmout
agreement to participate in developing three core areas in the Wattenberg Field in Weld County,
Colorado. The development program is slated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2016 with drilling to
continue until the middle of 2017. If the participation agreement is entered into, the Company's
commitment for drilling and completing the wells is expected to cost approximately $9,600. A director of
the Company is one of the owners of IronHorse.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
Forward Looking Statements
This Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “Exchange Act”). All statements other than statements of historical facts included in and
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. When used in this Form
10-Q, the words “will”, “expect”, “anticipate”, “intend”, “plan”, “believe”, “seek”, “estimate” and similar
expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking
statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include
statements regarding our expected future revenue, income, production, liquidity, cash flows, reclamation
and other liabilities, expenses and capital projects, future capital expenditures and future transactions.
Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ
materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a variety of
factors, including those associated with our ability to find oil and natural gas reserves that are
economically recoverable, the volatility of oil, NGL and natural gas prices, declines in the values of our
properties that have resulted in and may in the future result in additional ceiling test write downs, our
ability to replace reserves and sustain production, our estimate of the sufficiency of our existing capital
sources, our ability to raise additional capital to fund cash requirements for our participation in oil and
gas properties and for future acquisitions, risks arising from defaults under our credit facility, the
uncertainties involved in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves, in prospect
development and property acquisitions or dispositions and in projecting future rates of production or
future reserves, the timing of development expenditures and drilling of wells, hurricanes and other natural
disasters and the operating hazards attendant to the oil and gas and minerals businesses. In particular,
careful consideration should be given to cautionary statements made in the “Risk Factors” section of our
2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, and other quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the
SEC, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. The Company undertakes no duty to update or
revise any forward-looking statements.
General Overview
We are an independent energy company focused on the acquisition and development of oil and gas
producing properties in the continental United States. Our business is currently focused in South Texas
and the Williston Basin in North Dakota. However, we do not intend to limit our focus to these geographic
areas. We continue to focus on increasing production, reserves, revenues and cash flow from operations
while managing our level of debt.
We currently explore for and produce oil and gas through a non-operator business model; however, we
may operate oil and gas properties for our own account and may expand our holdings or operations into
other areas. As a non-operator, we rely on our operating partners to propose, permit and manage wells.
Before a well is drilled, the operator is required to provide all oil and gas interest owners in the
designated well the opportunity to participate in the drilling costs and revenues of the well on a pro-rata
basis. After the well is completed, our operating partners also transport, market and account for all
production. Our long-term strategic focus is to develop operational capabilities through the pursuit of
opportunities to acquire operated properties and/or operatorship of existing properties.
Recent Developments
In February 2016, we transferred to Mt. Emmons Mining Company, a subsidiary of Freeport-McMoRan
Inc. (“MEM”), our Mt. Emmons mine site located in Gunnison County, Colorado, including the Keystone
Mine, a related water treatment plant (the “WTP”) and other related properties (collectively, the
“Purchased Assets”). MEM replaced the Company as the permittee and owner of the WTP and will
discharge the obligation of the Company to operate the WTP in accordance with the applicable permits
issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.
As additional consideration for MEM to accept transfer of the Purchased Assets, including related
obligations, the Company entered into a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the
“Series A Purchase Agreement”) with MEM pursuant to which the Company issued to MEM 50,000
shares of newly designated Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Preferred Stock”). The Preferred
Stock accrues dividends at a rate of 12.25% per annum of the Adjusted Liquidation Preference (as
defined), which are not payable in cash but are accrued and compounded quarterly in arrears. The
“Adjusted Liquidation Preference” is initially $40 per share of Preferred Stock, increased each quarter by
the accrued quarterly dividend. The Preferred Stock is senior to other classes or series of shares of the
Company with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation. No dividend or distribution will be
declared or paid on junior stock, including the Company’s common stock, (1) unless approved by the
holders of Preferred Stock, voting as a group and (2) unless and until a like dividend has been declared
and paid on the Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis, unless waived by the holders of Preferred
Stock.
-20-
Each share of Preferred Stock may initially be converted into 13.33 shares of the common stock of the
Company at the option of the holder at any time. The conversion rate is subject to anti-dilution
adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and certain reorganization events and to price-based anti-
dilution protections. Each share of Preferred Stock will be convertible into a number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the product of (1) the conversion value as adjusted for accumulated dividends
divided by the initial conversion value, multiplied by (2) the conversion rate (plus cash in lieu of fractional
shares and dividends accrued since the last accrual date). The Preferred Stock will generally not vote
with the common stock on an as-converted basis on matters put before the Company’s shareholders.
The holders of the Preferred Stock have the right to approve specified matters and have the right to
require the Company to repurchase the Preferred Stock in connection with a change of control.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) requires us to make assumptions and estimates that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. A summary of our significant accounting policies is detailed in Note
1 – Organization, Operations and Significant Accounting Polices in Item 8 of our 2015 Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016, as amended. We have outlined below those policies
identified as being critical to the understanding of our business and results of operations and that require
the application of significant management judgment.
Oil and Gas Reserve Estimates. Our estimates of proved reserves are based on quantities of oil and gas
reserves which current engineering data indicates are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing
economic and operating conditions. Estimates of proved reserves are critical estimates in determining
our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (“DD&A”) and our full cost ceiling limitation (“Full
Cost Ceiling”). Future cash inflows are determined by applying oil and gas prices, as adjusted for
transportation, quality and basis differentials to the estimated quantities of proved reserves remaining to
be produced as of the end of that period. Future production and development costs are based on costs
existing at the effective date of the report. Expected cash flows are discounted to present value using a
prescribed discount rate of 10% per annum.
Estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise because of uncertainties in projecting rates of
production and timing of developmental expenditures, interpretations of geological, geophysical,
engineering and production data and the quality and quantity of available data. Changing economic
conditions also may affect our estimates of proved reserves due to changes in developmental costs and
changes in commodity prices that may impact reservoir economics. We utilize independent reserve
engineers to estimate our proved reserves at the end of each fiscal quarter during the year.
Oil and Gas Properties. We follow the full cost method in accounting for our oil and gas properties. Under
the full cost method, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
properties are capitalized and accumulated in a country-wide cost center. This includes any internal
costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities, but does not include any costs
related to production, general corporate overhead or similar activities. Proceeds received from property
disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal
of reserves, in which case a gain or loss is recognized.
The sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each
cost center are amortized using the equivalent unit-of-production method, based on proved oil and gas
reserves. The capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets,
with the DD&A recognized in the period that the reserves are produced. DD&A is calculated by dividing
the period’s production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and
multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future
development costs associated with the investment. Changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result
in changes in our DD&A per unit. Costs associated with production and general corporate activities are
expensed in the period incurred.
-21-
Exploratory wells in progress are excluded from the DD&A calculation until the outcome of the well is
determined. Similarly, unproved property costs are initially excluded from the DD&A calculation.
Unproved property costs not subject to the DD&A calculation consist primarily of leasehold and seismic
costs related to unproved areas. Unproved property costs are transferred into the amortization base on
an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves are established or impairment is
determined. Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed quarterly for impairment to determine whether
we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven either to have
economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist.
Under the full cost method of accounting, capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated DD&A
and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed the Full Cost Ceiling. The Full Cost Ceiling is equal to
the present value, discounted at 10%, of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves
plus the unimpaired cost of unproved properties not subject to amortization, plus the lower of cost or fair
value of unproved properties that are subject to amortization. When net capitalized costs exceed the Full
Cost Ceiling, impairment is recognized.
Derivative Instruments. We use derivative instruments, typically costless collars and fixed-rate swaps, to
manage price risk underlying our oil and gas production. We may also use puts, calls and basis swaps in
the future. All derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. We
offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty.
Although we do not designate any of our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, such derivative
instruments provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with
forecasted future oil and gas production. These contracts are accounted for using the mark-to-market
accounting method and accordingly, we recognize all unrealized and realized gains and losses related
to these contracts currently in earnings and they are classified as gain (loss) on oil price risk derivatives
in our consolidated statements of operations.
Our Board of Directors sets all risk management policies and reviews the status and results of derivative
activities, including volumes, types of instruments and counterparties. The master contracts with
approved counterparties identify the CEO as the Company representative authorized to execute trades.
Discontinued Operations- Mining Properties. Due to the disposition of our mining properties in February
2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued operations. Effective January 1, 2015, we
adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition and presentation of discontinued operations
in our financial statements. Under the revised guidance, beginning in 2015 only disposals of businesses
that represent strategic shifts that have a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported
in discontinued operations. Accordingly, the disposal of our mining segment qualified for reporting as
discontinued operations.
We capitalized all costs incidental to the acquisition of mining properties and related equipment. The
costs of operating the WTP, holding costs to maintain permits, mining exploration costs and general
corporate overhead were expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized impairment of
the carrying value of the mine property when we determined that the carrying value could not be
recovered.
Joint Interest Operations. We do not serve as operator for any of our oil and gas properties. Therefore, we
rely to a large extent on the operator of the property to provide us with timely and accurate information
about the operations of the properties. Joint interest billings from the operators serve as our primary
source of information to record revenue, operating expenses and capital expenditures for our properties
on a monthly basis. Many of our properties are subject to complex participation and operating
agreements where our working interests and net revenue interests are subject to change upon the
occurrence of certain events, such as the achievement of “payout”. These calculations may be subject to
error and differences of interpretation which can cause uncertainties about the proper amount that should
be recorded in our accounting records. When these issues arise, we make every effort to work with the
operators to resolve the issues promptly.
Revenue Recognition. We record oil and gas revenue under the sales method of accounting. Under the
sales method, we recognize revenues based on the amount of oil or natural gas sold to purchasers,
which may differ from the amounts to which we are entitled based on our interest in the properties. Gas
balancing obligations as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were not significant.
Stock Based Compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for all
equity awards granted, including stock options, based on the fair market value of the award as of the
grant date. We recognize the cost of the equity awards over the period during which an employee is
required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period. For awards granted
which contain a graded vesting schedule, and the only condition for vesting is a service condition,
compensation cost is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period
as if the award was, in substance, a single award.

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $4.2 million as compared to a
net loss of $6.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our loss from continuing operations
was $4.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $5.6 million for the three months
ended June 30, 2015. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-
operating income (expense), and discontinued operations for the three months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.

The decrease in our oil sales of $1.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to
the three months ended June 30, 2015 was attributable to a 26% reduction in our oil production quantity
and a 23% reduction in the average oil price realized during the three months ended June 30, 2016. The
reduction in our net realized oil price is reflective of the dramatic decrease in global commodity prices
during 2015 which has intensified during 2016. During the last year, the differential between West Texas
Intermediate (“WTI”) quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realize for sales in the Williston Basin
was approximately $8.00 per barrel. We expect this differential to continue (with the amount of the
differential varying over time) and that our oil sales revenue will be affected by lower realized prices from
this region.
Our natural gas and liquids sales were approximately $0.3 million for each of the three months ended
June 30, 2016 and 2015. Our natural gas and liquids production was 19% higher for the three months
ended June 30, 2016, but this increase was offset by a 23% reduction in the average price realized
during this period.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we produced 71,015 BOE, or an average of 780 BOE per
day, as compared to 81,617 BOE or 897 BOE per day during the comparable period in 2015. This 13%
reduction was attributable to several factors, including (i) the normal decline in production for wells in the
area of our properties, (ii) we did not add significant reserves from drilling or acquisitions over the past
year, and (iii) in this low price environment operators have an incentive to scale back production until
prices recover.

For the three months ended June 30, 2016, production taxes decreased by $0.1 million compared to the
same period in 2015. Substantially all of this decrease in production taxes resulted from lower oil and
gas sales. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, lease operating expense decreased by $0.5
million which was primarily due to the implementation of cost reduction strategies by the operators of our
wells. For the three months ended June 30, 2016, lease operating expense includes $0.3 million for
workovers that were implemented to maintain production levels. We expect further well by well
decreases as cost reduction programs continue during the industry downturn.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was
$12.17 per BOE compared to $25.18 per BOE for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Our DD&A rate
can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes
in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and
complete proved undeveloped reserves. The primary factor that resulted in a reduction in our DD&A rate
for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $44.8 million of aggregate quarterly impairment charges
that resulted from our quarterly Full Cost Ceiling limitations during the 12-month period ended June 30,
2016. Such impairment charges reduced the net capitalized costs subject to future DD&A calculations.
Accordingly, our DD&A rate per BOE decreased as we reduced the net capitalized costs by the quarterly
impairment charges.
Impairment of oil and gas properties. During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we
recorded impairment charges related to our oil and gas properties of $2.6 million and $3.2 million,
respectively, because the net capitalized costs were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation.  These
quarterly impairment charges were primarily due to the deepening declines in the price realized from the
sale of oil during the 18-month period ended June 30, 2016. Presented below are the weighted average
prices (before applying the impact of basis differentials between the benchmark prices and the actual
prices realized for our wells) used to prepare our reserve estimates and to calculate our Full Cost Ceiling
limitations for each of the last six calendar quarters, along with the impairment charges recognized
during each of those quarters (dollars in thousands, except average prices):

General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was attributable to (i) a
reduction of $0.5 million in compensation and benefits, which was driven by the termination of all except
one employee by December 31, 2015, (ii) a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $0.1
million, which primarily resulted from the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock
associated with employees who terminated employment in 2015, and (iii) a reduction in insurance, rent
and other expenses of $0.1 million. These decreases, which totaled $0.7 million, were partially offset by
an increase in professional services of $0.2 million which was driven by incremental costs as we
replaced some of the services previously performed by employees with consultants. Professional
services for the three months ended June 30, 2016 also include one-time charges of approximately $0.1
million to effect the reverse stock split that was approved by shareholders on June 20, 2016.

We had a realized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 compared to a loss of $25,000 for the comparable period in 2015. We had an unrealized loss on oil
price risk derivatives of $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $0.3
million for the comparable period in 2015. The realized gains during the three months ended June 30,
2016 result from the significant decline in the market for crude oil after we entered into the derivative
contracts. The change in unrealized gains or losses results from changes in the fair value of the
derivatives as commodity prices increase or decrease. Unrealized losses also result in the months when
derivative contracts are settled in cash whereby previously unrealized gains become realized gains.
Similarly, unrealized gains are recognized in the months when derivative contracts are settled in cash
whereby previously unrealized losses become realized losses.
For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a gain of $0.1 million from the sale of certain
data that was generated from previous exploration activities. We did not have any cost basis in the data
which resulted in a gain for the entire amount of the consideration received.
Interest expense did not change significantly during the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to
the comparable period in 2015. Interest rates charged under our revolving line of credit only increased
slightly for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.
Discontinued Operations. In February 2016, we completed the disposition of our mining segment to
MEM, including the Keystone Mine, the WTP and other related properties. A significant objective for
completing the disposition was to improve future profitability through the elimination of the obligations to
operate the WTP and mine holding costs, which are expected to result in estimated annual cash savings
of approximately $3.0 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we began to realize the
benefits of this disposition as aggregate operating expenses associated with the discontinued mining
segment declined by $0.7 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2015.
-25-
Due to the disposition in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued
operations for all periods presented in this report.
Comparison of our Statements of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015
During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $14.8 million as compared to a
net loss of $30.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our loss from continuing operations
was $12.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $28.5 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2015. In the following sections we discuss our revenue, operating expenses, non-
operating income (expense), and discontinued operations for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015.

The decrease in our oil sales of $2.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the
six months ended June 30, 2015, resulted from a 29% reduction in our oil production quantity and a 31%
reduction in the average oil price realized. The decrease in our natural gas and liquids sales of $0.2
million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, was
driven by a 23% decrease in our natural gas and liquids production and an 8% decrease in the average
price realized. The reduction in our net realized oil price is reflective of the dramatic decrease in global
commodity prices during 2015 which has intensified during 2016. During the last year, the differential
between West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) quoted prices for crude oil and the prices we realize for sales
in the Williston Basin was approximately $8.00 per barrel. We expect this differential to continue (with the
amount of the differential varying over time) and that our oil sales revenue will be affected by lower
realized prices from this region.
For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we produced 121,643 BOE, or an average of 668 BOE per day,
as compared to 167,845 BOE or 927 BOE per day during the comparable period in 2015. This 28%
reduction was attributable to several factors, including (i) the normal decline in production for wells in the
area of our properties, (ii) we did not add significant reserves from drilling or acquisitions over the past
year, and (iii) in this low price environment operators have an incentive to scale back production until
prices recover.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, production taxes decreased by $0.2 million compared to the
comparable period in 2015. Substantially all of this decrease in production taxes resulted from lower oil
and gas sales. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, lease operating expense decreased by $1.2
million, which was primarily due to the implementation of cost reduction strategies by the operators of our
wells. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, lease operating expense includes $0.3 million for
workovers that were implemented to maintain production levels. We expect further well by well
decreases as cost reduction programs continue during the industry downturn.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization. Our DD&A rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was
$13.53 per BOE compared to $29.37 per BOE for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Our DD&A rate
can fluctuate as a result of changes in drilling and completion costs, impairments, divestitures, changes
in the mix of our production, the underlying proved reserve volumes and estimated costs to drill and
complete proved undeveloped reserves. The primary factor that resulted in a reduction in our DD&A rate
for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $63.6 million of aggregate quarterly impairment charges that
resulted from our quarterly Full Cost Ceiling limitations during 2015 and for the first quarter of 2016.
During each of the four quarters in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we recognized impairment charges
which reduced the net capitalized costs subject to future DD&A calculations. Accordingly, our DD&A rate
per BOE decreased as we reduced the net capitalized costs by the quarterly impairment charges
discussed below.
Impairment of oil and gas properties. During the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded
impairment charges related to our oil and gas properties of $9.6 million and $22.4 million, respectively,
because the net capitalized costs were in excess of the Full Cost Ceiling limitation.  These quarterly
impairment charges were primarily due to the deepening declines in the price realized from oil sales
during the 18-month period ended June 30, 2016. Additionally, during the six months ended June 30,
2016, we determined that unevaluated properties were impaired for approximately $1.0 million.
Accordingly, we transferred these costs to the full cost pool which contributed to the Full Cost Ceiling
limitation for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

General and administrative expenses decreased by $1.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016
compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease was attributable to (i) a reduction of
$1.2 million in compensation and benefits, which was driven by the termination of all except one
employee by December 31, 2015, (ii) a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million,
which primarily resulted from the acceleration of vesting of stock options and restricted stock associated
with employees who terminated employment in 2015, and (iii) a reduction in insurance, rent and other
expenses of $0.2 million. These decreases which totaled $1.6 million were partially offset by an increase
in professional services of $0.2 million which was driven by incremental costs as we replaced some of
the services previously performed by employees with consultants. Professional services for the three

We had a realized gain on oil price risk derivatives of $1.3 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016 compared to a loss of $0.1 million for the comparable period in 2015. We had an unrealized loss on
oil price risk derivatives of $1.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a loss of
$0.3 million for the comparable period in 2015. The realized gains during the six months ended June 30,
2016 result from the significant decline in the market for crude oil after we entered into the derivative
contracts. The change in unrealized gains or losses results from changes in the fair value of the
derivatives as commodity prices increase or decrease. Unrealized losses also result in the months when
derivative contracts are settled in cash whereby previously unrealized gains become realized gains.
Similarly, unrealized gains are recognized in the months when derivative contracts are settled in cash

For the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recognized a gain of $0.1 million from the sale of certain
data that was generated from previous exploration activities. We did not have any cost basis in the data
which resulted in a gain for the entire amount of the consideration received.
Interest expense increased by $0.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the
comparable period in 2015. This increase was attributable to the amortization of a debt issuance cost
incurred in 2015 for $0.1 million when we determined that this source of financing would no longer be
pursued.
Discontinued Operations. In February 2016 we completed the disposition of our mining segment to MEM,
including the Keystone Mine, the WTP and other related properties. A significant objective for completing
the disposition was to improve future profitability through the elimination of the obligations to operate the
WTP and mine holding costs, which are expected to result in estimated annual cash savings of $3.0
million. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we began to realize the benefits of this disposition
as aggregate operating expenses associated with the discontinued mining segment declined from $1.4
million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 to $0.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, a
decrease of $1.0 million or 73%.
In order to induce MEM to assume the Company’s obligations to operate the WTP we needed to issue
additional consideration in the form of 50,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. We
recorded the fair value of the Preferred Stock based on the initial liquidation preference of $2.0 million.
Since the cash consideration paid by MEM for the Preferred Stock was $500, we recorded a charge to
discontinued operations of approximately $2.0 million associated with the issuance. In connection with
the disposition, we also incurred professional fees of $0.1 million for the six months ended June 30,
2016.
Due to the disposition in February 2016, all of our mining properties are included in discontinued
operations for all periods presented in this report. As of December 31, 2015, we recognized an
impairment charge of $22.6 million when we determined that the carrying value of the mining property
assets could not be recovered.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures- Adjusted EBITDAX
Adjusted EBITDAX represents income (loss) from continuing operations excluding impairments,
depreciation, depletion and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss on investments and
other non-operating income or expense, income taxes, unrealized derivative gains and losses, interest
expense, exploration expense, and other items set forth in the table below. Adjusted EBITDAX excludes
certain items that we believe affect the comparability of operating results and can exclude items that are
generally one-time in nature or whose timing and/or amount cannot be reasonably estimated, such as the
employee severance charges incurred in 2015.
-28-
Adjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP measure that is presented because we believe it provides useful
additional information to investors and analysts as a performance measure. In addition, adjusted
EBITDAX is widely used by professional research analysts and others in the valuation, comparison, and
investment recommendations of companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, and
many investors use the published research of industry research analysts in making investment decisions.
Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income
(loss) from operations, net cash provided by operating activities, or profitability or liquidity measures
prepared under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDAX excludes some, but not all items that affect net
income (loss) and may vary among companies, the adjusted EBITDAX amounts presented may not be
comparable to similar metrics of other companies. In addition, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Energy One
LLC, is also subject to a debt to adjusted EBITDAX ratio as one of the financial covenants under its credit
agreement. The calculation of EBITDAX for purposes of the credit agreement differs from our financial
reporting definition.

As of June 30, 2016, we have a working capital deficit of $9.5 million compared to a working capital
deficit of $9.8 million as of December 31, 2015, an improvement of $0.3 million. This improvement was
primarily attributable to a reduction in current liabilities of $2.5 million, partially offset by a reduction in
current assets by $2.2 million.
-29-
The reduction in our total assets is primarily associated with our net loss of $14.8 million during the six
months ended June 30, 2016, as discussed under Results of Operations herein. The reduction in our
shareholders’ equity is primarily associated with our net loss of $14.8 million during the six months
ended June 30, 2016, partially offset by the issuance of $2.0 million of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, as discussed under Results of Operations herein.
Our sole source of debt financing is a revolving credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (“Wells
Fargo”). With lower oil and gas prices during 2015, Wells Fargo decreased the borrowing base by $18.5
million to $6.0 million, which is the borrowing base in effect as of June 30, 2016. Outstanding borrowings
as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $6.0 million, and we did not have any unused
borrowing availability at either date.
During 2015 and 2016, we violated certain financial ratio covenants in our credit agreement. In July
2015, Wells Fargo agreed to enter into a third amendment to the credit agreement and provide waivers
for our non-compliance with the financial ratio covenants for the fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2015 and
September 30, 2015. In April 2016, Wells Fargo provided a waiver for our non-compliance with the
covenants for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015. In August 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to enter
into a fourth amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the credit agreement. The Fourth Amendment
provides for, among other things: (i) a limited waiver of the negative financial covenants as it relates to
the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, (ii) implementation of a new negative
covenant that prohibits the Company’s consolidated general and administrative expenses (as defined)
from exceeding $3.0 million for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017, (iii) an
extension of the next borrowing base redetermination until December 1, 2016, and (iv) the pledge of
additional collateral, consisting of certain real estate assets and our shares of Anfield Resources, Inc.
common stock.
We believe that Wells Fargo will not demand repayment until an alternative lender can be obtained and
we expect that Wells Fargo will continue to work with us as we attempt to obtain alternative sources of
financing. However, no assurance can be provided and we are continuing to classify this debt as a
current liability as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, due to our expectation that further non-
compliance with our financial ratio covenants is likely for the third quarter of 2016. The ongoing
availability of borrowings under this credit agreement through the maturity date of July 30, 2017, or our
receipt of funding from alternative sources, is critical to our ability to survive until oil and gas prices
recover.
During 2015 and 2014, we received significant overpayments due to an operator’s failure to timely
recognize the payout implications of our joint operating agreements. During the second quarter of 2015,
the operator corrected its records and has elected to begin withholding the net revenues from all of our
wells that it operates to recover these overpayments. As of June 30, 2016, the balance of the
overpayment was approximately $3.3 million. Based on the oil and gas prices and costs used to
calculate our estimated reserves as of June 30, 2016, this liability is not expected to be fully settled, but
under higher pricing scenarios we expect the entire liability will be repaid. Accordingly, the aggregate
overpayment liability is presented as a current liability in our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015.
We believe certain operators have failed to allocate our share of non-consent ownership interests, which
results in contingent liabilities to the extent we have not been billed for our proportionate share of such
interests, and contingent assets to the extent that we have not received our share of the net revenues.
We record net contingent liabilities for the obligations that we believe are probable, which amounted to
$3.6 million as of June 30, 2016. The ultimate resolution of these uncertainties about our working
interests and net revenue interests can extend over a long period of time and we cannot provide any
assurance that these matters will be resolved within the next year.
Since September 2015, we completed the following actions which are expected to improve our operating
results in 2016 and beyond to enable our survival and begin to grow our oil and gas reserve base:
During the third quarter of 2015, we began to implement restructuring actions to reduce corporate
overhead through a reduction in the size of the Company’s workforce from 14 employees at the end of
2014 to one employee by January 2016. Additionally, in December 2015 we completed a move of our
·
corporate headquarters to Denver, Colorado for better access to financial services and to improve
access to oil and gas deal flow. We expect our restructuring and other cost-cutting actions will result in
an overhead reduction of approximately $4.0 million on an annualized basis.
In February 2016, we completed the disposition of our mining segment, including the Keystone Mine, a
related water treatment plant and other related properties. A significant objective for completing the
disposition was to improve future profitability. Following the disposition, we are no longer required to
·
operate the water treatment plant and will not be responsible for mine holding costs, which are expected
to result in estimated annual cash savings of $3.0 million. We believe the disposition of our mining
segment is a major step in the transformation of the Company to solely focus on our existing oil and gas
business.
-30-
As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and equivalents of $1.4 million. We believe approximately $7.0 million
of annualized administrative overhead and mining expense reductions have poised the Company to
survive the current low commodity price environment. We also expect our new singular industry focus,
combined with attractive producing properties and a low-cost overhead structure, will make the Company
an attractive vehicle to partner with for potential investors and lenders during this industry downturn and
low commodity price environment. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete
future transactions on acceptable terms or at all.
We are projecting capital expenditures of $1.0 million in 2017 and $3.8 million in 2018 for estimated
drilling costs associated with our proved undeveloped oil and gas properties. In July 2016, we entered
into a non-binding letter of intent to continue negotiations with IronHorse Resources LLC (“IronHorse”)
pursuant to which we may obtain the right to acquire a 40% interest in a farmout agreement to participate
in developing three core areas in the Wattenberg Field in Weld County, Colorado. A member of our
board of directors has an ownership interest in IronHorse and no assurance can be provided that a
formal agreement will be entered into. If a formal participation agreement is entered into, our commitment
for drilling and completing the wells is expected to cost approximately $9.6 million. This development
program is slated to begin in the fourth quarter of 2016 with drilling to continue until the middle of 2017.
The specific timing of these expenditures is controlled by the operators of the respective properties and
can change based on a variety of economic and operating conditions. Additionally, our long-term
strategy is to acquire additional oil and gas properties at attractive prices. Our ability to finance our
planned capital expenditures and our ability to acquire additional producing properties is contingent
upon our ability to repay $6.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our Wells Fargo credit agreement
and to obtain alternative sources of financing. In order to reduce the financing commitments needed to
carry out our plans, we intend to pursue sales of non-core assets to generate near-term liquidity.
Alternatives that we intend to pursue include selling or joint venturing an interest in some of our oil and
gas assets, selling our real estate assets in Wyoming, selling our marketable equity securities, issuing
shares of our common stock for cash or as consideration for acquisitions, and other alternatives, as we
determine how to best fund our capital programs and meet our financial obligations.
Our capital expenditure plan and our ability to obtain sufficient funding to make anticipated capital
expenditures and satisfy our financial obligations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties,
including the risk of continued low commodity prices or further reductions in those prices, the risk that
future breaches of covenants in our credit agreement will not be waived and will result in liquidation,
bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the risk that we will be unable to enter into additional financing
arrangements on acceptable terms or at all, and numerous other risks, including those discussed in Risk
Factors in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q
as filed with the SEC.

Operating Activities. Cash used by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.4
million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $3.5 million for the comparable period in
2015, a decrease of $4.9 million. This decrease is primarily related to the cash impact between the
periods caused by (i) reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and (ii) lower oil and gas
sales receivable due to lower oil and gas prices.
Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.1
million as compared to cash used in investing activities of $2.1 million for the comparable period in 2015.
The primary use of cash in our investing activities for 2015 was for capital expenditures for our oil and
gas drilling activities.
Financing Activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, our financing cash flows consisted
primarily of payments of $24,000 for debt issuance costs related to our Wells Fargo credit agreement. We
did not have any financing cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015.
Discontinued Operations. Cash used in our discontinued operations was $0.4 million for the six months
ended June 30, 2016 as compared to $1.4 million for the comparable period in 2015, an improvement of
$1.0 million. The improvement in 2016 was due to the disposition of our discontinued mining segment in
February 2016 as discussed above.
Off-balance Sheet Arrangements
As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate relationships with
unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance
or special purpose entities (“SPEs”), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
We evaluate our transactions to determine if any variable interest entities exist. If it is determined that we
are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, that entity will be consolidated in our consolidated
financial statements. We have not been involved in any unconsolidated SPE transactions during the
periods covered by this report.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
As of June 30, 2016, the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and principal
financial officer, completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act).  Based on that
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer concluded:
That the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure (a) that information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and
i.
forms, and (b) that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management,
including the Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure; and
ii. That the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
During the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal control over
financial reporting that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
control over financial reporting.

PART II – OTHER INFORMATION
Item 1.  Legal Proceedings
Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from the legal proceedings as previously
disclosed in Item 3 of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended.
Employment Claim. A former at-will employee has asserted a claim that a change of control occurred and
he was involuntarily terminated without cause, thereby entitling him to compensation under a purported
Executive Severance and Non-Compete agreement (the “Agreement”). The Company claims that the
Agreement is invalid because it was never authorized by the Board of Directors or ratified by the
Company’s shareholders. Furthermore, the Company contends that no change of control occurred that
would entitle the former at-will employee to benefits under the Agreement. The former employee has
claimed that the Company owes up to $1.8 million under the Agreement which requires that any disputes
be submitted to binding arbitration. A request for arbitration was submitted by the former employee in
March 2016 and, on April 15, 2016, the Company filed a complaint in Denver District Court seeking a
stay of the arbitration and/or preliminary injunction against the employee from proceeding with the
arbitration. As a result, administration of the arbitration proceeding was suspended until the outcome of
the Company’s complaint could be resolved. On August 12, 2016, the Court refused to stay the
arbitration or grant the Company a preliminary injunction on the grounds that the Agreement had not
been authorized by the Board of Directors or ratified by the Company’s shareholders and the Court
ordered the parties to proceed with the arbitration.
