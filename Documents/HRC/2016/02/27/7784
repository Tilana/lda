<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation 
submits the present report in accordance with Human Rights Council resolutions 16/2 and 
21/2. Focusing on sustainability in the realization the human rights to water and sanitation, 
the Special Rapporteur examines how the rights to water and sanitation can and must be 
met for present and future generations. She highlights challenges to sustainability and 
particularly aggravated risks in times of economic and financial crisis. After addressing the 
relevance of sustainability to the core human rights concepts of &#8220;progressive realization&#8221; 
and &#8220;non-retrogression&#8221;, the Special Rapporteur explains how the normative content and 
principles of the human rights to water and sanitation contribute to ensuring sustainability. 
</p>
<p> Using the human rights framework, the Special Rapporteur analyses States&#8217; 
common approaches to water and sanitation, particularly in adopting measures both during 
times of normalcy and during economic and financial crises, and shows how those 
approaches often fail to incorporate sustainability. She then demonstrates that the human 
rights framework can and should facilitate improvement in such policies. A key finding of 
the report is that developing policies and programmes in accordance with human rights 
standards and principles will ensure that such measures will last for future generations &#8211; 
they will stand the test of time.

<p><b> I. Introduction  
</b></p>
<p>1. The present report is submitted to the Human Rights Council by the Special 
Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation in accordance with 
Human Rights Council resolutions 16/2 and 21/2. The focus is on sustainability in realizing 
the human rights to water and sanitation.  
</p>
<p>2. In preparing the report the Special Rapporteur engaged in a wide consultative 
process, which included numerous written contributions received from States and others, 
and the holding of a multi-stakeholder expert consultation. She is grateful to all those who 
contributed with their time and expertise.  
</p>
<p>3. While the benefits of access to safe water and sanitation have been widely 
pronounced, the international community is currently failing to ensure the availability of 
safe water and sanitation for all, without discrimination, including for future generations. 
About 1.8 billion people are estimated to lack access to safe water,1 2.5 billion have no 
toilets, septic tanks, piped sewer systems or other means of improved sanitation and about 
1.1 billion people still practice open defecation.2 
</p>
<p>4. Moreover, while the Millennium Development Goals target calls for sustainable 
access, the monitoring framework not only fails to capture this dimension, but to some 
extent provides an incentive for quick solutions that have proven unsustainable in the long 
term. In a period of 20 years, more than 180,000 hand pumps installed in rural sub-Saharan 
Africa failed prematurely, representing a total failed investment of between $1.2 billion and 
$1.5 billion;3 if all of the pumps had continued to work, 70 million more people would have 
had access to water.4 Data available for some regions show that between 35 and 80 per cent 
of water systems, such as hand pumps, were not functioning at the time the data was 
collected. 5  Similar problems arise with sanitation, as various wastewater plants have 
stopped being operational a short time after their construction.6 Deteriorating water and 
sanitation infrastructure, compounded by rapid urbanization and insufficient maintenance, 
causes yearly water losses of between 250 million to 500 million cubic metres in many 
megacities&#8217; supply systems.7 However these &#8220;slippages&#8221; are not systematically monitored 
globally. 
</p>
<p>5. Another dimension that challenges sustainability is increasing water scarcity. In 
2010, nearly all megacities were facing water scarcity.8 As the world population continues 
to grow, so has the demand for water: water withdrawals tripled over the last 50 years and

<p>demand for water for food production is projected to double by 2050.9 With the existing 
climate change scenario, almost half of the world population will be living in areas of high 
water stress by 2030.10 Even under conditions of water scarcity, global water availability is 
sufficient to meet the personal and domestic needs of all human beings. However, since the 
overall demand for water from all sectors exceeds availability, prioritization of uses 
becomes all the more important. 
</p>
<p>6. This lack of access to safe water and sanitation has severe human costs, such as poor 
health, as well as major economic losses &#8211; an estimated US$ 260 billion lost yearly due to 
lack of access to sanitation alone.11 Conversely, it is estimated that in developing regions 
the return on a US$ 1 investment in water and sanitation was in the range of US$ 5 to 
US$ 28.12  
</p><p>7. As these examples illustrate, the world is facing enormous challenges in the area of 
safe water and sanitation, as regards not only improving access but also ensuring quality 
and sustainability. The difficulties are compounded by the effects of climate change, a 
decrease in financial resources and the ever-growing demands for water, which put 
additional stress on resources. Urgent efforts and a change of mindset are needed. Without 
modifications in practices and policies the situation will only deteriorate. In the present 
report, the Special Rapporteur demonstrates that integrating sustainability is key to securing 
the human rights to water and sanitation, today and for future generations.  
</p>
<p>8. The Special Rapporteur considers this report to be especially timely, in particular 
given that many countries are currently facing periods of crisis. Austerity measures are 
being implemented all over the world, with significant impacts on the realization of human 
rights. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that States often do not use the policy space 
they have to protect human rights, but follow a strict course of budget consolidation with 
austerity measures that often have a disproportionate impact on those who are already 
disadvantaged in society. She also considers that the impacts currently felt represent only 
the tip of the iceberg. Challenges to sustainability and retrogressions in the water and 
sanitation sector run much deeper, and examining merely the impacts of the crisis 
underestimates the challenges faced. The Special Rapporteur therefore seeks to address 
such challenges holistically, both in times of economic growth and in times of economic 
crisis. In doing so, she underscores that States have an obligation to address challenges to 
sustainability at all times, which would in turn help them to be better prepared for times of 
crisis. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Sustainability and the human rights to water and sanitation 
</b></p>
<p>9. The Special Rapporteur considers the concept of sustainability to be non-dissociable 
from human rights law, in particular from the scope and content of the International 
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Along with the core human rights

<p>principles of participation and empowerment, accountability, non-discrimination and 
equality, transparency and access to information, she deems sustainability to be a human 
rights principle fundamental for the realization of human rights.  
</p>
<p>10. The subsections below explore the links between sustainability and the obligation of 
States to progressively realize the rights to water and sanitation using maximum available 
resources, the principle of non-retrogression, and the human rights principle of non-
discrimination.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Progressive realization and the use of maximum available resources 
</b></p>
<p>11. Article 2, paragraph 1, of the Covenant requires States to take steps progressively to 
realize economic, social and cultural rights. Such steps should be deliberate, concrete and 
targeted as clearly as possible towards meeting the obligations recognized in the 
Covenant.13 States have an obligation to move as expeditiously and effectively as possible 
towards the goal of full realization, using the maximum available resources. 14  The 
Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights affirmed the link between this 
obligation of progressive realization (meaning that States must achieve rights over the long 
term), and the way progressive realization of the right to water &#8220;must also be sustainable, 
ensuring that the right can be realized for present and future generations&#8221;.15 In fact, the 
spirit of all international human rights instruments is &#8220;intergenerational&#8221;: human rights 
instruments do not have expiration dates.  
</p>
<p>12. The Committee also interprets the Covenant as imposing &#8220;minimum core 
obligations&#8221; to provide essential levels of each right,16 below which States are not permitted 
to regress. These are not static obligations, set at a single point in time. Rather, they must be 
considered over the long term, including with respect to the requirements of future 
generations. The Covenant obliges States to plan to ensure that a minimum level of each 
right will be enjoyed by all in years to come. Also, even if resources are highly constrained, 
such as during financial or economic crises, measures taken must include the use of 
targeted programmes aimed at those most at risk.17 
</p>
<p><b> B. The principle of non-retrogression and austerity measures  
</b></p>
<p>13. A failure to take steps to progressively realize human rights would be contrary to 
States&#8217; obligations under the Covenant.18 A &#8220;strong presumption&#8221; exists that retrogressive 
measures are prohibited. 19  States must be careful to ensure that certain restraints and 
safeguards are met when considering such measures. To do otherwise undermines the 
raison d&#8217;&#234;tre of the Covenant.  
</p>
<p>14. A retrogressive measure is one that, directly or indirectly, leads to backward steps in 
the enjoyment of human rights. Examples include raising the price of services 
disproportionately so that poor people can no longer afford water and sanitation, and letting

<p>infrastructure deteriorate due to a lack of investment in operation and maintenance.20 In 
times of financial and economic crisis, retrogressive measures are more common and their 
impacts often exacerbated by austerity measures.21  
</p>
<p>15. From a human rights standpoint, retrogressive measures are prohibited if they 
deliberately interfere with the progressive realization of rights.22 States must justify such 
measures according the following criteria: 
</p>
<p>(a) There must be a reasonable justification for the steps taken and the 
subsequent regression in the implementation of rights.23 The measure must be necessary 
and proportionate24 &#8220;in the sense that the adoption of any other policy, or a failure to act, 
would be more detrimental&#8221;25 to human rights. The State must prove the measures were 
&#8220;introduced after the most careful consideration of all alternatives and that they are justified 
by reference to the totality of rights&#8221;;26   
</p>
<p>(b) In addition to meeting core obligations as a matter of priority, maximum 
available resources must be fully used to progressively realize all levels of human rights in 
a way that guards against retrogressive steps or impacts and/or maintaining the status quo.27 
A social protection floor, especially for disadvantaged and marginalized groups and 
individuals, should ensure access to basic social services, shelter, food, water and 
sanitation, and empowerment and protection of the poor and vulnerable (A/HRC/13/38, 
paras. 21 and 25); 
</p>
<p>(c) Measures must not be discriminatory. 28  Even where resources are tightly 
constrained, for example during times of austerity, targeted programmes aimed at those 
most at risk are needed.29 Policies and legislation should not be designed to benefit already 
advantaged groups at the expense of others;30  
</p>
<p>(d) Meaningful participation of affected groups and individuals in examining 
proposed measures and alternatives is required when considering a retrogressive measure;31  
</p>
<p>(e) Retrogressive measures should be temporary and short term in nature 
(E/C.12/ISL/CO/4, para. 6). Where implemented in times of crisis, they should cover only 
the period of the crisis;32 
</p>
<p>(f) There should be accountability mechanisms in place that ensure the 
possibility of independent review of the measures at a national level33 and provide access to 
remedies for victims of rights violations;

<p>(g) The State has the burden of proof regarding compliance with the above 
criteria.34 <b> 
</b></p>
<p>16. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has addressed 
retrogression mainly in the context of decisions by States to adopt austerity measures that 
may have a negative impact on the realization of human rights.35 Hence, its focus has been 
on criticizing measures that are deliberately retrogressive.36 However, in line with the scope 
of her report, which examines not only times of crisis, but also broader challenges of 
ensuring sustainability in times of economic growth, the Special Rapporteur considers it 
necessary to look at retrogression more broadly. Even if not deliberately regressive, some 
State acts, as well as omissions, may have a retrogressive effect. Where States fail to ensure 
adequate operation and maintenance, where they fail to implement adequate mechanisms 
for regulation, monitoring and sector oversight, or where they fail to build and strengthen 
their capacity in the long term, the result may be unsustainable interventions that lead to 
slippages in access to water and sanitation and retrogression in the realization of the human 
rights to water and sanitation. While such retrogression cannot always be avoided, the 
human rights framework puts forward certain requirements for States even where 
retrogression is non-deliberate: States must act with care and deliberation, exercise due 
diligence to assess the impacts of their actions and omissions on the realization of human 
rights, and adjust their policies and measures as soon as they become aware that current 
policies might lead to unsustainable results. 
</p>
<p>17. There is a clear link between non-retrogression and sustainability. Acts or omissions 
that result in retrogressions in the progressive realization of the rights to water and 
sanitation jeopardize sustainability. Unless the criteria outlined above have been satisfied 
during the States&#8217; decision-making processes, it is unlikely that such processes will result in 
the sustainable provision of water and sanitation. Rather, retrogressive steps will perpetuate 
unsustainable practices and create a constant threat to the full realization of economic, 
social and cultural rights in general and the rights to water and sanitation in particular.   
</p>
<p><b> C. The human rights principle of sustainability   
</b></p>
<p>18. Since the 1980s, the international community has repeatedly emphasized that 
development must be sustainable and must protect the environment on which present and 
future generations depend.37  The common definition of &#8220;sustainable development&#8221; was 
established in the landmark report of the World Commission on Environment and 
Development entitled &#8220;Our common future&#8221; (A/42/427, annex). It underlines striking a 
balance among three mutually reinforcing dimensions &#8211; economic, social and 
environmental &#8211; while &#8220;meet[ing] the need of the present without compromising the ability 
of future generations to meet their own needs&#8221; (ibid., para. 27). 
</p>
<p>19. More recent expressions of sustainability continue to recognize these three 
interdependent dimensions. In the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on 
Sustainable Development (Rio+20), entitled &#8220;The future we want&#8221;, States reaffirmed the 
need to achieve sustainable development by promoting inclusive and equitable economic 
growth, promoting respect for all human rights, reducing inequalities, raising basic 
standards of living, fostering equitable social development and inclusion, and promoting the

 37 See, for example, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development.  </p>


<p>integrated and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems that support 
economic, social and human development.38 The Special Rapporteur has made use of the 
notion of sustainability for her analysis in various thematic and country mission reports,39 
and has also identified sustainability as one of the criteria that serve to identify good 
practices for the realization of the rights to water and sanitation (see A/HRC/15/31/Add.1).  
</p>
<p>20. Based on these human rights principles and taking into account the different 
dimensions of sustainable development, the Special Rapporteur puts forward a holistic 
understanding of sustainability as the direct counterpart to retrogression. In order for 
services to be sustainable, they must be available and accessible to everyone on a 
continuous and predictable basis, without discrimination. There must be &#8220;permanent 
beneficial change&#8221; that flows from quality services and sustained behavioural change,40 or, 
in human rights terms, progressive realization towards fully realizing the human rights to 
water and sanitation for everyone. Once services and facilities have been improved, the 
positive change must be maintained and slippages or retrogression must be avoided. 41 
Services must be available for present and future generations and the provision of services 
today should not compromise the ability of future generations to realize the human rights to 
water and sanitation (A/HRC/15/31/Add.1, para. 65).  
</p>
<p>21. Sustainability is more than mere reliability or functionality, and requires a balance of 
its different dimensions. Water and sanitation must be provided in a way that respects the 
natural environment; finite resources must be protected and overexploitation cannot occur.42 
Likewise, the economic and social dimensions have to be balanced: while service provision 
relies on raising sufficient revenue, this must be achieved in such a way as to ensure 
affordability for all people in society, including those living in poverty. 
</p>
<p>22. The provision of services and systems should be properly planned in a strategic 
manner, such that ongoing assessments of risks across the entire infrastructure are 
conducted. Services and systems must be appropriately financed for their full life cycle,43 
including for operation, maintenance, repair and replacement. Technology must be 
appropriate for the given need and must also be appropriately maintained.44  
</p>
<p>23. To enable the sustainable provision of services, a number of factors within and 
beyond the water and sanitation sector must be reinforced, in particular, accountable 
governance. Water and sanitation services must be embedded in a sound legislative policy 
and regulatory framework.45 Institutions involved in the water and sanitation sectors must 
be responsive and accountable for their actions, and decisions must be participatory and 
transparent. All groups and individuals concerned and all relevant stakeholders must be 
provided with genuine opportunities to meaningfully participate and must be empowered in 
these processes.

<p><b> D. Sustainability and the principle of non-discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>24. States must actively and immediately ensure that the principle of non-discrimination 
is upheld in decisions and practices relating to the rights to water and sanitation. This 
principle requires States to eliminate both formal and substantive discrimination on all 
prohibited grounds46 and requires the adoption of positive measures where necessary to 
dismantle unequal access to water and sanitation. Lack of sustainability, slippages and 
backward steps will primarily affect the most marginalized members of society, since they 
will often lack the means to adjust, a necessary voice, visibility, and access to mechanisms 
of redress. Moreover, the elimination of inequalities is essential to ensuring sustainable 
water and sanitation, as inequality can also be destructive to growth, amplifies the risk of 
crisis and makes it difficult for the poor to invest in water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Betraying present and future generations: failure to 
incorporate sustainability in times of economic growth and 
crisis 
</b></p>
<p>25. In this section the Special Rapporteur outlines approaches taken by States that fail to 
incorporate sustainability in the water and sanitation sectors in times of economic growth as 
well as during times of crises when sustainability is under an aggravated threat. If even in 
times of economic growth States fail to adopt the necessary measures and policies to make 
sure sustainability and human rights are protected, sustainability will be at risk. This risk 
will occur not only in the wake of an economic crisis, but might be present even in times of 
economic growth. In both cases, the State is at the origin of impermissible retrogressions 
(by action or by inaction, voluntary or involuntary) of the human rights to water and 
sanitation.   
</p>
<p><b> A. Inadequate planning and institutional fragmentation 
</b></p>
<p>26. The importance of effective planning has been elucidated many times,47 but a lack of 
planning and institutional coordination for the long-term realization of the rights to water 
and sanitation persists. Competencies for water and sanitation are often spread both 
horizontally (falling within the auspices of many national authorities) and vertically (shared 
between central, regional and local governments). Other actors also have a relevant role to 
play &#8211; as public or private service providers, international donors, regulators or civil society 
organizations.   
</p>
<p>27. During periods of growth, States should plan for the long-term realization of the 
rights to water and sanitation, so as to ensure the prioritization of water for personal and 
domestic uses, and avoid duplication of efforts and waste of resources, as well as a power 
vacuum where no institutional responsibility is assigned for water and sanitation. While 
there are challenges, including differing priorities between institutions, corruption, power 
struggles, lack of consideration for operation and maintenance, and lack of independent 
regulation, monitoring and accountability (see A/HRC/18/33), these are more easily 
addressed in times of economic growth, as States do not act under time pressure and have 
more resources available. Establishing well-functioning water and sanitation systems in 
good economic times will help to withstand the additional pressure on scarce resources 
during times of crisis.

<p><b> B.  Insufficient financing and inadequate targeting of funding  
</b></p>
<p>28. Challenges related to financing pose significant threats to sustainability (see 
A/66/255). The current global landscape is rife with rapidly deteriorating infrastructure48 
and with insufficient funding for operating and maintaining these systems. It is estimated 
that the costs of replacing ageing water supply and sanitation infrastructure in developed 
countries may be as high as US$ 200 billion a year.49 Underfunding is a present-day issue 
and a major restriction on the ability to provide sustainable water and sanitation. This is 
exacerbated during times of crisis.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Reductions in spending 
</b></p>
<p>29. Where States reduce funding for water and sanitation, there can be major 
consequences for sustainability, both in growth and crisis periods. Reduction in expenditure 
can take many forms, such as reducing subsidies to people with low incomes or divesting 
from the monitoring of service provision. Private sector service providers may also 
diminish spending, in response to a decrease in revenues as a result of cuts in subsidies or 
increasing number of users unable to pay for water and sanitation services due to loss of 
jobs or social benefits in times of crisis. 
</p>
<p>30. Cuts to public spending particularly affect the poorest and most marginalized, who 
tend to receive a higher proportion of their income from social security benefits, rely 
heavily on public services, and spend a higher proportion of their income on basic 
services.50 Decreases in social spending lead to decreasing social subsidies, which hitherto 
enabled people to access to affordable water and sanitation. Thus people may be confronted 
with the dilemma of having to choose between food, water and medicine, which 
undermines the realization of their human rights.  
</p>
<p>31. Since 2010 cuts in public expenditure have been the most common reaction to the 
crisis in Europe. Budget consolidation plans have been introduced, inter alia, in Ireland, 
Greece, Portugal and Spain, with decreased public expenditure programmes introduced at 
the request of the European Central Bank, the European Commission, and the International 
Monetary Fund.51  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Increased prices and unaffordability-related disconnections 
</b></p>
<p>32. Water sector reform often leads to increases in water prices, as can be seen from the 
recent examples in the United States of America and around Europe.52 Even though these 
price rises might be indispensable to ensure sustainability, such decisions need to be 
carefully considered during times of economic and financial crisis because increases occur

<p>when people have the least personal resources to adjust. Price increases are instituted 
concurrent with rising unemployment and social spending reductions, leaving many unable 
to afford essential services. This may lead to disconnections by service providers or to 
private individuals cancelling their water provision contracts (see A/HRC/18/33/Add.4, 
para. 50). Water unaffordability also can lead people to seek alternative and potentially 
unsafe water sources. Overall, these circumstances undermine the sustainability of systems, 
by reducing the number of users of the network or giving rise to a spiral of rising prices to 
compensate for the number of consumers lost.  
</p>
<p><b> 3. Budgeting 
</b></p>
<p>33. The Special Rapporteur has previously discussed some of the gaps that arise in 
financing and budgeting for the water and sanitation sectors, which all affect the ability of 
States to provide water and sanitation in a sustainable way (see A/66/255). 
</p>
<p>34. Insufficient budgeting for the water and sanitation sectors which fails to prioritize 
the most marginalized people, a lack of overview of all resources (both national and 
international) devoted to the sectors and a lack of national budgeting that incorporates a 
long-term perspective and in particular operation and maintenance costs, jeopardizes 
sustainable provision. In times of economic growth, developing new water and sanitation 
infrastructure has often been prioritized. However, planning and budgeting to ensure that 
existing infrastructure or new infrastructure remains functional does not often take into 
account recurrent operation and maintenance costs. Instead of devoting the necessary 75 per 
cent of water and sanitation funds to operation and maintenance, on average only 31 per 
cent is devoted to these recurrent costs.53 
</p>
<p>35. The lack of budgeting for operation and maintenance raises some important 
questions about sustainability: will there be enough specialized human resources to look 
after the investments made, are there spare parts available, and do providers have the 
resources and capacity to operate and maintain the infrastructure?  
</p>
<p>36. Often States fail to adopt a tariff structure which is both affordable and promotes 
enough revenue to ensure financial sustainability. In most urban public water systems, 
charges often barely cover the recurrent costs of operation and maintenance, leaving little 
or no funds to recover the capital costs of modernization and expansion. A survey of such 
systems in 132 cities in high-, middle- and low-income countries found that 39 per cent did 
not recover even their operation and maintenance costs.54 The impact of decreased spending 
then threatens the sustainability of water systems as lack of reinvestment leads to 
deterioration of the system and leakages, and the low level of investment in the water sector 
hampers growth. In rural areas neglect of operation and maintenance budgets and cost 
recovery contribute to widespread non-functionality. 55  Accessibility and quality are 
compromised because of limitations on services, lack of expansion and lack of 
maintenance. Affordability is also affected because funds that would have been available 
before the financial downturn have been decreased or reallocated, and therefore prices to 
the user increase to cover the shortfall. 
</p>
<p>37. States must allocate funding to operation and maintenance in times of stability to 
ensure that systems and facilities do not deteriorate.56 Not doing so creates a significant risk

<p>that in times of crisis the upkeep of systems will deteriorate to a point where previous 
investments in the infrastructure are lost.  
</p>
<p><b> 4. Foreign aid: low levels and ineffectiveness 
</b></p>
<p>38. Adding to the challenges, particularly in developing countries, decreases in foreign 
aid in times of economic crisis have restricted the ability of States to sustainably realize the 
rights to water and sanitation. The Special Rapporteur has previously outlined shortfalls in, 
and ineffective targeting of, overseas development aid (see A/66/255). These problems are 
exacerbated in times of crisis as donor countries decrease aid, unless additional measures 
are taken to ensure that marginalized people are prioritized in the allocation of the 
remaining aid. 
</p>
<p>39. Development assistance and cooperation fluctuate with donor countries&#8217; fiscal 
policies and public spending priorities. Data published by OECD shows that official 
development assistance provided by members of the Development Assistance Committee 
of OECD fell by nearly 3 per cent (to 133.5 billion) in 2011 compared to 2010. This was 
the first drop in assistance since 1997.57 While the water and sanitation sectors have not 
been as affected by decreasing aid commitments as other sectors, commitments to 
sanitation and water were already lower than those for most social sectors.58  
</p>
<p>40. Since the start of the global financial crisis, the majority of European countries have 
cut their aid budgets; for example, Ireland announced a cut of nearly &#8364;100 million (a 10.6 
per cent decrease) in its 2009 budget and Spain cut its aid budget globally by approximately 
75 per cent. For the poorest countries, sustainable and predictable flows of funds are 
therefore unlikely to be forthcoming at least until the recession is over. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Challenges in non-State service provision 
</b></p>
<p>41. Human rights are neutral as to economic models and modes of service delivery. 
States may involve non-State actors in service provision, including private service 
providers, donors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). However, the delegation 
of water and sanitation service delivery does not exempt the State from its human rights 
obligations, including acting in a sustainable manner. Irrespective of the responsibilities of 
non-State service providers, the State remains the primary duty-bearer for the realization of 
human rights.  
</p>
<p><b> 1. Service provision by donors and non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>42. While support and participation of donors and NGOs in water and sanitation service 
delivery is welcome, there are challenges to sustainability when they become service 
providers and questions of accountability and transparency arise. A key risk to 
sustainability is the fact that few NGOs provide services on a permanent or long-term basis. 
Most usually disengage from projects after a certain period, which may have negative 
impacts on the long-term viability of services if no proper sustainability strategy is put in 
place. Even with the best of intentions, these systems may be responding to immediate and 
concrete needs to the detriment of building a system that can remain functional over time. 
While providing immediate access is important, it is equally central to guarantee long-term 
operation and maintenance, and to plan with government and communities for phased exits

<p>and local ownership. The lack of long-term focus has been linked to a lack of political 
incentives, particularly for donors, to put resources towards maintaining existing 
infrastructure, over building new ones that give better visibility for their investment and 
support. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Private service provision 
</b></p>
<p>43. Austerity measures are often accompanied by calls for increased private sector 
participation, including in the water and sanitation sectors, as a means for governments to 
raise revenue. The Special Rapporteur has previously outlined key challenges from a 
human rights perspective relating to private water and sanitation service provision (see 
A/HRC/15/31). 
</p>
<p>44. While certain safeguards are in place in several countries to protect consumers, for 
example from disconnections due to non-payment of bills in cases of inability to pay, there 
remain concerns relating to sustainability. Often profits made by private operators are 
almost fully distributed among shareholders, rather than being partially reinvested in 
maintaining and extending service provision, the result being increased prices for 
consumers, continued need for public investment, and potentially unsustainable services. 
For instance, when contracts fail to incorporate minimum levels of spending on operation 
and maintenance of systems, this affects their sustainability.  
</p>
<p>45. Private service provision can also create concerns for other important human rights 
principles and standards, such as the principles of participation and accountability. During 
the current crisis, private sector participation in public services delivery, including in water 
provision, has been a condition for bailout packages signed with indebted countries.59 Once 
the decision to privatize has been made, and especially in the context of economic crisis, 
the process of selling the assets often does not include sufficient opportunities for 
meaningful public participation. 
</p>
<p><b> D.  Inappropriate technology choices 
</b></p>
<p>46. Choosing the right technology is essential to achieving sustainability of water and 
sanitation services. While human rights law does not call for or reject any specific type of 
technology, States have often made wrong or inappropriate decisions to invest in 
technology that is either too costly or complicated; uses too much water or too much 
electricity; is very cheap, but does not last; or is inappropriate in a given context, not taking 
into account cultural or other preferences. One example is the installation of flush toilets in 
water-scarce regions, which people are forced to stop using after a certain time 
(A/HRC/21/42/Add.3, para. 33). 
</p>
<p>47. During one country mission, the Special Rapporteur witnessed a donor-led solution 
responding to limited freshwater availability that has led to the installment of desalination 
plants, despite few successes. The operation and maintenance of desalination plants is 
costly and requires a high level of technical capacity. On isolated small islands, solely 
relying on desalination plants for water provision is unsustainable but the strategy continues 
to attract donors and Governments (see A/HRC/24/44/Add.1). In another country, the 
Special Rapporteur learned about decisions taken by municipalities to invest in 
conventional centralized systems in areas of low population density, the results being high 
per-household costs, when small-scale on-site systems could be significantly cheaper and 
</p>
<p>

</p>

<p>more sustainable (A/HRC/18/33/Add.4, paras. 25-27). In times of crisis the impact of past 
inappropriate decisions becomes visible.  
</p>
<p><b> E. Lack of meaningful participation 
</b></p>
<p>48. Ensuring participation proves to be a consistent challenge, and lack of participation has 
negative impacts on sustainability. Such challenges are exacerbated in times of crisis, where 
the State seeks to avoid the financial costs of participation and is under time pressure to adopt 
austerity-related measures. However, States are never exempted from their human rights 
obligations, including the duty to give people the opportunity to pronounce themselves on 
issues that concern them. Where meaningful participation does not occur, States often 
misunderstand the barriers to access, and fail to pinpoint how these barriers might be 
overcome. Lack of participatory processes might result in choices which might simply be 
unacceptable to the people they aim to serve, hence condemning the said solutions to 
unsustainability, as they may not be used at all or people might revert to old habits after using 
the new services for a while. During her mission to Tuvalu the Special Rapporteur witnessed 
a change of perception among the general public concerning previously rejected eco-
sanitation solutions, attributable to a new participatory approach comprising education, 
awareness-raising to address misconceptions, and a redesign of the toilets 
(A/HRC/24/44/Add.2, para. 30).  
</p>
<p>49. Furthermore, States might put in place decision-making processes without ensuring 
meaningful participation by the most disadvantaged, who generally tend to have less ability 
to voice their opinions and needs. This will have an impact on the use and sustainability of 
decisions aimed at ensuring water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p><b> F. A pattern of neglect of the most vulnerable and marginalized 
</b></p>
<p>50. What emerges from the above is a pattern of neglect of the needs of the most 
vulnerable and marginalized groups in society across planning, institutional responsibilities 
and resource allocation. Disadvantaged groups can often be identified along ethnic, 
geographic, and socioeconomic divides (see, for example, A/HRC/18/33/Add.4, para. 79). 
Indigenous peoples, Dalits and Roma are among such groups facing discrimination with 
whom the Special Rapporteur has met during the course of her mandate.60 Moreover, there 
are vast gender inequalities &#8211; in many poor communities, the task of collecting water 
overwhelmingly falls to women and girls (see, for example, A/HRC/15/31/Add.3 and 
Corr.1, para. 22). Persons with disabilities are also disproportionately represented among 
those lacking access to water and sanitation (A/HRC/15/55, para. 21). Neglect can occur for 
a variety of reasons: groups and individuals may experience stigmatization, they may live 
in remote areas making serving them costly, or politicians may be indifferent to their needs.  
</p>
<p>51. Such inequality tends to become even more aggravated during crises. With a 
decrease in budget and personal incomes, people are confronted with the need to prioritize 
among different human rights. Furthermore, in times of crisis there will be an even greater 
temptation for States and service providers to focus on those who are relatively easy to 
reach, and no efforts will be made to reach the most marginalized people living, for 
instance, in remote rural areas. 
</p>
<p>52. Neglecting the rights of marginalized people violates human rights law and its 
fundamental principle of non-discrimination. Moreover, doing so might render services 
unsustainable. When a water and sanitation system is designed for a city or town with a 
</p>
<p>  
 60 See A/HRC/12/24/Add.1, para. 48, A/HRC/15/55, para. 25, A/HRC/18/33/Add.2, para. 33. </p>


<p>certain number of inhabitants, ignoring the affordability challenges faced by poorer people 
will mean these people will eventually be disconnected from services. Those numbers can 
rise significantly in times of crisis; in such cases the system becomes unsustainable and 
underfunded, unless tariffs increase for those who stay connected (which in turn might lead 
to more disconnections). On the other hand, the inclusion of those previously excluded 
from water and sanitation networks, such as slum dwellers, will bring more revenues to the 
system and promote a more sustainable use of water resources, as everybody will contribute 
to paying for the system. In many instances, paying regular tariffs will be significantly 
more affordable to people than paying for informal services at often exorbitant prices. 
Finally, from an environmental perspective, extending networked provision also contributes 
to sustainability as unauthorized abstraction from groundwater sources will be significantly 
reduced. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Lack of monitoring, regulation and accountability  
</b></p>
<p>53. Monitoring and data collection are essential in giving States a basis for planning and 
budgeting, and ensuring informed decisions. In a large number of States, information 
systems for financial planning and reporting are still inadequate. 61  Monitoring the 
sustainability of interventions is generally insufficient, including in the framework of the 
Millennium Development Goals. This creates a major gap in the ability of States to 
understand what policies, infrastructure and service delivery practices are able to last and 
be effective in the long term, as well as the negative consequences of certain (in)action.  
</p>
<p>54. For service provision to be sustainable, States must utilize effective monitoring and 
data collection practices. Monitoring the effects of decisions made and steps taken enables 
accountability and allows States to assess which decisions and processes produced quality 
impactful outcomes, which is useful for informing future decisions that are sustainable. 
</p>
<p>55. A related issue is that of independent regulation and accountability mechanisms: 
lack of regulation undermines sustainable investment in the water and sanitation sectors. 
Where States fail to establish regulatory and accountability mechanisms when the economy 
is going well, they open the door to corruption and to risks that the realization of the rights 
to water and sanitation might be jeopardized, and such abuses might go unnoticed by 
authorities. Accountability is essential for closing the loop and bringing unsustainable 
practices to the public eye and exerting pressure on authorities. However, accountability 
cannot be ensured if national human rights institutions have no mandate or capacity to deal 
with economic, social and cultural rights, or if such rights are not considered justiciable.  
</p>
<p>56. In times of crisis, accountability may weaken even further when existing regulatory 
institutions become underfunded. Examples exist of independent regulators receiving 
reduced funding to perform more functions, creating concerns about how the regulator 
could effectively fulfil its mandate and ensure accountability.62 This can happen in times of 
either growth or crisis, but the consequences are greater when other accountability 
mechanisms are removed due to financial pressures. For example, under various different 
austerity measures, judges are paid less, civil servants are laid off, and resources for courts, 
</p>
<p>  
 61 <i>GLAAS Report</i>, p. 25. For example, over 60 per cent of countries surveyed either have no financial 
</p>
<p>information management systems in place or the one used provides only partial information (ibid., p. 33).  
 62 For example, in the context of the austerity measures, the 2013 Portuguese budget foresees budget 
</p>
<p>freezes of between 10 and 60 per cent; the country&#8217;s water and wastewater regulator is suffering a 
decrease in funding for operational expenses of approximately 32 per cent in 2013, while its 
competences have recently increased.  </p>


<p>police, and national human rights institutions, which are all important for accountability, 
are decreased.63 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Adopting measures compliant with human rights 
</b></p>
<p>57. This section illustrates the contribution that human rights, including the 
incorporation of sustainability, can have in providing safe and affordable water and 
sanitation to all, both in times of economic growth and in times of crisis.  
</p>
<p><b> A. Use of well-targeted fiscal policies and devoting maximum available 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources  
</b></p>
<p>58. States cannot expect to meet the obligation to progressively realize human rights 
with minimal investments in the water and sanitation sectors that merely enable countries to 
make &#8220;some&#8221; progress over time. Human rights standards demand that States invest the 
&#8220;maximum available resources&#8221; in the sectors. They also require the use of resources in 
ways that have the greatest possible impact on achieving universal realization of these 
rights, by prioritizing essential levels of access to the most marginalized. In times of 
prosperity, spending on water and sanitation has to include planning, independent 
monitoring, establishment of accountability mechanisms, and operation and maintenance, 
so as to enable the progressive realization of the rights even during times of crisis, hence 
preventing slippages and retrogression.  
</p>
<p>59. From a human rights perspective it is crucial to balance economic and social 
sustainability. The human rights framework does not require that water and sanitation 
services be provided free of charge, and State revenues have to be raised in order to ensure 
universal access to services. If everyone obtained water and sanitation at no cost this would 
actually harm low-income households by depriving governments and service providers of 
the revenue needed to expand and maintain the service, jeopardizing the overall economic 
sustainability of the system and the State&#8217;s capacity to protect and fulfil other human rights. 
</p>
<p>However, implementing the human rights to water and sanitation has important 
implications as to how to raise revenues while ensuring social sustainability. They oblige 
States to ensure that the cost of accessing water and sanitation remains affordable and 
appropriately reflects the needs of marginalized and vulnerable groups, and that there is a 
safety net in place for those who cannot afford to pay full costs. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Use of maximum available resources 
</b></p>
<p>60. The obligation of States to progressively realize the rights to water and sanitation 
through the use of maximum available resources, including through international 
cooperation and assistance, is essential to achieving sustainability. &#8220;Lack of resources&#8221; is 
</p>
<p>sometimes invoked by States to justify insufficient and inadequate investments for the 
sector, when often the true reason is the lack of political will to prioritize social services, 
and in particular water and sanitation for the most disadvantaged. Thus it is important to 
assess whether maximum available resources are truly being devoted to the sectors by 
examining the national allocation of funds to areas such as the military, bailouts for banks, 
</p>
<p>  
 63  See for example the situation in Spain: David Rom&#225;n, &#8220;Austerity adds to Spain&#8217;s jobless woes&#8221;,<i> Wall 
</i></p>
<p><i>Street Journal</i>, 29 April 2012. </p>


<p>and the construction of infrastructure for the hosting of mega-events, as well as the amount 
of funds lost due to the toleration of corruption.64  
</p>
<p>61. Comparing per capita incomes against water and sanitation indicators among 
countries with comparable levels of development provides a more objective benchmark. 
Analysing the magnitude, composition and distribution of resources allocated to the water 
and sanitation sectors,65 as well as the expenditure per capita, can help identify common 
policy problems that curtail the progressive realization of the rights to water and sanitation, 
as well as effective policy and strategies that have led to improvements in a specific area.  
</p>
<p><b> 2. Fiscal policies and taxes 
</b></p>
<p>62. During times of economic prosperity there will be more financial resources available 
to the State to maintain and develop the water and sanitation sectors than in times of 
economic and financial crisis. Yet, times of crisis per se do not inevitably lead to 
regressions in implementing the rights to water and sanitation. Fiscal austerity can be 
achieved not only by cutting government spending, but also by increasing government 
revenue. From a human rights perspective, a crucial question is how such revenue is raised. 
</p>
<p>63. Ensuring efficient tax systems that enable continued investments in the water and 
sanitation sectors contributes to sustainability and guards against impermissible 
retrogressions. Mobilizing tax revenue, in an appropriately targeted manner, is the 
responsibility of governments,66 and a way of implementing their human rights obligations. 
Methods such as assessing the effective tax rate (or tax to gross domestic product ratio) can 
be utilized to provide indicators for reviewing and benchmarking States, identifying failures 
in their efforts to mobilize resources to meet the need for a water and sanitation sector that 
is sustainable for all, forever. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Targeting of resources 
</b></p>
<p>64. The Special Rapporteur is aware that resources available to States are limited, 
despite efforts to mobilize revenue. As noted in a previous report (A/66/255, para. 41 ff), 
this highlights the need for appropriate targeting of available resources. Human rights 
principles give clear guidance on this: States should initially direct resources and efforts 
towards meeting obligations with immediate effect, for example, targeting the realization of 
the core content of the human rights to water and sanitation without discrimination and 
protecting existing access. One of the challenges highlighted above demonstrates this need 
for targeting of resources: while potentially necessary for long-term sustainability of the 
sector, the introduction of metred service delivery at cost price can have discriminatory 
effects. Thus the pricing of services (as well as taxation) needs to be targeted and 
appropriately adjusted for the most disadvantaged and for people living in poverty. For 
example, scarcity pricing, penalties or higher pricing structures for non-essential use, well-

<p>designed increasing-block tariffs, subsidies for those in need, 67  and institutional and 
distributive taxes,68 are all examples of approaches used to raise revenue and recover costs. 
These should be implemented in a fair manner that promotes sustainability and access for 
all to water and sanitation services. 
</p>
<p>65. Two of the biggest challenges in the sector are: ensuring sustainability (the 
dimension of &#8220;forever&#8221;) through, inter alia, the investment of sufficient resources in the 
operation, maintenance and rehabilitation of systems; and expanding services to those yet 
unserved (the dimension of &#8220;everyone&#8221;). As resources are scarce, policymakers, donors and 
</p>
<p>sector professionals perceive a dilemma of prioritizing &#8220;forever&#8221; or &#8220;everyone&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>66. It has been argued that the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing systems should 
be given priority in order to ensure that investments are not lost. The human rights 
framework stresses the imperative of achieving equality as well as the efficient use of 
resources. States must eliminate inequalities in access to water and sanitation and expand 
access to minimum essential service levels, to meet the core content of the human rights to 
water and sanitation, before improving service levels for those who already enjoy this level 
of access. If the available resources were to be invested only in maintaining existing 
systems, inequalities in access would never be overcome. 
</p>
<p>67. In many instances, this perceived dilemma of sustainability versus equality does not 
exist as such. Rather, both notions should complement each other, which requires 
appropriate planning in both the short and long term. True sustainability can be achieved 
only when everyone has access to services. Moreover, the consideration of equality needs 
to guide decision-making processes for both requirements: maintenance and rehabilitation 
as well as the expansion of services. Where it is decided to repair rather than newly build, 
how, when and where services are repaired or rehabilitated should be considered to ensure 
equality of access. When services are constructed or expanded, the financial and human 
resource requirements, including capacity-building and training, must also be planned for. 
And since slippages disproportionately affect excluded or marginalized communities, it is 
crucial to ensure that the &#8220;forever&#8221; dimension &#8211; including considerations of how operation 
and maintenance will be paid for and managed &#8211; is built into policymaking from the outset, 
so as to avoid discrimination and retrogression in realizing the rights. Investing in poor 
quality, low-cost options may not be best in the longer term, while some high quality, high-
technology options may also be a poor investment, particularly in situations where there is 
insufficient technical and financial capacity and limited access to spare parts to operate and 
maintain the system. 
</p>
<p>68. Decisions on the prioritization of resources can be taken only on a case-by-case 
basis that balances all resources and human needs. Decision makers need to determine the 
most appropriate use of funds to work towards both &#8220;forever&#8221; and &#8220;for everyone&#8221;, 
addressing inequalities wherever they occur. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights budgeting  
</b></p>
<p>69. Transparent budgeting is central to the realization of the rights to water and 
sanitation and all other human rights.69 It fosters accountability and public participation,

<p>and contributes to greater predictability and long-term planning. This has clear benefits for 
the sustainability of water and sanitation systems.  
</p>
<p>70. Transparency cannot be achieved by simply making budgets publicly available, but 
not making the data accessible. In order for members of affected communities and civil 
society to work together with governments to find workable long-term solutions that 
promote sustainability, there is also a need for education with respect to understanding 
budgets and budgetary processes, as well as true participation by affected communities in 
the decision-making processes. 
</p>
<p>71. The Social Justice Coalition in Cape Town provides an example of how budgeting 
in the water and sanitation sectors that incorporates transparency, education and 
participation can result in gains in sustainability and better implementation of the rights to 
water and sanitation.70  
</p>
<p><b> C. Effective planning towards people-centred service delivery: addressing 
</b></p>
<p><b>inequalities and discrimination 
</b></p>
<p>72. Planning processes that accord sufficient priority to the rights to water and sanitation 
help ensure sustainable results and strengthen accountability. A clearly articulated vision 
can serve as a firm foundation for prioritizing funding to the sector, and inspire confidence 
about spending. Such planning must target the elimination of inequalities: centring national 
planning in the water and sanitation sectors around the obligation of non-discrimination 
helps Governments ensure not only that the most marginalized people are able to access 
services, but also that such access is maintained in a sustainable manner.   
</p>
<p>73. One mechanism for achieving this is to establish social protection floors. Adequate 
planning must ensure that basic social security guarantees exist to enable access to essential 
social services. Social protection floors need to be a priority in periods of economic and 
financial growth and sustained in times of crisis. At the same time, when economic and 
financial crises strike, special measures to protect the most vulnerable must be set in place. 
</p>
<p>74. One way to minimize reliance on social protection floors during times of crisis is to 
ensure that inequalities are dealt with during times of growth as a matter of priority, 
ensuring that the sustainability of existing services is not an excuse to continue prioritizing 
provision to middle-class, urban formal residential areas to the detriment of extending 
coverage to informal settlements, remote or rural areas, and ensuring that existing gaps 
between the haves and have-nots are eliminated. 
</p>
<p>75. In India, the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board connected more than 5 
per cent of the city&#8217;s informal settlements to the network between 2000 and 2005. This 
initiative not only aimed at providing safe water for people living in informal settlements 
who were previously excluded from the formal network, but also reduced non-revenue 
water and decreased residents&#8217; dependency on free water through public taps or illegal 
connections. Even though challenges remain, connection costs and tariffs were adjusted to 
ensure affordability, leading to an increase in the revenue base and sustainability.71

<p><b> D. Ensuring participation and empowerment  
</b></p>
<p>76. The participation of concerned communities in decision-making processes is a 
human rights principle and a human right in itself. Some see it as a hurdle as it costs money 
and time. However, meaningful participation is also a guarantee of sustainability &#8211; as the 
integral basic sanitation (SABA) model in Peru or the safe water committees in Nicaragua 
have shown, the participation of communities in the design, construction, management and 
operation of services creates a greater willingness to use and to pay for water and 
sanitation, and better entrenches hygiene habits. True participation requires meaningful 
opportunities to freely and actively influence decisions, not mere superficial consultation or 
information sharing (A/HRC/18/33, paras. 68-69). Such a process entails providing 
information through multiple channels, enabling participation in transparent and inclusive 
processes, ensuring that funds are appropriately spent on interventions that are needed and 
strengthening the capacities of individuals and civil society to engage (ibid.).  
</p>
<p><b> E. Effective monitoring and independent regulation  
</b></p>
<p>77. A well-structured system of monitoring will incorporate indicators and collect 
disaggregated data to determine if access to water and sanitation is sustained and non-
discriminatory. Governments must look beyond the averages and aggregated data to 
consider inequalities based on where an individual lives, the wealth quintile he or she is in, 
to which ethnic group he or she belongs, and how other forms of discrimination affect him 
or her. Moreover they must monitor whether services are sustained, and in cases of slippage 
must collect information on the reasons for the latter. 
</p>
<p>78. Strong community-based monitoring strategies can improve how information is 
specifically disaggregated to identify marginalized groups and the reasons why 
retrogressions or slippages occur. This also promotes transparency, participation and 
accountability, as the community becomes more involved and information becomes easily 
accessible.   
</p>
<p>79. The monitoring of sustainability is not being undertaken in a systematic manner. 
Only 7 per cent of total investments in water are devoted to maintenance and monitoring;72 
and water systems are rarely visited after being built. One of the reasons for this lack of 
sustainability monitoring might reside in the fact that the Millennium Development Goals 
framework counts only the numbers of those who have gained access, ignoring whether 
anyone among those have lost access. 
</p>
<p>80. Donors increasingly advocate for comprehensive systems for monitoring the 
sustainability of water and sanitation interventions. Some seek to include a sustainability 
clause in their contracts with implementers as a means to verify whether sustainability 
criteria are being met. Similarly, the United Nations Children&#8217;s Fund (UNICEF) has 
developed sustainability checks aimed at auditing the water supply and open-defecation-
free status of communities after the project has ended. These checks examine several 
institutional, social, technical and financial indicators to measure sustainability. From a 
human rights perspective, it is crucial to complement such tools with equality criteria to 
ensure that all in society benefit. Moreover, such sustainability checks must not be 
perceived as a donor-driven initiative applied on a project level, but must be incorporated 
more broadly in the sector. 
</p>
<p>81. When it comes to the adoption of policies that might have a detrimental effect on the 
human rights to water and sanitation, ex ante and ex post human rights assessments are 
</p>
<p>  
 72 <i>GLAAS Report</i>, p. 4. </p>


<p>useful tools in monitoring implementation and guiding stakeholders. Before 
implementation, environmental, social and specific human rights impact assessments can 
help in deciding if proposed policies will have a retrogressive effect, or if they will be 
sustainable. Likewise, after implementation, ex post human rights impact assessments are 
an important tool that governments can use to discharge their obligation to monitor the 
implementation of the rights to water and sanitation. 
</p>
<p>82. Independent regulation to ensure water quality, accessibility, reliability and 
affordability is also key to implementing and monitoring the rights to water and sanitation. 
It is the role of a regulator to ensure a fair distribution of service coverage and promote a 
focus on serving the poorer neighbourhoods, since those residents are less likely to be able 
to gain access to water and sanitation services.  
</p>
<p><b> F. Accountability and justiciability 
</b></p>
<p>83. Sustainable, long-term realization of the rights to water and sanitation demands 
accountability. Accountability, likewise, is interrelated with and based on other principles, 
such as transparency, access to information and participation. Accountability requires 
States to provide effective remedies for breaches of the rights to water and sanitation. For 
this, a legal framework, appropriate policies, functioning institutions, and the necessary 
procedures and mechanisms must exist so that individuals and communities can seek 
redress and secure their rights to water and sanitation. The rights to water and sanitation are 
justiciable human rights, and should be recognized as such by governments and courts.   
</p>
<p>84. In the water and sanitation sectors, accountability can also be enhanced, and the 
sustainability of the sectors improved, by fighting corruption and opaque decision-making 
by agencies lacking transparency. There are a variety of ways that States can work to 
address this, inter alia through integrity pacts between NGOs such as Transparency 
International and government agencies,73 and broad-based partnerships, which, among other 
things, seek to improve accountability at a local level. National human rights institutions 
are also engaged in a number of activities which help to foster greater accountability in the 
sectors. Where such mechanisms are established during times of &#8220;normalcy&#8221;, they can be 
maintained during times of economic and financial crisis. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>85.<b> The Special Rapporteur considers sustainability to be a fundamental human 
rights principle essential for realizing the human rights to water and sanitation. She 
</b></p>
<p><b>understands sustainability as the direct counterpart to retrogression; it requires  that 
</b></p>
<p><b>services be available and accessible to everyone on an almost permanent basis, 
</b></p>
<p><b>without discrimination, while ensuring beneficial change through quality services and 
</b></p>
<p><b>sustained behavior change. Water and sanitation must be available for present and 
</b></p>
<p><b>future generations, and the provision of services today should not compromise the 
</b></p>
<p><b>future ability to realize these human rights. Understanding sustainability from a 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights perspective greatly contributes to achieving lasting solutions to water 
</b></p>
<p><b>and sanitation challenges for present and future generations.  
</b></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>and Sewerage Board. </p>


<p>86.<b> In line with the above, the Special Rapporteur recommends that States:
