<p><b>I.  INTRODUCTION 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants visited Mexico from 9 
to 15 March 2008. He visited Tapachula (Chiapas state), Tijuana (Baja California), and 
Mexico City (Federal District). The Special Rapporteur expresses his thanks to the Government 
of Mexico for its cooperation and assistance, and his appreciation to the Office of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and the International 
Organization for Migration (IOM) for their support.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur met with a number of ministries and agencies responsible for law 
enforcement, border control and the protection of migrants and their families at the federal, state 
and municipal levels, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, the 
Under-Secretariat of Population, Migration and Religious Affairs, the Ministry of Labour, 
Security and Social Services, the Ministry of Public Security, the National System for the 
Integral Development of the Family (DIF), and the National Institute of Migration (INM). He 
also engaged in a dialogue with the Senate. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur had a meeting with United Nations actors working on issues 
related to migration, held three civil society forums (one in each city visited) and met with the 
National Human Rights Commission and the Federal District Human Rights Commission. He 
spoke with a range of non-governmental actors involved directly in the protection of migrants 
(legal services, medical assistance and shelters) and in the investigation of issues related to the 
human rights of migrants, and expresses his appreciation to them for their time and resources. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur visited three governmental migration detention centres during his 
visit - the Migrant Holding Centre (Estaci&#243;n Migratoria) Iztapalapa in Mexico City, the Migrant 
Holding Centre of Tijuana and the Migrant Holding Centre Modelo Siglo XXI in Tapachula - to 
observe migrants&#8217; detention conditions and an official shelter for migrant children in Tapachula. 
The Special Rapporteur did a brief tour of the Mexico-Guatemala border near Tapachula, 
including the official border crossings of Talism&#225;n and Ciudad Hidalgo, with the assistance of 
the Beta Groups and the INM. 
</p>
<p>5. The present report analyses the protection of migrants&#8217; human rights in Mexico from a 
comprehensive perspective, placing Mexico in the context of regional migration flows with an 
emphasis on the dimensions of movement to the United States and from Central America. It 
highlights Mexico&#8217;s significant historical role in the promotion of the human rights of migrants 
at the international level and examines the protection afforded under the International 
Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families, to which Mexico is a party. It then refers to the legal framework on migrants&#8217; human 
rights at the federal level, underscoring significant implementation gaps, and noting problematic 
policies. 
</p>
<p>6. There follows an analysis of some groups in the Mexican migrant phenomenon, including 
the Mexican diaspora and deportees from the United States, migrant workers (in the agricultural 
and domestic spheres), migrant children, including unaccompanied minors, and child labour, and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 5 
 
</p>
<p>migrant women. Following that the Special Rapporteur draws attention to key migration 
challenges, including: border control and the detention of migrants, organized crime networks 
and impunity among governmental and law enforcement officials; and assistance to migrants. 
</p>
<p>7. Among his concerns, the Special Rapporteur notes reports of rampant impunity for 
instances of corruption, including bribery and extortion, and violence and abuse of labour 
practices, especially against women and children. Attention to the physical and psychological 
health of migrants seems to be of utmost urgency. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that this 
impunity seems to be linked to abuses of power and resources at the municipal, state and federal 
levels. As in the conclusions of his predecessor during her visit to Mexico in 2002 (see 
E/CN.4/2003/85/Add.2), the Special Rapporteur calls for an end to the dichotomy between what 
Mexican authorities and organizations ask for its own migrants abroad in terms of protection, 
and the type of treatment it offers to the foreign-born population in Mexico. 
</p>
<p>8. Based on these observations, the Special Rapporteur offers conclusions and 
recommendations to the Government of Mexico and to the United Nations. The 
Special Rapporteur, in formulating his recommendations, gives special attention to those made 
by his predecessor following her visit in 2002 and by the Committee on Migrant Workers in their 
concluding observations in 2006.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>II. INTERNATIONAL AND FEDERAL PROTECTION OF THE  
RIGHTS OF MIGRANTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  International protection of the rights of migrants 
</b></p>
<p>9. Based on Mexico&#8217;s history as a country of origin to the United States and as a transit 
country for northward movements, migration has long been a priority on the Government&#8217;s 
domestic and foreign policy agendas. At the international level, especially within the 
United Nations, Mexico has demonstrated its commitment to the promotion of the human rights 
of migrants and has encouraged the development of regional and international law in this respect. 
Mexico played a leading role in the establishment of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on 
the human rights of migrants by the Commission on Human Rights, a mandate renewed in 
June 2008 by the Human Rights Council. It also played an important role in the adoption of the 
paragraphs on migrants&#8217; rights in the Declaration and Programme of Action of the World 
Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance and in 
promoting the inclusion of a human rights perspective in the process leading up to the 
second Global Forum on Migration and Development, held in October 2008 (&#8220;the Manila 
process&#8221;). 
</p>
<p>10. Mexico is a party to most of the international and regional human rights treaties, and the 
Special Rapporteur notes that, since his predecessor&#8217;s visit in 2002, Mexico has ratified the 
following instruments: the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, 
</p>
<p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2

</p>
<p>Especially Women and Children, and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants By Land, 
Sea and Air, both supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational 
Organized Crime, ratified on 4 May and 4 March 2003, respectively; the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, 
ratified on 11 April 2005; the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified 
on 17 December 2007, and the Optional Protocol to the above Convention, ratified 
on 17 December 2007; and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, ratified on 18 March 2008. 
</p>
<p>11. Mexico has been one of the main promoters of the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families since the 
Government submitted the issue for discussion to the General Assembly of the United Nations 
in 1980. The Government of Mexico signed the Convention on 22 May 1991 and ratified it 
on 8 March 1999. The Convention was promulgated in Mexico&#8217;s <i>Diario Oficial</i> <i>de la 
Federaci&#243;n </i>on 13 August 1999 and entered into force on 1 July 2003. 
</p>
<p>12. Upon ratifying the Convention, Mexico stated in an interpretative declaration that it 
reaffirmed its political will to ensure international protection of the rights of all migrant workers 
in accordance with the Convention. It submitted its first periodic report for consideration by the 
Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their 
Families (CMW/C/MEX/1), in accordance with the provisional guidelines regarding the form 
and content of initial reports to be submitted by States Parties under article 73 of the Convention, 
adopted by the Committee at its informal meeting in October 2004. 
</p>
<p>13. Article 133 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States establishes that international 
treaties concluded by the President of the Republic, with the approval of the Senate, shall, 
together with the Constitution itself and the laws of the Congress of the Union, be the supreme 
law of the nation. Accordingly, the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of 
All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families forms part of domestic legislation and may 
be the basis and foundation of any legal action. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Federal legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>14. Despite Mexico&#8217;s leadership role at the international level in promoting a human rights 
framework for the protection of migrants, there remain significant gaps in its domestic legal 
framework, existing laws and practice. Although Mexico is a party to the Convention, it only 
recently - on 16 April 2008, subsequent to the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s visit - accepted the 
competency of the Committee on Migrant Workers to receive individual communications. This 
limits the Committee to review the practice of the Government of Mexico with regard to the 
protection of the rights of migrants. In its report to the Committee on Migrant Workers in 2006, 
the Government of Mexico recognized that absolute respect for the human rights of migrants is 
still a challenge for the country, since the existence of a legal framework envisaging strict 
respect for those rights does not per se guarantee the implementation of the Convention. 
</p>
<p>15. The federal legal framework regarding migration is provided by the Constitution of the 
United Mexican States (1917). Additionally, the General Population Act (1974) and its </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 7 
 
</p>
<p>Regulation (April 2000) establish the legal regime governing migration in Mexico for the 
purpose of regulating the volume, structure, and distribution of the population in the national 
territory. This law states that the Ministry of the Interior is in charge of setting the conditions for 
the entry and stay of foreigners in Mexico. The National Migration Institute (INM), which is 
under the Ministry of the Interior, is the institution in charge of carrying out migration policy. 
The INM and the Federal Preventive Police (PFP) are the agencies authorized to inspect the exit 
and entry of persons in Mexico. The authorities in charge of federal, state, or municipal public 
forces work in collaboration with the immigration authorities (through &#8220;collaboration 
agreements&#8221;). The Beta Migrant Protection Groups are a government-sponsored mechanism 
tasked with the responsibility for protecting and counselling migrants on the country&#8217;s northern 
and southern borders. 
</p>
<p>16. Article 11 of the Constitution of Mexico establishes the right of every person to enter, exit 
and travel within the territory of Mexico. Article 33 defines foreigners as those who are not 
Mexican by birth or adoption and provides that foreigners are covered by the guarantees of 
Chapter I, Title 1 of the Constitution, on, inter alia, the prohibition of slavery and the right to 
education. This article also authorizes the executive to make foreigners leave the national 
territory expeditiously and without any procedure when it is determined that their presence is 
&#8220;inadvisable&#8221;. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur reiterates the concern expressed during the 
concluding observations of the Committee on Migrant Workers in December 2006, which noted 
Mexico&#8217;s reservation to article 22, paragraph 4, of the Convention, given the fact that article 33 
of the Constitution stipulates that &#8220;the Executive has exclusive authority to expel from the 
national territory, immediately and without a judicial hearing, any foreigner whose residence in 
Mexico it deems undesirable&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>17. In addition to the Constitution, the most relevant legislation concerning migration in 
Mexico is the General Population Act and its Regulations governing the Ministry of the Interior 
and the decree establishing the National Institute of Migration, as mentioned. These laws and 
regulations govern migration procedures, establishing migrants&#8217; duties and the limits on their 
rights, but do not explicitly and exhaustively list the obligations of Mexico to protect the human 
rights of migrants. Rather, these rights are regulated by secondary laws. 
</p>
<p>18. Similar to his predecessor, the Special Rapporteur raised concerns during his visit about 
the long-discussed reform initiatives before Congress of the General Population Act. As noted by 
the Committee on Migrant Workers, these initiatives had not made much headway in Congress 
and that articles 118 to 125 of the General Population Act, which stipulate that infractions 
relating to migration may be subject to criminal proceedings, remained in force. This law 
criminalizes undocumented migrants (up to 10 years&#8217; imprisonment) and can even be applied to 
the victims of trafficking and smuggling. 
</p>
<p>19. Moreover, article 67 of the General Population Act only authorizes legally resident 
foreigners to institute legal proceedings. Although that provision does not affect the right of 
every migrant worker to an effective remedy in conformity with article 83 of the Convention on 
Migrant Workers, the Special Rapporteur echoes the concern raised by the Committee on 
Migrant Workers that this provision may in practice give rise to discriminatory treatment of 
undocumented migrant workers, which would limit their access to justice. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
page 8 
 
</p>
<p>20. During the mission the Special Rapporteur called on the Government of Mexico to 
reinstate the long-term process of reform of the General Population Act that would ensure that 
the most comprehensive protection would be afforded to migrants, whether documented or in a 
situation of irregular stay. As such, migrants would have the same rights as nationals of Mexico 
to file complaints and have access to redress mechanisms before the courts. 
</p>
<p>21. The Special Rapporteur takes special note of the subsequent efforts at revision following 
his visit, formalized on 22 July 2008, especially modifications passed by the Commission on 
Population and Development of the Senate of the Republic, to articles 118 and 125. He 
welcomes the efforts of the Senate to decriminalize irregular migration, making entering without 
documentation an administrative offence rather than criminal offence. He takes note of 
amendments to articles 19, 120, 121, 123, 124 and 127 of the Act that, inter alia, lessen penalties 
to migrants who enter Mexico without documentation. The Special Rapporteur emphasizes the 
landmark nature of such reforms, and calls on the Government of Mexico to implement them in 
accordance with international standards, especially the International Convention on the 
Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  THE MEXICAN MIGRANT PHENOMENON 
</b></p>
<p>22. The multidimensional complexity of the Mexican migrant phenomenon can only be 
understood if one views Mexico as a country of origin, transit and destination. Mexican 
migration to the United States has occurred for centuries, creating a notable Mexican diaspora 
and population of Mexican-Americans (also known as <i>chicanos</i>). Over 1 million people migrate 
to the United States annually, and the last survey by the U.S. Census Bureau (2003) on the 
foreign-born population in the country estimated that over 50 per cent of this population are from 
Mexico and Central America; many more attempt entry into the United States but are deported or 
deterred before entry, creating intense pressure at the United States-Mexico border - not only at 
border posts in Tijuana, Nogales, Nuevo Laredo and Ciudad Ju&#225;rez, but also in the more remote 
desert and river areas that border California, Arizona, Texas, and New Mexico, which are subject 
to increasing surveillance. 
</p>
<p>23. Mexico also receives a significant number of migrants, especially through the southern 
border, but due to its porosity it is impossible to know precisely how many migrants enter and 
for what reasons, whether for temporary stay (tourists and commercial traders), to use Mexico as 
a country of transit toward the United States, or to fill the labour gap in the agricultural industry, 
for example, left by the significant population of Mexicans who have departed. Rough estimates 
indicate that the number of these &#8220;southern&#8221; migrants could be around 400,000 in transit 
annually. According to INM, in the period from January to December 2007, 50,598 foreign 
nationals were detained in the southern border region and 45,785 were repatriated or deported. 
These flows create pressure on the Mexico-Guatemala border, not only at the crossings of 
Talism&#225;n and Ciudad Hidalgo, but also the unofficially regulated river and jungle crossings 
bordering Guatemala and Belize. 
</p>
<p>24. Within these general trends, one sees several dimensions of mixed migration flows: 
creation of a northward pattern of migration from Mexico to the United States; establishment of </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 9 
 
</p>
<p>Mexico as a country of transit for migrants from Central and South America and the Caribbean 
and, to a much lesser extent, Asia and Africa; and evolution of Mexico into a receiving 
country for labourers, traders, and as a central harbour for transnational gang operators using 
migration as a &#8220;business&#8221; (smuggling and trafficking in persons), often linked to drug and arms 
cartels. These flows contain a large number of migrant children (boys and girls), including 
unaccompanied minors, and a small number of asylum-seekers. Females (girls, adolescents and 
adults) are a notable portion of these migrants, which makes them vulnerable to abuses. 
</p>
<p>25. Also significant is the scope of internal movement within the country, characterized by 
both the migration of Mexicans from rural to urban areas and from various parts of the country to 
the borders, as well as the movement of the foreign-born population with the initial intention of 
northward transit but who remain in various parts of Mexico for longer than intended and 
become locally integrated. Agricultural day-labourers, especially from the southern states of 
Mexico, such as Oaxaca, Chiapas and Veracruz, form the greatest part of this movement and are 
largely responsible for harvesting tomato and apple crops, among others, in the northern states of 
Sinaloa, Sonora and Coahuila. These internal migrants, estimated at up to 3.5 million, the 
majority of whom are of indigenous origin, live on ranches or farms for months at a time, 
making rotations when needed on a seasonal basis. Their working conditions, standards of 
health, housing, transport and education are reported to be below international standards. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Mexican diaspora 
</b></p>
<p>26. Although this report focuses on Mexico as a country of transit and destination, Mexico has 
long been a country of origin with the majority of Mexican emigrants destined for the 
United States of America, and this dimension forms part of the general migration phenomenon of 
the country (see A/HRC/7/12/Add.2). It is estimated that more than 2.5 million Mexicans 
emigrated to the United States from 2000 to 2006, and approximately 560,000 in 2007. Figures 
indicate drops in emigration attempts in the first part of 2008, which may be related to the 
economic downturn and attendant rise in unemployment. While many Mexicans have made the 
United States their new home, have become legal permanent residents or naturalized citizens and 
gained from the education and employment opportunities in the country, the continued outward 
migration is a cause of concern for numerous reasons. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Risks for and abuses of Mexican migrants in the United States 
</b></p>
<p>27. Most importantly, as the United States has increased its border control policies (e.g. by 
erecting a wall along its southern border with Mexico, carrying out radar surveillance, and 
increasing its technical and human capacity to do roundups and arrest and detain undocumented 
migrants, inter alia), the journey that the average Mexican with irregular status makes to the 
United States has become more dangerous. According to the United States Border Patrol, 
roughly 4,000 migrants have died en route in the last 12 years, equivalent to about one death a 
day during the last decade. This startling number directly relates to the need for would-be 
migrants to undertake increasingly high-risk routes, which are often longer and involve 
traversing rough terrain in extreme temperatures. 
</p>
<p>28. Despite these risks, a significant portion of the Mexican population continues to attempt 
their migration northward without documentation. The United States has absorbed a high number </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
page 10 
 
</p>
<p>of low-skilled Mexican migrants, and migrants from Central and South America and the 
Caribbean who travel through Mexico en route, offering mostly employment in the low-skilled 
service, commercial, domestic and agricultural sectors. These migration flows fill a need on the 
demand side, and provide employment opportunities potentially unavailable in many migrants&#8217; 
countries of origin, but there are disadvantages for migrants with irregular status in the 
United States. It is estimated that their salaries are 60 per cent lower than those of citizens or 
migrants with regular status, and they are vulnerable to wrongful termination and xenophobic 
and discriminatory acts of violence with no recourse or remedy. During his visit, the 
Special Rapporteur noted that it was not only the responsibility of the Government of the 
United States and members of the private sector to be aware of and change these practices, but 
also that of the Government of Mexico to demand better conditions for their labour force in the 
diaspora, regardless of their status. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Transnational gang networks and deportation 
</b></p>
<p>29. Another dimension of the migration of the Mexican (and Central American) population is 
its relation to the spread of transnational gang networks, and related deportation policies. This 
has become a regional phenomenon, with many activities in the United States and in the border 
zones of Mexico and Central America, and a serious threat to peace. There are two main 
elements of this phenomenon of interest within the discussion on the human rights of migrants - 
one is the gang members themselves, who are often detained, arrested, abused and deported, and 
another is that the smuggling and trafficking of persons has become a business for many of the 
operators of these networks. 
</p>
<p>30. There is no agreement as to the precise origins or motivations of the gangs. Although there 
are numerous copycat or splinter youth gangs, the main components are divided into two rival 
gangs (or <i>maras</i>): Barrio 18 (also known as 18th Street gang) and Mara Salvatrucha (also known 
as MS-13). The majority of the members are males, in their teens or early twenties. They sustain 
themselves by organized crime networks of smuggling in drugs and persons and extortion. They 
are notorious for their violence (including beheadings and mutilation), kidnappings, violence 
against women and their increasing geographical and numerical pervasiveness. Reports estimate 
there are 70,000 to 100,000 members from as far south as Honduras, spreading north to Mexico 
and in increasing numbers on both coasts of the United States. One cannot overstate the regional 
dimension of this phenomenon and its consequences, with Mexico at the centre. 
</p>
<p>31. For those members who operate in the United States, many of them Mexican (but also 
El Salvadoran, Honduran, Nicaraguan and Guatemalan), the principal policy response of the 
United States Government (Department of Homeland Security and Federal Bureau of 
Investigation) has been either incarceration or deportation. The United States Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement bureau estimates that 70 per cent of gang members who are picked up by 
the police are deported; the members are often found in the United States without documentation 
and broadly linked to gang activity, yet sufficient evidence is often lacking to prosecute them of 
a specific crime. The United States Government therefore deports suspected gang members on a 
regular basis, flying weekly private jets of deportees and releasing them in their country of 
origin. Deportation further perpetuates the phenomenon and its cycle has been referred to as a </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 11 
 
</p>
<p>&#8220;revolving door&#8221;, a &#8220;merry-go-round&#8221; and an &#8220;unending chain&#8221;. Those deported to 
Central America often attempt to return to the United States, transiting through Mexico along the 
way, and often re-establishing operations with the gang networks during their journey. 
</p><p>32. Deportees are returned to their countries of origin stigmatized and with little assistance for 
integration and employment; some are not fluent in Spanish. They are, however, highly trained 
in sophisticated organized-crime techniques. With the large number of other deportees and 
continual communication with members remaining in the United States, they are often able to 
recreate or fortify existing gang networks with relative ease. And, because of the large number of 
disenfranchised youth in low-income neighbourhoods of the capital cities, deportees are able to 
find a plethora of new recruits. In Mexico, especially along the southern border with Guatemala, 
it is offshoots and affiliates of these networks that operate the majority of the smuggling and 
trafficking networks, and are responsible for the operation of the famed &#8220;train of death&#8221; (see 
chapter II.B above). 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Migrant workers 
</b></p>
<p>33. Mexico houses a large number of migrant workers in the agricultural sector and the 
domestic sphere. These workers are subject to the insecure circumstances described throughout 
the report, but warrant specific mention due to their particular situations. 
</p>
<p>34. Due to the high number of Mexican migrants going to the United States in search of better 
wages, there are large gaps left in the agricultural industry. These are specifically in the Mexican 
state of Chiapas, where the coffee plantations depend on the seasonal work of Central American 
labourers (<i>cafeteleros</i>), many from indigenous communities in Guatemala, as the 
Special Rapporteur noted after his mission there in 2008 (see A/HRC/11/7/Add.3). Although 
many are undocumented and therefore data may be unreliable, various reports estimate that there 
are between 250,000 and 300,000 such labourers in the state of Chiapas alone. Although 
Mexican wages are reportedly higher than in Guatemala, with some estimates at 50 per cent 
higher, the seasonal agricultural workers are still subject to low wages, excessive hours of work, 
and no overtime pay, depending on their migration status and employer. Coffee picking is a 
specialized field; the beans must be selected one by one and coffee plants often grow on steep 
hillsides where it is difficult to work. The harvested beans, collected in large baskets, must then 
be carried away on the labourers&#8217; backs for sorting and drying. 
</p>
<p>35. The Special Rapporteur has received reports of various abuses related to migrants&#8217; 
irregular status and sentiments of racism and xenophobia, such as overwork and wrongful 
termination. Of particular concern is the practice of employing child labour. There have been 
efforts between the Government of Mexico and the International Labour Organization to 
regularize the flow of seasonal workers, but many of the labour practices still occur without 
official involvement or oversight. The state of Chiapas is in the process of developing new 
programmes for assistance, including for medical care and education of families of agricultural 
workers, but there is much left to be done in the way of regularizing labour practices and 
providing recourse for abuses of migrant workers. 
</p>
<p>36. The clandestine abuse of domestic migrant workers (especially from Central America) is 
also a major issue, but there are few programmes to protect them and little data on their numbers </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
page 12 
 
</p>
<p>and nationality. As such, they may go largely unprotected and remain especially vulnerable to 
abuse. The Special Rapporteur received reports of wealthier Mexican families employing 
&#8220;servants&#8221; from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. Vague estimates state that, for example, 
there may be 1,000 El Salvadoran female domestic workers in Mexico City alone and hundreds 
of Guatemalan domestic workers in the Tapachula area, many of them below the age of 18 and 
from indigenous communities. Central American domestic workers reportedly earn significantly 
lower wages than their Mexican counterparts. 
</p>
<p>37. But these numbers are not substantiated with recent data, and the precise locations of most 
of these workers are unknown. The situation of domestic workers remains of particular concern 
because of its wholly unregulated nature and therefore warrants further research. Federal law to a 
certain extent protects workers in the domestic sphere, but labour authorities seem to be doing 
little to monitor the situation of domestic workers or implement the obligations placed on 
employers. Health and education standards seem to be disregarded. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Migrant children, including unaccompanied minors, and child labour 
</b></p>
<p>38. Migrant children including labourers (predominantly in the agricultural industries) and 
unaccompanied minors, is an issue of increasing concern in Mexico and a stated priority of the 
Government of Mexico. DIF estimates that there were 21,366 unaccompanied minor and 
adolescent migrants attended to in 2007. INM estimates there were a total of 17,558 Mexican 
unaccompanied minors (internal migrants) registered in the country in 2007. Both the northern 
and southern border regions pose an extremely high risk for children and adolescents. Traffickers 
and smugglers (<i>polleros </i>or <i>coyotes</i>) - many of them operators of gangs - take minors across the 
border, sometimes in order to reunite them with family members who have emigrated and 
sometimes to hand them over to exploiters. Many of these children are in need of international 
protection, since they are fleeing not only poverty but also <i>maras</i>, criminal groups, violence and 
abandonment by their families and society. They are returned to countries that lack adequate 
protection networks and where due attention is not given to their future reintegration; this 
exposes them to new risks of trafficking and exploitation. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Migrant children, including unaccompanied minors 
</b></p>
<p>39. Many migrant children are repatriated/deported back to their countries of origin. Of 
those deported in 2007, 47.46 per cent were Guatemalans, 36.85 per cent were 
Hondurans, 15.56 per cent were Salvadoran and 0.01 per cent were Nicaraguan. A total of 
24 minors (15 boys, 9 girls) applied for asylum in Tapachula, representing 10.71 per cent of total 
asylum-seekers. The majority of these children were accompanied by their parents. None of the 
children were recognized as refugees in Tapachula. 
</p>
<p>40. DIF is the principal governmental organization dealing with children; through 32 offices of 
DIF at the state level, it attempts to build capacity at the local level through child protection 
programmes, a network of 29 shelters and an expansive system of information-sharing on 
individual cases. It develops national child protection policies, as well as intervention and 
rehabilitation strategies for child victims, and provides shelter to migrant families and </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 13 
 
</p>
<p>unaccompanied minors. Also, the Ministry of Social Development implements policies to 
combat rural poverty (there are also a significant number of internal migrants, Mexican children 
who move within the country to work in the agricultural industries as young as age 6) and acute 
manifestations of urban poverty. These policies include immigrant support clubs, child-care 
facilities (schools or cr&#232;ches), social assistance and credit programmes in the poorest 
municipalities and activities to raise awareness among employers and migrant families of the 
need for children to attend school. This is of particular importance in the state of Chiapas, where 
there are many children of immigrant parents in the agricultural industry (mainly coffee 
plantations). 
</p>
<p>41. While the Special Rapporteur welcomes the many efforts being made by the Government 
of Mexico to focus on protecting the human rights of migrant children, including unaccompanied 
minors, he expresses various concerns. First of all, it is unclear that there is a uniform policy at 
the federal level or across states to protect migrant children. Despite clear standards established 
by the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Mexico is a party, the Special Rapporteur 
received inconsistent information about what age defined a &#8220;minor&#8221;, and therefore who deserve 
additional protection. This seemed to vary according to state and sex (i.e. there was a lower age 
for adulthood for boys, 13-15 in various cases, whereas girls could in certain circumstances be 
considered minors until age 17). Considering the mobility across states of many minors, and that 
there is no evidence to suggest that a 15-year-old boy would not need as much protection and 
assistance as a 15-year-old girl, for example, this policy leaves gaps for protection. This is 
especially important considering the high instances of violence towards girls and boys, including 
prostitution, other forms of sexual exploitation and trafficking (see A/HRC/7/12/Add.2). 
</p>
<p>42. Moreover, despite notable initiatives to attend to victims, Mexico has no effective 
centralized system to protect and provide assistance to children and adolescents who have been 
victims of offences of sexual exploitation or any form of trafficking. While shelters and holding 
centres have medical care available, the average stay of a minor can be a matter of days, even 
hours, limiting the types of long-term care necessary to treat the psychological and medical 
traumas associated with migrating. Social rehabilitation or reintegration programmes are 
practically non-existent. This lack of assistance to child victims of sexual exploitation and 
trafficking is one of the causes of re-victimization. Only 3 of the 31 Mexican states punish child 
prostitution as a serious offence. Although the Government of Mexico seems aware of what is 
necessary, there are gaps in capacity and resources, as well as impunity among law-enforcement 
officials, and more comprehensive policies for migrant children victimized by sexual offences or 
trafficking have yet to be developed. 
</p>
<p>43. Additionally, it is unclear from the visits of the Special Rapporteur to official government 
migrant-holding centres and shelters that children receive protection to the extent necessary 
while in the custody of Mexican authorities or during the return process. This raises questions 
about the length of stay, deportation procedures, relationship with consular officers, and 
reintegration and rehabilitation measures. While the state authorities seem to be making efforts 
to return children to their places of origin as soon as possible (some within hours), there were no 
clear signs that the children would be returned to a safe environment (not all children underwent 
an investigation of whether they were fleeing abuse) and whether, once they reached the border 
of their country of origin, that the journey to their home would be safe or that they would be safe 
upon arrival. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
page 14 
 
</p>
<p>44. In addition, during a visit to a shelter for migrant children in Tapachula, run by DIF in the 
state of Chiapas, the Special Rapporteur arrived at the centre, with a capacity to provide shelter 
for over 100 children, to find only 2 boys housed there. It was unclear why the shelter was 
empty, considering the significant number of migrant children found on the streets and that 
shelter space is limited. Information gathered at meetings suggested that authorities working with 
DIF in Chiapas, advised of the visit of the Special Rapporteur, removed the children housed in 
the shelter, and carried out extra preparations so that the shelter would be in good condition. It 
was suggested that, should any minors give the impression that their conditions were less than 
desirable, their absence would be ensured during the visit of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Child labour 
</b></p>
<p>45. Child labour is prohibited nationally as well as internationally. Nevertheless, the 
Special Rapporteur observed rampant violations of this prohibition, with regard to child migrants 
from other countries as well as those Mexican children who have migrated internally. Although 
figures are inconclusive due to the clandestine nature of child labour, it is estimated that more 
than 100,000 children (nationals and non-nationals) under the age of 16 work in the Mexican 
agricultural industry. This is evident in the western states on the Pacific coast of Mexico. 
Moreover, children under the age of 16 can be found working in the mining industry, as well as 
in domestic service in the central and southern parts of Mexico; alarming violations of the rights 
of girls in the domestic sphere were specifically reported. 
</p>
<p>46. These violations are acute in the case of indigenous Mexican children who have migrated 
internally and migrant minors from Guatemala. The Special Rapporteur heard accounts of a 
&#8220;word of mouth&#8221; labour market where employers exchanged information on where and how to 
buy &#8220;servants&#8221; in Tapachula to work in Mexico City, or in Guatemala to take across the northern 
border of Mexico. 
</p>
<p>47. Migrant children form part of a sobering phenomenon of street children and children 
engaged in prostitution, confirmed by the Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child 
prostitution and child pornography who visited Mexico in May 2007. In his report to the Human 
Rights Council (A/HRC/7/8/Add.2), the Special Rapporteur noted that &#8220;these problems should 
be viewed in the context of the pressures exerted on local society as a whole by the presence of a 
large immigrant population. The fact that more and more children are in the street, using drugs or 
involved in illegal migrant smuggling or drug trafficking only increases their vulnerability and 
exacerbates the likelihood of their becoming victims of sexual exploitation&#8221;.<b>2</b>  
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  The Special Rapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, 
</p>
<p>Juan Miguel Petit, visited bars and other popular night spots in Tijuana, both during the day and 
at night. He was informed that groups of minors were involved in the local sex trade and that 
there was a proliferation of other businesses employing minors who provided sexual services, 
such as massage parlours, beauty salons, spas and escort or modelling agencies. All of these 
operate outside the public health inspection system, since they are not registered as 
establishments providing sexual services. There is therefore no information on the number 
of minors employed and the conditions in which they work (see A/HRC/7/8/Add.2, 
paragraphs 47-59). </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 15 
 
</p>
<p>48. Migrant child labour is a pervasive phenomenon according to information received by the 
Special Rapporteur. But government efforts, especially at the state level, seem not to be 
commensurate with the high rates of its occurrence and the corrupt practices that permit its 
continuance. The Special Rapporteur welcomes recent efforts by the state of Chiapas, for 
example, to acknowledge the phenomenon and to combat it, but suggests that these efforts are 
inadequate. Not only a shift in consciousness about the reality and severity of the violations, but 
a more robust targeting of employers and recruiters, are in order. The first step is further 
investigation regarding the extent that migrant child labour is being used. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Migrant women 
</b></p>
<p>49. Migrant women are particularly vulnerable in Mexico. They form the majority of cases of 
harassment or abuse in detention, clandestine domestic workers (sometimes &#8220;servants&#8221;), 
prostitutes, sexual abuse and physical and sexual assault in smuggling operations. They are also 
the majority of victims of trafficking (the total estimated at 16,000 to 22,000 victims annually, 
including children) and there are unusually high rates of homicides of women, especially in such 
border towns as Ciudad Ju&#225;rez. Those women migrants who enter Mexico regularly or find 
decent work are often subject to a wage differential based on their sex, reported to be as much 
as 40 per cent lower than men of the same skill level. 
</p>
<p>50. According to INM, women migrants detained and deported from Mexico represent 
approximately 20 per cent of annual flows. While the majority of these women are from 
Central America (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador), some 5 per cent are from other 
Latin America countries and various parts of the world. The average stay in Mexico for women 
from Central America seems to be between two and seven days, while women from outside of 
Central America stay longer, generally from two weeks to three months or more, depending on 
their nationality, access to consular protection, and whether or not they had filed a legal claim. 
</p>
<p>51. According to reports from civil society organizations, there are recurrent incidents of 
women being treated with violence or aggressively by INM personnel when being transferred to 
detention centres and by staff upon arrival and during the duration of their stay. Some refer to 
aggressive and discriminatory comments, and others report physical mistreatment. There are few 
formal complaints, however, both because of fear of reprisal, or because there seems to be little 
knowledge about how to lodge a formal complaint. 
</p>
<p>52. Medical assistance to migrants, especially female-specific, seems to be lacking in some 
circumstances. Due to the stress that detention causes for women migrants, many become sick 
upon arrival at the detention centre and some seek to attend to injuries or illnesses incurred 
before or during the journey. Care and treatment related to sexual violence needs to be further 
developed and offered more pervasively. IOM has a programme in Tapachula to fill this gap and 
reports that there is a stigma attached to reporting incidences of sexual abuse. Although many 
women migrants flee abuse of such a kind or experience it along the way, few programmes for 
counselling or, more specifically, for victims of trafficking, exist. 
</p>
<p>53. There are also a small number of women asylum-seekers. According to INM figures 
from 2007, a total of 40 women applied for asylum in Tapachula, among whom 23 were main 
applicants. Four of these women were recognized as refugees; all four were Iraqi. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
page 16 
 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  KEY MIGRATION CHALLENGES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Border control and detention procedures 
</b></p>
<p>54. Most undocumented migrants come through the southern border with Guatemala. It is 
estimated that 60 per cent come through the state of Chiapas, but it is extremely difficult to get 
an estimate of the number of persons who pass through the southern border during the year. 
According to migration statistics, INM in Chiapas detained approximately 90,601 persons during 
2007, 49.58 per cent of the total in Mexico. Furthermore, Chiapas receives undocumented 
migrants from other Mexican states for their deportation to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador 
and Nicaragua. During 2007, 86,206 persons were deported from Tapachula, an average of 
225 persons per day. On a national level, Mexico deported 182,705 persons in 2007, an increase 
from 179,345 in 2006.  
</p>
<p>55. To avoid treating undocumented migration as a crime, Mexico uses the term &#8220;to secure&#8221; 
rather than &#8220;to detain&#8221; in migration matters. Under the General Population Act, a foreigner is 
secured when, because of his/her irregular situation in the country, he/she is housed temporarily 
in a migrant holding centre, pending clarification of his/her migration status and, if appropriate, a 
decision to send him/her back. The latter is an administrative penalty, applicable when a 
foreigner infringes migration law, and involves making the foreigner leave the country 
immediately.  
</p>
<p>56. According to the Government of Mexico, it is their policy to detain migrants for a very 
short time (a few days to a couple of weeks, generally). Depending on the bilateral relationship 
Mexico has with the country of origin of the migrant, they can be returned the same day after 
spending only a few hours in a holding centre. The return is carried out at the expense of the 
Government of Mexico, and the most frequent returns are to Guatemala. 
</p>
<p>57. INM instituted new procedures for repatriation in 2006, partly as a response to 
international reports of abuse. The main change is that citizens of Guatemala, Honduras, 
El Salvador and Nicaragua now have the opportunity to sign a repatriation form that may 
expedite their removal from the country. Those who immediately admit unlawful entry and who 
waive their rights to an administrative procedure are taken to the nearest INM office for 
processing. 
</p>
<p>58. Rather than remaining in the office or detention centre as in the past, these migrants are 
placed within hours on an INM bus. The bus then travels from office to office, collecting 
migrants until it is full. During 2007, 63 per cent of Central American migrants opted for 
repatriation or were repatriated. This process usually takes between one and three days 
depending on the location where the migrant is detained. Upon arriving at the Tapachula 
Detention Centre, migrants are usually deported on buses within 24 hours. 
</p>
<p>59. INM reports that it maintains 48 permanent detention centres and 116 additional spaces for 
housing migrants on a national level. These include immigration offices and, on occasion, jail 
cells. The number of detention centres has more than doubled since 2000, when INM reported 
having just 22 detention centres. INM began ramping up its infrastructure in 2000 by expanding 
the detention centre in Mexico City and then remodelling some of the smaller centres.  </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 17 
 
</p>
<p>60. In 2006, INM opened its largest detention centre in Tapachula, Chiapas, which 
holds 960 migrants. The 48 centres are located in 23 of Mexico&#8217;s 32 states and the 
Federal District. They are divided into three categories according to space, types of facilities, and 
administrative capacity. For example, three large detention centres are authorized to carry out 
administrative procedures and have separate spaces for men, women and families, and medical 
facilities. These are located in Saltillo, Coahuila, near the northern border; Mexico City; and 
Tapachula. In addition to these, there are two other centres in Acayucan, Veracruz state, and 
Juhro, Chihuahua state. INM manages the centres with security from local or federal police 
forces, and sometimes employs private security companies, raising the question of whether 
human rights standards are being enforced. 
</p>
<p>61. The executive order on detention facilities of 26 November 2001 provides for separating 
men and women and for setting aside areas for families, psychiatric patients and carriers of 
infectious diseases. The guards in the women&#8217;s sleeping quarters must be women. In addition, 
the executive order states that detained individuals must be assigned a dormitory and given a mat 
and articles for personal hygiene. Detainees also have the right to receive food three times a day. 
</p>
<p>62. But despite the executive order, the Special Rapporteur notes recurring problems with 
Mexico&#8217;s detention centres. Cases of cruel and degrading treatment and overcrowding have been 
reported, and lack of medical care and failure to notify consulates are commonplace. There are 
also common complaints about lack of hygiene, poor access to or poor quality food, and poor 
treatment by authorities. Concerns specific to women migrants relate to the practice that some 
security guards and attending physicians are men, which has occasionally resulted in accusations 
of sexual harassment and abuse. In addition, women have specific medical problems that they 
may want to disclose only to female medical personnel.  
</p>
<p>63. Among the three detention centres that the Special Rapporteur visited, in Mexico City, 
Tapachula and Tijuana, there were a very small number of migrants detained (between 5 and 50, 
depending on the holding centre), meaning the majority of supposed irregular migrants in the 
country were unaccounted for. While noting the Government of Mexico&#8217;s policy of rapid 
repatriation, questions about the criminalization of irregular migration remain a concern. Reports 
suggest that there is an unknown number of migrants in prison, including in federal, state and 
municipal prisons, as well as unofficial or clandestine prisons, but requests by the Special 
Rapporteur for additional data and statistics on the foreign-born population in incarceration were 
not answered with sufficient information.  
</p>
<p>64. Reports from civil society indicate that detained migrants in many cases are not adequately 
informed of their rights, lack access to a lawyer, that no interpretation is offered in the case of 
non-Spanish-speaking migrants and that the registration of migrants is not systematic. Some 
migrants are detained for a short period of time by the authorities, &#8220;voluntarily repatriated&#8221; (but 
in many cases it is involuntary) and there is no record of some migrants&#8217; arrival and departure. 
Some non-governmental organizations explained that they do not have access to detained 
migrants in order to assist them and if so, in the cases where detainees do have access to a 
lawyer, they are allowed only 30 minutes (at most) to speak, which is insufficient to exchange 
proper information about the details of the case and the rights afforded to the migrant. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
page 18 
 
</p>
<p><b>B. Organized crime networks and impunity among governmental 
and law enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p>65. Transnational migration continues to be a business in Mexico, largely operated by 
transnational gang networks involved in smuggling and trafficking in persons and drugs, with 
collaboration of the local, municipal, state and federal authorities. These practices are directly 
related to the rise in cases of violence against women and children, especially along the northern 
and southern borders, and at transit points. As such, impunity for human rights abuses against 
migrants is rampant. With the pervasiveness of corruption at all levels of government and the 
close relationship that many authorities have with gang networks, incidences of extortion, rape 
and assault of migrants continue. The majority of the cases seem to be against migrants from 
Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. 
</p>
<p>66. The Government of Mexico has to some extent a sophisticated and well-developed 
bureaucracy to handle migration issues, as evidenced by the myriad of agencies that cover the 
issue. However, implementation remains a challenge and, according to certain ministries, 
scarcity of resources remains a problem. There are reports about the misuse of funds intended to 
prevent undocumented migration to the United States (an estimated US$ 1.5 million), including 
professionalizing the police forces. The Beta Groups, which provide material assistance and 
support to migrants in the process, often lack sufficient gasoline or personnel to carry out their 
tasks.  
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur recalls a point made by the Committee on Migrant Workers in its 
concluding observations. Under the General Population Act and its regulations, only officials of 
the National Institute for Migration and the Federal Preventive Police are empowered to carry 
out appropriate duties related to immigration control and supervision of the foreign-born 
population in the country. Under article 73 of the General Population Act, other authorities who 
by law have federal, local or municipal forces under their command may provide assistance to 
the migration authorities when so requested. However, the Committee noted that it is disturbed 
to find that in certain cases authorities not so empowered, including members of the Armed 
Forces and private security personnel (also known as <i>garroteros</i>), carry out migration control 
activities and arrests. 
</p>
<p>68. The Special Rapporteur has been informed of abuses by the INM, public law enforcement 
agents and private security personnel. Civil society organizations reported that arbitrary arrests 
are carried out by private security groups. These groups are mainly in charge of guarding 
railroads and trains, who arrest undocumented migrants illegally and hand them over to the INM. 
The most infamous cases seem to be those associated with the &#8220;train of death&#8221;, a mode of 
transport often used by undocumented migrants travelling internally. Reports indicate that 
mutilations, kidnapping, assaults and sexual harassment and abuse of migrants occur with some 
regularity during transit. The Special Rapporteur received reports of frequent operations during 
which the police and private security forces use extreme violence, beat people or throw them out 
of the train, causing serious accidents which can result in the amputation of limbs (arms or legs). 
</p>
<p>69. Civil society organizations and journalists reported cases of aggression, intimidation, 
violence and kidnapping of human rights defenders of migrants and those who assist </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 19 
 
</p>
<p>undocumented migrants. These often take place in areas near shelters where migrants are housed 
or in migrant communities. Many of these incidents and practices are associated with the 
transnational gang network described in more detail above. Systematic kidnapping for ransom 
purposes, whereby migrants with relations in the United States were targeted so that they would 
send money in order to free their family members in Mexico, was also reported. These incidents 
often go unreported if the relatives in the United States are undocumented and do not want to 
raise alarm for fear of deportation, raising levels of impunity. Reports of kidnappings involving 
sexual violence against women were highlighted. 
</p>
<p>70. Mexico has adopted an anti-<i>mara</i> law at the national level, and works with the 
United States and Central America on regional approaches to combating the phenomenon. 
However, there seem to be concerns about the collaboration between these networks and 
governmental officials and law enforcement agents, making the distinction between the 
two groups difficult to discern. Impunity, corruption, extortion and bribery seem to be a rampant 
phenomenon within the business of migration and contributing significantly to the pervasive 
abuse of migrants. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Assistance to migrants 
</b></p>
<p>71. Basic due-process guarantees include the right to information, translation, and 
interpretation, the right to be heard, the right to an impartial and accountable adjudicator, the 
right to legal representation, the right to judicial review, and the right to consular access. The 
Government of Mexico faces the challenge of providing due-process guarantees to unauthorized 
migrants while also helping the majority return home safely and quickly.  
</p><p>72. In practice, the Government implements due-process guarantees unevenly. One problem is 
that authorities from several agencies participate in the detention process before turning migrants 
over to migration officials. As a result, the initial information collected about the circumstances 
leading to detention is not always clear. In theory, a recent reform decriminalizing 
undocumented entry should return migration control to INM agents and the Federal Preventive 
Police. However, if INM officials detain Central Americans they presume to be irregular 
migrants, and if those individuals cannot produce any legal migration documents, they will be 
placed in deportation proceedings with little time to clarify their situation. 
</p>
<p>73. Once migrants are in the custody of migration officials, the procedures vary among 
regional offices. For example, some officials allow migrants to make phone calls while others do 
not. Some migrants interviewed stated that they were unable to make phone calls if they lacked 
the necessary funds, which is often the case, especially with minors.  
</p>
<p>74. The Special Rapporteur observed a number of challenges regarding consular processes and 
migrants&#8217; detention and return to their country of origin. According to international standards,<b>3</b> 
the receiving State is to notify the consular or diplomatic authorities of the State of origin

</p>
<p>without delay whenever a migrant worker or a member of his family is arrested or detained, if so 
requested by the individual concerned. However, it was not clear the implementation of this law. 
Migrants interviewed in migrant holding centres affirmed not to have spoken with their legal 
representation. While this may have been obviated by the rapid return of certain migrants 
(especially those to Guatemala), migrants of other nationalities remained in detention without an 
indication of their legal rights or duration of detention. 
</p>
<p>75. Return depends on a bilateral agreement between the country of destination or transit and 
the country of the migrant&#8217;s citizenship (not necessarily the country of origin). It was evident in 
visiting the migrant detention centres that Mexico has a functional reciprocal agreement with 
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua whereby most undocumented migrants from 
these countries detained by Mexican authorities are released and returned promptly (often within 
two weeks but in many cases it is a matter of days, sometimes hours). Mexico often pays for the 
return of such migrants, as evidenced by the provision of ground transportation (tourist buses). 
</p>
<p>76. Bilateral agreements with other countries were not as evident. Cuba, for example, seems to 
be less tolerant of the outmigration of its citizens and, accordingly, less receptive of returned 
migrants, despite a Memorandum of Understanding with Mexico. Cuban migrants complained of 
waiting in detention without information about their stay duration or return. Those returned are 
potentially subject to persecution, as Cuban law criminalizes departure, raising questions about 
the non-refoulement of Cuban migrants under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of 
Refugees. 
</p>
<p>77. As discussed throughout the report, physical and psychological assistance to migrants is a 
significant gap in Mexico&#8217;s level of protection. Holding centres provide a minimum of physical 
care, and rarely offer mental-health assistance. The scarcity of treatment available for victims of 
sexual and gender-based violence is a weakness. The cases of amputees and those mutilated in 
association with violence on the &#8220;train of death&#8221; and the poor medical assistance, indeed 
negligence, that follows, is alarming.  
</p>
<p>78. Undocumented asylum-seekers arriving through the southern border of Mexico pose a 
procedural challenge. The border between Mexico and Guatemala is extremely difficult to 
monitor and there are several hundred unofficial crossings along the border. At the official entry 
points there is no standard procedure for referral of cases, and apparently there is confusion 
about the ad hoc procedures in place. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR) reports that, since most people stay only for a few hours in the holding 
centre, it is their greatest challenge to identify possible asylum-seekers among the hundreds of 
undocumented migrants. In theory, every migrant is interviewed (either at the checkpoint or in 
the holding centre) and there should be a transcript of this interview recorded by INM, but this is 
not always the case. Civil society organizations report systematic expulsion of asylum-seekers 
who are awaiting the determination of their refugee status.  
</p>
<p>79. The National Commission for Refugee Assistance (COMAR) in Tapachula 
analysed 224 cases in 2007. These cases originated from 26 countries. A bit fewer than half of 
the refugees were of Cuban, Salvadoran, Honduran and Guatemalan origin, none of whom were </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
  page 21 
 
</p>
<p>recognized. A total of eight cases analysed by COMAR Tapachula were recognized as refugees: 
Colombia (2), Somalia (1), Burundi (1), Cuba (1) and Iraq (3). Thirty-one per cent of the 
applicants abandoned the procedure, many because of the amount of time spent in the migratory 
holding centre during the procedure.  
</p>
<p>80. The percentage of refugees recognized seems to be in decline, perhaps due to the fact that 
asylum-seekers of African origin are provided with an exit permit (<i>oficio de salida</i>), which 
allows them to travel through the country (generally with the goal of crossing the northern 
border). Since the destination of extraregional migrants is usually the North, they often do not 
bother to seek asylum in Mexico when they can be granted an exit permit.  
</p>
<p><b>V.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>Mexico&#8217;s progress in developing and implementing programmes to protect the human 
rights of migrants is evident, in terms of both the Government&#8217;s capacity and willingness. 
The Special Rapporteur witnessed notable efforts by Mexican authorities to improve the 
handling of detention centres (especially overcrowding), training of border officials, return, 
and protection of children. Nevertheless, there are many issues of concern that warrant 
further attention and resources and, accordingly, the Special Rapporteur wishes to make 
the following suggestions for further consideration and action. 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Recommendations to the Government of Mexico 
</b></p>
<p><b>Legal revisions 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Regarding the expulsion of migrants from its territory, the Special Rapporteur 
recommends that the Government of Mexico review its laws regarding expulsion (article 33 
of the Constitution and corresponding practices stipulated in the General Population Act) 
and formulate policies according to international human rights law standards, that 
migrants are expelled only pursuant to a decision taken by the competent authority 
pursuant to the law. In addition, the Special Rapporteur, following up on recommendations 
by the Committee on Migrant Workers, recommends that Mexico should consider taking 
measures to withdraw its reservation to article 22, paragraph 4, of the Convention on 
Migrant Workers.  
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Regarding the criminalization of irregular migration, the Special Rapporteur 
welcomes the reform of the General Population Act and urges its harmonization with 
international law and reflection of attendant protections in practice. He is concerned with 
the punitive measures given to irregular migrants, including migrants involved in 
smuggling and trafficking. Now that irregular migration has been decriminalized by the 
reforms, and following up on recommendations by the Committee on Migrant Workers, 
the Special Rapporteur recommends that the law should, inter alia, implement the 
classification of illegal entry into the country as an administrative rather than criminal 
offence. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>The Special Rapporteur again welcomes the efforts made by Mexico to implement the 
Convention on Migrant Workers, and notes that Mexico recently made a declaration under </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2 
page 22 
 
</p>
<p><b>article 77 recognizing the competence of the Committee to receive communications from 
individuals. The Special Rapporteur regrets that this reluctance may signify a lack of 
complete support for the Convention itself. In the light of Mexico&#8217;s exemplary efforts in the 
worldwide promotion of migrants&#8217; rights, the Special Rapporteur underscores the crucial 
nature of this element in the promotion of the Convention. 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur received inconsistent information about at what age the 
federal Government and the state agencies considered migrant children as being legally 
&#8220;minors&#8221; and therefore deserving of additional protection. He also noted that there seemed 
to be differences according to sex, with girls eligible for protection longer than boys, which 
illustrates gaps in protection and lack of coherence in policy. The Special Rapporteur 
therefore recommends the revision of what is legally considered a &#8220;minor&#8221; at both the 
federal and state levels, and suggests that &#8220;minors&#8221; be inclusive, regardless of sex, of all 
children under the age of 18.4 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Despite some programmes in place, the Special Rapporteur noted a general absence 
of public consciousness about the severity and extent of migrant child labour practices in 
Mexico, and calls for immediate measures to be taken by the Government of Mexico 
including: an enhanced national educational campaign against child labour, the further 
implementation of legislation that Mexico already has aimed at making child labour 
practices a crime, and prosecution and punishment of hiring a minor for labour at both the 
federal and state levels.  
</b></p>
<p><b>Implementation and practice 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>The Special Rapporteur takes note of efforts made by the Government of Mexico to 
professionalize and train its police forces and border control officials. He welcomes 
initiatives by the INM to organize technical training courses for administrative officials 
focusing on the protection of the human rights of migrants. The Special Rapporteur invites 
Mexico to continue these efforts, especially at the local level, and in particular for INM 
personnel, Federal Preventative Police personnel supporting the INM in the area of 
migration management, and officials working for the Beta Groups. He calls on the Office of 
the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to assist with such trainings and 
capacity-building efforts. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>The Special Rapporteur takes note of the rapid manner in which the authorities 
endeavour to return undocumented migrants to their countries of origin once detained in 
migrant holding centres. This varies by country of nationality and, as such, the 
corresponding bilateral agreement Mexico has with that country. However, he also 
observed that there were gaps to the extent Mexico had formulated bilateral agreements

</b>  Note article 1 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which Mexico is a part, which

age of eighteen years unless under the law applicable to the child, majority is attained earlier.&#8221; </p>

<p><b>encompassing conditions of return with many countries producing migrants to Mexico. He 
therefore recommends that Mexico review its current bilateral arrangements with 
consulates of countries in which migrants in Mexico are found and formulate more specific 
provisions for the following: (a) cost of return; (b) handling of reception of migrants; 
(c) transport from border or consular office back to family or other safe destination; 
(d) provision of immediate medical care if necessary; and (e) provision of clothing, food 
and shelter to be used in the interim, if applicable. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur observed gaps with regard to consular protection, as many 
migrants claim that they were offered no legal representation nor informed of their date of 
departure. As such, this limits their knowledge about their rights, even if a migrant is in an 
irregular situation. The Special Rapporteur recommends that the Mexican authorities 
notify the consular or diplomatic authorities of the State of origin without delay whenever 
a migrant is arrested or detained. 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The Special Rapporteur observes the involvement of the armed forces and private 
security personnel in the handling of migrants, a practice not afforded to them under 
international nor federal law. He recommends that Mexico, and more specifically the 
National Institute for Migration, take appropriate steps to ensure that migration control 
and securing of migrants are carried out exclusively by the competent authorities and that 
every violation in this regard is promptly reported. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>Regarding the abuse of domestic workers, the Special Rapporteur recommends that 
the Government of Mexico devote further resources to improving the data on migrant 
work in the domestic sphere, including but not limited to the research of numbers and 
nationalities of domestic workers and employers of domestic migrant workers. Further, he 
recommends that it examine potential abuse in the recruitment process, through 
investigations involving recruitment agencies and registration systems for migrant workers 
destined for the domestic sphere. In addition, the Special Rapporteur recommends that the 
Government create a mechanism whereby workers, even if in irregular stay, may lodge 
complaints of abuse regarding unfair labour practices in the domestic sphere and further 
develop support services and shelters for victims of abuse in the domestic sphere.  
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>The Special Rapporteur recommends that appropriate legislative reforms address 
impunity of human rights violations, as a major weakness of the judicial system. In this 
regard the Special Rapporteur recommends to the Government that it establish obligations 
to report annually the number of cases that involve judicial actions such as arrests and 
convictions for the persecution of perpetrators of violations of the human rights of 
migrants, particularly, of the number of cases of judicial actions against perpetrators of 
child labour abuses.  
</b></p>
<p><b>B.  Recommendations to the United Nations 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>While the Special Rapporteur was pleased to learn about the various United Nations 
agencies and country offices involved in activities to protect women and children included </b></p>

<p>A/HRC/11/7/Add.2

</p>
<p><b>in the foreign-born population, he observed a fragmented approach among them, 
composed of disparate projects and programmes, which could benefit from increased 
cohesion. As such, he recommends that the United Nations Resident Coordinator, in 
conjunction with the International Organization for Migration, the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights, and specialized agencies, (a) review existing 
programmes that work to protect the rights of migrants and (b) integrate them for a more 
comprehensive approach to promote the protection of migrants within the United Nations 
system. This may be done in accordance with United Nations offices in, inter alia, 
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and the United States. Considering the significant 
flow-through of the migration population, the Mexico offices of the United Nations have a 
leadership role to play in this regard. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>The Special Rapporteur, at the time of drafting this report, was pleased to receive the 
recommendations issued by the International Meeting on the Protection of the Rights of 
Children in the Context of International Migration, &#8220;Migration and human rights of 
children&#8221;, organized jointly by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico City, held from 30 September to 
1 October 2008. As such, he would like to reiterate the call to intergovernmental 
institutions such as the United Nations to support initiatives to promote migrant children&#8217;s 
rights protection, and recommends that the United Nations encourage inter-institutional 
coordination at the national level, including through specific mechanisms and with the 
participation of the civil society, consular services, local governments and the private 
sector. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the reforms of the General Population Act and the 
recent initiative of the Senate of the Republic of Mexico to recognize the competency of the 
Committee on Migrant Workers to hear individual communications, established in 
articles 76 and 77 of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All 
Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. He is pleased to learn that the Senate 
Commission on Population and Development is collaborating to form a working group, in 
coordination with the office in Mexico of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, to put 
such initiatives into practice. The Special Rapporteur therefore recommends that this 
office, in cooperation with the International Organization for Migration and various NGOs 
working on migration issues, work closely with the Congress to ensure harmonization of 
domestic law and policy with international standards.
