LUCAS ENERGY, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
NOTE 1 - GENERAL
History of the Company. Incorporated in Nevada in December 2003 under the name Panorama
Investments Corp., the Company changed its name to Lucas Energy, Inc. effective June 9, 2006.
The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Lucas Energy, Inc.
(“Lucas” or the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States and the rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes
thereto contained in Lucas’s annual report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended
March 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring
adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations
for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim
periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the
consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained
in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year 2016 as reported in the Form
10-K have been omitted.
Our fiscal year ends on the last day of March of each year. We refer to the twelve-month periods
ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 as our 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, respectively.
On July 15, 2015 the Company effected a 1-for-25 reverse stock split of all of the outstanding
shares of the Company’s common stock. Proportional adjustments were also made to the
conversion and exercise prices of the Company’s outstanding convertible preferred stock,
warrants and stock options, and to the number of shares issued and issuable under the
Company’s stock incentive plans. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
conversion terms of preferred stock, options and warrants to purchase common stock and per
share amounts contained in the financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect
the reverse split for all periods presented.
NOTE 2 – LIQUIDITY AND GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATIONS
At June 30, 2016, the Company’s total current liabilities of $11.5 million exceeded its total current
assets of $0.6 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $10.9 million, while at March 31,
2016, the Company’s total current liabilities of $11.1 million exceeded its total current assets of
$0.6 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $10.5 million. The $0.6 million increase in the
working capital deficit is primarily related to cash used for operations from the issuance of debt.
On August 30, 2015, we entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement with Silver Star
Oil Company (“Silver Star”). The line of credit provided us the right to issue up to $2.4 million in
convertible promissory notes to Silver Star. Specifically, the Company had the right to request
advances in an amount not to exceed $200,000, each thirty days, and each advance was
evidenced by a convertible note. To date, Lucas has drawn $1,000,000 under the line of credit for
the months of October, November, December 2015 and January and February 2016. In February
2016, we received notice that $300,000 of the convertible notes were assigned by Silver Star to
Rockwell Capital Partners (“Rockwell”), and on March 28, 2016, Rockwell converted $206,000 of
the principal and interest due on such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a
conversion price of $1.50 per share, for an aggregate of 137,333 shares. We also received notice
in April 2016, that $500,000 of additional convertible notes were assigned by Silver Star to
Rockwell, and on April 25, 2016, Rockwell partially converted $159,780 of the principal and
interest due on such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of
$1.50 per share, for an aggregate of 106,520 shares. Additionally, as discussed below, in April
2016, the Company, Target Alliance London Limited (“TALL”), and Silver Star, entered into an
Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement whereby Silver
Star assigned its rights and ownership of a $200,000 Convertible Promissory Note issued by us
to Silver Star thereunder dated February 10, 2016 to TALL in consideration for $200,000.
On December 30, 2015, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to acquire, from twenty-
one different entities and individuals, working interests in producing properties and undeveloped
acreage. The assets agreed to be acquired include varied interests in two largely contiguous
acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region. In exchange for the assets being
acquired, Lucas will assume $31,350,000 in commercial bank debt, issue 552,000 shares of a
newly designated form of convertible preferred stock, issue 13,009,664 shares of common stock,
and pay $4,975,000 in cash. At the closing of the transaction, which is subject to various closing
conditions, we will rebrand and change our name to “Camber Energy, Inc.” The Asset Purchase
Agreement also includes customary termination provisions for both the Company and the sellers,
subject to the terms of the purchase agreement and in certain circumstances rights to cure or
other prerequisites. The Company also obtained the opinion of Canaccord Genuity Corporation
(“Canaccord”) providing that in the opinion of Canaccord, the acquisition is fair, from a financial
point of view, to the Company, prior to the approval of such purchase agreement by the Board of
Directors. The Company agreed to pay Canaccord $170,000 for the fairness opinion. We
currently anticipate the closing of the acquisition, which is subject to various closing conditions,
to occur in August or September 2016, and we will require additional funding of approximately
$1.35 million in legal expenses, investment banking fees and other transaction costs in order to
complete the acquisition (the “Acquisition”), in addition to the cash required to be paid at closing
as described above.
7
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited
institutional investor, pursuant to which we issued a redeemable convertible subordinated
debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of common stock at a
conversion price equal to $3.25 per share (the “Debenture”) and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616
shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”). The
accredited institutional investor purchased the Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the
sum of $500,000 and agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant, upon satisfaction of certain
conditions, for the sum of $4.5 million.
On April 6, 2016, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement”) with the same accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we
agreed, subject to certain conditions, to issue a $5.26 million face amount newly designated
Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) at a 5% original
issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.25
per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$4.50 per share (the “Second Warrant”). Under the terms of the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement, the Second Warrant and $530,000 of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and
issued for $500,000 after we close the Acquisition, and, assuming the Acquisition closes, the
remaining $4.73 million of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $4.5 million
immediately after approval by our stockholders for NYSE MKT purposes of the issuance of
shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the
Second Warrant, which the Company is seeking at its special meeting of stockholders to be held
on August 23, 2016, and there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the
Second Warrant.
On April 11, 2016, the Company, TALL, and Silver Star, entered into an Assignment, Assumption
and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement. Pursuant to the assignment agreement,
Silver Star assigned its rights and ownership of a $200,000 convertible note issued by us to
Silver Star thereunder dated February 10, 2016 to TALL in consideration for $200,000.
Additionally, Silver Star provided us a release from any liability in connection with the line of
credit and prior convertible notes issued to Silver Star by us. The assignment agreement also
amended the line of credit and terms of any future convertible notes issued thereunder, to, among
other things, to increase the monthly advance limit from $200,000 to $250,000 per month and
increase the conversion price of any future notes issued from $1.50 per share to $3.25 per share.
As additional consideration for TALL agreeing to the terms, we agreed to grant TALL warrants to
purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share, for each
$250,000 loaned pursuant to the terms of the amended line of credit. Subsequently, on June 27,
2016, TALL and Silver Star attempted to unilaterally rescind the Assignment, Assumption and
Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement and the transactions undertaken therewith;
however, we refused to recognize such rescission due to the fact that we were not party to, and
did not agree to the terms of, such rescission. To date, the Company has submitted four $250,000
advance requests for the months of May 2016, June 2016, July 2016 and August 2016, for which
TALL has not provided any funds to date. The Company is currently investigating potential
remedies for TALL’s breach of its funding obligations and may in the future file a complaint
against TALL.
On April 20, 2016, and effective April 1, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to
Asset Purchase Agreement (the “First Amendment”), with twenty-one separate sellers and two
other parties who became sellers as a result of the First Amendment (collectively, the “Sellers”)
and Segundo Resources, LLC, as a Seller and as a representative of the Sellers named therein,
amending the Asset Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the parties
amended the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement to among other things: (a) make the
effective date of the Asset Purchase April 1, 2016 (including the date that the Company will be
due consideration for the production of hydrocarbons in connection with the assets to be
acquired); (b) remove the requirement that we register the primary issuance of the shares of
common stock and preferred stock issuable to the Sellers pursuant to the Asset Purchase
Agreement prior to the closing of the Asset Purchase (the “Closing”); (c) provide for the issuance
of restricted shares of common and preferred stock to the Sellers at Closing; (d) include
representations of the Sellers sufficient to enable us to confirm that an exemption from
registration exists for the issuance of the common stock and preferred stock due to be issued at
Closing; (e) require us to register the resale of the common stock shares issuable at Closing,
after Closing (we are required to file the registration statement registering such shares no later
than 30 days after Closing and obtain effectiveness thereof no later than 90 days after closing
(135 days in the event the SEC reviews such registration statement)); (f) adjust the number of
shares of common and preferred stock we were allowed to have outstanding immediately prior to
Closing; (g) provide for the anticipated issuance of additional shares of common stock in
connection with the debt assumption contemplated at the Closing; (h) adjust the required timing
for our appointment of three director nominees to be nominated by the Sellers at the Closing to
10 days after the Closing date; (i) require us to indemnify the Sellers against losses caused by
misstatements in the registration statement unless such losses are caused by information
supplied by the Sellers, in which case the Sellers providing such information are required to
indemnify us against such losses; (j) confirm that certain recent transactions undertaken by the
Company relating to the sale of securities (as previously disclosed by the Company), are
approved by the Sellers and that such transactions did not cause any breaches of the terms of
the Asset Purchase Agreement; (k) allow for certain additional issuances of common stock from
time to time pursuant to the terms of convertible securities sold by the Company prior to Closing;
(l) allow the Sellers to sell certain property in Glasscock County, Texas prior to Closing, subject
to the pre-approval of such sale by the Company, and subject to such sale proceeds being
placed in escrow until the earlier of Closing (and thereafter released to the Company) or as
mutually agreed by the Company and the Seller Representative; and (m) remove certain closing
conditions which have already been completed to date from the conditions to Closing described
in the Asset Purchase Agreement.
8
In July and August 2016, RAD2 Minerals, Ltd. (“RAD2”), which is one of the Sellers, and
controlled by Richard Azar, who will become the Company’s largest stockholder and will be
appointed as Executive Chairman following the closing of the Acquisition, advanced the
Company an aggregate of $350,000. This advance does not accrue interest and has no stated
maturity date. The Company anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by RAD2 at the closing
of the Acquisition.
In August 2016, two other Sellers advanced the Company an aggregate of $200,000 ($100,000
each). These advances do not accrue interest and have no stated maturity date. The Company
anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by the two Sellers following the closing of the
Acquisition and after completion of the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement.
In addition to the transactions noted above, Lucas is currently discussing potential financing
transactions in order to fulfill our current capital requirements as well as our planned asset
acquisition, which we believe, if finalized and completed, will ensure the future viability of the
Company. However, due to our current capital structure and the nature of oil and gas interests,
i.e., that rates of production generally decline over time as oil and gas reserves are depleted, if
we are unable to obtain the necessary financing to finalize the asset purchase or drill additional
wells and develop our proved undeveloped reserves (PUDs); coupled with the continued
substantial drop in commodity prices over the last twelve months, we believe that our revenues
will continue to decline over time. Therefore, we may be forced to scale back our business plan,
sell assets to satisfy outstanding debts or take other remedial steps which may include seeking
bankruptcy protection.
The realization of the Company’s assets and satisfaction of its liabilities is contingent on the
completion of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Company anticipates that it will need
approximately $15.0 million to execute its current business plan and is currently in the later
stages of seeking shareholder approval and closing of the Asset Purchase Agreement. In the
event that the Company is unable to complete the Asset Purchase Agreement, and is otherwise
unable to replace such financing on a timely basis, it would materially affect the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. If closing on the Asset Purchase Agreement is not
completed, among other things, the Company expects that it would incur additional impairment of
its oil and gas properties of approximately $12.0 million and the Company’s ability to meet its
obligations from existing cash flows would be significantly affected. If the Company would be
required to seek financing from other sources, such financings may not be available or, if
available, may not be on terms acceptable to the Company. Accordingly, the financial statements
do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets or classification of liabilities
that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise
capital to meet its obligations and develop its oil and gas properties to attain profitable
operations.
9
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the
next twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The Company has provided a discussion of significant accounting policies, estimates and
judgments in its 2016 Annual Report. There have been no changes to the Company’s significant
accounting policies since March 31, 2016.
NOTE 4 – PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Oil and Gas Properties
Lucas uses the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities. Costs to
acquire mineral interests in oil and gas properties, to drill and equip exploratory wells used to find
proved reserves, and to drill and equip development wells including directly related overhead
costs and related asset retirement costs are capitalized. Properties not subject to amortization
consist of acquisition, exploration and development costs, which are evaluated on a property-by-
property basis. Amortization of these unproved property costs begins when the properties
become proved or their values become impaired and the corresponding costs are added to the
capitalized costs subject to amortization. Costs of oil and gas properties are amortized using the
units of production method. Amortization expense calculated per equivalent physical unit of
production amounted to $26.46 per barrel of oil equivalent (“Boe”) for the three months ended
June 30, 2016, and was $31.95 per Boe for the three months ended June 30, 2015.
In applying the full cost method, Lucas performs an impairment test (ceiling test) at each reporting
date, whereby the carrying value of property and equipment is compared to the “estimated
present value,” of its proved reserves discounted at a 10-percent interest rate of future net
revenues, based on current economic and operating conditions at the end of the period, plus the
cost of properties not being amortized, plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved
properties included in costs being amortized, less the income tax effects related to book and tax
basis differences of the properties. The price used in the ceiling test is the simple average first of
the month price for the prior 12 months. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is
charged as an impairment expense. As of June 30, 2016, no impairment of oil and gas properties
was indicated.
All of Lucas’s oil and gas properties are located in the United States. Below are the components

Office Lease
In June 2016, we moved our corporate headquarters from Suite 780 to Suite 860 at our same
physical address location of 450 Gears Road, Houston, Texas 77067. The new office space is
approximately 4,400 square feet and has a base monthly rent of approximately $7,700 for the first
year and approximately $7,900, $8,000, $8,200 and $8,400 for subsequent years. We also paid
an $8,400 deposit and received proceeds from our prior security deposit of $5,000.

NOTE 6 – NOTES PAYABLE, DEBENTURE
Rogers Loan
At June 30, 2016, the Company had $7,114,734 due under the $7.5 million Letter Loan
Agreement (as amended, modified, restated and revised to date, the “Rogers Loan”) originally
entered into with Louise H. Rogers (“Rogers”) on August 13, 2013. Amortization of debt discount
of $21,323 was recorded during the year ended March 31, 2016 while no unamortized discount
remained as of June 30, 2016.
Currently, the Rogers Loan has a maturity date of October 31, 2016, and we have agreed to pay
all professional fees incurred by Rogers and to pay Rogers $39,000 in lieu of interest on the
Rogers Loan as well as all operating income of collateralized assets (beginning October 1,
2015). Also, we agreed to make principal payments to Rogers from certain insurance proceeds to
be received, which we have not received to date. For the months of January, February, March,
June and July 2016, the Company did not make the required monthly principal payments due
pursuant to the terms of the Rogers loan as amended. Instead, the Company and the loan
administrator agreed to settle any outstanding administration and legal fees in lieu of the
principal payments. The Company paid approximately $98,000 related to the fees and effective
July 5, 2016, the Company obtained a waiver for the nonpayment of the principal amounts.
Additionally, per a prior amendment, we transferred all of our oil and gas interests and equipment
to our then newly formed wholly-owned Texas subsidiary, CATI Operating LLC, which clarified
that following the transfer, Rogers had no right to foreclose upon the Company (at the Nevada
corporate parent level) upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Rogers Loan, and
that instead Rogers would only take action against CATI and its assets and required Rogers to
release all UCC and other security filings on the Company (provided that Rogers is allowed to
file the same filings on CATI and its assets). Subsequently, we formally assigned all of our oil
and gas interests and equipment to CATI pursuant to an Assignment and Bill of Sale dated
December 16, 2015.
Silver Star Line of Credit
On August 30, 2015, we entered into a Non-Revolving Line of Credit Agreement with Silver Star
Oil Company. The line of credit provided us the right to issue up to $2.4 million in convertible
promissory notes to Silver Star. To date, Lucas has drawn $1,000,000 under the line of credit for
the months of October, November, December 2015 and January and February 2016. The
convertible notes contained a beneficial conversion feature with a combined intrinsic value of
$687,987 for the five notes, which is recognized as a discount and is being amortized through
interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes.
As of June 30, 2016, $800,000 of convertible notes have been assigned by Silver Star to
Rockwell Capital Partners (“Rockwell”), of which Rockwell has converted a total of $365,780 of
the principal and interest due on such convertible notes into shares of our common stock at a
conversion price of $1.50 per share, for an aggregate of 243,853 shares.
11
On April 11, 2016, the Company, Target Alliance London Limited, and Silver Star, entered into an
Assignment, Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement whereby Silver
Star assigned its rights and ownership of a $200,000 convertible promissory note issued by us to
Silver Star thereunder dated February 10, 2016 to TALL in consideration for $200,000. The
Assignment Agreement also extended the due date of the February Note and all future notes
issued under the Line of Credit to April 11, 2017. As additional consideration for TALL agreeing
to the terms of the Assignment Agreement, we agreed, subject to NYSE MKT listing approval and
where applicable stockholder approval under applicable NYSE MKT rules and regulations, to
grant TALL warrants to purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25
per share, for each $250,000 loaned pursuant to the terms of the amended Line of Credit.
On June 27, 2016, TALL and Silver Star attempted to unilaterally rescind the Assignment,
Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement and the transactions
undertaken therewith; however, we refused to recognize such rescission due to the fact that we
were not party to, and did not agree to the terms of, such rescission. To date, the Company has
submitted four $250,000 advance requests to TALL for the months of May 2016, June 2016, July
2016 and August 2016, for which TALL has not provided any funds to date. The Company is
currently evaluating potential remedies for TALL’s breach of its funding obligations and may in
the future file a complaint against TALL.
As of June 30, 2016, we had total convertible notes due to Rockwell and TALL of $636,732 (net
of the unamortized discount of $9,563) which is recognized as a short-term liability on the
Company’s balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The Company has also recognized
approximately $18,700 in accrued interest as of June 30, 2016.
HFT Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement and Convertible Promissory
Notes
On March 29, 2016, Lucas entered into a Convertible Promissory Note Purchase Agreement with
HFT Enterprises, LLC (“HFT”). Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we agreed to issue an
aggregate of $600,000 in convertible notes, including $300,000 in convertible notes purchased
on the date of the parties’ entry into the agreement, and $150,000 in convertible notes purchased
by Debra Herman, the wife of Michael Herman, the principal of HFT, on April 26, 2016. We also
granted Mrs. Herman warrants to purchase 124,285 shares of common stock with an exercise
price of $1.50 per share on April 26, 2016, when the final loan was made pursuant to the terms of
the agreement.
Each of the convertible notes are due and payable twelve months from their issuance date,
accrue interest at the rate of 6% per annum (15% upon the occurrence of an event of default), and
allow the holder thereof the right to convert the principal and interest due thereunder into
common stock of the Company at a conversion price of $1.50 per share, provided that the total
number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes cannot
exceed 19.9% of our outstanding shares of common stock on March 29, 2016. The convertible
notes contained a beneficial conversion feature with a combined intrinsic value of $600,000 for
the three notes, which is recognized as a discount and is being amortized through interest
expense using the effective interest method over the term of the notes.
As of June 30, 2016, we had total convertible notes due to HFT of $165,458 (net of the
unamortized discount of $434,542) which is recognized as a short-term liability on the
Company’s balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The Company has also recognized
approximately $8,000 in accrued interest as of June 30, 2016.
Dreeben Note
On March 28, 2016, we borrowed $250,000 from Alan Dreeben, who is one of the sellers of the
assets we plan to acquire pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, pursuant to a short-term
promissory note. The short-term promissory note has a principal balance of $275,000 (the
$250,000 borrowed plus a $25,000 original issue discount), does not accrue interest unless an
event of default occurs thereunder, at which time the note accrues interest at 15% per annum,
has a maturity date of June 28, 2016 and contains standard and customary events of default. The
short-term promissory note may be prepaid at any time without penalty. As additional
consideration for Mr. Dreeben agreeing to make the loan, we agreed to issue Mr. Dreeben
15,000 restricted shares of common stock, which to date, have not been issued. Therefore, as of
March 31, 2016, we accrued $48,000 in stock payable, which is based on the closing price of the
Company’s common stock ($3.20 per share) on March 28, 2016. We also recognized the value of
the $48,000 stock payable as a discount to the short-term promissory note in addition to the
original discount of $25,000, for a total discount of $73,000.
12
On June 27, 2016, we entered into an amended and restated short-term promissory note,
amending and restating the note originally entered into with Alan Dreeben on March 28, 2016;
evidencing an additional $100,000 borrowed on June 13, 2016, plus a $10,000 original issue
discount on such loan amount and extending the maturity date of the note to August 31, 2016. Mr.
Dreeben is one of the Sellers.
As of June 30, 2016, we had a short-term promissory due to Alan Dreeben of $375,000 (net of the
unamortized discount of $10,000), which is recognized as a short-term liability on the Company’s
balance sheet as of June 30, 2016.
Debenture
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited
institutional investor, pursuant to which we issued a redeemable convertible subordinated
debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of common stock at a
conversion price equal to $3.25 per share and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of
common stock (subject to adjustment thereunder) at an exercise price equal to $3.25 per share
(the “First Warrant”). The accredited institutional investor purchased the debenture at a $30,000
original issue discount for the sum of $500,000 and agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant,
upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the sum of $4.5 million. The debenture matures in
seven years and accrues interest at a rate of 6.0% per annum, subject to adjustment as provided
in the debenture.
As the fair value of the warrants issued in connection with the debenture exceeds the $530,000
value of the debenture, we fully discounted the entire debenture and will amortize the discount
over the term of the debenture. The discount is being amortized through interest expense using
the effective interest method over the term of the debenture.
As of June 30, 2016, we had a convertible subordinated debenture of $18,929 (net of the
unamortized discount of $511,071) which is recognized as a long-term liability on the Company’s
balance sheet as of June 30, 2016. The Company has also recognized approximately $8,000 in
accrued interest as of June 30, 2016.
NOTE 7 – STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with the same accredited
institutional investor (noted above in “Note 6 – Notes Payable, Debenture”), pursuant to which we
agreed, subject to certain conditions, to sell 527 shares of Series C redeemable convertible
preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”)(with a face value of $5.26 million) at a 5%
original issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock at a conversion price
of $3.25 per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $4.50 per share (the “Second Warrant”). Under the terms of the Stock Purchase
Agreement, the Second Warrant and 53 shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and
issued for $500,000 after the Acquisition (as defined and described in “Note 2 – Liquidity and
Going Concern Considerations”) closes, and, assuming the Acquisition closes, the remaining
474 shares of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $4.5 million immediately after
approval by our stockholders for NYSE MKT purposes, of the issuance of shares of common
stock issuable upon conversion/exercise thereof, which the Company is seeking at its special
meeting of stockholders to be held on August 23, 2016, and at such time as there is an effective
registration statement in place covering the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of
the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the Second Warrant.
13
NOTE 8 – STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Preferred Stock
On April 19, 2016, the holder of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, agreed to convert all
500 shares of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 20,000 shares of our
common stock (a conversion ratio of 40:1 as provided in the original designation of the Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock adjusted for the Company’s 1:25 reverse stock split effective on July
25, 2015), which conversion was completed on April 25, 2016. We paid the holder $20,000 in
connection with and effective upon such conversion in order to comply with the terms of the Asset
Purchase Agreement that no shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding at
the closing. As of June 30, 2016, we have no preferred stock issued or outstanding.

Warrants
During the three months ended June 30, 2016, warrants to purchase 1,384,616 shares of
common stock were granted in connection with our sale of the debenture noted in “Note 6 – Note
Payables, Debenture”, above. We also granted warrants to purchase 124,285 shares of common
stock in connection with the HFT Convertible Promissory Notes (see “Note 6 – Note Payables,
Debenture”, above). No warrants were exercised, expired or cancelled during the three months
ended June 30, 2016. However, warrants to purchase 66,668 shares of common stock issued in
connection with an equity raise completed in April 2014, contained a weighted average anti-
dilutive provision in which the exercise price of the warrants are adjusted downward based on
any subsequent issuance or deemed issuance of common stock or convertible securities by the
Company for consideration less than the then exercise price of such warrants. As a result of the
anti-dilution rights, the exercise price of the warrants was adjusted from $15.56 per share as of
March 31, 2016 to $9.75 per share as of June 30, 2016, in connection with our issuance of
common stock and convertible securities for consideration less than the then exercise price of the
warrants during the period. As of June 30, 2016, the fair value of the derivative liability associated
with the 66,668 warrants was $182,333 compared to $126,960 at March 31, 2016. Therefore, the
$55,373 change in the derivative liability fair value was recorded as other expense on the
consolidated statement of operations.
The Company follows the authoritative guidance for measuring fair value of assets and liabilities
in its financial statements. For further information regarding the fair value hierarchy, refer to Note
3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Form 10-K.

fiscal year and consequently, recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the three
months ended June 30, 2016.
NOTE 10 – SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
Lucas measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity
instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award over the vesting period.
Common Stock
Lucas issued 7,653 shares of its common stock with an aggregate grant date fair value of
$23,572 during the three-month period ended June 30, 2016, which were valued based on the
trading value of Lucas’s common stock on the date of grant. Also, on June 30, 2016, the
Company agreed to award an additional 6,285 shares of its common stock with an aggregate
grant fair value of $23,882, which were valued based on the trading value of Lucas’s common
stock on the date of grant. Those common stock awards had yet to be physically issued as of
June 30, 2016, and therefore, were recognized as accrued common stock payable on the
balance sheet. The shares were awarded according to the employment agreement with an officer
and as additional compensation for other managerial personnel.

Stock Options
As of June 30, 2016, the Company had 22,920 stock options outstanding with a weighted
average exercise price of $33.96 and as of June 30, 2015, the Company 24,920 stock options
outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $33.80.
Of the Company’s outstanding options, no options expired, were exercised or forfeited during the
three months ended June 30, 2016. Additionally, no stock options were granted during the three
months ended June 30, 2016. Compensation expense related to stock options during the three-
month periods ended June 30, 2016 was $4,816.
Options outstanding and exercisable at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 had no intrinsic value,
respectively. The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the market price of
Lucas’s common stock on the date of exercise and the grant price of the stock options.

In prior periods, the shareholders of the Company approved the Company’s 2014 (as amended),
2012 and 2010 Stock Incentive Plans (“the Plans”). The Plans are intended to secure for the
Company the benefits arising from ownership of the Company’s common stock by the
employees, officers, directors and consultants of the Company, all of whom are and will be
responsible for the Company’s future growth. The Plans provide an opportunity for any
employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company to receive incentive stock options (to
eligible employees only), nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, stock awards and shares in
performance of services. There are 81,190 shares available for issuance under the Plans as of
June 30, 2016.

In July and August 2016, RAD2 Minerals, Ltd. (“RAD2”), which is one of the Sellers, and
controlled by Richard Azar, who will become the Company’s largest stockholder and will be
appointed as Executive Chairman following the closing of the Acquisition, advanced the
Company an aggregate of $350,000. This advance does not accrue interest and has no stated
maturity date. The Company anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by RAD2 at the closing
of the Acquisition.
In August 2016, two other Sellers advanced the Company an aggregate of $200,000 ($100,000
each). These advances do not accrue interest and have no stated maturity date. The Company
anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by the two Sellers following the closing of the
Acquisition and after completion of the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement.

financial statements and notes thereto and Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016.
Certain capitalized terms used below and otherwise defined below, have the meanings given to

Overview
Lucas Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is an independent oil and natural gas company based
in Houston, Texas (herein the “Company”, “Lucas”, “Lucas Energy” or “we”). We are engaged in
the acquisition and development of crude oil and natural gas from various known productive
geological formations, including the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford formations, primarily in
Gonzales, Wilson and Karnes counties south of the city of San Antonio, Texas.
We continue to operate with sound judgment keeping lower overall costs as a priority while
pursuing a strategic partnership, acquisitions and mergers with a focus on development of
reserves, increasing revenue and improving shareholder value. As to be expected, the Company
has been in a production maintenance mode through this process, and the minimal capital outlay
for development has curbed the expected decline in costs on a per barrel basis.
19
The Company is taking an aggressive growth posture towards finding the right strategic fit in this
environment of continued depressed commodity prices. It is our objective to create a company
with a sturdy platform capable of delivering on the long expected conversion of reserves to
production, continued long term development and sustainable shareholder value.
Our website address is http://www.lucasenergy.com. Our fiscal year ends on the last day of
March of each year. The information on, or that may be accessed through, our website is not
incorporated by reference into this report and should not be considered a part of this report. We
refer to the twelve-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 as our 2017 Fiscal
Year and 2016 Fiscal Year, respectively.
At June 30, 2016, the Company had leasehold interests (working interests) in approximately
8,395 gross acres, or 8,309 net acres, which is the Company’s total net developed and
undeveloped acreage as measured from the surface to the base of the Austin Chalk formation. In
deeper formations, the Company has approximately 1,909 net acres in the Eagle Ford oil
window.
As of June 30 2016, Lucas was producing an average of approximately 40 net barrels of oil
equivalent per day (Boepd) from 17 active well bores, of which 11 wells accounted for more than
90% of our production. The ratio between the gross and net production varies due to varied
working interests and net revenue interests in each well. An affiliate of Marathon Oil Corporation
operates two Eagle Ford horizontal wells in our Gonzales leases, of which we have a 15%
working interest on each well. Our production sales totaled 3,617 barrels of oil equivalent, net to
our interest, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.
At March 31, 2016, Lucas’s total estimated proved reserves were 4.3 million barrels of oil
equivalent (Boe), of which 3.8 million barrels (Bbls) were crude oil reserves, and 2.5 billion cubic
feet (Bcf) were natural gas reserves. Approximately 3% of the barrel of oil equivalent (Boe) was
proved producing. As of June 30, 2016, Lucas employed seven full-time employees. We also
utilized three contractors on an “as-needed” basis to carry out various functions of the Company,
including but not limited to field operations, land administration, corporate activity and information
technology maintenance.
Industry Segments
Lucas Energy’s operations are all crude oil and natural gas exploration and production related.
Operations and Oil and Gas Properties
We operate in known productive areas in order to decrease geological risk. Our holdings are
located in an increased area of current industry activity in Gonzales, Wilson and Karnes counties
in Texas. We concentrate on two vertically adjoining formations: the Austin Chalk and Eagle
Ford formations, listed in the order of increasing depth measuring from land surface. Lucas’s
acreage position is in the oil window of the Eagle Ford trend and we currently have
approximately 8,395 gross acres in the Gonzales, Karnes and Wilson County, Texas areas.
Austin Chalk
The Company’s original activity started in Gonzales County by acquiring existing shut-in and
stripper wells and improving production from those wells. Most of the wells had produced from
the Austin Chalk. The Austin Chalk is a dense limestone, varying in thickness along its trend
from approximately 200 feet to more than 800 feet. It produces by virtue of localized fractures
within the formation.
Eagle Ford
On Lucas’s leases, the Eagle Ford is a porous limestone with organic shale matter. The Eagle
Ford formation directly underlies the Austin Chalk formation and is believed to be the primary
source of oil and natural gas produced from the Austin Chalk. Reservoir thickness in the area of
the Company’s leases varies from approximately 60 feet to 80 feet.
20
Our Strategic Path
On December 30, 2015, Lucas entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase
Agreement”), as purchaser, with twenty-one separate sellers (the “Sellers”) and Segundo
Resources, LLC, as a Seller and as a representative of the sellers named therein (the
“Representative”). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the terms and conditions thereof, we
agreed to acquire from the Sellers, working interests in producing properties and undeveloped
acreage in Texas and Oklahoma, including varied interests in two largely contiguous acreage
blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region of the United States, and related wells, leases,
records, equipment and agreements associated therewith (collectively, the “Assets”). The
properties currently produce approximately 1,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d), of
which 53% are liquids from 114 producing wells. The bulk of the production is from the Hunton
formation holding approximately 43,000 gross acres (9,900 net acres) in central Oklahoma.
Additionally, further, offset development drilling opportunities for at least 40 additional wells have
been identified.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and in consideration for the Assets, we agreed to assume
$31.35 million of commercial bank debt; issue 552,000 shares of a newly designated form of
redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Convertible Preferred Stock”, which is currently
anticipated to be in an amended form of our Series B Preferred Stock), to one of the Sellers,
which is under common control with the Seller Representative, with a total face value of $13.8
million; issue 13,009,664 shares of common stock to certain of the Sellers; and pay $4,975,000 in
cash to certain of the Sellers. Notwithstanding the above, in the event there are any title or other
material issues associated with the Assets, the parties agreed to work in good faith to address
such issues, and if such issues cannot be addressed, to adjust the purchase price, provided that
no adjustment will be made unless such issues in aggregate total more than 5% of the aggregate
purchase price, and provided further that if such issues in aggregate total more than 20% of the
aggregate purchase price, we can terminate the Purchase Agreement, all of which are subject to
the terms of the Purchase Agreement. We and the Sellers also agreed to a true-up for certain
joint interest billings and authorization for expenditures at and/or after closing, and to effect a
true-up in connection with any material agreements, the rights thereto, were not provided by the
Sellers at closing.
At the closing of the transaction, we will rebrand and change our name to “Camber Energy, Inc.”
The parties currently anticipate the closing of the acquisition, which is subject to various closing
conditions, including those described below, to occur during August or September 2016.
We intend to grow the company in three ways: the development of our acquired assets and/or
develop what we own; expansion of the existing footprint or what would be considered bolt-on
acquisitions; and additional material acquisitions.
Following our anticipated acquisition of the Assets, we intend to drill the acquired acreage,
funding permitting. As previously disclosed, 50 Hunton locations have been identified on the
acreage to be acquired, and we have further refined those locations to what we believe are six
initial wells to be drilled in the second, possibly third quarter of this fiscal year assuming the
acquisition is completed and funding is available. That schedule will be dependent on exactly
when we are able to close the acquisition.
Beyond those known locations, there exists opportunities to develop other sands present in the
acreage. From the top to the bottom of this play, there are 19 different sands that have been
produced in various areas of central Oklahoma. They include shallow Pennsylvanian formations,
such as the Bartlesville, the Redfork and the Skinner, and the Mississippi Lime formation is
present in addition to the Woodford shale. The Prue Sand, another potentially productive sand, is
of particular interest. We plan to study the Prue as a high-priority target for its economic viability.
Another aspect of our growth plan is to acquire opportunities within or near the Assets. We are
actively seeking other interest owners to supplement or add to the 13% working interest we plan
to acquire in connection with the Assets. Also, we are looking to expand our footprint by
acquiring acreage that is nearby or offset to the operations we currently participate in, especially
where those opportunities also represent existing production.
Following the entry into the Purchase Agreement, we have continued to review opportunities,
primarily asset or corporate acquisitions, but also include strategic partnerships, and/or merger
opportunities. While these types of transactions tend to be large and take time to generate, they
also represent material increases in the size and scope of the Company.
21
We continue to operate our Gonzales, Texas, Austin Chalk/Eagle Ford Shale properties. The
activity around our Eagle Ford assets sharpens the focus of opportunities in our leases. The
number of wells drilled near and offsetting our leases continues to support our enhanced view of
the Eagle Ford area. In addition, leading operators in the Eagle Ford area have developed
drilling and completion technologies that have significantly reduced production risk and
decreased per unit drilling and completion costs. While commodity prices have dropped
dramatically, the associated drilling and completion costs have dropped as well. We continue to
review the cost to benefit of drilling as commodity prices and drilling costs fluctuate.
In the current commodity price environment, we do not generate enough revenue from our current
production to cover our overhead burden. While we have diligently reduced costs, such reduction
is not sufficient to overcome the decline in the price of oil. We have made significant strides in
cost cutting programs including overall general and administrative expenses; however, without
also generating new production the commodity price environment outweighs the cost savings.
Through this period of oil price uncertainty, we benefit from the proven merger and acquisition,
and operating and financing capabilities of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Anthony Schnur, and
the rest of the Company’s management team and directors. Mr. Schnur has over twenty years of
extensive oil and gas and financial management experience. He has provided a steady hand as
the Company navigates this precipitous decline in energy prices. Further, the Company has
highly experienced personnel in its operations, reservoir analysis, land and accounting functions
and believes it has brought together a professional and dedicated team to deliver value to
Lucas’s shareholders.
In previous filings we have discussed seeking out potential transactions which would provide the
financial mass to develop the significant reserves and grow the Company. We are hopeful that
the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement will not be simply a destination, but
the first platform step in growing Lucas/Camber to its greatest potential.
Liquidity and Going Concern Consideration
On December 31, 2015, we entered into the Purchase Agreement described above, whereby we
agreed to acquire, from twenty-one different entities and individuals, working interests in
producing properties and undeveloped acreage. The assets being acquired include varied
interests in two largely contiguous acreage blocks in the liquids-rich Mid-Continent region. In
exchange for the assets being acquired, Lucas will assume $31,350,000 in commercial bank
debt, issue 552,000 shares of a newly designated form of convertible preferred stock, issue
13,009,664 shares of common stock, and pay $4,975,000 in cash. We anticipate closing the
acquisition in August or September 2016 and anticipate requiring additional funding of
approximately $1.35 million in legal expenses, investment banking fees and other transaction
costs in order to complete the acquisition, as well as the approximately $5 million needed to be
paid at closing.
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited
institutional investor, pursuant to which we issued a redeemable convertible subordinated
debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of common stock at a
conversion price equal to $3.25 per share (the “Debenture”) and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616
shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”). The
accredited institutional investor purchased the Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the
sum of $500,000 and agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant, upon satisfaction of certain
conditions, for the sum of $4.5 million.
On April 6, 2016, we also entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement”) with the same accredited institutional investor, pursuant to which we
agreed, subject to certain conditions, to issue a $5.26 million face amount newly designated
Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) at a 5% original
issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.25
per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares of common stock at an exercise price of
$4.50 per share (the “Second Warrant”). Under the terms of the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement, the Second Warrant and $530,000 of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and
issued for $500,000 after we close the Acquisition, and, assuming the Acquisition closes, the
remaining $4.73 million of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $4.5 million
immediately after approval by our stockholders for NYSE MKT purposes of the issuance of
shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the
Second Warrant, which the Company is seeking at its special meeting of stockholders to be held
on August 23, 2016, and there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the
Second Warrant.
22
On April 11, 2016, the Company, TALL, and Silver Star, entered into an Assignment, Assumption
and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement. Pursuant to the assignment agreement,
Silver Star assigned its rights and ownership of a $200,000 convertible note issued by us to
Silver Star thereunder dated February 10, 2016 to TALL in consideration for $200,000.
Additionally, Silver Star provided us a release from any liability in connection with the line of
credit and prior convertible notes issued to Silver Star by us. The assignment agreement also
amended the line of credit and terms of any future convertible notes issued thereunder, to, among
other things, to increase the monthly advance limit from $200,000 to $250,000 per month and
increase the conversion price of any future notes issued from $1.50 per share to $3.25 per share.
As additional consideration for TALL agreeing to the terms, we agreed, to grant TALL warrants to
purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share, for each
$250,000 loaned pursuant to the terms of the amended line of credit. Subsequently, on June 27,
2016, TALL and Silver Star attempted to unilaterally rescind the Assignment, Assumption and
Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement and the transactions undertaken therewith;
however, we refused to recognize such rescission due to the fact that we were not party to, and
did not agree to the terms of, such rescission. To date, the Company has submitted four $250,000
advance requests for the months of May 2016, June 2016, July 2016 and August 2016, for which
TALL has not provided any funds to date. The Company is currently analyzing potential remedies
for TALL’s breach of its funding obligations and may in the future file a complaint against TALL.
On April 20, 2016, and effective April 1, 2016, the Company entered into a First Amendment to
Asset Purchase Agreement, with twenty-one separate sellers and two other parties who became
sellers as a result of the First Amendment (collectively, the “Sellers”) and Segundo Resources,
LLC, as a Seller and as a representative of the Sellers named therein, amending the Asset
Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the First Amendment, the parties amended the terms of the
Asset Purchase Agreement to among other things: (a) make the effective date of the Asset
Purchase April 1, 2016 (including the date that the Company will be due consideration for the
production of hydrocarbons in connection with the assets to be acquired); (b) remove the
requirement that we register the primary issuance of the shares of common stock and preferred
stock issuable to the Sellers pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement prior to the closing of the
Asset Purchase (the “Closing”); (c) provide for the issuance of restricted shares of common and
preferred stock to the Sellers at Closing; (d) include representations of the Sellers sufficient to
enable us to confirm that an exemption from registration exists for the issuance of the common
stock and preferred stock due to be issued at Closing; (e) require us to register the resale of the
common stock shares issuable at Closing, after Closing (we are required to file the registration
statement registering such shares no later than 30 days after Closing and obtain effectiveness
thereof no later than 90 days after closing (135 days in the event the SEC reviews such
registration statement)); (f) adjust the number of shares of common and preferred stock we were
allowed to have outstanding immediately prior to Closing; (g) provide for the anticipated issuance
of additional shares of common stock in connection with the debt assumption contemplated at the
Closing; (h) adjust the required timing for our appointment of three director nominees to be
nominated by the Sellers at the Closing to 10 days after the Closing date; (i) require us to
indemnify the Sellers against losses caused by misstatements in the registration statement
unless such losses are caused by information supplied by the Sellers, in which case the Sellers
providing such information are required to indemnify us against such losses; (j) confirm that
certain recent transactions undertaken by the Company relating to the sale of securities (as
previously disclosed by the Company), are approved by the Sellers and that such transactions
did not cause any breaches of the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement; (k) allow for certain
additional issuances of common stock from time to time pursuant to the terms of convertible
securities sold by the Company prior to Closing; (l) allow the Sellers to sell certain property in
Glasscock County, Texas prior to Closing, subject to the pre-approval of such sale by the
Company, and subject to such sale proceeds being placed in escrow until the earlier of Closing
(and thereafter released to the Company) or as mutually agreed by the Company and the Seller
Representative; and (m) remove certain closing conditions which have already been completed
to date from the conditions to Closing described in the Asset Purchase Agreement.
In July and August 2016, RAD2 Minerals, Ltd. (“RAD2”), which is one of the Sellers, and
controlled by Richard Azar, who will become the Company’s largest stockholder and will be
appointed as Executive Chairman following the closing of the Acquisition, advanced the
Company an aggregate of $350,000. This advance does not accrue interest and has no stated
maturity date. The Company anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by RAD2 at the closing
of the Acquisition.
23
In August 2016, two other Sellers advanced the Company an aggregate of $200,000 ($100,000
each). These advances do not accrue interest and have no stated maturity date. The Company
anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by the two Sellers following the closing of the
Acquisition and after completion of the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Stock
Purchase Agreement.
Lucas is currently discussing potential financing transactions in order to fulfill our current capital
requirements as well as our planned asset acquisition, which we believe, if finalized and
completed, will ensure the future viability of the Company. However, due to our current capital
structure and the nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production generally decline
over time as oil and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to obtain the necessary financing
to finalize the asset purchase or drill additional wells and develop our proved undeveloped
reserves (PUDs); coupled with continued lower commodity prices over the last twelve months,
we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time. Therefore, we may be forced to
scale back our business plan, sell assets to satisfy outstanding debts or take other remedial
steps which may include seeking bankruptcy protection.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the
next twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include any
adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be
necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Market Conditions and Commodity Prices
Our financial results depend on many factors, particularly the price of natural gas and crude oil
and our ability to market our production on economically attractive terms. Commodity prices are
affected by many factors outside of our control, including changes in market supply and demand,
which are impacted by weather conditions, inventory storage levels, basis differentials and other
factors. As a result, we cannot accurately predict future commodity prices and, therefore, we
cannot determine with any degree of certainty what effect increases or decreases in these prices
will have on our production volumes or revenues. In addition to production volumes and
commodity prices, finding and developing sufficient amounts of natural gas and crude oil
reserves at economical costs are critical to our long-term success. We expect prices to remain
volatile for the remainder of the year. For information about the impact of realized commodity
prices on our crude oil revenues, refer to “Results of Operations” below.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations for the three-month periods
ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As used below, the
abbreviations “Bbls” stands for barrels, “NGL” stands for natural gas liquids, “Mcf” for thousand
cubic feet and “Boe” for barrels of oil equivalent on the basis of six Mcf per barrel. The majority of
the numbers presented below are rounded numbers and should be considered as approximate.
Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 vs. Three Months Ended June 30, 2015
We reported a net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $1.4 million, or $0.80 per
share. For the same period a year ago, we reported a net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.73 per share.
As discussed in more detail below, our net loss increased by $0.4 million primarily due to a
decrease in sales revenue of $0.2 million and an increase of operating expenses of $0.1 million.
24
The following table sets forth the operating results and production data for the three-month
periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. There were no reportable natural gas sales.

Oil and Gas Revenues
Total crude oil revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased approximately
$0.24 million, or 61%, to $0.15 million from $0.39 million for the same period a year ago due
primarily to an unfavorable crude oil volume variance of $0.15 million coupled with an
unfavorable crude oil price variance of $0.09 million. The production decline can be attributed to
numerous wells being shut-in during the early part of the three months ended June 30, 2016. The
Company has implemented several workover plans in the later part of the current reporting period
in order to get these wells on-line and increase production flows. Additional declines can be
attributed to workover drilling and lateral programs with higher front-end production in the prior
reporting period coupled with production declines primarily related to interference from offset
activity in the current period.
Operating and Other Expenses
The following table summarizes our production costs and operating expenses for the periods
indicated:

Lease Operating Expenses
There was an increase in lease operating expense of approximately $0.1 million including a
significant increase in workovers when comparing the current quarter to the prior year’s period.
As noted above, the Company implemented several workover programs in the later part of the
current period in order to address wells that have been shut-in for a significant period of time. In
total, overall lease operating expenses increased 70% for the current period as compared to the
prior period. The Company has noted an increase in production in the later part of the current
period and anticipates that the additional workover activity will continue to increase production in
the following periods.
Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and Accretion (DD&A)
DD&A decreased for the current quarter as compared to the prior year period by approximately
$0.1 million primarily related to a decrease in production of 3,428 Boe compared to the previous
period. As noted above, the production decrease was primarily due to numerous wells being
shut-in during the early part of current reporting period and drilling and lateral programs with
higher front-end production when compared to the prior period.
General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses and Share-Based Compensation
G&A expenses (not including share-based compensation) increased by approximately $0.1
million for the current quarter as compared to the prior year’s period primarily related to
transaction costs incurred as a result of our entry into the Purchase Agreement noted above.
Although the Company has endured significant expenses related to the Purchase Agreement,
many other G&A Expenses have decreased significantly as we still look to improve the efficiency
of the daily operating activities within the Company by performing functions related to other G&A
expenses internally as opposed to engaging outside support by restructuring employee
responsibilities and duties within the Company. There was also a 30% decrease in share-based
compensation primarily due to a decrease in the awarding of employee stock based options and
compensation, while total G&A expense increased by 20% when comparing the current quarter
to the prior year’s quarter.
Interest Expense
Interest expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 decreased by 12% when compared
to the prior year’s three-month period primarily due to interest payment adjustments made per the
various amendments to the Rogers Loan issued in August 2013 (see “Note 6 – Notes Payable,
Debenture” to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in “Part 1. Financial
Statements” – “Item 1. Financial Statements”, above), which resulted in lower interest payments
being due on such note during the current period compared to last year’s period.
Other Expense
Other expense for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased, in part, by $55,000 when
compared to the prior three-month period due to recording of changes in the derivative liability
associated with the 66,668 April 2014 warrants outstanding. An additional increase of $20,000
related to a payment to the holder of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock in order to induce
the holder to convert the outstanding preferred shares into common stock to comply with the
terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement which required that no shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock were outstanding at the closing (see “Note 8 – Stockholders’ Equity” to our
unaudited consolidated financial statements included in “Part 1. Financial Statements” – “Item 1.
Financial Statements”, above).
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not
include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.
26
The primary sources of cash for Lucas during the three months ended June 30, 2016 were
funds generated from sales of crude oil and funds borrowed under funding agreements.
The primary uses of cash were funds used in operations.
Working Capital
At June 30, 2016, the Company’s total current liabilities of $11.5 million exceeded its total
current assets of $0.6 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $10.9 million, while at
March 31, 2016, the Company’s total current liabilities of $11.1 million exceeded its total
current assets of $0.6 million, resulting in a working capital deficit of $10.5 million. The $0.6
million increase in the working capital deficit is primarily related to cash obtained in
connection with the sale of debt.
Financing
On April 6, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an accredited
institutional investor (the “Investor”), pursuant to which we issued a redeemable
convertible subordinated debenture, with a face amount of $530,000, convertible into
163,077 shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to $3.25 per share (the
“Debenture”) and a warrant to purchase 1,384,616 shares of common stock at an exercise
price equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”). The accredited institutional investor
purchased the Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the sum of $500,000 and
agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, for the
sum of $4.5 million.
On April 6, 2016, the Company also entered into a stock purchase agreement (the
“Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement”) with the Investor, pursuant to which the
Company agreed, subject to certain conditions, to issue a $5.26 million face amount newly
designated Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock (the “Series C Preferred
Stock”) at a 5% original issue discount, convertible into 1,618,462 shares of common
stock at a conversion price of $3.25 per share, and a warrant to purchase 1,111,112 shares
of common stock at an exercise price of $4.50 per share (the “Second Warrant”). Under
the terms of the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement, the Second Warrant and $530,000
of Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $500,000 after the Company closes
the Acquisition, and, assuming the Acquisition closes, the remaining $4.73 million of
Series C Preferred Stock will be sold and issued for $4.5 million immediately after approval
by the Company’s stockholders for NYSE MKT purposes described below, which the
Company is seeking at its special meeting of stockholders to be held on August 23, 2016,
and there is an effective registration statement covering the shares of common stock
issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock and exercise of the Second
Warrant.
On April 11, 2016, the Company, TALL, and Silver Star, entered into an Assignment,
Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement. Pursuant to the
assignment agreement, Silver Star assigned its rights and ownership of a $200,000
convertible note issued by us to Silver Star thereunder dated February 10, 2016 to TALL in
consideration for $200,000. Additionally, Silver Star provided us a release from any liability
in connection with the line of credit and prior convertible notes issued to Silver Star by us.
The assignment agreement also amended the line of credit and terms of any future
convertible notes issued thereunder, to, among other things, increase the monthly
advance limit from $200,000 to $250,000 per month and increase the conversion price of
any future notes issued from $1.50 per share to $3.25 per share. As additional
consideration for TALL agreeing to the terms, we agreed, to grant TALL warrants to
purchase 51,562 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.25 per share, for each
$250,000 loaned pursuant to the terms of the amended line of credit. Subsequently, on
June 27, 2016, TALL and Silver Star attempted to unilaterally rescind the Assignment,
Assumption and Amendment to Line of Credit and Notes Agreement and the transactions
undertaken therewith; however, we refused to recognize such rescission due to the fact
that we were not party to, and did not agree to the terms of, such rescission. To date, the
Company has submitted four $250,000 advance requests for the months of May 2016,
June 2016, July 2016 and August 2016, for which TALL has not provided any funds to
date. The Company is currently reviewing potential remedies for TALL’s breach of its
funding obligations and may in the future file a complaint against TALL.
In July and August 2016, RAD2 Minerals, Ltd. (“RAD2”), which is one of the Sellers, and
controlled by Richard Azar, who will become the Company’s largest stockholder and will
be appointed as Executive Chairman following the closing of the Acquisition, advanced
the Company an aggregate of $350,000. This advance does not accrue interest and has no
stated maturity date. The Company anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by RAD2
at the closing of the Acquisition.
27
In August 2016, two other Sellers advanced the Company an aggregate of $200,000
($100,000 each). These advances do not accrue interest and have no stated maturity date.
The Company anticipates repaying the amounts advanced by the two Sellers following the
closing of the Acquisition and after completion of the transactions contemplated by the
Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.
In addition to the transactions noted above, Lucas is currently discussing potential
financing transactions in order to fulfill our current capital requirements as well as our
planned asset acquisition, which we believe, if finalized and completed, will ensure the
future viability of the Company. However, due to our current capital structure and the
nature of oil and gas interests, i.e., that rates of production generally decline over time as
oil and gas reserves are depleted, if we are unable to obtain the necessary financing to
finalize the asset purchase or drill additional wells and develop our proved undeveloped
reserves (PUDs); coupled with the continued substantial drop in commodity prices over
the last twelve months, we believe that our revenues will continue to decline over time.
Therefore, we may be forced to scale back our business plan, sell assets to satisfy
outstanding debts or take other remedial steps which may include seeking bankruptcy
protection.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern
for the next twelve months. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and
classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.

Net cash used in operating activities was $0.8 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to $0.3 million for the same period a year ago. The increase in net cash
used in operating activities of approximately $0.5 million was primarily related to
production declines, with an associated $0.1 million decrease in depreciation, depletion,
amortization and accretion, a $0.3 increase in net loss and a $0.1 million decrease in
changes to other components of working capital.
Net cash used in investing activities was $0.05 million for the three months ended June 30,
2016 as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of $0.4 million for the same
period a year ago. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due
to $0.5 million in sales of oil and gas properties in the prior period compared to no such
sales in the current period.
Net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was
$0.7 million in connection with proceeds from loans compared to $0.3 million in loan
proceeds in the prior period.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We
are exposed to risks related to increases in the prices of fuel and raw materials consumed
in exploration, development and production. We do not engage in commodity price
hedging activities.
28
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and
principal financial officer), to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The
Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Acting Chief Financial
Officer (our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the
period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company’s Chief Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer (our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer) concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of June 30, 2016.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting during
the three months ended June 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
Lucas is periodically named in legal actions arising from normal business activities. Lucas
evaluates the merits of these actions and, if it determines that an unfavorable outcome is
probable and can be reasonably estimated, Lucas will establish the necessary reserves.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.
There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the
Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, filed with the
Commission on July 13, 2016, except as provided below, and investors should review the
risks provided below and in the Form 10-K prior to making an investment in the Company.
We are currently not in compliance with NYSE MKT continued listing standards and if we
are unable to regain compliance, our common stock may be delisted from the NYSE MKT
equities market, which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common
stock to decline.
Our common stock currently is listed on the NYSE MKT (the “Exchange”). The Exchange
will consider suspending dealings in, or delisting, securities of an issuer that does not
meet its continued listing standards.
On July 21, 2016, we received notice from the Exchange that we were not in compliance
with certain of the Exchange’s continued listing standards as set forth in Part 10 of the
NYSE MKT Company Guide (the “Company Guide”). Specifically, we were not in
compliance with Sections 1003(a)(ii) and (iii) of the Company Guide because we did not
have stockholders’ equity over $4 million (required if an Exchange listed company has
had losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in three of its last four fiscal
years, as we did) or over $6 million (required if an Exchange listed company has had
losses from continuing operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years, as
we did), as of March 31, 2016 (we reported stockholders’ equity of only $2.4 million as of
March 31, 2016 and had reported losses from operations in our five most recent fiscal
years).
In order to maintain our listing on the Exchange, the Exchange has requested that we
submit a plan of compliance (the “Plan”) by August 21, 2016 addressing how we intend to
regain compliance with Sections 1003(a)(ii) and (iii) of the Company Guide by January 21,
2018.
We plan to submit a Plan to the Exchange by the August 21, 2016 deadline. If the
Exchange accepts the plan, we will be able to continue our listing during the plan period
and will be subject to continued periodic review by the Exchange staff. If the Plan is not
accepted or is accepted but we do not make progress consistent with the Plan during the
plan period, we will be subject to delisting procedures as set forth in the Company Guide.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve compliance with the Exchange’s
continued listing standards within the required time frame.
We have been operating under a going concern opinion since December 31, 2014, which
corresponded with the collapse in crude oil prices that began in June 2014. We hope to
close the Acquisition in August or September 2016 and in consideration for the
acquisition, we will issue approximately 13 million shares of common stock, in addition to
preferred stock, and also undertake various preferred stock and debt transactions. These
financings and transactions are expected to return us to compliance with the
requirements of Sections 1003(a)(ii) and (iii) of the Company Guide. Additionally, the oil
and gas reserves planned to be acquired are currently producing approximately 1,000
barrels of oil equivalent per day from 25 wells, which, together with the transactions above,
should generate sufficient revenues and cash flows to mitigate the doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern.
Notwithstanding the above, we may be unable to regain compliance with the Exchange’s
continued listing standards described above or may be deemed to be out of compliance
with other of the Exchange’s continued listing standards. Our business has been and may
continue to be affected by worldwide macroeconomic factors, which include uncertainties
in the credit and capital markets. External factors that affect our stock price, such as
liquidity requirements of our investors, as well as our performance, could impact our
market capitalization, revenue and operating results, which, in turn, affect our ability to
comply with the Exchange’s listing standards. The Exchange has the ability to suspend
trading in our common stock or remove our common stock from listing on the Exchange if
in the opinion of the Exchange: (a) the financial condition and/or operating results of the
Company appear to be unsatisfactory; or (b) it appears that the extent of public
distribution or the aggregate market value of our common stock has become so reduced
as to make further dealings on the Exchange inadvisable; or (c) we have sold or otherwise
disposed of our principal operating assets, or have ceased to be an operating company;
or (d) we have failed to comply with our listing agreements with the Exchange (including
those described above); or (e) any other event shall occur or any condition shall exist
which makes further dealings on the Exchange unwarranted.
30
If we are unable to satisfy the Exchange’s criteria for continued listing and are unable to
regain compliance during any applicable cure periods, our common stock would be
subject to delisting. A delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by,
among other things, reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock and
reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which
could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing. In addition, delisting from the
Exchange might negatively impact our reputation and, as a consequence, our business.
Additionally, if we were delisted from the Exchange and are not able to list our common
stock on another national exchange we will no longer be eligible to use Form S-3
registration statements and will instead be required to file a Form S-1 registration
statement for any primary or secondary offerings of our common stock, which would
delay our ability to raise funds in the future, may limit the type of offerings of common
stock we could undertake, and would increase the expenses of any offering, as, among
other things, registration statements on Form S-1 are subject to SEC review and
comments whereas take downs pursuant to a previously filed Form S-3 are not.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS.
On April 6, 2016, we issued (i) a redeemable convertible subordinated debenture, with a
face amount of $530,000, convertible into 163,077 shares of our common stock at a
conversion price equal to $3.25 per share (the “Debenture”) and (ii) a warrant to purchase
1,384,616 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment thereunder) at an exercise price
equal to $3.25 per share (the “First Warrant”) to an institutional investor. The investor
agreed to purchase the Debenture at a 5.0% original issue discount for the sum of
$500,000 and agreed that it will exercise the First Warrant, upon satisfaction of certain
conditions, for the sum of $4.5 million. The sale and issuance of the securities described
above have been determined to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act in
reliance on Sections 3(a)(9) and 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rule 506 of Regulation D
promulgated thereunder and Regulation S promulgated thereunder, as transactions by an
issuer not involving a public offering. The investor represented that it is an accredited
investor, as that term is defined in Regulation D. The investor also represented that it is
acquiring the securities for investment purposes only and not with a view to or for sale in
connection with any distribution thereof.
On April 19, 2016, the holder of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, agreed to
convert all 500 shares of our outstanding Series A Convertible Preferred Stock into 20,000
shares of our common stock (a conversion ratio of 40:1 as provided in the original
designation of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock adjusted for our 1:25 reverse
stock split effective on July 25, 2015), which conversion was completed on April 25, 2016.
We agreed to pay the holder $20,000 in connection with and effective upon such
conversion in order to comply with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement that no
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are outstanding at the closing of the
Acquisition. We claim an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act for the sale and issuance of the securities pursuant to (a) Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act; and/or (b) Rule 506 of the Securities Act, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder. With respect to the transactions described above, no general solicitation was
made either by us or by any person acting on our behalf. The transactions were privately
negotiated, and did not involve any kind of public solicitation. No underwriters or agents
were involved in the foregoing sales and issuances and we paid no underwriting
discounts or commissions.
On April 21, 2016, Rockwell Capital Partners, Inc., who was previously assigned $300,000
of the Convertible Notes by Silver Star on February 2, 2016, converted $159,780 of the
principal and interest due on such Convertible Notes into shares of our common stock at
a conversion price of $1.50 per share, and was issued an aggregate of 106,520 shares. We
claim an exemption from registration provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, as
the security was exchanged by us with our existing security holder in a transaction where
no commission or other remuneration was paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting
such exchange.

the Company an aggregate of $350,000. This advance does not accrue interest and has no
