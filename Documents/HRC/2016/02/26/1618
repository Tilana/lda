Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of): draft resolution 
</b></p>
<p><b>25/&#8230;  Adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate 
standard of living 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i>Reaffirming</i> that international human rights law instruments, including the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and 
Cultural Rights, entail obligations and commitments of States parties in relation to access to 
adequate housing,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling</i> all previous resolutions adopted by the Commission on Human Rights on 
the issue of women&#8217;s equal rights to ownership of, access to and control over land and the 
equal rights to own property and to adequate housing, including resolution 2005/25 of 15 
April 2005,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recalling also</i> its resolutions 5/1, on institution-building of the Human Rights 
Council, and 5/2, on the Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate Holders of the 
Council, of 18 June 2007, and stressing that the mandate holder shall discharge his/her 
duties in accordance with those resolutions and the annexes thereto,<b> 
</b></p>
<p>  
</p>

<p><i>Reaffirming</i> all its previous resolutions, as well as those adopted by the Commission 
on Human Rights on the issue of adequate housing as a component of the right to an 
adequate standard of living, including Council resolution 19/4 of 22 March 2012,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Reaffirming also </i>the principles and commitments with regard to adequate housing 
enshrined in the relevant provisions of declarations and programmes adopted by major 
United Nations conferences and summits and at special sessions of the General Assembly 
and at their follow-up meetings, inter alia, the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements 
and the Habitat Agenda,1 and the Declaration on Cities and Other Human Settlements in the 
New Millennium, adopted at the twenty-fifth special session of the Assembly and annexed 
to its resolution S-25/2 of 9 June 2001, 
</p>
<p><i>Noting</i> the work of the United Nations treaty bodies, in particular the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, in the promotion of the rights related to adequate 
housing, including all its relevant general comments, 
</p>
<p><i>Recalling </i>the Global Housing Strategy of the United Nations Human Settlements 
Programme, the principles on housing and property restitution for refugees and displaced 
persons2 and the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, 
Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security, 
</p>
<p><i>Concerned</i> that more than 860 million people are still living in unserviced and 
unplanned urban poor settlements, up from 725 million in 2000; that, despite the significant 
efforts to improve the living conditions of urban settlement dwellers, the net growth in the 
number of people living in these settlements continues to outpace the improvements; and 
that persons living in such conditions are particularly vulnerable to, inter alia, disease, 
natural and man-made disasters, unemployment and a lack of education, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that, in recent years, millions of homeowners have been affected 
by foreclosures and that high foreclosure rates may have an impact on the enjoyment of the 
right to adequate housing, and equally concerned that, in recent years, there has been an 
increase in private housing rentals for the urban poor without a balanced framework to 
protect tenants and owners, and that rental options for the urban poor are still insufficient 
and inadequate, 
</p>
<p><i>Deeply concerned </i>that any deterioration in the general housing situation 
disproportionately affects persons living in conditions of poverty, low-income earners, 
women, children, persons belonging to minorities and indigenous peoples, migrants, 
internally displaced persons, tenants, the elderly, persons with disabilities and other persons 
belonging to marginalized groups or persons belonging to groups in vulnerable situations, 
and that tenure insecurity per se might result in discrimination and further exclusion, 
particularly social and economic exclusion,<b> 
</b></p>
<p><i>Recognizing </i>that security of tenure enhances the enjoyment of the right to adequate 
housing and is significant to the enjoyment of many other economic, social, cultural, civil 
and political rights, and that all persons should possess a degree of security of tenure that 
guarantees legal protection against forced eviction, harassment and other threats, 
</p>
<p><i>Recognizing also</i> the need to promote, protect and strengthen a variety of tenure 
forms, as part of mainstreaming human rights, in particular in urban development, including 
in housing and slum upgrading, urban planning, land management and land administration 
policies, to ensure social integration, with the full participation of all relevant stakeholders,

<p>1. <i>Welcomes</i> the work of the Special Rapporteur on adequate housing as a 
component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and on the right to non-
discrimination in this context, including the undertaking of country missions; 
</p>
<p>2. <i>Acknowledges with appreciation </i>in particular the report of the Special 
Rapporteur on security of tenure for the urban poor3 and the guiding principles on security 
of tenure for the urban poor as laid out therein, and encourages States to take these 
guidelines into account when planning and implementing measures to improve the security 
of tenure for the urban poor; 
</p>
<p>3. <i>Calls upon</i> States to give due consideration to the human right to adequate 
housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of living and to issues related 
to universal access to decent and sustainable housing in the elaboration of the post-2015 
development agenda; 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Decides</i> to extend, for a period of three years, the mandate of the Special 
Rapporteur on adequate housing as a component of the right to an adequate standard of 
living, and on the right to non-discrimination in this context, as set out in Human Rights 
Council resolution 15/8 of 30 September 2010; 
</p>
<p>5. <i>Notes</i> the work on the basic principles and guidelines on development-based 
evictions and displacement and the need to continue to work on them, including through 
consultations with States and other stakeholders; 
</p>
<p>6. <i>Requests</i> the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights to provide all necessary assistance to the Special Rapporteur for the 
effective fulfilment of his or her mandate<b>; 
</b></p>
<p>7. <i>Notes</i> <i>with appreciation</i> the cooperation extended to date to the Special 
Rapporteur by different actors, and calls upon States: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) To continue to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur in the discharge of his 
or her mandate and to respond favourably to his or her requests for information and visits; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To enter into a constructive dialogue with the Special Rapporteur with 
respect to the follow-up to and implementation of his or her recommendations<b>;</b> 
</p>
<p>8. <i>Decides</i> to continue its consideration of this matter under the same agenda 
item.<b>
