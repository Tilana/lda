</p>
<p><b>Summary 
</b></p>
<p> There is a good deal to commend about the record of the United States of America on 
extrajudicial killings: in most instances, there is no lack of laws or procedures for addressing 
potentially unlawful killings and, at least domestically, data are generally gathered systematically 
and responsibly. I found, however, three areas in which significant improvement is necessary if 
the Government of the United States is to bring its actions into line with its stated commitment to 
human rights and the rule of law. 
</p>
<p> First, the Government must ensure that the imposition of the death penalty complies with 
fundamental due process requirements; the current system&#8217;s flaws increase the likelihood that 
innocent people will be executed. Second, the Government must provide greater transparency in 
law enforcement, military and intelligence operations that result in potentially unlawful deaths. 
Third, it must overcome the current failure of political will and ensure greater accountability for 
potentially unlawful deaths in its international operations; political expediency is never a 
permissible basis for any State to deviate from its obligation to investigate and punish violations 
of the right to life. 
</p>
<p> It is widely acknowledged that innocent people have likely been sentenced to death and 
executed. Yet, in Alabama and Texas, I found a shocking lack of urgency with regard to the need 
to reform glaring criminal justice system flaws. Each State should undertake a systematic inquiry 
into its criminal justice system and ensure that the death penalty is applied fairly, justly and only 
for the most serious crimes. Deficiencies that should be remedied include the lack of adequate 
counsel for indigent defendants and racial disparities in sentencing. The system of electing 
judges in both States should be reconsidered, because it politicizes the death penalty and unfairly 
increases the likelihood of a capital sentence. Given the inadequacies of state criminal justice 
systems, Congress should enact legislation permitting federal court habeas review of state and 
federal death penalty cases on the merits. 
</p>
<p> I am also concerned that the death penalty could be imposed under the Military 
Commissions Act of 2006, the provisions of which violate the due process requirements of 
international human rights and humanitarian law. I welcome the Government&#8217;s stay of 
commission proceedings. It should not resort to prosecutions under the Act again. 
</p>
<p> Significant attention needs to be given to promoting transparency in the case of potentially 
unlawful killings. Domestically, although the Government does a strong job of collecting data 
generally, it fails to provide timely and meaningful information about deaths in immigration 
detention or arising out of law-enforcement activities. 
</p>
<p> Transparency failures are far more acute in the Government&#8217;s international military and 
intelligence operations. First, the Government has failed to track and make public the number of 
civilian casualties or the conditions under which deaths occurred. Second, the military justice 
system fails to provide ordinary people, including United States citizens and the families of Iraqi 
or Afghan victims, basic information on the status of investigations into civilian casualties or 
prosecutions resulting therefrom. Third, the Government has refused to disclose the legal basis 
for targeted killings conducted through drone attacks on the territory of other States or to identify 
any safeguards in place to reduce collateral civilian casualties and ensure that the Government 
has targeted the correct person. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.5 
  page 3 
 
</p>
<p> These transparency failures contribute to the lack of accountability for wrongful deaths. 
They represent a lost opportunity to learn from mistakes and apply policies and practices that 
reduce casualties. Unsurprisingly, they have undermined support for operations by the 
United States. Such failures are remedied relatively easily, and the measures I recommend 
should be implemented expeditiously. 
</p>
<p> All States have an obligation to effectively investigate, prosecute and punish violations of 
the right to life, including in situations of armed conflict. It is important, of course, to 
acknowledge the unique characteristics and challenges of armed conflict, including that 
intentional killing may be permitted. The obligation to enforce the law, however, does not 
change: the rule of law must be upheld in war as in peace. 
</p>
<p> Some aspects of the rule of law have been taken seriously during United States military 
operations. Thus, after visiting Afghanistan in May 2008, I noted no evidence that international 
forces in Afghanistan, including those of the United States, were committing widespread 
intentional killings in violation of human rights or humanitarian law. In addition, the 
Government has implemented compensation programmes for civilian victims of United States 
military operations. While these programmes should be improved, the United States has shown 
admirable leadership in relation to compensation payments. 
</p>
<p> However, there have been chronic and deplorable accountability failures with respect to 
policies, practices and conduct that resulted in alleged unlawful killings, including possible war 
crimes, in the international operations conducted by the United States. The Government has 
failed to effectively investigate and punish lower-ranking soldiers for such deaths, and has not 
held senior officers responsible under the doctrine of command responsibility. Worse, it has 
effectively created a zone of impunity for private contractors and civilian intelligence agents by 
failing to investigate and prosecute them. 
</p>
<p> These accountability failures arise in part from a lack of political and prosecutorial will 
that is utterly inconsistent with the Government&#8217;s stated commitment to upholding the rule of 
law. The new administration&#8217;s expressed desire to &#8220;move forward&#8221; from past unlawful policies 
and practices is understandable, but cannot be accomplished without accountability. It would set 
a dangerous precedent, domestically and internationally, if the Government were to bow to 
political pressure and fail to enforce its own laws against wrongful deaths and illegal abuse. 
</p>
<p> Although there is no substitute for prosecution of violations of the right to life, in the short 
term there are other steps that the Government can take towards transparency and accountability. 
One is the creation of a national commission of inquiry to conduct an independent, systematic 
and sustained investigation of policies and practices that lead to deaths and other abuses. Another 
is the appointment of a special prosecutor independent of the pressures on the political branches 
of Government. Adoption of both mechanisms would send a strong message that the 
United States is truly &#8220;moving forward&#8221;.<b> </b></p>

</p>
<p><b>I.  BACKGROUND AND INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK 
</b></p>
<p>1. I spent two weeks (16-30 June 2008) visiting the United States of America at the invitation 
of the Government and met with federal and state officials, judges, civil society groups, and 
victims and witnesses in Washington DC, New York City, Montgomery (Alabama), and Austin 
(Texas). 
</p>
<p>2. I am grateful to the Government of the United States for its cooperation and for facilitating 
meetings with officials from the Departments of State, Justice, Defense and Homeland Security, 
as well as officials in Alabama and Texas. The Government&#8217;s willingness to invite me and to 
engage in a constructive dialogue sends an important message. I am also grateful to the 
representatives of civil society organizations who met with me. 
</p>
<p>3. Although the title of my mandate may seem complex, it should be simply understood as 
including any killing that violates international human rights or humanitarian law. This may 
include unlawful killings by the police, deaths in military or civilian custody, killings of civilians 
in armed conflict in violation of humanitarian law, and patterns of killings by private individuals 
which are not adequately investigated and prosecuted by the authorities. My mandate is not 
abolitionist, but the death penalty falls within it with regard to due process guarantees, the death 
penalty&#8217;s limitation to the most serious crimes and its prohibition for juvenile offenders and the 
mentally ill. 
</p>
<p>4. The United States is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the 
Convention against Torture and the Geneva Conventions of 1949.<b> </b>Like all parties to armed 
conflicts, the United States is also bound by customary and conventional international 
humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  DOMESTIC ISSUES 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  The death penalty:  the risk of executing the innocent 
</b></p>
<p>5. In the United States, 35 states, the federal Government and the U.S. military provide for 
the death penalty.<b>1</b> Some 3,300 people are on death row across the country, and, since 1976, 
1,145 people have been executed. My mission focused on the federal death penalty and the 
application of the death penalty in Alabama and Texas. Alabama has the highest per capita rate 
of executions in the United States, while Texas has the largest total number of executions and 
one of the largest death row populations.<b>2</b> 
</p>
<p>6. Since 1973, 130 death row inmates have been exonerated across the United States. This 
number continues to grow. While I was in Texas, the conviction of yet another person on death 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  The number of states does not include New Mexico; legislation repealing the death penalty in 
</p>
<p>New Mexico will take effect on July 1, 2009. 
<b>2
</b>  Since 1976, Texas has executed 429 people. The state with the next highest number of total 
</p>
<p>executions is Virginia, which executed 102 people over the same period. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.5

</p>
<p>row was overturned by the Court of Criminal Appeals.<b>3</b> Although in that case DNA testing 
ultimately prevented the execution of an innocent man, other possible innocents have been less 
fortunate. In many cases, either because of inadequate laws or practices governing the 
preservation of evidence or because of the passage of time, there is no longer any physical 
evidence that can be DNA tested and potentially exonerate the inmate. In some states, legal 
barriers - such as a lack of a post-conviction DNA access laws - make DNA testing difficult for 
death row inmates to obtain.<b>4</b> In yet other cases, biological evidence is immaterial and other 
evidentiary or procedural issues preclude a just or reliable basis for imposing the death penalty. 
7. I met a range of officials and others who acknowledged that innocent people might have 
been executed. Serious flaws in the system are of obvious significance to the innocent convicted 
person, but also of serious concern for victims&#8217; families and the wider community, because 
wrongful convictions mean that true criminals remain at large. 
</p>
<p>8. At present, a great deal of time and energy is spent trying to expedite executions. A better 
priority would be to analyze where the criminal justice system is failing in capital cases and why 
innocent people are being sentenced to death. In Texas, there is at least official recognition that 
reforms are needed and that innocent people may have been executed. In Alabama, the situation 
remains highly problematic. Government officials seem strikingly indifferent to the risk of 
executing innocent people and have a range of standard responses to due process concerns 
(which are sometimes seen as &#8220;technicalities&#8221;), most of which are characterized by a refusal to 
engage with the facts. When I confronted them with cases in which death row inmates have been 
retried and acquitted, officials explained that a &#8220;not guilty&#8221; verdict does not mean the defendant 
was actually innocent and that most defendants &#8220;played the system&#8221; and probably were guilty. 
But the truth is that Alabama&#8217;s capital system is simply not designed to uncover cases of 
innocence, however compelling they might be. Alabama may already have executed innocent 
people, but its officials would rather deny than confront criminal justice system flaws.<b>5</b>

</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  In Texas, by statute, a convicted person may apply for post-conviction DNA testing if certain 
</p>
<p>requirements are met. Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 64. The requirements are set 
at a high threshold and, as a result, some convicted persons are denied access to DNA testing. 
The situation is worse in Alabama. Alabama is one of seven states that does not have a specific 
post-conviction DNA access law at all. Inmates must seek DNA testing through the regular 
post-conviction claim channels, which have strict procedural and time requirements. 
<b>5
</b>  Alabama&#8217;s systematic rejection of concerns that basic international standards are being 
</p>
<p>violated sits oddly alongside the Government&#8217;s determined and successful bid to attract foreign 
investment from the European Union in particular. Indeed, Alabama&#8217;s largest export market is 
Germany. See U.S. Department of Commerce, &#8220;Alabama: Exports, Jobs, and Foreign 
Investment&#8221; (September 2008), <i>available at</i> http://www.trade.gov/td/industry/otea/ 
state_reports/alabama.html. Alabama&#8217;s death penalty policies are thus an appropriate subject for 
dialogue with the international community. </p>

</p>
<p>9. Given the rising number of innocent people being exonerated nationwide, both state and 
federal Governments need to investigate and fix the problems in their criminal justice systems. 
As a start, I recommend that: (1) problems already recognized as such, including lack of judicial 
independence and the absence of an adequate right to counsel, should be addressed immediately; 
(2) systematic review of criminal justice system flaws, including racial disparities in capital 
cases, should be undertaken to identify needed reforms; and (3) federal courts should be 
authorized to review all substantive claims of injustice in capital cases. In light of the United 
States&#8217; international law obligations with respect to the death penalty, I also recommend that: 
(4) state and federal legislatures ensure that the death penalty only be applied for the &#8220;most 
serious crimes&#8221;; and (5) review and reconsideration be provided to foreign nationals on death 
row who were denied the right to consular notification. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Judicial independence 
</b></p>
<p>10. Alabama and Texas both have partisan elections for judges.<b>6</b> My mandate does not extend 
to an evaluation of how a system of multi-million dollar campaigns for judicial office comports 
with judicial independence requirements. But if - as research and practice show - the outcome of 
such a system is to jeopardize the right of capital defendants to a fair trial and appeal, there is 
clearly a need to consider changes. Studies reveal that in states where judges are elected there is 
a direct correlation between the level of public support for the death penalty and judges&#8217; 
willingness to impose or uphold death sentences. There is no such correlation in non-elective 
states. In particular, research shows that, in order to attract votes or campaign funds, judges are 
more likely to impose or refuse to reverse death sentences when: elections are nearing; elections 
are tightly contested; pro-capital punishment interest organizations are active within a district or 
state; and judges have electoral experience.<b>7</b> 
11. The goal of an independent judiciary is to ensure that justice is done in individual cases 
according to law. Too often, though, under judicial electoral systems, the death penalty is treated 
as a political rather than a legal matter.<b>8</b> The significant impact of judicial electoral systems on 
capital punishment cases was recognized by many with whom I spoke. They strongly suggested 
that judges in both Texas and Alabama consider themselves to be under popular pressure to

</b>  Judges in both states are elected for 6-year terms. See Article 5, Constitution of the State of

</p>
<p>impose and uphold death sentences and that decisions to the contrary would lead to electoral 
defeat. Numerous government officials in both states openly stated that it was not possible to 
speak out against the death penalty and hope to get re-elected.<b>9</b> 
</p>
<p>12. In Alabama, the problem of politicizing death sentences is heightened because state law 
permits judges to &#8220;override&#8221; the jury&#8217;s opinion in sentencing.<b>10</b> Thus, even if a jury unanimously 
decides to sentence a defendant to life in prison, the judge can instead impose a death sentence. 
When judges override jury decisions, it is nearly always to increase the sentence to death rather 
than to decrease it to life - 90% of overrides imposed the death penalty. And a significant 
proportion of those on death row would not be there if jury verdicts had been respected. Over 
20% of those currently on death row were given the death sentence by a judge overruling a jury 
decision for life without parole.<b>11</b> According to one study, judicial overrides are twice as 
common in the year before a judge seeks re-election than in other years.<b>12</b> In light of concerns 
about possible innocence and the irreversible nature of the death penalty, Alabama should relieve 
judges of the invidious influence of politics by repealing the law permitting judicial override. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Right to counsel 
</b></p>
<p>13. One of the most fundamental rights Governments must provide criminal defendants is the 
right to counsel, which helps ensure defendants receive fair trials.<b>13</b> But the right is empty, and 
reliable and just trial outcomes are threatened, if the quality of counsel is poor. In both Alabama 
and Texas, a surprisingly broad range of people in and out of government acknowledged that 
existing programs for providing criminal defense counsel to indigent defendants are inadequate. 
</p>
<p>14. Neither state has a statewide public defender system. Instead, individual counties in each 
state determine how counsel for the indigent will be appointed, with most opting for 
court-appointed counsel.<b>14</b> One effect of such a system is that defense counsel are less likely to 
be independent. Counsel must appear before the same judges for their appointed death penalty 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  Indeed, I viewed a number of election advertisements by prospective judges in which the 
</p>
<p>underlying message was the judge&#8217;s commitment to handing down death sentences.

</b></p>
<p>  In Alabama, just four of 41 judicial circuits have a public defender (and only one represents 
capital defendants). Most of the circuits appoint attorneys for an hourly fee. The options for the 
counties are set out in state legislation: Alabama Code, &#167; 15-12-4(e) (2006). </p>

</p>
<p>cases as for the rest of their legal practice. Not surprisingly, this can create structural 
disincentives for vigorous capital defense.<b>15</b> Such structural problems are compounded by 
inadequate compensation for counsel.<b>16</b> Until 1998, court-appointed counsel in Alabama could 
only be compensated up to $1,000 per phase of the case.<b>17</b> A significant proportion of current 
death row inmates were convicted during the time that cap was in place. Although hourly caps 
were subsequently enacted, they bear similarly little relation to the true costs of effectively 
defending a death penalty case. 
</p>
<p>15. Failure to provide an adequately-funded state-wide public defender has the predictable 
result of poor legal representation for defendants in capital cases.<b>18</b> In Texas, one well-informed 
Government official referred to the overall quality of appointed defense counsel as &#8220;abysmal.&#8221; In 
Alabama, I read appellate legal briefs, submitted on behalf of defendants on death row, that 
barely reached ten pages, did not request oral argument, or were largely a bare restatement of the 
facts. Cost concerns also limit the extent to which qualified experts can or will be retained for the 
defense.<b>19</b> 
</p>
<p>16. For there to be a meaningful right to counsel, major reforms are required. A positive first 
step is the system recently established in West Texas - a pilot multi-county public defender to 
provide capital defense in 85 counties. This project is an exception, however, and in both Texas 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>15
</b>  A further structural problem with court-appointed defense counsel systems is that judges are 
</p>
<p>likely to appoint defense counsel based on factors that could compromise counsel&#8217;s 
independence, including: the advice of state prosecutors; the defense counsel&#8217;s ability to move 
cases &#8216;regardless of the quality defense they provide&#8217;; on the basis of campaign contributions; 
and based on personal friendships. Texas Defender Service, <i>A State of Denial: Texas and the 
Death Penalty</i> (2000), p. 79.

<p>  The $1,000 cap no longer applies. Presently, trial counsel can receive $60 per hour of work in 
court, and $40 per hour of work out of court: Alabama Code, &#167; 15-12-21(d) (2006). Appellate 
counsel on a direct appeal can receive $60 per hour, capped at $2,000 per appeal: Alabama Code, 
&#167; 15-12-22(d)(3) (2006). There is no right to post-conviction counsel, but if such counsel is 
appointed, the fee is capped at $1,000: Alabama Code, &#167; 15-12-23(d) (2006).

<p>17. Studies from across the country show racial disparities in the application of the death 
penalty.<b>20</b> The weight of the scholarship suggests that the death penalty is more likely to be 
imposed when the victim is white, and/or the defendant is African American. 
</p>
<p>18. When I raised racial disparity concerns with federal and state Government officials, I was 
met with indifference or flat denial. Some officials had not read any specific reports or studies on 
race disparity and showed little concern for the issue. Others conceded racial disparity exists, but 
invoked a handful of studies suggesting the cause was not racial bias.<b>21</b> Thus, I was told that the 
overrepresentation of African Americans among those sentenced to death as opposed to life 
without parole was related to racial disparities in criminality, or to the overrepresentation of 
African Americans in the prison population generally. Many officials dismissed the results of 
studies showing racial disparity as biased, claiming they were written by researchers with 
anti-death penalty views. Some dismissed the results of studies but then admitted that they had

<b>21
</b></p>
<p>  Federal Justice Department officials relied heavily upon a 2006 Rand Corporation study that 
identified the heinousness of the crime rather than race as the principal determinant in seeking 
the death penalty. But the study itself warned that its finding were not definitive given the 
difficulty of determining causation based on statistical modeling. See Klein, Berk, and 
Hickman, <i>Race and the Decision to Seek the Death Penalty in Federal Case</i>. The study&#8217;s 
methodology has been criticised for using selective data, framing the issue very narrowly, and 
limiting its investigation to Janet Reno&#8217;s term as Attorney-General. See: ACLU, <i>The Persistent 
Problem of Racial Disparities in the Federal Death Penalty</i> (25 June 2007). See also Death 
Penalty Information Center, &#8220;Racial and Geographical Disparities in the Federal Death Penalty&#8221;

<p>not carefully looked at them. These responses are highly disappointing. They suggest a damaging 
unwillingness to confront the role that race can play in the criminal justice system generally, and 
in the imposition of the death penalty specifically. Given the stakes, both state and federal 
Governments need to systematically review and respond to concerns about continuing racial 
disparities. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Systematic evaluation of the criminal justice system 
</b>19. There is a clear onus on states to systematically evaluate the workings of their criminal 
justice systems to ensure that the death penalty is not imposed unjustly. In Texas, the Court of 
Criminal Appeals recently set up a Criminal Justice Integrity Unit to examine wrongful 
conviction issues. This is a positive development, but much more is needed. An appropriate 
approach would be for the Texas legislature to establish, as some have proposed,<b>22</b> an Innocence 
Commission designed to assess systematically why people have been wrongly convicted and 
then to apply those lessons with recommendations for criminal justice system reform. 
20. Alabama could draw on the in-depth analysis of its system produced by the American Bar 
Association (ABA).<b>23</b> While various state officials dismissed the ABA as biased, they generally 
acknowledged that those who conducted the study were serious lawyers. In any event, none of 
the officials with whom I spoke had undertaken a thorough analysis of the report. Given the 
seriousness of the problems identified, and officials&#8217; reluctance to undertake any alternative 
in-depth study, it is incumbent upon the authorities to formally respond to the ABA&#8217;s findings 
and recommendations. Alabama officials could indicate the seriousness of their concern about 
alleged injustices if they gave reasons for accepting or rejecting the ABA&#8217;s specific 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Federal habeas corpus review 
</b></p>
<p>21. A capital defendant convicted by a state court can (after exhausting state habeas corpus 
review) bring a habeas corpus suit in federal court to challenge the conviction.<b>24</b> But federal 
courts&#8217; role in reviewing state-imposed death sentences has been curtailed by legislation 
designed to &#8220;expedite&#8221; such cases. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 
(AEDPA) prevents federal habeas review of many issues, imposes a six-month statute of 
limitation for inmates seeking to file federal habeas claims, and restricts access to an evidentiary 
hearing at the federal level.<b>25</b> As initially enacted, AEDPA permitted states to opt in to expedited 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>22
</b>  See, e.g., Texas Senate Bill 263, <i>A bill to be entitled an act relating to the creation of a 
</i></p>
<p><i>commission to investigate and prevent wrongful convictions</i> (23 April 2007). 
<b>23
</b></p>
<p>  ABA Alabama Report, n. 9 above. 
<b>24
</b></p>
<p>  In California, for example, &#8220;70 per cent of the habeas petitions in death cases have achieved 
relief in the federal courts, even though relief was denied when the same claims were asserted in 
state courts&#8221;. See <i>Report and Recommendations on the Administration of the Death Penalty in 
California</i> (30 June 2008), p. 57. 
<b>25
</b></p>
<p>  As amended, these provisions are at 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2261. </p>

</p>
<p>federal review of death penalty cases if the state provided counsel for indigent death row inmates 
in post-conviction cases.<b>26</b> But federal courts, which were originally responsible for determining 
whether states qualified for expedited review, found that few states met statutory requirements 
for proper provision of counsel. (Texas was among those states denied qualification.) The 
appropriate response to the federal courts&#8217; findings would have been to improve state indigent 
defense systems. Instead, Congress amended the law to permit the Department of Justice (DOJ) 
to issue regulations under which DOJ, rather than the courts, would certify state indigent defense 
systems.<b>27</b> The regulations that came into effect on 12 January 2009 are grossly inadequate.<b>28</b> 
They do not specify: the level of competency that must be exhibited by state appointed counsel; 
the amount of litigation expenses that counsel must be provided with; or that counsel must 
receive reasonable or adequate compensation. Such matters are left to the discretion of the states, 
thus effectively eviscerating both the federal oversight function and incentives for states to 
improve indigent defense. These regulations should be amended or repealed. 
</p>
<p>22. When I asked one official with responsibility for handling federal habeas cases about the 
impact of AEDPA, I was told that although the restrictive legislation may prevent some 
meritorious claims from being raised, rules were necessary to enforce finality. I agree that 
finality is important in criminal cases, and that it serves important purposes both for victims and 
the system as a whole. But presently, too much weight is given to finality and too little to the due 
process rights of the accused and to the Government&#8217;s obligation to ensure that innocent people 
are not executed. Given the serious concerns about the fairness of state-level trials and appeals, 
the federal writ of habeas corpus plays a critical role in capital cases. Congress should 
investigate whether state criminal justice systems fail to protect constitutional rights in capital 
cases, and also enact legislation permitting federal courts to review <i>de novo </i>all merits issues in 
death penalty cases, with appropriate exceptions, such as where a defendant attempts deliberately 
to bypass state court procedures. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Most serious crimes 
</b></p>
<p>23. States that retain the death penalty may only permit capital punishment for the &#8220;most 
serious crimes.&#8221;<b>29</b> Under international law, this means crimes requiring an intention to kill that 
results in the loss of life.<b>30</b> However, several U.S. jurisdictions allow the death penalty for lesser 
crimes. For example, the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 permits the death penalty for crimes 
such as the running of large-scale drug enterprises.<b>31</b> During my mission, there was an

The Court&#8217;s decision brings U.S. law further in line with international human rights law. Federal 
and state Governments should amend the remaining laws permitting capital punishment to 
conform to international law. 
</p>
<p><b>7.  Consular notification 
</b></p>
<p>24, Of particular importance in Texas are the cases in which foreign nationals have been 
sentenced to death without the opportunity to contact their national consulates for assistance as 
required by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR), to which the United States 
has been a party since 1969.<b>33</b> In 2008, Texas executed two Mexican nationals who had not been 
notified of their consular rights.<b>34</b> Of the remaining 25 foreign nationals on Texas&#8217;s death row, 
14 (twelve Mexicans, one Honduran and one Argentinean) were not informed of their consular 
rights at the appropriate time.<b>35</b> 
</p>
<p>25. The federal Government has acknowledged that it has a legal obligation to provide review 
and reconsideration of the cases of Mexican nationals on death row who were not notified of 
their consular rights.<b>36</b> Review is necessary to determine whether any of these individuals was

</b>  128 S. Ct. 2641 (2008). Five states (Louisiana, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas, South Carolina)

positive recent developments in the Supreme Court&#8217;s death penalty jurisprudence are <i>Roper v. 
Simmons</i> 543 U.S. 551 (2005) (holding that juveniles or persons who committed crimes as 
juveniles could not be executed) and <i>Atkins v. Virginia</i> 536 U.S. 304 (2002) (striking down the 
death penalty for mentally retarded defendants). 
<b>33
</b></p>
<p>  Article 36(1)(b) of the VCCR provides: &#8220;if he so requests, the competent authorities of the 
receiving State shall, without delay, inform the consular post of the sending State if, within its 
consular district, a national of that State is arrested or committed to prison or to custody pending 
trial or is detained in any other manner. Any communication addressed to the consular post by 
the person arrested, in prison, custody or detention shall also be forwarded by the said authorities 
without delay. The said authorities shall inform the person concerned without delay of his rights 
under this sub-paragraph.&#8221;

<p>prejudiced by the lack of consular notification. But the Texas Legislature has failed to authorize 
state courts to provide this review, and the U.S. Congress has similarly failed to authorize federal 
courts to do so.<b>37</b> The very simplicity of the available solutions makes it all the more disturbing 
that nothing has been done. 
</p>
<p>26. Texas officials told me their refusal to provide review was supported by the U.S. Supreme 
Court&#8217;s decision, in <i>Medellin v. Texas</i>,<b>38</b> that the federal Government could not force Texas to 
abide by the United States&#8217; international legal obligations. As one senior Texas official noted, it 
is not a popular notion in Texas to be seen to be &#8220;submitting&#8221; to the International Court of 
Justice. But it is a bedrock principle of international law that when a country takes on 
international legal obligations, those obligations bind the entire state apparatus, whether or not it 
is organized as a federal system.<b>39</b> There are many federal systems around the world, and they 
have all devised means to ensure that treaties, whether dealing with trade, investment, diplomatic 
immunities, or human rights, bind the entire state, including its constituent parts. Nor is it 
&#8220;submission&#8221; to respect the treaty rights and obligations by which the United States voluntarily 
agreed to abide - and from which American citizens have benefitted for nearly 40 years. 
Consular rights protection not only affects foreign nationals currently on death row in Texas, it 
applies equally to any American who travels to another country. 
</p>
<p>27. Texas&#8217;s refusal to provide review of the foreign nationals&#8217; cases undermines the 
United States&#8217; role in the international system, and threatens nation States&#8217; reciprocity with 
respect to the rights of each others&#8217; nationals. If Texas opts to put the United States in breach 
of its international legal obligations, Congress must act to ensure compliance at the federal  
level.

<p><b>B.  Deaths in immigration detention

immigration detention facilities since 2003.<b>40</b> Subsequent newspaper reports indicate a

</b>  Presently, the regular procedural default rules apply to VCCR claims, so that foreign nationals

prohibited from having the merits of their claim heard when seeking federal habeas corpus 
review. See e.g., <i>Sanchez-Llamas v Oregon</i>, 126 S Ct 2669 (2006).

<p>  There were 74 deaths to June 2008 according to a statement by Julie L Myers,

<p>significantly higher number. I received credible reports from various sources that deaths were 
due to: denial of necessary medical care; inadequate or delayed care; and provision of 
inappropriate medication.<b>41</b> 
</p>
<p>29. Immigration detention facilities, managed by Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE), an arm of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), hold immigrants with ongoing 
immigration legal proceedings, or awaiting removal from the United States. ICE&#8217;s Office of 
Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) carries out the detention function.<b>42</b> The standards of 
detention at each of these facilities are set by ICE&#8217;s National Detention Standards, which include 
general medical care provisions.<b>43</b> The details of the medical care to be provided to detainees are 
in ICE&#8217;s Division of Immigration Health Services (DIHS) Medical Dental Detainee Covered 
Services Package. The package states that it primarily covers emergency care, and other care is 
generally excluded unless it is judged necessary for the detainee to remain healthy enough for 
deportation.<b>44</b> Specialty care and testing believed necessary by the detainee&#8217;s on-site doctor must 
be pre-approved by DIHS in Washington, DC. Reliable reports indicate that DIHS often applies 
an unduly restrictive interpretation in determining the provision of medical care. Officials at 
various detention centers have themselves reported difficulties in getting approval for medical 
care.<b>45</b> In defense, DIHS and DRO explained that truly urgent care is provided at the discretion 
of medical personnel at each detention center without the need for prior authorization. However,

</p>
<p><b>41
</b>  In one well-known case, a detainee&#8217;s request for a biopsy was denied for nearly a year, 
</p>
<p>despite a doctor&#8217;s statement that it was urgent. During that period, the detainee developed cancer, 
and died after his release from detention. Nina Bernstein, <i>Ill and in Pain, Detainee Dies in U.S. 
Hands</i>, The New York Times, Aug. 12, 2008. 
<b>42
</b></p>
<p>  Immigration detainees can be held in a range of facility types. Across the United States, 
about 350 facilities operate under Intergovernmental Service Agreements (most are county jails); 
8 service processing centres are owned and operated by ICE; and 7 contract detention facilities 
are operated by private contractors. 
<b>43
</b></p>
<p>  The ICE National Detention Standards require that detainees &#8220;have access to medical services 
that promote detainee health and general well-being.&#8221; 
<b>44
</b></p>
<p>  See DIHS Medical Dental Detainee Covered Services Package, p. 1: &#8220;The DIHS Medical 
Dental Detainee Covered Services Package primarily provides health care services for 
emergency care. Emergency care is defined as &#8220;a condition that is threatening to life, limb, 
hearing, or sight.&#8221;  Accidental or traumatic injuries incurred while in the custody of ICE or BP 
and acute illnesses will be reviewed for appropriate care. [&#8230;] Other medical conditions which 
the physician believes, if left untreated during the period of ICE/BP custody, would cause 
deterioration of the detainee&#8217;s health or uncontrolled suffering affecting his/her deportation 
status will be assessed and evaluated for care.&#8221;

<p>the care provider will not be reimbursed unless subsequent DIHS authorization is given. Denials 
of such requests have a chilling effect on medical personnel&#8217;s subsequent decisions about 
proceeding without authorization. 
</p>
<p>30. The ICE standards are merely internal guidelines rather than legally-enforceable 
regulations. This has insulated ICE policies from the external oversight provided by the normal 
regulatory process and limits the legal remedies available to detainees when the medical care 
provided is deficient.<b>46</b> DHS should promulgate legally enforceable administrative regulations, 
and these should be consistent with international standards on the provision of medical care in 
detention facilities. 
</p>
<p>31. With respect to detention center conditions, I met with the DHS IG, whose office has 
prepared some valuable reports. A report on deaths in immigration detention was released 
shortly after my visit,<b>47</b> and made important recommendations,<b>48</b> but it reviewed only two deaths 
in detail. And the accountability system is incomplete by virtue of the fact that internal and 
external accountability functions are more or less combined. The law enforcement officers who 
investigate abuses by DHS personnel themselves report to the IG. Existing IG peer review 
arrangements appear to be an unlikely check on the performance of the IG in relation to sensitive 
and problematic cases. 
</p>
<p>32. ICE has no legal reporting requirements when a death occurs in ICE custody. The result 
has been a clear failure of transparency. Both civil society groups and Congressional staff 
members told me that for years they were unable to obtain any information at all on the numbers 
of deaths in ICE custody. ICE&#8217;s recent public reporting of numbers, and its voluntary 
undertaking to report future deaths, are encouraging, but insufficient. ICE should be required to 
promptly and publicly report all deaths in custody, and each of these deaths should be fully 
investigated. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Killings by law-enforcement officials 
</b></p>
<p>33. Data on deaths in custody in federal and state prisons and jails are compiled by the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics (BJS) of the Department of Justice (DOJ).<b>49</b> These data cover homicides 
                                                 
</p>
<p><b>46
</b>  ICE assured me that there are internal grievance procedures. Detainees can also contact the 
</p>
<p>DHS Inspector General (IG) via a dedicated hotline, or in writing, or they can make a complaint 
to the DHS Office for Civil Rights and Liberties. But detainees and their lawyers regularly report 
no or delayed responses to complaints, and hotline telephones that do not work.

<p>(generally by other inmates), suicides, and other causes and show generally that there has been a 
significant decline in deaths both in jails and prisons.<b>50</b> The data do not separate out deaths 
caused by guards, however, so it is impossible to estimate the rate of such deaths or to assess 
whether the trends in this regard are similarly encouraging.<b>51</b> The Government also compiles 
three sources of data on law enforcement killings outside detention centers, the most 
comprehensive and reliable of which is likely BJS&#8217;s data on &#8220;arrest-related killings.&#8221;<b>52</b> The 
number of arrest-related killings has not changed dramatically over the past 30 years.<b>53</b> 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>there is no law inducing federal institutions to provide data. However, while the program is 
essentially voluntary, compliance with reporting &#8220;requirements&#8221; is extremely high. According to 
the officials with whom I spoke, out of roughly 3,100 state jail jurisdictions, no more than 10 or 
so fail to report in any given year, and all state prisons have reported throughout. 
<b>50
</b></p>
<p>  The data show that while the homicide rate in jails has remained fairly stable at 3-5 
per 100,000 inmates, the homicide rate in state prisons has plummeted from 54 per 100,000 in 
1980 to 4 per 100,000 in 2006. Data on homicides and suicides in state jails and prisons are from 
BJS, &#8220;Suicide and Homicide in State Prisons and Local Jails&#8221; (August 2005) and &#8220;Deaths in 
Custody Statistical Tables&#8221; <i>available at</i> http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/dcrp/dictabs.htm. The 
suicide rate in jails also fell from 129 per 100,000 in 1983 to 38 per 100,000 in 2005. The 
suicide rate in state prisons was 34 per 100,000 in 1980 and had fallen to 17 per 100,000 in 2006. 
In the federal prison system, over a one-year period in 1999-2000, there were approximately 
3 homicides and 12 suicides per 100,000 inmates. BJS, &#8220;Census of State and Federal 
Correctional Facilities, 2000&#8221; (August 2003). 
<b>51
</b></p>
<p>  Officials stated that cases involving &#8220;positional asphyxiation&#8221; during cell extraction will 
generally end up in the &#8220;accidental&#8221; category even though some of the deaths in this category 
will constitute unlawful killings by guards. However, even if all such killings are so classified, 
this would permit one only to determine that there are somewhere between 0 and 3 unlawful 
killings by correctional officials per 100,000 inmates. 
<b>52
</b></p>
<p>  BJS is mandated to gather data from states on the death of &#8220;any person who is in process of 
arrest&#8221;, which BJS interprets to include &#8220;[a]ll deaths of persons in the physical custody or under 
the physical restraint of law enforcement officers&#8221; and &#8220;all deaths resulting form use of force by

BJS, statistics on &#8220;justifiable homicides&#8221; by police are gathered by the FBI, and statistics on

<p>34. Generally, police killings are investigated by a police department&#8217;s internal affairs unit and 
prosecuted by the local district attorney. However, in cases involving the &#8220;willful&#8221; violation of 
constitutional rights, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) may investigate, and the Civil 
Rights Division of the federal Department of Justice may prosecute.<b>54</b> Statistics on the total 
number of prosecutions and convictions in such cases are not available, but it is clear that the 
number of prosecutions is small and the number of convictions smaller still. Because there are no 
statistics on killings that involved the use of excessive force, it is difficult to evaluate whether the 
low conviction rate reflects impunity for abuse or whether the use of lethal force is limited and 
disciplined. 
</p>
<p>35. Two measures that would improve transparency and analysis are: (1) enhanced use of 
technology to record police conduct, and (2) adapting existing data collection efforts to be more 
comprehensive and to play an &#8220;early warning&#8221; and &#8220;hot spot identification&#8221; role for unlawful 
killings by law enforcement officers. 
</p>
<p>36. Both prosecutors and plaintiffs&#8217; counsel emphasized the importance of increased use of 
video and audio recording equipment in police cars, jails, and prisons. These recordings have 
helped build cases that would otherwise be impossible to prove. At the same time, the presence 
of recording equipment deters many law enforcement officers from using excessive force. The 
primary limits to the effectiveness of recording are that it is not sufficiently widespread and that 
tapes too often &#8220;disappear.&#8221; Additional federal funding and incentives would address the first 
problem. Measures to safeguard tapes include: increasing the penalties for tape destruction; 
establishing a presumption in civil litigation that the destruction of a tape indicates liability; and, 
making it technically impossible for individual officers to access the tapes. 
</p>
<p>37. Data collection by the Government on deaths related to law enforcement activities serves 
to create an historical record that is useful, <i>inter alia</i>, in assessing long-term trends. It is quite 
unhelpful, however, in providing &#8220;early warning&#8221; of emerging problems, whether at the national 
level or in particular jurisdictions. Indeed, most of the available statistics are three years out of 
date. Officials explained that one cause of delay is the need to obtain local medical examiners 
certificates on the cause of death in each case. While such efforts are commendable, and the 
resulting impulse to delay the release of data understandable, BJS should consider adopting 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>&#8220;justifiable homicides&#8221; as compiled by the FBI. These data are likely to be undercounts because 
three states and the federal Government did not report to BJS, and the law enforcement agencies 
concerned were often the principal sources of information.

with capital offences under the Military Commissions Act (MCA) and a number of other 
Guantanamo detainees face charges that may carry the death penalty.<b>56</b> I welcome the President&#8217;s

<p>  Five men were arraigned on 5 June 2008: Khalid Sheik Mohammed; Ramzi bin al-Shibh; 
Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali; Mustafa Ahmed al-Hawsawi; and Walid bin &#8216;Attash. The five will be tried 
at a joint trial. They were charged with: conspiracy; attacking civilians; attacking civilian 
objects; intentionally causing serious bodily injury; murder in violation of the law of war; 
destruction of property in violence of the law of war; hijacking or hazarding a vessel or aircraft; 
terrorism; and providing material support for terrorism (see: <i>United States of America v Khalid 
Sheikh Mohammed et al</i>, Charge Sheet, 9 May 2008). 
</p>
<p> Two other men faced charges for capital offenses, but the charges were either dismissed or 
have been withdrawn without prejudice and could be reinstated. On 11 February 2008, U.S. 
military officials announced charges against Mohammed al-Qahtani for his alleged role in the 
11 September 2001 attack, but those charges were dismissed on 9 May 2008. According to the 
official responsible for approving military commission charges, the charges were dismissed 
because al-Qahtani had been subjected to torture by U.S. officials over a prolonged period, 
which had resulted in a negative impact on his health. Bob Woodward, <i>Detainee Tortured, 
Says U.S. Official</i>, Washington Post, Jan. 14, 2009. On 30 June 2008, prosecutors charged 
Abd al-Rahim Hussein Muhammed Abdu al-Nashiri, for his alleged role in the October 2000 
USS Cole attack (see: <i>United States of America v Abd al-Rahim Hussein Muhammed Abdu 
al-Nashiri</i>, Charge sheet, 30 June 2008). Charges against him were withdrawn without prejudice

</p>
<p>United States is restoring its commitment to the rule of law in its treatment, detention and 
prosecution of Guantanamo detainees. However, the President&#8217;s order appears to leave open the 
possibility that detainees may still be prosecuted - and subjected to the death penalty - under the 
MCA. Any such prosecution would be a violation of the United States&#8217; obligations under 
international human rights and humanitarian law because the MCA does not comport with 
fundamental fair trial principles. 
</p>
<p>39. The United States has an obligation under international law to provide detainees with fair 
trials that afford all essential judicial guarantees. No State may derogate from this obligation, 
regardless of whether persons are to be tried for crimes allegedly committed during peace or 
armed conflict.<b>58</b> But the text of the MCA and the experiences of those involved in the military 
commission process with whom I met indicate that commission proceedings utterly fail to meet 
basic due process standards. I highlight just a few of the more egregious evidentiary due process 
flaws.<b>59</b> 
</p>
<p>40. There is now no doubt that detainees at Guantanamo were subjected to torture and 
coercion; senior Government officials have publicly admitted as much, and non-governmental 
organizations and counsel for individual detainees have provided credible accounts of cruelty 
and mistreatment. Contrary to international law, the MCA permits the taint of such coercion to 
pollute the U.S. justice system because it explicitly allows statements coerced by means such as 
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment to be admitted into evidence.<b>60</b> Also deeply problematic 
are the MCA provisions on classified information, which permit the Government to withhold 
from the defense the sources and methods by which evidence was acquired, and permits the 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>58
</b>  See, e.g., International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 14; UN Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee, General Comment No 29, U.N. Doc. CCPR/C/21/Rev.1/Add.11 (2001), paras 11, 
16; Geneva Conventions, Common Article 3; International Committee of the Red Cross, 
<i>Customary International Humanitarian Law</i>, Volume 1: Rules, Rule 100. 
<b>59
</b></p>
<p>  The jurisdictional flaws are equally troubling. For example, the MCA&#8217;s definition of an &#8220;alien 
unlawful enemy combatant&#8221; who may be subjected to military commission jurisdiction does not 
comport with international humanitarian law. The definition elides the fundamental distinctions 
humanitarian law makes between combatants and non-combatants and between types of armed 
conflict. MCA, section 3, amending Subtitle A of Title 10 U.S.C. &#167;948a(1)  Thus, civilians who 
have never directly participated in hostilities against the United States and even those without 
any connection to armed conflict could be militarily prosecuted under the MCA. The MCA&#8217;s 
subject matter jurisdiction provisions are also inconsistent with international humanitarian law 
because they include offenses that are not recognized as war crimes. See, e.g., MCA section 3, 
amending Subtitle A of Title 10 U.S.C. &#167;950v(b)(25) (offense of &#8220;providing material support for 
terrorism&#8221;) and &#167;950v(b)(28)(conspiracy). 
<b>60
</b></p>
<p>  Statements obtained by cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment may be used, if they were 
obtained before December 2005 and the military judge finds that they are reliable, possess 
probative value and to do so would be in the interests of justice. See MCA, section 3, amending 
Subtitle A of Title 10 U.S.C. &#167;948r(c) and (d). </p>

</p>
<p>accused to be convicted on the basis of evidence he has never seen.<b>61</b> The MCA also 
presumptively permits second and third hand hearsay evidence.<b>62</b> Together, the provisions on 
coerced evidence, classified evidence, and hearsay make it likely that evidence obtained through 
torture, although formally prohibited,<b>63</b> may in practice be admitted. 
</p>
<p>41. The MCA&#8217;s provisions constitute a gross infringement on the right to a fair trial and it 
would violate international law to execute someone under this statute. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Detainee deaths at Guant&#225;namo 
</b></p>
<p>42. Of the five reported deaths of detainees in U.S. custody at Guant&#225;namo, four were 
classified by Government officials as suicides,<b>64</b> and one was attributed to cancer.<b>65</b> In the 
custodial environment, a state has a heightened duty to ensure and respect the right to life.<b>66</b> 
Thus, there is a rebuttable presumption of state responsibility - whether through acts of 
commission or omission - for custodial deaths. The state must affirmatively show that it lacks 
responsibility to avoid this inference,<b>67</b> and has an obligation to investigate and publicly report its 
findings and the evidence supporting them.<b>68</b> But until forced to do so through Freedom of 
Information Act lawsuits, the Department of Defense (DOD) provided little public information

Such secrecy impedes the defense&#8217;s ability to answer accusations, and particularly inhibits the

coercion.

internal investigation documents and autopsies, it should provide fully unredacted medical 
records, autopsy files and other investigation records to the families of all the deceased. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Lack of transparency regarding civilian casualties 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Military 
</b></p>
<p>43. DOD officials confirmed to me that the military does not systematically compile statistics 
on civilian casualties in its operations in Afghanistan or Iraq. The purported reason is that &#8220;body 
counts&#8221; are not relevant to evaluating the effectiveness or legality of military operations. It is 
true that a simple &#8220;body count&#8221; may not on its own be useful. However, systematically tracking 
how different kinds of operations result in different levels of civilian casualties is critical if the 
United States is serious about minimizing casualties. Indeed, the Government&#8217;s own experience 
shows why this is so. Despite the general policy against tracking civilian casualties, in Iraq the 
military reportedly tracked checkpoint deaths when soldiers fire at civilians they believe, 
sometimes mistakenly, to be suicide bombers or other attackers. I understand these monitoring 
efforts resulted in procedural changes that saved lives. This kind of effort to track, analyze, and 
learn from the consequences of military operations should be routine, not exceptional. The 
numbers and trends should be reported publicly to strengthen external accountability. 
</p>
<p>44. The challenges of compiling statistics on civilian casualties during military operations are 
undeniable. The lack of secure access to incident sites, especially those of aerial bombardments, 
can make it difficult to determine the number of persons killed, much less the proportion that 
were civilians. Thus, the DOD has noted that, while information on civilian casualties is included 
in significant activity (SIGACT) reports, this information is not necessarily accurate.<b>69</b> But the 
</p>

<p><b>69
</b>  Letter of General Peter Pace, Chairman of the Join Chiefs of Staff, to Representative 
</p>
<p>John Warner, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, 19 April 2006: &#8220;SIGACT 
reports include data derived from a variety of sources and are based on incidents observed by or 
reported to U.S. forces. In some cases, estimates of civilian casualties may be included in 
SIGACT reporting of terrorist or insurgent attacks against Coalition or Iraqi forces due to U.S. 
presence at the scene. However, commanders also often include reports received from Iraqi 
ministries, civilians, or the press as SIGACTs. Such reports of significant civilian casualties or 
attacks against civilians are reported irrespective of ultimate authenticity in order to 
expeditiously notify senior leadership of possible significant civilian casualty events.&#8221;  This 
letter also informed Congress that &#8220;[r]ecords maintained at military treatment facilities where 
civilian patients have been treated&#8221; and &#8220;[r]ecords of those incidents where compensation and 
assistance to the victims or victim&#8217;s family were deemed warranted&#8221; contain &#8220;some information 
related to civilian casualties&#8221; but reiterated that &#8220;[t]he Department of Defense does not maintain 
comprehensive records and/or databases of civilian casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan [and] 
[t]hese records are not maintained for the purpose of tracking civilian casualties, are not 
consolidated, and are not maintained within a comprehensive, searchable database&#8221;. See also 
Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, <i>Iraqi Civilian Death Estimates</i>, 
27 Aug. 2008, <i>available at</i> http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RS22537.pdf. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.5 
  page 23 
 
</p>
<p>solution is not to avoid compiling civilian casualty statistics altogether but to eschew simple 
counts in favor of releasing information that continually and systematically presents ranges and 
estimates with the necessary qualifications. 
</p>
<p>45. In relation to deaths in military custody, operational difficulties cannot be used to justify a 
failure to compile statistics. Making the numbers and causes of such deaths public is part of the 
United States&#8217; obligation to exercise diligence, to prevent deaths of prisoners in its custody, and 
to investigate and prosecute any illegal conduct. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Private contractors 
</b></p>
<p>46. There have been numerous and credible accounts of private security and other contractors 
(PCs) engaging in a pattern of indiscriminate or otherwise questionable use of force against 
civilians.<b>70</b> At least in Iraq, that use of force has resulted in a significant number of casualties, 
conservatively estimated to be in the hundreds, perhaps thousands. Yet the failures of reporting 
and transparency by PCs employed by various Government military and civilian agencies are 
even more dramatic than those for the military. For example, in Iraq, the DOD established 
Reconstruction Operating Councils (ROCs), administered by a private security contractor, to 
provide coordination between the military and security contractors. While in theory DOD 
contractors report casualties and use of force in serious incident reports (SIRs) to the ROCs, 
doing so has not been compulsory for all contractors.<b>71</b> The most comprehensive study to date 
found that few firms ever report shooting incidents, that such incidents are often misreported, 
and that SIRs that are filed are almost uniformly cursory and uninformative.<b>72</b> 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Civilian intelligence agencies 
</b></p>
<p>47. There are credible reports of at least five custodial deaths caused by torture or other 
coercion in which the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been implicated.<b>73</b> Although the

<p>  Mainstream media accounts and reports from civil society organizations indicate CIA 
involvement in the deaths of the following five people: an un-named detainee killed in 
November 2002 at a CIA site code-named the &#8220;Salt Pit,&#8221; reportedly located to the north of 
Kabul, Afghanistan; Abdul Wali, killed in U.S. custody in Asadabad, Afghanistan, on  
June 21, 2003; Manadel al-Jamadi, killed in U.S. custody in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, on  
November 4, 2003; Major General Abed Hamed Mowhoush, killed at U.S. Forward Operating 
Base Tiger, Iraq, on November 26, 2003; Lt. Col. Abdul Jameel, killed at a U.S. forward 
operating base in Iraq on January 9, 2004. </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.5 
page 24 
 
</p>
<p>role of the CIA in these wrongful deaths has reportedly been investigated (and in one instance, a 
CIA contractor prosecuted), no investigation has ever been released and alleged CIA 
involvement has never been publicly confirmed or denied. The CIA Inspector General told me 
that the number of cases involving possibly unlawful killings referred by the CIA to the DOJ is 
classified. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Transparency and accountability for unlawful killings and custodial deaths 
</b></p>
<p>48. As discussed above, the Government&#8217;s failure to track civilian casualties in Iraq and 
Afghanistan means a lost opportunity to analyze causes and the lost possibility of reducing those 
deaths. Similarly, a failure to undertake transparent and effective investigations into, and 
meaningful prosecution of, wrongful deaths means the Government cannot fulfill its obligation 
to ensure accountability for violations of the right to life. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Military justice system failures 
(a) Lack of transparency 
</b>49. During my visit to Afghanistan, I saw first hand how the opacity of the military justice 
system reduces confidence in the Government&#8217;s commitment to public accountability for illegal 
conduct.<b>74</b> It is remarkably difficult for the U.S. public, victims&#8217; families, or even commanders to 
obtain up-to-date information on the status of cases, the schedule of upcoming hearings, or even 
judgments and pleadings.<b>75</b> This lack of transparency is, in part, a side-effect of the decentralized 
character of the system, in which commanders around the world are given the authority to 
conduct preliminary investigations and act as &#8220;convening authorities&#8221; to initiate courts-martial. 
</p>
<p>50. This problem can be solved relatively quickly and easily. Each service, for example, is 
required by law to maintain a Court-Martial Management Information System for records of 
general and special courts-martial. A centralized system for reporting and providing public 
information about all courts-martial and non-judicial proceedings relating to civilian casualties 
could be added to the existing system, and this would markedly improve accountability and 
reduce the sense among Afghan and Iraqi civilians, and others around the world, that U.S. forces 
operate with impunity. 
</p>
<p><b>(b) Lack of effective investigation and prosecution 
</b>51. While the U.S. military justice system has achieved a number of convictions for unlawful 
killings in Afghanistan and Iraq, numerous other cases have either been inadequately 
investigated or senior officers have used administrative (non-judicial) proceedings instead of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>

</b>  Appendix B (describing lack of transparency into 4 March 2007 incident in which, in 
</p>
<p>response to a suicide attack, U.S. Marines killed some 19 individuals and wounded many others). 
<b>75
</b></p>
<p>  The military has only (and so far partially) released documents concerning civilian casualties 
in Iraq and Afghanistan since 1 January 2005 as a result of litigation brought under the Freedom 
of Information Act. The documents are available at www.aclu.org/civiliancasualties. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.5 
  page 25 
 
</p>
<p>criminal prosecutions. In cases in which criminal convictions were obtained, some sentences 
appear too light for the crime committed, and senior officers have not been held to account for 
the wrongful conduct of their subordinates. 
</p>
<p>52. The legal obligation to effectively punish violations is as vital to the rule of law in war as 
in peace. It is thus alarming when States either fail to investigate or permit lenient punishment of 
crimes committed against civilians and combatants. The legal duty to investigate and punish 
violations of the right to life is not a formality. Effective investigation and prosecution vindicates 
the rights of the victims and prevents impunity for the perpetrators. Yet, based on the military&#8217;s 
own documents, one study of almost 100 detainee deaths in U.S. custody between August 2002 
and February 2006 found that investigations were fundamentally flawed, often violated the 
military&#8217;s own regulations for investigations, and resulted in impunity and a lack of transparency 
into the policies and practices that may have contributed to the deaths.<b>76 </b></p>
<p>53. States must punish individuals responsible for violations of law in a manner commensurate 
with the gravity of their crimes.<b>77</b> I raised this issue with the Government in relation to the 
January 2006 sentencing of Chief Warrant Officer Lewis E. Welshofer Jr. to two months 
confinement to his base, a fine of $6,000, and a letter of reprimand after being found guilty 
of negligent homicide and negligent dereliction of duty for the death of Major General 
Abed Hamed Mowhoush, an Iraqi general who had turned himself in to military authorities. I 
have received no response. 
</p>
<p>54. I also received no response to my request for data on sentences imposed for particular 
offences.<b>78</b> But military records released in Freedom of Information Act litigation make clear 
that the Welshofer sentence is not an anomaly.<b>79</b> Data compiled by journalists also reinforce the 
perception that sentences have not consistently been proportionate to the offence committed. 
According to a review of cases in Iraq between June 2003 and February 2006 conducted by the 
Washington Post, 39 service members were formally accused in connection with the deaths of

<p>  On 18 June 2008, during my visit to the U.S., I formally requested: &#8220;The number of 
courts-martial convened with charges of murder or manslaughter; of those that have concluded, 
their verdicts and sentences. These data would be broken down by charge (murder, 
manslaughter), time period (2007, 2008 to date) and country where the charged crime took place 
(Afghanistan, Iraq, elsewhere).&#8221; 
<b>79
</b></p>
<p>  For example, four U.S. service members were charged with forcing two Iraqi men to jump 
into the Tigris River, resulting in the death of one of the men; the highest punishment any of the 
four appear to have received is six months imprisonment, reduction in rank, and a $2,000 fine.

<p>only 12 ultimately served prison time (with sentences ranging from 45 days to 25 years), 
3 were convicted with no confinement, 1 was acquitted, charges against two others were 
dropped, and 6 received administrative, non-judicial punishments.<b>80</b> 
55. It is noteworthy that &#8220;command responsibility,&#8221; a basis for criminal liability recognized 
since the trials after World War II,<b>81</b> is absent both from the Uniform Code of Military Justice 
(UCMJ) and the War Crimes Act. It appears that no U.S. officer above the rank of major has 
ever been prosecuted for the wrongful actions of the personnel under his or her command. 
Instead, in some instances, commanders have exercised their discretion to lessen the punishment 
of subordinates for wrongful conduct that resulted in a custodial death.<b>82</b> Such failures of 
accountability undermine the importance of hierarchy and discipline within the military as well 
as the essential role of the commander in preventing and punishing war crimes. The criminal 
liability of commanders for failure to prevent or punish the crimes committed by subordinates 
should be codified in the UCMJ and the War Crimes Act. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Civilian justice system failures 
</b>56. For far too long, there has been a zone of <i>de facto</i> impunity for killings by private 
contractors (PCs) and civilian intelligence agents operating in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. 
There is some debate whether federal court jurisdiction extends to PCs of Government agencies 
other than DOD, a debate that Congress should resolve expeditiously by clarifying that it does.<b>83</b> 
But the principal accountability problem today is not the inadequacy of the applicable legal 
framework. Rather, U.S. prosecutors have failed to use the laws on the books to investigate and 
prosecute PCs and civilian agents for wrongful deaths, including, in some cases, deaths credibly

<p>alleged to have resulted from torture and abuse. Prosecutors have also failed, even years after 
alleged wrongful deaths, to disclose the status of their investigations or the bases for decisions 
not to prosecute. One well-informed source succinctly described the situation: &#8220;The DOJ has 
been AWOL in response to these incidents.&#8221; This must change. 
</p>
<p>57. The Department of Justice (DOJ) is responsible for prosecuting PCs and civilian 
Government employees, as well as former military personnel who commit war crimes. DOJ has 
failed miserably. Its efforts are coordinated by two bodies. The first is a task force based at the 
U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which handles detainee abuse cases. 
This task force has admitted that 24 cases of alleged detainee abuse were referred to it and that it 
has declined to prosecute 22 of these cases.<b>84</b> It is unclear why more cases have not been referred 
(or if they have, how many more), or how many of the 24 referred cases involved the detainee 
deaths credibly alleged to have occurred at the hands of PCs or the CIA. 
</p>
<p>58. The second entity, the Domestic Security Section (DSS) of DOJ&#8217;s Criminal Division, 
coordinates the prosecution of other cases involving PCs, such as unlawful shootings committed 
while protecting convoys. Its track record has been somewhat better, although too often it 
appears investigations and prosecutions follow only the most notorious public cases, such as the 
shootings in Nissor Square. 
</p>
<p>59. DSS representatives acknowledged the lack of convictions to me, but refused to provide 
even ballpark statistics on the allegations received or the status of investigations.<b>85</b> They 
emphasized that conducting investigations in a war zone is extremely difficult and that they 
ultimately rely on the military either to conduct the investigation or to provide the FBI with 
logistical and security support. While there are significant challenges to conducting 
investigations in the context of armed conflict, DSS representatives&#8217; responses suggested serious 
thought had not been given to how such investigations can be conducted. Investigations into 
PCs&#8217;s conduct can be conducted successfully, and one interlocutor who has done so suggested 
that these cases are actually relatively easy to investigate because they tend to take place in 
daylight in front of numerous witnesses who can go to safe locations to be interviewed.

<b>85
</b></p>
<p>  In testimony to Congress in April 2008, a Department of Justice official stated that, as of that 
date, there had been 25 allegations of private contractor wrongdoing under the Military 
Extraterritorial Judicial Act (MEJA), of which 12 resulted in federal criminal charges and one in 
state criminal charges, with others still pending and others being declined. Four of the seven 
successful prosecutions were for sexual abuse charges. Statement of Sigal P. Mandelker, Deputy 
Assistant Attorney General, Before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations (9 April 2008), 
<i>available at</i> http://foreign.senate.gov/testimony/2008/MandelkerTestimony080409a.pdf. It is not 
clear how many of the cases under investigation relate to killings of Iraqi or Afghan civilians. In 
its response to this Report, the Department of State informed me that, as of December 2008, the 
Department of Justice had brought charges in 25 MEJA cases and that in one of those cases, in 
May 2009, a jury convicting Steven Green, a former soldier, of MEJA charges arising out of his 
murder and rape of Iraqi civilians in 2006. </p>

</p>
<p>60. The lamentable bottom line is that DOJ has brought a scant few cases against PCs for 
civilian casualties, achieved a conviction only in one case involving a CIA contractor, and 
brought no cases against CIA employees. Government officials with whom I met acknowledged 
this lack of accountability, and it now seems clear that this vacuum is neither legally nor 
ethically defensible. Indeed, many PCs themselves accept the need for legal regulation and 
accountability.<b>86</b> Unfortunately, accountability for CIA officials appears more remote because of 
a lack of political will. 
</p>
<p><b>3.  Ensuring transparency and accountability 
</b></p>
<p>61. The key to overcoming this record of failure, both in the civilian and military justice 
systems, is prosecutorial and political will to enforce the rule of law. However, the nearly 
universal sense I was given during my visit by those in Government is that systematic accounting 
of, and prosecutions for, wrongful deaths are unlikely. In short, war crimes prosecutions in 
particular are &#8220;politically radioactive.&#8221; That sense continues to be reflected by Government 
statements which indicate more of a commitment to &#8220;moving forward&#8221; than to ensuring 
transparency and accountability for policies, practices and conduct that led to illegal killings by 
Government personnel and their agents. But a refusal to look back inevitably means moving 
forward in blindness. Political expediency is never a permissible justification for a State&#8217;s failure 
to investigate and prosecute alleged crimes. 
</p>
<p>62. Although there is no substitute for prosecution of violations of the right to life, in the short 
term there are a number of steps the Government can take towards transparency and 
accountability. One such step is the creation of a national &#8220;commission of inquiry&#8221; tasked with 
carrying out an independent, systematic and sustained investigation of policies and practices that 
lead to deaths and other abuses. Over the 27 years of their mandate, successive Special 
Rapporteurs for extrajudicial execution have focused on the procedures and results that make 
such commissions effective and give them credibility. I described in a recent report to the 
Council the situations to which a commission is best suited, and the principles and standards 
necessary for it to be successful.<b>87</b> 
</p>
<p>63. A commission is an especially attractive option in this context because it is likely that 
extrajudicial killings resulted from a set of policy failures on the part of a variety of Government 
actors and agents. In such complex circumstances, transparency may best be achieved through a 
commission rather than through prosecution alone. The commission could propose structural or 
long-term reforms that would better ensure the right to life and other fundamental human 
rights.<b>88</b> Another option is the appointment of a special prosecutor who would be independent of 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>86
</b>  It is also encouraging that the United States has participated in efforts to clarify the relevant 
</p>
<p>international standards as part of the Swiss Initiative on Private Military and Security 
Companies. 
<b>87
</b></p>
<p>  A/HRC/8/3, paras. 12-58. 
<b>88
</b></p>
<p>  A successful example of such a commission of inquiry comes from Canada. E/CN.4/2006/53, 
p. 41 (&#8220;Canada&#8217;s experience in Somalia illustrates the complementary roles of criminal and 
non-criminal investigation. Canada prosecuted and punished several soldiers for their actions in

</p>
<p>the kinds of institutional and political pressures that could - and have - hindered effective 
investigation and prosecution by DOJ. Some have made proposals about the particular form a 
commission could take, and the merits of a special or independent prosecutor. I do not endorse 
any specific proposal, although I do note that a commission and an independent prosecutor are 
not mutually exclusive. 
</p>
<p>64. Regardless of the specific form of the commission, it should meet certain fundamental 
requirements, including that it must: be independent, impartial and competent; have the powers 
necessary to obtain all the information it requires; have sufficient resources and personnel; and, 
report all of its findings and recommendations publicly and disseminate them widely.<b>89</b> When the 
report is completed, the Government should reply publicly and indicate what it intends to do in 
response.<b>90</b> Any commission designed to provide the appearance of accountability rather than to 
establish the truth, or one that undermines the possibility of eventual prosecution, would fall 
short of the same international standards to which the United States often seeks to hold other 
countries. 
</p>
<p>65. The most credible response to the military justice system&#8217;s investigative failures and 
sentencing distortions would be the creation of a Director of Military Prosecutions (DMP) 
position. Such positions have recently been instituted in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand 
and the United Kingdom to ensure greater separation between the chain of command and the 
prosecution function. Rather than permitting commanding officers to decide whether to 
prosecute their own soldiers - a decision in which superior officers have a direct and potentially 
conflicting interest - a DMP makes independent decisions. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>Somalia, but it also established a Commission of Inquiry to determine the institutional defects 
that allowed those abuses to occur. By identifying pervasive problems in how rules of 
engagement were drafted, were disseminated through the chain of command, and were taught to 
soldiers on the ground, Canada improved its institutional capacity to better ensure the right to life 
in the future.&#8221;).

</p>
<p>66. Regarding investigation and prosecution of PCs, a significant problem is that cases are 
handled by U.S. Attorneys offices around the country. Prosecutors do not have an incentive to 
prioritize such difficult and expensive cases, especially when expected to conduct investigations 
within their ordinary operating budget. An office should be established within DOJ dedicated 
solely to investigating and prosecuting cases involving PCs, civilian Government employees, and 
former military personnel, and to provide appropriate funding. 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Reparations for civilian casualties 
</b></p>
<p>67. The Government has implemented a number of programs to provide compensation and 
restitution to civilian victims of U.S. military operations. While the motivation for these 
programs is often cited as &#8220;winning hearts and minds&#8221; they are also responsive to international 
law&#8217;s requirement of reparations for violations of human rights and humanitarian law.<b>91</b> In some 
respects, the Government has done less than the law requires by de-linking reparation from the 
question of whether illegal conduct occurred. In other respects, the Government has done more, 
by providing reparations to the families of those killed in lawful attacks. My overall assessment 
is that the Government&#8217;s approach has, in practice, meant far more people have received 
reparations for the loss of their loved ones than has often been the case in previous conflicts, but 
that reparation programs need to be made more consistent and comprehensive. 
</p>
<p>68. The Foreign Claims Act authorizes payment of legal claims arising from a death 
negligently or wrongfully caused by military personnel outside of combat.<b>92</b> Payment under this 
law can be higher than in other programs. Two other programs make death-related payments 
without any admission of fault or liability. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the military makes 
&#8220;condolence payments&#8221; using funds from the Commander&#8217;s Emergency Response Program 
(CERP).<b>93</b> In Afghanistan, the military also makes &#8220;solatia payments.&#8221;<b>94</b> The maximum payment

<b>92
</b></p>
<p>  Army Regulation 27-20, para. 10-3; 10 U.S.C. &#167; 2734. The exclusion of combat-related 
deaths has often been construed narrowly, to permit, for example, compensation for deaths at 
checkpoints. <i>See</i> the documentation on decisions by foreign claims commissions in Afghanistan 
and Iraq obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union at http://www.aclu.org/natsec/

Response Program in Iraq and Afghanistan</i>, The Army Lawyer (Feb. 2004). 
<b>94
</b></p>
<p>  Like CERP, the solatia program was designed by the military rather than by Congress; its 
funding is pursuant to a fairly general Congressional authorization to &#8220;use appropriated funds for 
certain investigations and security services&#8221; (10 U.S.C. 2242). These solatia payments were also 
made in Iraq up until January 2005. </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.5 
  page 31 
 
</p>
<p>amount provided under either program for a death is roughly $2,500.<b>95</b> Other programs provide 
assistance to individuals and communities to help repair damage caused by military operations.<b>96</b> 
</p>
<p>69. In important ways, these are model programs. But they have developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> 
manner that permits innovation and rapid evolution, but has also resulted in a complex, 
overlapping and inconsistent system. This leads to unprincipled variation in compensation 
amounts and the unintentional exclusion of some victims. The United States is a leader in this 
area and should continue to build on its achievements by increasing funding, proactively seeking 
out victims and their families, and regularizing and better coordinating existing programs. 
</p>
<p>70. The lack of systematic compensation for civilian casualties caused by private contractors is 
acute. While some have offered compensation on their own account, this does not appear to be 
an approach that could be systematized. One interlocutor suggested the best approach would be 
for the Government to provide reparations for casualties caused by its contractors and then 
deduct the amount of this compensation from payments made under the contract. 
</p>
<p><b>E. Targeted killings:  lack of transparency regarding 
the legal framework and targeting choices 
</b></p>
<p>71. The Government has credibly been alleged to have engaged in targeted killings on the 
territory of other States.<b>97</b> Senior Government officials have confirmed the existence of a

<p><b>95
</b>  Thus, in fiscal year 2006, in Afghanistan, 1% of CERP funds were used for condolence 
</p>
<p>payments, and, in Iraq, 5% of CERP funds were used for condolence payments. CERP funds are 
also used for a range of other activities, including supporting agricultural programs, repairing 
civic and cultural facilities, water and sanitation, and &#8220;other urgent humanitarian and 
reconstruction projects&#8221;. Similarly, funds for solatia payments come out of general &#8220;Unit 
Operations and Maintenance Funds&#8221;. Government Accountability Office, <i>Military Operations:

<p>  Thus, in Afghanistan, a woman whose husband was killed during an aerial bombardment 
might receive training in making clothes and a sewing machine to help her earn a livelihood. In 
Afghanistan, such assistance is provided through the Afghan Civilian Assistance Program 
(ACAP); in Iraq, it is provided through the Marla Ruszicka Iraqi War Victims Fund.

<p>  On 17 September 2001, the President signed a &#8220;presidential finding&#8221; pursuant to the authority

<p>program through which drones are used to target particular individuals, but have also caused 
civilian casualties.<b>98</b> On several occasions I have asked the Government to explain the legal basis 
on which a particular individual was targeted.<b>99</b> While I have welcomed the Government&#8217;s 
willingness to engage in dialogue on targeted killings, it has been evasive about its grounds 
for targeting, and I am disturbed by the broader implications of its positions. Briefly, those 
positions are that: (a) the Government&#8217;s actions against al-Qaeda constitute a world-wide armed 
conflict to which international humanitarian law applies; (b) international humanitarian law 
operates to the exclusion of human rights law; (c) international humanitarian law falls outside the 
mandate of the Special Rapporteur and of the Human Rights Council; and (d) States may 
determine for themselves whether an individual incident is governed by humanitarian law or 
human rights law. 
</p>
<p>72. I responded to these positions in detail both directly to the Government and in my 2007 
report to the Council.<b>100</b> I have discussed the extent to which these positions constitute a radical 
departure from past practice, and the highly negative consequences that would flow from 
them.<b>101</b> Under the Government&#8217;s reinterpretation of the law and the Council&#8217;s and my mandate, 
the United States would function in a public accountability void - as could other States - to the 
detriment of the advances made by the international human rights and humanitarian law regimes 
over the past sixty years. 
</p>
<p>73. The new administration should reconsider these positions and move to ensure the 
necessary transparency and accountability. Withholding such information replaces public 
accountability with unverifiable Government assertions of legality, inverting the very idea of due 
process.

concerns about continuing racial disparities in the criminal justice system 
generally, and in the imposition of the death penalty specifically. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>In light of uncorrected flaws in state criminal justice systems, and given the finality

<p>&#8226; <b>The Department of Defense should establish a central office or &#8220;registry&#8221; to

jurisdiction over all private contractors and civilian employees, including those 
working for intelligence agencies. </b></p>

</p>
<p>81. <b>Ensuring accountability 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>A commission of inquiry should be established to conduct an independent, 
systematic and sustained investigation of policies and practices that led to deaths 
and other abuses in U.S. operations. The commission should have the mandate and 
resources to conduct a full investigation. Its results and recommendations should 
be publicly and widely disseminated, and the Government should publicly respond 
thereto. Given the importance of prosecutions, an independent special prosecutor 
should be considered and the commission should not undermine the possibility of 
eventual prosecution. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Consideration should be given to establishing a Director of Military Prosecutions 
to ensure separation between the chain of command and the prosecution function. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>An office dedicated to investigation and prosecution of crimes by private 
contractors, civilian Government employees, and former military personnel should 
be established within the DOJ. The office should receive the resources and 
investigative support necessary to handle these cases. The DOJ should make public 
statistical information on the status of these cases, disaggregated by the kind, year, 
and country of alleged offence. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>Enhancing reparations programs 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>Existing reparation programs should be combined or replaced by a comprehensive 
and adequately-funded compensation program for the families of those killed in 
U.S. operations, including by military and intelligence personnel and private 
contractors. In missions involving a range of international forces, such as those in 
Afghanistan and Iraq, the Government should urge allies to implement similar 
programs and should promote coordination to ensure that all casualties are 
compensated. 
</b></p>
<p>83. <b>Enhancing transparency in targeted killings 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government should explicate the rules of international law it considers to 
cover targeted killings. It should specify the bases for decisions to kill rather than 
capture particular individuals, and whether the State in which the killing takes 
place has given consent. It should specify the procedural safeguards in place, if 
any, to ensure in advance of drone killings that they comply with international law, 
and the measures the Government takes after any such killing to ensure that its 
legal and factual analysis was accurate and, if not, the remedial measures it would 
take. 
</b></p>
<p>&#8226; <b>The Government should make public the number of civilians collaterally killed as 
a result of drone attacks, and the measures in place to prevent such casualties. </b></p>

<p><b>CASE STUDY:  LACK OF TRANSPARENCY IN THE 
MILITARY JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</b></p>
<p>1. The troublingly opaque character both of investigation and of prosecution in the 
U.S. military justice system is well illustrated by a case described to me by witnesses and 
investigators when I visited Afghanistan.<b>a</b> On 4 March 2007, U.S. Marines responded to a 
suicide attack on their convoy, in which one soldier was wounded, by killing some 19 Afghans 
and wounding many others in the space of a ten mile retreat. I asked the regional commander in 
Afghanistan what follow-up had occurred. He could not tell me and explained that his unit had 
just arrived in Afghanistan, that accountability for incidents involving the previous unit was that 
unit&#8217;s responsibility, and that the prior unit had taken all the relevant files when it left the 
country. In fact, at that time, a Court of Inquiry into the incident was proceeding in 
North Carolina. 
</p>
<p>2. Shortly after I returned from Afghanistan, the U.S. military released a short statement on 
this incident, indicating that the commander of U.S. Marine Corps Forces Central Command 
had conducted a &#8220;thorough review of the report of a Court of Inquiry&#8221; and had determined 
that the soldiers had &#8220;acted appropriately and in accordance with the rules of engagement and 
tactics, techniques and procedures in place at the time in response to a complex attack.&#8221;<b>b</b> 
Unsurprisingly, this conclusory and unsubstantiated response to such a serious incident was met 
with dismay in Afghanistan. Afghans - and Americans - have a right to ask on what basis this 
conclusion was reached. But all of the documents produced by the Court of Inquiry have 
remained classified. The record of proceedings has not been released. The 12,000-page report 
of the Court of Inquiry, including recommendations and factual findings, has not been released. 
The Government has even disregarded its own regulation requiring the convening authority to 
ensure that an executive summary of the report be made public.<b>c</b> Whether or not the decision not

</p>
<p><b>c
</b>  The use of Courts of Inquiry is provided for in Article 135 of the Uniform Code of Military 
</p>
<p>Justice (UCMJ). While the UCMJ authorizes the President to prescribe regulations to implement 
UCMJ provisions, with respect to Courts of Inquiry, the President has delegated most of this 
authority to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. For the Navy, which includes the 
Marine Corps, the key regulation is JAGINST 5830.1A, &#8220;Procedures Applicable to Courts and 
Boards of Inquiry&#8221; (31 October 2005). This regulation distinguishes between three products of a 
Court of Inquiry: the &#8220;record of proceedings&#8221;, the &#8220;report&#8221;, and the &#8220;executive summary&#8221;. On 
this last, the regulation states that: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Given the nature of the major incidents investigated, officials of the DON, the DOD, 
other executive agencies, the legislative branch, and the media, often desire copies of the 
investigation. Where the incident results in death, the next of kin also will normally request 
a copy of the investigation. The report of the investigation, transcript of the proceedings, 
and enclosures can often be thousands of pages in length. For persons unfamiliar with  </p>

<p>A/HRC/11/2/Add.5

</p>
<p>to initiate criminal proceedings in this case was justified, the manner in which the military justice 
system operated in this case is entirely inconsistent with principles of public accountability and 
transparency. 
</p>
<p>     
</p>
<p>military organizations, terminology, and operations, the task of deciphering an 
investigation can be difficult. Accordingly, convening authorities should ensure that an 
executive summary in plain English, which accurately reflects the findings, opinions, and 
recommendations of the investigation, is prepared prior to forwarding the investigation. 
The summary may be a part of the convening authority's endorsement or an enclosure 
thereto. There is nothing improper with requiring counsel to the investigation or the 
president of a Court or Board of Inquiry to prepare the summary. Participation by public 
affairs personnel in the preparation of the executive summary may also be advisable.&#8221;

<p><b>Appendix III 
</b></p>
<p><b>LEGAL FRAMEWORK APPLICABLE TO PROSECUTIONS OF PRIVATE 
CONTRACTORS AND CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES 
</b></p>
<p>1. Congress has adopted a series of statutes expanding and clarifying jurisdiction over 
offences committed by contractors and civilian Government employees operating in areas of 
armed conflict and in peacetime. To date, however, these legislative initiatives have been largely 
reactive to specific incidents such as the abuses at Abu Ghraib and the shooting incident at 
Nisoor Square. The result is legislation that closes particular jurisdictional gaps but leaves others. 
Nevertheless, these statutes together should permit the justice system to punish all or virtually all 
killings prohibited by human rights or humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>2. The USA Patriot Act of 2001 expanded the scope of &#8220;special maritime and territorial 
jurisdiction&#8221; over crimes committed overseas to include offenses committed &#8220;by or against a 
national of the United States&#8221; on U.S. bases, facilities and diplomatic missions.<b>a</b> This expanded 
jurisdiction applies to about 30 criminal statutes and is most likely to be of use in cases involving 
deaths in custody.<b>b</b> Indeed, the only private security contractor ever successfully prosecuted in 
the civilian justice system was convicted under this statute after beating a detainee to death 
during an interrogation in Afghanistan. 
</p>
<p>3. When the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act (MEJA) was enacted in 2000, it 
covered Department of Defense employees, former military personnel, contractors, and 
sub-contractors accompanying the military outside the United States.<b>c</b> After it came to light that 
contractors to other Government agencies were implicated in the torture and abuse of prisoners 
at Abu Ghraib, Congress amended MEJA in 2004 to cover any federal employee or Government 
contractor whose &#8220;employment relates to supporting the mission of the Department of Defense 
overseas&#8221; (except contractors who are nationals or residents of the country in which the missions 
takes place).<b>d</b> The intent was to cover the range of civilian employees and contractors operating 
in Afghanistan and Iraq, but there is some debate whether a court would agree that all such 
persons are &#8220;supporting the mission of the Department of Defense.&#8221; I was briefed by a number 
of Congressional staffers on ongoing efforts to adopt new legislation that would definitively 
clarify MEJA in this regard.<b>e</b> This is most encouraging. There was, however, also talk of

</b>  18 U.S.C. &#167; 7(9), as amended by PL 107-56 &#167; 804. 
</p>
<p><b>b
</b>  The jurisdiction provision would not, however, apply if a foreign security contractor to the 
</p>
<p>U.S.. Government were to kill a foreign national. 
<b>c
</b>  PL 106-523. 
</p>
<p><b>d
</b>  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3267, as amended by PL 108-375, &#167; 1088. 
</p>
<p><b>e
</b>  The &#8220;Security Contractor Accountability Act of 2007&#8221; was passed by the House (HR 2740), 
</p>
<p>and its companion bill (S 2147) is subject to ongoing discussions in the Senate. </p>

</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>including a so-called &#8220;intelligence carve-out&#8221; that would provide impunity for contractors and 
employees working for U.S. intelligence agencies. This would be wholly inappropriate, and 
Congress should adopt legislation that comprehensively provides criminal jurisdiction over 
contractors and civilian employees. 
</p>
<p>4. The War Crimes Act was adopted in 1996 and amended in 1997 and 2006.<b>f</b> In contrast 
to MEJA and the Patriot Act, which define the scope of federal jurisdiction but do not codify 
new criminal offences, the War Crimes Act provides jurisdiction over a number of violations 
of international humanitarian law, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the &#8220;willful killing&#8221; of &#8220;protected 
persons&#8221; within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions (in international armed conflicts) and 
&#8220;murder&#8221; (in a non-international armed conflict).<b>g</b> In accordance with the United States&#8217; 
humanitarian law obligations, the War Crimes Act originally made all violations of the Common 
Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions a war crime under U.S. domestic law. The 2006 
amendments to the War Crimes Act - made as part of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 - 
however, exempted certain violations of Common Article 3 from prosecution as war crimes, 
including &#8220;humiliating and degrading treatment,&#8221; and sentencing or execution by courts 
that fail to provide &#8220;all the judicial guarantees . . . recognized as indispensable by civilized 
peoples.&#8221; Such provisions narrow the United States&#8217; obligations under international  
humanitarian law and, together with the MCA&#8217;s provisions that violate fair trial principles, 
should be repealed. 
</p>
<p>5. Finally, pursuant to a 2006 amendment, the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) also 
provides jurisdiction over &#8220;persons serving with or accompanying an armed force in the field&#8221; 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>f
</b>  The War Crimes Act was originally adopted in Public Law 104-192 (enacted 21 August 1996) 
and was significantly amended in Public Law 105-118 (enacted 26 November 1997) and Public 
Law 109-366 (enacted 17 October 2006). 
<b>g
</b>  Note that jurisdiction is also provided over several other offences that involve killing. The 
</p>
<p>provision most relevant killings in the current conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq is, however, that 
of &#8220;murder&#8221;. This is defined as: 
</p>
<p>&#8220;The act of a person who intentionally kills, or conspires or attempts to kill, or kills 
whether intentionally or unintentionally in the course of committing any other offense 
under this subsection, one or more persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including 
those placed out of combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>This definition is qualified by another provision, which declares that the &#8220;intent specified . . . 
precludes the applicability of [the murder provision] to an offense under [Common Article 3] 
with respect to- (A) collateral damage; or (B) death, damage, or injury incident to a lawful 
attack.&#8221;  (18 U.S.C. &#167; 2441(d)(3).) </p>

<p>  A/HRC/11/2/Add.5 
  page 41 
 
</p>
<p>whether &#8220;[i]n time of declared war or a contingency operation.&#8221;<b>h</b> This first conviction of a 
private security contractor under this provision occurred in June 2008 in response to one 
contractor stabbing another in Iraq. 
</p>
<p>6. There may be incidents over which both the military justice system and the civilian justice 
system have jurisdiction. With respect to killings by contractors or civilian Government officials 
in the context of armed conflicts, the military justice system may have jurisdiction under the 
UCMJ, and the civilian justice system may also have jurisdiction under a variety of statutes. 
With respect to unlawful killings by soldiers, both the UCMJ and the War Crimes Act could 
apply. 
</p>
<p>7. The current arrangement in cases implicating contractors or civilian Government 
employees is that the DOJ will generally prosecute the case in the federal courts, and the military 
justice system will only act if the DOJ declines to do so.<b>i</b> While the DOJ&#8217;s performance in these 
cases has thus far been abysmal, as I discuss in the body of this report, this is the right 
arrangement in principle.<b>j</b> 
</p>
<p>----- 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>h
</b>  UCMJ, Art. 2(a)(10) was amended with Public Law 109-364 (enacted 17 October 2006) to 
</p>
<p>expand its scope from declared wars to &#8220;contingency operations&#8221;. Military operations in 
Afghanistan and Iraq are characterized in U.S. law as &#8220;contingency operations.&#8221; 
<b>i
</b>  In March 2008, the Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum to implement the 2006 
amendment extending the UCMJ to cover private security contractors. <i>UCMJ Jurisdiction Over 
DoD Civilian Employees, DoD Contractor Personnel, and Other Persons Serving With or 
Accompanying the Armed Forces Overseas During Declared War and in Contingency 
Operations</i> (10 March 2008). The memorandum provides that DOD will notify DOJ of cases so 
that the latter can &#8220;determine whether it intends to exercise jurisdiction&#8221;. If DOJ decides to 
pursue the case, DOD will withhold from commanders the authority to initiate court-martial 
charges. If DOJ decides not to pursue the case, DOD will notify the relevant geographic 
combatant commander that he may initiate action under the UCMJ and notifies DOJ that this 
authorization has been made. 
<b>j
</b>  The general framework for DOD - DOJ cooperation is the Memorandum of Understanding 
Between Departments of Justice and Defense Relating to the Investigation and Prosecution of 
Crimes (August 1984) contained in Manual for Courts-Martial 2008, appendix 3. This requires 
the DOD to notify the DOJ of certain cases. The issue of the propriety of military jurisdiction 
over civilians raises complex questions that I do not address here. </p>
