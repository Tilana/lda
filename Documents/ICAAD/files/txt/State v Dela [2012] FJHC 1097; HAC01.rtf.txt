In HAC 02/2012 your sentence will be 2 months imprisonment.

19.     
Now I consider Section 4(1) of the Sentencing guidelines decree. The only purposes for which sentencing may be imposed by a court are 

a)      
To punish offenders to an extend and in a manner which is just in all the circumstances;
b)      
To protect the community from offenders;
c)      
To deter offenders of other person from committing offences of the same or similar nature;
d)      
To establish conditions so that rehabilitation of offenders may be promoted or facilitated;
e)      
To signify that the court and the community denounce the commission of such offenders; or 
f)      
Any combination of these purposes.

20.     
I further consider Section 4 (2) of the Sentencing guidelines decree. In sentencing offenders a court must have regarded to  

(a)     
the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence;
(b)     
current sentencing practice and the terms of any applicable guideline judgment;
(c)     
the nature and gravity of the particular offence;
(d)     
the offender's culpability and degree of responsibility for the offence;
(e)     
the impact of the offence on any victim of the offence and the injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence;
(f)     
whether the offender pleaded guilty to the offence, and if so, the stage in the proceedings at which the offender did so or indicated an intention to do so;
(g)     
the conduct of the offender during the trial as an indication of remorse or the lack of remorse;
(h)     
any action taken by the offender to make restitution for the injury, loss or damage arising from the offence, including his or her willingness to comply with any order for restitution that a court may consider under this Decree;
(i)     
the offender's previous character;
(j)     
the presence of any aggravating or mitigating factor concerning the offender or any other circumstance relevant to the commission of the offence; and
(k)     
any matter stated in this Decree as being grounds for applying a particular sentencing option. 

21.     
Considering the nature of the offence and all circumstances I find the sentence imposed on the 1st Accused Navitalai Dela cannot be suspended. But the sentence imposed on the 2nd Accused and 3rd Accused Persons can be considered under section 26(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree.

22.     
Considering Section 26 (1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree the section states as follows:

"On sentencing an offender to a term of imprisonment a court may make an order suspending, for a period specified by the court, the whole or part of the sentence, if it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.

23.     
Both of you are seeking mercy of the Court and request another chance of life. In other words both of you are urging the Court to impose a non custodial sentence. 

24.     
Both of you committed a serious crime but considering all circumstances you deserve a second chance in your life, therefore I act under Section 26(1) and suspend your sentence for a period of 3 years.

25.     
The sentence imposed on the 1st Accused Navitalai Dela is not suspended since the two sentences are imposed in two separate cases. Both sentences will be implemented consecutively. 

26.     
Sentence imposed on the 2nd and 3rd Accused persons is suspended to a period of 3 years. Nature and consequences of the suspended sentence are explained to them.

27.     
Considering the nature of the offence I inclined to act under Section 31(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree. Section 31(1) of the Sentencing and Penalties Decree states as follows:

"If a person is found guilty of an offence the court may, subject to any specific provision relating to the offence, fine the offender in addition to or instead of any other sentence to which the offender may be liable "

28.     
After carefully considering all factors especially the 2nd and 3rd Accused persons are willing to reimburse the loss of the virtual complainant. I impose fine in the following manner:

HAC 01/2012-    
$1000.00 each in default 5 months
HAC 02/2012-    
$500 each in default 2 ½ years

29.     
Considering section 34 of the said Decree the 2nd and 3rd Accused persons are given 3 months to pay the fine in 3 installments. 1st installment will be on the 18/05/2012, 2nd installment 21/06/2012 and 3rd installment 19/07/2012.

30.     
When the fine is paid the virtual complainant can claim the paid amount.

31.     
Summary:

1st Accused  Navitalai Dela

In HAC 01/2012, 2 years and 2 months imprisonment and you will not be illegible for parole before 18 months. In HAC 02/2012, 2 years imprisonment and you will not be eligible for parole for 16 months. Both sentences will be implemented consecutively.
