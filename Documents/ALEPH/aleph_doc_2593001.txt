NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
 
 
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, among other
things, statements regarding plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance
and underlying assumptions and other statements, which are other than statements of historical
facts. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation,
Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.” Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as
“anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “projects,” “will be,”
“will continue,” “will likely result,” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements are
based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited
to, those discussed in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015 and in particular, the risks discussed in our Form 10-K under the caption
“Risk Factors” in Item 1A therein, and those discussed in other documents we file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Important factors that in our view could cause
material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations include, but are not
limited to, risks associated with the company's ability to obtain additional capital in the future to
fund planned expansion, the demand for oil and natural gas, general economic factors,
competition in the industry and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially
different from those described herein as anticipated, believed, estimated or expected. We
undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to any forward-
looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.
 
As used herein, the “Company,” “we,” “Torchlight,” “our,” and similar terms include Torchlight
Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
 
1. NATURE OF BUSINESS
 
Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. was incorporated in October 2007 under the laws of the State
of Nevada as Pole Perfect Studios, Inc. (“PPS”).  From its incorporation to November 2010, the
company was primarily engaged in business start-up activities.
 
On November 23, 2010, we entered into and closed a Share Exchange Agreement (the
“Exchange Agreement”) between the major shareholders of PPS and the shareholders of
Torchlight Energy, Inc. (“TEI”).  As a result of the transactions effected by the Exchange
Agreement, at closing TEI became our wholly-owned subsidiary, and the business of TEI
became our sole business.  TEI was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in June
2010.  We are engaged in the acquisition, exploitation and/or development of oil and natural gas
properties in the United States.  In addition to TEI, we also operate our business through our
wholly-owned subsidiaries Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC, a Texas limited liability company
and Hudspeth Oil Corporation, a Texas corporation.
 
On December 10, 2010, we effected a 4-for-1 forward split of our shares of common stock
outstanding.  All owners of record at the close of business on December 10, 2010 (record date)
received three additional shares for every one share they owned.  All share amounts reflected
throughout this report take into account the 4-for-1 forward split.
 
Effective February 8, 2011, we changed our name to “Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc.”  In
connection with the name change, our ticker symbol changed from “PPFT” to “TRCH.”
 
The Company is engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and
gas properties within the United States. The Company’s success will depend in large part on its
ability to obtain and develop profitable oil and gas interests.
 
2. GOING CONCERN
 
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company
will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for its next fiscal year.
 
At June 30, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations. We had a net loss of
approximately $5.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and had accumulated losses
of $80,688,892 since our inception to June 30, 2016, and expect to incur further losses in the
development of our business.  Working Capital as of June 30, 2016 was negative $5,513,845.
Negative working capital is exacerbated by the inclusion in current liabilities of the $3,384,345
outstanding balance of subordinated convertible notes which have a maturity date of June 30,
2017 and are therefore included in current liabilities as of June 30, 2016.
 
The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate
future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and
repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  Management’s
plan to address the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern includes:  (1) obtaining
debt or equity funding from private placement or institutional sources; (2) obtain loans from
financial institutions, where possible; (3) participating in joint venture transactions with third
parties; or (4) sale of assets.  Although management believes that it will be able to obtain the
necessary funding to allow the Company to remain a going concern through the methods
discussed above, there can be no assurances that such methods will prove successful.  The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
The Company maintains its accounts on the accrual method of accounting in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accounting principles
followed and the methods of applying those principles, which materially affect the determination
of financial position, results of operations and cash flows are summarized below:
 
Use of estimates – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and certain assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated
financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)
 
3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
 
Basis of presentation—The financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis and
include all of the accounts of Torchlight Energy Resources Inc. and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Torchlight Energy, Inc., Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC, and Hudspeth Oil
Corporation. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
 
Risks and uncertainties – The Company’s operations are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties, including financial, operational, technological, and other risks associated with
operating an emerging business, including the potential risk of business failure.
 
Concentration of risks – The Company’s cash is placed with a highly rated financial institution,
and the Company periodically reviews the credit worthiness of the financial institutions with
which it does business. At times the Company’s cash balances are in excess of amounts
guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 
Fair value of financial instruments – Financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable,
accounts payable, notes payable to related party, and convertible promissory notes. The
estimated fair values of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and related party payables
approximate the carrying amount due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. The
carrying amounts of the convertible promissory notes approximate their fair value giving affect for
the term of the note and the effective interest rates.
 
For assets and liabilities that require re-measurement to fair value the Company categorizes
them in a three-level fair value hierarchy as follows:
 
·Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
·Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that
are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration.
·Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on management’s own assumptions used to
measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
 
A financial asset or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
 
Accounts receivable – Accounts receivable consist of uncollateralized oil and natural gas
revenues due under normal trade terms, as well as amounts due from working interest owners of
oil and gas properties for their share of expenses paid on their behalf by the Company.
Management reviews receivables periodically and reduces the carrying amount by a valuation
allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amount that may not be collectible. As
of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 no valuation allowance was considered necessary.
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company had a $419,839 account receivable from Husky
Ventures for the estimated balance of the sale proceeds from the sale of the Chisholm Trail
properties in fourth quarter, 2015. The Chisholm Trail properties were sold to Husky Ventures
who then included them with the Husky interests in Chisholm Trail and then entered into a sale
agreement with Gastar Exploration Inc. for the combined Torchlight and Husky interests. Receipt
of the balance of the sale proceeds was subject to final determination of mineral lease
classification and was to occur by February 28, 2016.
 
On June 14, 2016, after the lawsuit that is described in Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings
regarding the Hunton Play, the Company received and subsequently deposited a check from
Husky Ventures in the amount of $520,400.   Husky Ventures designated that the check was in
full satisfaction of its obligations under the transaction in which the Company sold the Chisholm
Trail properties as described above. The Company does not believe the check is in full
satisfaction of Husky Ventures’s obligations, including but not limited to that Husky Ventures has
provided insufficient information for the Company regarding this transaction.  The Company is
currently pursuing claims against Husky Ventures, and others, related to this transaction and
intends to continue to pursue those claims as described further in Part II Item 1. Legal
Proceedings regarding the Hunton Play.
 
Investment in oil and gas properties – The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for
exploration and development activities as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”). Under this method of accounting, the costs of unsuccessful, as well as successful,
exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment. This
includes any internal costs that are directly related to property acquisition, exploration and
development activities but does not include any costs related to production, general corporate
overhead or similar activities. Gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas
properties is not recognized, unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship
between capitalized costs and proved reserves.
 
Oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized.
Oil and natural gas property costs excluded represent investments in unevaluated properties and
include non-producing leasehold, geological, and geophysical costs associated with leasehold
or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs. The Company allocates a portion of its
acquisition costs to unevaluated properties based on relative value. Costs are transferred to the
full cost pool as the properties are evaluated over the life of the reservoir.
 
As of June 30, 2016 the Company performed an assessment of evaluated and unevaluated costs
in the cost pool to conform the cumulative value of the Full Cost Pool to the combined amount of
Reserve Value of evaluated, producing properties (as determined by independent analysis at
December 31, 2015), plus the lesser of cumulative historical cost or estimated realizable value of
unevaluated leases and projects expected to commence production in future operating periods.
The results of the assessment was an additional charge to Impairment Expense of $57,912.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
 
Capitalized interest – The Company capitalizes interest on unevaluated properties during the
periods in which they are excluded from costs being depleted or amortized.  During the periods
ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the Company capitalized $157,581 and $395,738,
respectively, of interest on unevaluated properties.
 
Depreciation, depletion, and amortization – The depreciable base for oil and natural gas
properties includes the sum of all capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation, depletion,
and amortization (“DD&A”), estimated future development costs and asset retirement costs not
included in oil and natural gas properties, less costs excluded from amortization. The
depreciable base of oil and natural gas properties is amortized on a unit-of-production method.
 
Ceiling test – Future production volumes from oil and gas properties are a significant factor in
determining the full cost ceiling limitation of capitalized costs. Under the full cost method of
accounting, the Company is required to periodically perform a “ceiling test” that determines a limit
on the book value of oil and gas properties. If the net capitalized cost of proved oil and gas
properties, net of related deferred income taxes, plus the cost of unproved oil and gas properties,
exceeds the present value of estimated future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent, net of
related tax affects, plus the cost of unproved oil and gas properties, the excess is charged to
expense and reflected as additional accumulated DD&A. The ceiling test calculation uses a
commodity price assumption which is based on the unweighted arithmetic average of the price
on the first day of each month for each month within the prior 12 month period and excludes
future cash outflows related to estimated abandonment costs. The Company recognized
impairment of $22,438,114 on its oil and gas properties during the three months ended June 30,
2015 and an additional impairment at December 31, 2015 of $3,236,009 for a total impairment
adjustment for 2015 of $25,674,123. Impairment in the amount of $57,912 was recognized at
June 30, 2016 as a result of the Company’s assessment. Due to the volatility of commodity
prices, should oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, it is possible that a write-down
could occur. Proved reserves are estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas
liquids, which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be
recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. The
independent engineering estimates include only those amounts considered to be proved
reserves and do not include additional amounts which may result from new discoveries in the
future, or from application of secondary and tertiary recovery processes where facilities are not in
place or for which transportation and/or marketing contracts are not in place. Estimated reserves
to be developed through secondary or tertiary recovery processes are classified as unevaluated
properties.
 
The determination of oil and gas reserves is a subjective process, and the accuracy of any
reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data and the application of engineering and
geological interpretation and judgment. Estimates of economically recoverable reserves and
future net cash flows depend on a number of variable factors and assumptions that are difficult to
predict and may vary considerably from actual results. In particular, reserve estimates for wells
with limited or no production history are less reliable than those based on actual production.
Subsequent re-evaluation of reserves and cost estimates related to future development of proved
oil and gas reserves could result in significant revisions to proved reserves.  Other issues, such
as changes in regulatory requirements, technological advances, and other factors which are
difficult to predict could also affect estimates of proved reserves in the future.
 
Gains and losses on the sale of oil and gas properties are not generally reflected in income
unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and
proved reserves. Sales of less than 100% of the Company’s interest in the oil and gas property
are treated as a reduction of the capital cost of the field, with no gain or loss recognized, as long
as doing so does not significantly affect the unit-of-production depletion rate. Costs of retired
equipment, net of salvage value, are usually charged to accumulated depreciation.
 
Asset retirement obligations – Accounting principles require that the fair value of a liability for an
asset’s retirement obligation (“ARO”) be recorded in the period in which it is incurred if a
reasonable estimate of fair value can be made, and that the corresponding cost be capitalized as
part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability is accreted to its then-
present value each subsequent period, and the capitalized cost is depleted over the useful life of
the related asset. Abandonment cost incurred is recorded as a reduction to the ARO liability.
 
Inherent in the fair value calculation of an ARO are numerous assumptions and judgments
including the ultimate settlement amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing
of settlement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental, and political environments. To
the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing ARO liability,
a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. Settlements greater
than or less than amounts accrued as ARO are recorded as a gain or loss upon settlement.
 
Asset retirement obligation activity is disclosed in Note 10.
 
Share-based compensation – Compensation cost for equity awards is based on the fair value of
the equity instrument on the date of grant and is recognized over the period during which an
employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Compensation cost for
liability awards is based on the fair value of the vested award at the end of each period.
 
Revenue recognition – The Company recognizes oil and gas revenues when production is sold
at a fixed or determinable price, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred and title has transferred, and collectability is reasonably assured.

3. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - continued
 
Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share – Basic earnings (loss) per common share is
computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per
common share is computed in the same way as basic earnings (loss) per common share except
that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would
be outstanding if all potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common
shares were dilutive.  The Company has not included potentially dilutive securities in the
calculation of loss per share for any periods presented as the effects would be anti-dilutive.
 
Environmental laws and regulations – The Company is subject to extensive federal, state, and
local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental expenditures are expensed or
capitalized depending on their future economic benefit. The Company believes that it is in
compliance with existing laws and regulations.
 
Recent accounting pronouncements –
 
On August 27, 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, which provides guidance on determining
when and how to disclose going-concern uncertainties in the financial statements. The new
standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are
issued. An entity must provide certain disclosures if conditions or events raise substantial doubt
about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. The ASU applies to all entities and is
effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods thereafter, with
early adoption permitted.
 
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 that introduces a new five-step revenue recognition
model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU also requires disclosures sufficient
to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash
flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures
about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets
recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This standard is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. The
Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its
consolidated financial statements.
 
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, which includes amendments that change the
requirements for reporting discontinued operations and require additional disclosures about
discontinued operations. Under the new guidance, only disposals representing a strategic shift in
operations - that is, a major effect on the organization’s operations and financial results should be
presented as discontinued operations. Additionally, the ASU requires expanded disclosures
about discontinued operations that will provide financial statement users with more information
about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. The new standard
is effective in the first quarter of 2015 for public organizations with calendar year ends. Early
adoption would be permitted for any annual or interim period for which an entity’s financial
statements have not yet been made available for issuance. The adoption of this guidance is not
expected to have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Other recently issued or adopted accounting pronouncements are not expected to have, or did
not have, a material impact on the Company’s financial position or results from operations.
 
Subsequent events – The Company evaluated subsequent events through August 15, 2016, the
date of issuance of the financial statements. Subsequent events are disclosed in Note 11.
 
4. RELATED PARTY PAYABLES
 
As of June 30, 2016, related party payables consisted of accrued and unpaid compensation to
two of our executive officers totaling $90,000 and a Director Fee payable to one of our Directors,
Mr. Edward J. Devereaux of $36,112. Mr. Devereaux elected to receive $50,000 of the Director
Fee in cash when funds are available. As of June 30, 2016 $13,888 had been paid to Mr.
Devereaux.
 
Additionally, Gregory McCabe, who became a Director in July, 2016, advanced the Company
$150,000 as a short term loan in June, 2016. Subsequent to June 30, 2016 these funds were
applied as consideration for Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued to Mr. McCabe.
 
On November 4, 2014, Eunis L. Shockey, a member of the Board of directors, loaned us
$500,000 under a 30 day promissory note.  The promissory note accrues interest at an annual
rate of 10%.  The balance of the note at June 30, 2016 was $131,250. The due date of the note is
December 31, 2016.
5. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
 
The Company is subject to contingencies as a result of environmental laws and
regulations.  Present and future environmental laws and regulations applicable to the Company’s
operations could require substantial capital expenditures or could adversely affect its operations
in other ways that cannot be predicted at this time.  As of June 30, 2016, no amounts had been
recorded because no specific liability has been identified that is reasonably probable of requiring
the Company to fund any future material amounts.

8. INCOME TAXES
 
Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases and operating loss carry forwards.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The effect on deferred tax assets and
liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.  A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more
likely than not that the related tax benefits will not be realized.  The Company has placed a 100%
valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset because future realization of these assets
is not assured.
 
Authoritative guidance for uncertainty in income taxes requires that the Company recognize the
financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority
would more likely than not sustain the position following an examination.  Management has
reviewed the Company’s tax positions and determined there were no uncertain tax positions
requiring recognition in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company’s tax returns
remain subject to Federal and State tax examinations for the years 2012 through
2015.  Generally, the applicable statutes of limitation are three to four years from their respective
filings.
 
Estimated interest and penalties related to potential underpayment on any unrecognized tax
benefits are classified as a component of tax expense in the statement of operation.  The
Company has not recorded any interest or penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits
for any periods covered by these financial statements.
 
The Company had a net deferred tax asset related to federal net operating loss carry forwards at
June 30, 2016 of $25,142,099 available to offset future taxable income.   The federal net
operating loss carry forward will begin to expire in 2030.  Realization of the deferred tax asset is
dependent, in part, on generating sufficient taxable income prior to expiration of the loss carry
forwards.  The Company has placed a 100% valuation allowance against the net deferred tax
asset because future realization of these assets is not assured.

Divestiture of Assets
 
In August, 2016 the Company entered into an agreement to assign its interest in the Ring Energy
project in Kansas to its joint venture partner in exchange for a release from a $1,500,000 drilling
commitment, release from future plugging and abandonment liability and cancellation of an
account payable of $100,500. Three wells were producing on the property with combined daily
production of less than five barrels per day. As of June 30, 2016, $5,355,705 was specifically
allocated to the Ring properties from accumulated impairment recorded in prior periods to adjust
the book value of Ring to the amount realized from the transaction in August, 2016. No additional
impairment was required.
 
Continuance of Offering to Warrant Holders
 
On June 16, 2016 an offering to warrant holders was circulated to allow holders to exercise
warrants at the reduced exercise price of $.50 per share regardless of the original exercise price
of warrants they were holding. The offering was scheduled to close on June 30, 2016. The
Company, however, elected to extend the expiration of the offering to July 15, 2016 at which date
the offering was closed. Holders exercised 2,069,065 warrants in July. Any warrants not
exercised within the offering period retained their original terms including the original exercise
price.
 
Preferred Series “C” Offering
 
On July 8, 2016, we sold a total of 10,000 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the
“Series C Preferred”) to certain investors at a purchase price of $100 per share for total
consideration of $1,000,000. We filed the Certificate of Designation for the Series C Preferred
with the Secretary of State of Nevada on July 8, 2016.  The designations, preferences,
limitations, restrictions and relative rights of the Series C Preferred are as follows: (i) a stated
value of $100 per share; (ii) mandatory conversion on the earlier of 92 days after the spud date of
Hazel Prospect or October 13, 2016, with each holder having the right to convert at its election
any time before that; (iii) a conversion price of $1.01 per share of common stock; (iv) each holder
has the right to convert its shares into a proportionate heads up working interest in the Hazel

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
Overview
 
We are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, and/or development of oil and
natural gas properties in the United States. We operate our business through our subsidiaries
Torchlight Energy Inc., Torchlight Energy Operating, LLC, and Hudspeth Oil Corporation.
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016 the Board of Directors initiated a review of Company
operations and focus given the divestiture of its Oklahoma properties beginning with the sale of
the Chisholm Trail properties in fourth quarter, 2015 and the sale of the Cimarron properties in
second quarter, 2016. During this same time frame development has continued on the Orogrande
Project in West Texas and in April, 2016 the Company acquired the Hazel Project in the Midland
Basin also in West Texas. These West Texas properties demonstrate significant potential, future
production capabilities based upon the analysis of scientific data being gathered in the day by
day development activity. Therefore, the Board has determined to focus its efforts and capital on
these two projects to maximize shareholder value for the long run.
 
During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, in accordance with this new emphasis, remaining
projects in other locations have been offered for sale. The result has been the closing on August
10, 2016 of the assignment of the Company’s Ring Properties in Kansas to our joint venture
partner. Further, the Marcelina properties in South Texas have been offered for sale, however,
discussions and negotiations are still in process at date of this filing. The Company’s remaining
assets in Oklahoma consisting of three AMI’s (the Viking, Rosedale, and the Thunderbird) and
four wells (two are producing) are held pending the outcome of the lawsuit filed by Torchlight
against the operator, Husky Ventures, in May, 2016.
 
The strategy in divesting of projects other than the Orogrande and the Hazel Projects is to
refocus on the greatest potential future value for the Company while systematically eliminating
debt as noncore assets are sold and operations are streamlined.
 
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in
conjunction with our unaudited financial statements included herewith and our audited financial
statements included with our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  This discussion
should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into
the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating
results in the future.  Such discussion represents only the best present assessment by our
management.
 
Current Projects
 
As of June 30, 2016 the Company had interests in five oil and gas projects: the Marcelina Creek
Field Development in Wilson County, Texas, the Ring Energy Joint Venture in Southwest
Kansas, Hunton wells operated by Husky Ventures in Central Oklahoma, the Orogrande Project
in Hudspeth County, Texas, and the Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas.
 
Marcelina Creek Field Development.
 
On July 6, 2010, TEI entered into a participation agreement with Bayshore Operating
Corporation, LLC (“Bayshore”), which is currently the holder of an oil, gas, and mineral lease
covering approximately 1,045 acres in Wilson County, Texas, known as the Marcelina Creek
Field Development.  The Participation Agreement provides for the drilling of four wells. Three of
the obligation wells have been drilled.  The first three wells include a horizontal re-entry well
known as the Johnson-1-H, a vertical well known as the Johnson #4, and a lateral well known as
the Johnson #2-H.  These three wells were producing a total of approximately 85 BOPD as of
June 30, 2016.  The remaining well (Johnson #3) is to be a vertical development well at a
location to be determined within the existing lease. Drilling is anticipated for midyear 2016.
 
The Company initiated a reentry project on the Johnson #4 well early in 2016 which has been
completed. Initial production at completion was 2,920 barrels for the month of February, 2016.
Production has declined to approximately 20 barrels per day.
 
Work is being planned on the Johnson #2 applying an acid treatment to increase production.
 
The Marcelina Creek Field Development is located over the Austin Chalk, Buda, and Eagle Ford
Formations, which formations are well known and established producers in central Texas.  Their
production is controlled by vertical fracturing of the rock with high productivity in wells which
encounter the greatest amount of fractures.  With the advent of horizontal drilling technology,
numerous opportunities exist in areas and fields that were only drilled vertically.
 
The Company has offered the Marcelina properties for sale and is in discussion with potential
buyers.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - continued
 
The Ring Energy Joint Venture, Southwest Kansas
 
In October 2013, we entered into a Joint Venture agreement with Ring Energy.  The agreement
called for us to provide for $6.2 million in drilling capital to, in effect, match Ring Energy’s
expenditures for leasing.  In exchange for this commitment, we would receive a 50% interest in
each well bore drilled and the acreage unit it held, until we had spent $6.2 million.  At such time,
we would then receive a 50% Working Interest in the entire lease block consisting of 17,000 +/-
acres.  We were to provide $3.1 million in advance of the program commencing, which would
cover approximately 5 wells to be drilled and completed.  Once the initial five wells are
completed, we and Ring would evaluate the program and the drilling activity and determine if
another five wells are to be drilled.  Should we continue with the program, we would then deposit
another $3.1 million with Ring for drilling and completion of the next five wells.
 
We have made the initial $3.1 million deposit and the first five well drilling program is completed.
Drilling operations commenced in March, 2014. Seven wells have been drilled – three are
producing, one can be converted to a salt water disposal well, one was not completed, and two
were plugged and abandoned.  Based upon results from drilling, the participants elected to
suspend further drilling and obtain seismic data to guide continuing development. As of June 30,
2016, the Company had invested approximately $5,500,000 in the Ring Joint Venture.
 
In August, 2016 the Company assigned its interest in the Ring Project in Kansas to its joint
venture partner in exchange for a release from a $1,500,000 drilling commitment, release from
future plugging and abandonment liability and cancellation of an account payable of $100,500.
Three wells were producing on the property with combined daily production of less than five
barrels per day.
 
Hunton Play, Central Oklahoma
 
As of June 30, 2016, we were actively producing from one well in Viking, and one in Prairie
Grove.
 
Legal Proceeding 
 
As previously disclosed, in May, 2016, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary
Torchlight Energy, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the 429th judicial district court in Collin County, Texas
against Husky Ventures, Inc., Charles V. Long, April Glidewell, Silverstar of Nevada, Inc.,
Maximus Exploration, LLC, Atwood Acquisitions, LLC, Gastar Exploration Inc., J. Russell Porter,
Michael A. Gerlich, Jerry R. Schuyler, and John M. Selser, Sr. 
 
Reference Part II. Item 1. Legal Proceedings regarding the Hunton Play for further detail.
 
Cimarron AMI
The Company negotiated a 15% working interest in approximately 3,700 acres in the Cimarron
Area of Logan County in May 2013.  The total acreage in which the Company had an interest
increased to 5,200. The Company has divested of its Cimarron Project assets including lease
rights and current production. Effective May 1, 2016 the sale of the Company’s Cimarron assets
in Oklahoma was completed at a sales price $750,000 resulting in a loss of $146,138 on the
sale.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - continued
  
Chisholm Trail AMI
 
In the third quarter of 2013, we acquired from a third party for stock, a 15.3% working interest in
5011+/- acres in the Chisolm Trail AMI with Husky Ventures Inc. as the operator. 
 
The Chisholm Trail properties were sold to Husky Ventures during fourth quarter, 2015 who then
combined them with the Husky interests in Chisholm Trail and entered into a sale agreement
with Gastar Exploration Inc. for the combined Torchlight and Husky interests. The estimated final
sale price to Torchlight pending final review by Gastar of lease classification, is $4,150,000. Sale
proceeds were applied to reduce Torchlight’s Joint Interest payable to Husky of $2,830,161 with
the balance to be received in cash. The Company received $900,000 in cash and has recorded
an account receivable as of December 31, 2015 of $419,839. Receipt of the balance of the sale
proceeds was subject to final determination of mineral lease classification and was to occur by
February 28, 2016.
 
On June 14, 2016, after the lawsuit that is described in Part II Item 1. Legal Proceedings
regarding the Hunton Play, the Company received and subsequently deposited a check from
Husky Ventures in the amount of $520,400.   Husky Ventures designated that the check was in
full satisfaction of its obligations under the transaction in which the Company sold the Chisholm
Trail properties as described above.  The Company does not believe the check is in full
satisfaction of Husky Ventures’s obligations, including but not limited to that Husky Ventures has
provided insufficient information for the Company regarding this transaction.  The Company is
currently pursuing claims against Husky Ventures, and others, related to this transaction and
intends to continue to pursue those claims as described further in Part II Item 1. Legal
Proceedings regarding the Hunton Play.
 
Viking AMI
 
In the fourth quarter of 2013 we entered into an Area of Mutual Interest (AMI) with Husky
Ventures, the Viking Prospect.   We acquired a 25% interest in 3,945 acres in the Viking. We
subsequently acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014.  We had an interest in 8,800 total acres as
of June 30, 2016. (Net undeveloped acres = 2,600) Husky drilled the first two wells in the AMI in
second quarter, 2014. One well is currently producing nominal quantities of oil. Our net
cumulative investment through June 30, 2016 in undeveloped acres in the Viking AMI was
$1,387,928. 
 
Rosedale AMI
 
In January of 2014 we contracted for a 25% Working Interest in approximately 5,000 acres in the
Rosedale AMI in South Central Oklahoma. We acquired an additional 5% in May, 2014.  The
Company had an interest in 11,600 total acres as of June 30, 2016 (Net undeveloped acres =
3,500). Our cumulative investment through June 30, 2016 in the Rosedale AMI was $2,834,514.
 
Prairie Grove – Judy Well
 
In February of 2014, we acquired a 10% Working Interest in a well in the Prairie Grove AMI from
a non-consenting third party who elected not to participate in the well. The well is producing
approximately 19 BOE per day.
 
Thunderbird AMI
 
In July of 2014, we contracted for a 25% Working Interest in the Thunderbird AMI.  The total acres
in which the Company had an interest at June 30, 2016 totals 4,300 acres (Net undeveloped
acres = 1,100). Our cumulative investment through June 30, 2016 in the Thunderbird AMI was
$949,530.
 
Orogrande Project, West Texas
 
On August 7, 2014, we entered into a Purchase Agreement with Hudspeth Oil Corporation
(“Hudspeth”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”), and Greg McCabe. Mr. McCabe was the
sole owner of both Hudspeth and MPC. Under the terms and conditions of the Purchase
Agreement, at closing, we purchased 100% of the capital stock of Hudspeth which holds certain
oil and gas assets, including a 100% working interest in 172,000 mostly contiguous acres in the
Orogrande Basin in West Texas. This acreage is in the primary term under five-year leases that
carry additional five-year extension provisions. As consideration, at closing we issued 868,750
shares of our common stock to Mr. McCabe and paid a total of $100,000 in geologic origination
fees to third parties.  Additionally, Mr. McCabe will have an optional 10% working interest back-in
after payout and a reversionary interest if drilling obligations are not met, all under the terms and
conditions of a participation and development agreement.  Closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement occurred on September 23, 2014.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - continued
 
The Company finalized an agreement to sell a 5% working interest in the Orogrande acreage on
June 30, 2015 with an effective date of April 1, 2015. Sale proceeds were $500,000 which were
received in April, 2015. In addition, the Company issued 250,000 three year warrants with an
exercise price of $.50 to the purchaser.
 
On September 23, 2015, our subsidiary, Hudspeth Oil Corporation (“HOC”), entered into a
Farmout Agreement by and between HOC, Pandora Energy, LP (“Pandora”), Founders Oil &
Gas, LLC (“Founders”), McCabe Petroleum Corporation and Greg McCabe (McCabe Petroleum
Corporation and Greg McCabe are parties to the Farmout Agreement for limited purposes) for the
entire Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County, Texas.  The Farmout Agreement provides for
Founders to earn from HOC and Pandora (collectively, the “Farmor”) an undivided 50% of the
leasehold interest in the Orogrande Project by Founder’s spending a minimum of $45 million on
actual drilling operations on the Orogrande Project in the next two years.  Founders is to pay
Farmor a total cost reimbursement of $5,000,000 in multiple installments as follows: (1)
$1,000,000 at the signing of the Farmout Agreement, the balance of which was received on
September 24, 2015; (2) within 90 days from the closing, Founders will frac and complete the
Rich A-11 No. 1 Well; and (3) within five days of the spudding of each of the next eight wells
drilled by Founders, Founders will pay to Farmor $500,000 resulting in the payment of the
remaining amount; provided that, in the event that within 90 days after the fracing of the Rich
Well, Founders notifies Farmor of its election not to drill any additional wells, Founders shall
have no further obligation to make further payment.  Upon payment of the first $1,000,000,
Farmor assigned to Founders an undivided 50% of the leasehold interest and a 37.5% net
revenue interest in the leases subject to the terms of the Farmout Agreement (including
obligations to re-assign to HOC and Pandora if the 50% interest in the entire Orogrande Project
is not earned) and a proportionate share of the McCabe 10% BIAPO (back in after pay out)
interest; provided, however, that for each well that Founders drills prior to earning the acreage, it
will be assigned a 50% working interest in the wellbore and in the lease on which it sits.
 
Under a joint operating agreement (on A.A.P.L. Form 610 – 1989 Model Form Operating
Agreement with COPAS 2005 Accounting Procedures) (“JOA”) also entered into on September
23, 2015, Founders Oil & Gas Operating, LLC is designated as operator of the leases.  Any
variance to the operating plan will be determined by a Development Committee, which
committee will be made up of members from Founders and Farmor, or their designees, to discuss
and recommend the location of the drill wells, data to be gathered and the form of same.  As
contemplated under the Farmout Agreement, starting within 90 days of the completion of the
fracing on the Rich Well, and at all times subject to the 90 day continuous drilling clause,
Founders has the option, but not the obligation, to retain the assigned interest as follows: (1) if
Founders spends a minimum of $45 million on actual drilling operations while maintaining
compliance with the continuous drilling clause, subject to reasonable delays resulting from
reasonable Force Majeure conditions, Founders will have fulfilled its farmout obligations and will
be entitled to retain the assigned interests. If Founders does not meet such obligations, it will
reassign to Farmor the assigned interest except it will be entitled to retain its interest in the leases
covering all wells drilled by Founders and the sections in which such wells are located.
Additionally, Founders will resign as operator of the JOA as to all lands reassigned; and (2)
Farmor will be carried in all drilling operations during the first two years and/or $45 million in
drilling operations, whichever comes last, subject to Founders’ right to recoup certain expenses
on “Gap Wells.”  After three years and after Founders has earned its working interest, either party
may elect to market the acreage as an entire block, including operatorship.  Should an
acceptable bid arise, and both parties agree, the block will be sold 100% working interest to that
third party bidder.  However, if only one party wants to accept the outside offer, the other party
(the party who wishes not to sell) has the right to purchase the working interest from the selling
party.
 
Torchlight Energy and Founders have elected to move forward on planning the next phase of
drilling in the Orogrande Project. The project operator planned to permit three new wells starting
with the University Founders B-19 #1 well. The new wells would be   drilled vertically for test
purposes and would have sufficient casing size to support lateral entry into any pay zone(s)
encountered once the well is tested vertically. Torchlight and the project operator would then run
a battery of tests on each well to gain information for future development of the field. The B-19 #1
well had been drilled and tested and pipe set at June 30, 2016.
 
Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas
 
Effective April 1, 2016, Torchlight Energy Inc. acquired from McCabe Petroleum Corporation
(Seller) a 66.66% working interest in approximately 12,000 acres in the Midland Basin in
exchange for 1,500,000 warrants to purchase Torchlight common stock with an exercise price of
$1.00 for five years and a back-in after payout of a 25% working interest to the seller.
 
Initial development of the first well on the Property began July 10, 2016 and development
continues in process at the date of this filing.

At June 30, 2016, we had working capital of ($5,513,845), current assets of $1,139,770
consisting of cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and prepaid expenses and total assets
of $10,535,663 consisting of current assets, investments in oil and gas properties, and other
assets. As of June 30, 2016, we had current liabilities of $6,653,615, consisting of, accounts
payable (principally for development costs), payables to related parties, notes payable, and
accrued interest. Negative working capital is exacerbated by the inclusion in current liabilities of
the $3,384,345 outstanding balance of subordinated convertible notes which have a maturity
date of June 30, 2017 and are therefore included in current liabilities as of June 30, 2016.

$2,206,568. Cash flow provided (used) by operating activities for the six months ended June 30,
2016 can be primarily attributed to net losses from operations of $5,785,453 which consists
primarily of $4,747,704 in general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion and
amortization of $722,054, and accretion of convertible note discounts of $95,979. Cash flow
provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2015 can be primarily
attributed to net losses from operations of $33,073,738, which consists primarily of $8,896,025 in
general and administrative expenses, depreciation, depletion, and amortization of $698,805,
accretion of convertible note discounts of $1,163,091, and impairment expense of $22,438,114.
We expect to continue to use cash flow in operating activities until such time as we achieve
sufficient commercial oil and gas production to cover all of our cash costs.
 
Cash flow used in investing activities for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $128,209
compared to $3,666,825 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Cash flow used in investing
activities consists primarily of oil and gas investments in Texas properties during the six months
ended June 30, 2016.
 
Cash flow provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $229,922
as compared to $2,302,989 for the six months ended June 30, 2015.  Cash flow provided by
financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from common stock issues, promissory notes,
and warrant exercises.  We expect to continue to have cash flow provided by financing activities
as we seek new rounds of financing and continue to develop our oil and gas investments.
 
Our current assets are insufficient to meet our current obligations or to satisfy our cash needs
over the next twelve months and as such we will require additional debt or equity financing to
meet our plans and needs.  We face obstacles in continuing to attract new financing due to
industry conditions and our history and current record of net losses and working capital deficits.
  Despite our efforts, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing
required to meet our stated objectives or even to continue as a going concern.
 
We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.
 
Commitments and Contingencies
 
We are subject to contingencies as a result of environmental laws and regulations. Present and
future environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations could require substantial
capital expenditures or could adversely affect our operations in other ways that cannot be
predicted at this time.  As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, no amounts have been recorded
because no specific liability has been identified that is reasonably probable of requiring us to
fund any future material amounts.
 
As of June 30, 2016 the Company had interests in five oil and gas projects: the Marcelina Creek
Field Development in Wilson County, Texas, the Ring Energy Joint Venture in Southwest
Kansas, the Hunton play in Central Oklahoma, the Orogrande Project in Hudspeth County,
Texas, and the Hazel Project in the Midland Basin in West Texas. See the description under
“Current Projects” above under “Overview” for more information and disclosure regarding
commitments and contingencies relating to these projects.

ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 
Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-
15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of June 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
applicable rules and forms and that such information was accumulated and communicated to our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in a manner that allowed for timely
decisions regarding disclosure. 
 
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 
Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have indicated that, upon evaluation,
there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or other factors during the
period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting
 
 
PART II   OTHER INFORMATION
 
ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
 
On February 16, 2012, Torchlight Energy Inc. filed a lawsuit against Hockley Energy, Inc. and
Frank O. Snortheim in the District Court of Harris County, Texas in connection with farmout
agreements entered into with Hockley Energy in November 2011.  In the lawsuit, we sued
Hockley Energy and Snortheim for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, prommissory
estoppel pertaining to failure to perform two farmout agreements entered into on November 4,
2011, the first relating to the Marcelina Creek prospect and the second relating to the East
Stockdale prospect.  Under the Marcelina Farmout, Hockley Energy had an obligation to fund
$2,231,250.00 no later than November 18, 2011.  They did not perform as promised.  On
February 23, 2015, we obtained a summary judgment against Hockley Energy in the amount of
$16,400,000 in damages and $21,877 in attorney fees.  On June 30, 2015, we obtained a
judgement against Snortheim for $16,400,000 in damages plus pre judgement interest of
$3,385,587. We are currently seeking to enforce the judgment, but it is doubtful that any
substantial portion of the judgment is recoverable from Hockley Energy.
In May, 2016, Torchlight Energy Resources, Inc. and its subsidiary Torchlight Energy, Inc. filed a
lawsuit in the 429th judicial district court in Collin County, Texas against Husky Ventures, Inc.,
Charles V. Long, April Glidewell, Silverstar of Nevada, Inc., Maximus Exploration, LLC, Atwood
Acquisitions, LLC, Gastar Exploration Inc., J. Russell Porter, Michael A. Gerlich, Jerry R.
Schuyler, and John M. Selser, Sr.  In the lawsuit, we allege, among other things, that the
defendants acted improperly in connection with multiple transactions, and that the defendants
misrepresented and omitted material information to us with respect to these transactions.  The
lawsuit seeks damages arising from 15 different causes of action, including without limitation,
violations of the Texas Securities Act, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary
duty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment and tortious interference.  The lawsuit also seeks a
complete accounting as to how our investment funds were used, including all transfers between
and among the defendants.  We are seeking the full amount of our damages on $20,000,000
invested.  At this time we believe our damages to be in excess of $1,000,000, but the precise
amount will be determined in the litigation.

number of securities were issued to a limited number of purchasers; (iii) there were no public
solicitations; (iv) the investment intent of the purchasers; and (v) the restriction on transferability of
