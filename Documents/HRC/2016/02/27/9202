General Assembly (A/61/353) pursuant to resolution 60/158, which remain relevant. 
</p>
<p> The report highlights the need to protect and promote all human rights and effective 
counter-terrorism measures. These are two complementary and mutually reinforcing 
objectives which must be pursued together as part of States&#8217; duty to protect. It outlines the 
High Commissioner&#8217;s activities particularly in the context of the Secretary-General&#8217;s Global 
Strategy to counter terrorism. It also considers specific human rights concerns which arise in 
international cooperation while countering terrorism. It concludes with the identification of a 
number of practical challenges related to complying with human rights obligations in the context 
of counter-terrorism. </p>

</p>
<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. By its resolution 7/7 of 28 March 2008 on the protection and promotion of human rights 
while countering terrorism, the Human Rights Council requested the High Commissioner for 
Human Rights to &#8220;implement the mandate given to her by the Commission on Human Rights in 
its resolution 2005/80 and the General Assembly in its resolution 60/158&#8221;, and report to the 
Council. These two resolutions request the High Commissioner for Human Rights, making use 
of existing mechanisms, to continue: 
</p>
<p> (a) To examine the question of the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
while countering terrorism, taking into account reliable information from all sources; 
</p>
<p> (b) To make general recommendations concerning the obligation of States to promote 
and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms while taking actions to counter terrorism; 
and 
</p>
<p> (c) To provide assistance and advice to States, upon their request, on the protection of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, as well as to relevant 
United Nations bodies. 
</p>
<p>2. The present report is submitted in accordance with the Council resolution. 
</p>
<p>3. Terrorist acts are crimes, albeit of particularly serious nature. Preventive measures, 
investigation and prosecution of these crimes must be founded on the rule of law, and based 
on internationally recognized human rights principles. The achievement of these measures is 
central to the effective implementation of the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy adopted by the 
General Assembly at its sixtieth session.<b>1</b> The Strategy rightly situates human rights as the 
fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism and emphasizes that States must ensure that any 
measure taken to confront terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in 
particular human rights law. It reinforces that an effective counter-terrorism approach must 
combine preventive measures with efforts to address grievances and underlying social, 
economic, and political conditions. These conditions include, but are not limited to, 
prolonged unresolved conflicts, dehumanization of victims of terrorism, lack of rule of law and 
violations of human rights, ethnic, national and religious discrimination, political exclusion, 
socio-economic marginalization and lack of good governance, while recognizing that none of 
these conditions can excuse or justify acts of terrorism. It is necessary to address the long-term 
structural conditions that may give rise to terrorism. 
</p>
<p>4. It has now become clear that upholding human rights is not at odds with confronting 
terrorism; on the contrary, the moral vision of human rights coupled with the nature of legal 
obligations to uphold these rights foster deep respect for the dignity of each person. National 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, General Assembly resolution 60/288. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism strategies and international cooperation must include measures to prevent the 
spread of terrorism, and must also include measures to prevent ethnic, national or religious 
discrimination, political exclusion, and socio-economic marginalization, as well as measures to 
address impunity for human rights violations. 
</p>
<p>5. There is a broad recognition that not only is respect for human rights an essential element 
of an effective counter-terrorism strategy, but disrespect for human rights actually undermines 
counter-terrorism efforts. Terrorism often thrives in environments in which human rights are 
violated, where human rights are curtailed, where non-violent channels to express discontent are 
lacking and where discrimination and exclusion are rampant. In the same vein, resort to 
excessive use of force and indiscriminate attack by police, security and army personnel when 
seeking to combat terrorism tends to strengthen terrorists&#8217; support base, thus complicating the 
very goals that States set out to achieve. 
</p>
<p>6. The full impact of terrorism and counter-terrorism measures on the enjoyment of human 
rights, including economic, social and cultural rights has not been sufficiently clarified. I note 
with interest the report of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human 
rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism that was submitted to the Council,<b>2</b> 
but further examination and analyses of this complex issue is still needed. The impact of security 
measures taken to combat and prevent terrorism on resources normally allocated to social and 
economic programmes, development assistance and poverty reduction is also significant but not 
yet measured in detail. The particularly severe impact of repressive security measures on the 
economic, social and cultural rights of specific populations, such as women; human rights 
defenders; indigenous peoples and minorities and people living in situations of armed conflict 
has also taken on greater focus and warrants closer study. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Implementation of the Secretary-General&#8217;s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy </b></p>
<p>7. Through the Secretary-General&#8217;s Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, Member States 
committed to adopting measures to ensure respect for human rights for all and the rule of law as 
the fundamental basis of the fight against terrorism. They further resolved to take measures 
aimed at addressing the conditions conducive to the spread of terrorism, including lack of rule of 
law and violations of human rights, and to ensure that any measures taken to counter terrorism 
comply with their obligations under international law, in particular human rights law, refugee 
law and international humanitarian law. The General Assembly plans to review the Global 
Strategy by September 2008. 
</p>
<p>8. In July 2005, the Secretary-General established the Counter-Terrorism Implementation 
Task Force (CTITF) in an effort to ensure coordinated and coherent approach across the 
United Nations system to counter-terrorism. The CTITF formed a working group on &#8220;Protecting 
Human Rights While Countering Terrorism&#8221; led by OHCHR and comprised of the 
Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights while countering terrorism, 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>2
</b>  See A/HRC/6/17. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Counter-Terrorism Committee 
Executive Directorate (CTED), the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs (OLA), the 
United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI), the World Bank, 
and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). The aim of the working group is to support 
efforts by Member States to ensure the promotion and protection of human rights in the context 
of counter-terrorism, including through the development and implementation of human 
rights-compliant legislation and policies. 
</p>
<p>9. The Strategy and Plan of Action gave OHCHR a lead role in examining the question of 
protecting human rights while countering terrorism. In this context, my Office is developing a 
number of tools on countering terrorism with full respect for human rights. The tools aim at 
assisting practitioners; providing technical assistance to Member States, upon their request, in 
developing human rights-compliant counter-terrorism legislation and policies; and supporting 
relevant United Nations mechanisms. As part of this effort a fact sheet on &#8220;Human Rights, 
Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism&#8221; was finalized in April 2008. It is addressed to State 
authorities, national and international non-governmental organizations, national human rights 
institutions, legal practitioners and other individuals concerned with ensuring the protection and 
promotion of human rights in the context of terrorism and counter-terrorism. My Office is also in 
the process of updating the Digest of Jurisprudence of the United Nations and Regional 
Organizations on the Protection of Human Rights while Countering Terrorism, which was first 
published in 2003. OHCHR is also cooperating with UNODC on developing tools in the criminal 
justice system related to countering terrorism that are compatible with human rights laws. 
</p><p>10. Several workshops hosted by Member States were organized during 2007 and 2008 to 
consider action by Member States regarding the implementation of the Global Strategy. The 
workshops aimed at assessing the overall contributions of the United Nations to the fight against 
terrorism and to identify ways to make its institutions more relevant to national counter-terrorism 
strategies and better able to support implementation of the Strategy. The meetings involved, in 
particular, experts from Governments, relevant United Nations bodies and other multilateral 
bodies from different regions, as well as academic and research institutions. My Office 
participated in these efforts to ensure that human rights issues remain at the centre of 
implementation of the Strategy. 
</p>
<p>11. During these workshops, it was considered that one of the Strategy&#8217;s achievements was its 
prioritization of the respect for human rights and the rule of law and their integration into all 
pillars of its implementation. The challenge for both the United Nations system and 
Member States is to ensure that this human rights-based approach is reflected in all Strategy 
implementation efforts, rather than remaining simply of rhetorical value. It was recognized that 
while the United Nations has a role to play, Member States have the primary responsibility in 
this area. There was also recognition that progress has been made since 2002 in ensuring respect 
for human rights in the fight against terrorism, but that more work remains to be done. The 
workshops also assessed the United Nations engagement with regional, subregional and 
functional bodies and civil society in implementing the Strategy, and the role that these 
stakeholders can play in furthering the implementation of the Strategy and what steps the 
United Nations, in particular its CTITF, might take to stimulate this engagement. They also 
discussed the role of the United Nations in promoting and strengthening the rule of law and good</p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>governance in the context of implementing the strategy. Efforts were also made with regard to 
the exchange of knowledge, experiences and techniques on countering challenges from terrorism 
through building national capacities. I welcome all efforts to ensure knowledge and 
commitments to the values incorporated in the Global Strategy. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  The work of the Security Council&#8217;s Counter-Terrorism Committee 
</b></p>
<p>12. In May 2006, the Counter Terrorism Committee (CTC) adopted a policy guidance note on 
how its Counter Terrorism Executive Directorate (CTED) can address human rights. The 
guidance note provides that when analysing States&#8217; implementation of Security Council 
resolution 1373 (2001), preparing draft letters to States, providing recommendations and 
organizing visits, CTED should provide advice to the CTC, including for its ongoing dialogue 
with States, on international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, in connection with 
identification and implementation of effective measures to implement resolution 1373.<b>3</b> It also 
provides that CTED should advise the CTC on how to ensure that any measures States take to 
implement the provisions of Security Council resolution 1624 (2005) comply with their legal 
human rights obligations. It requests the CTC and the CTED to liaise with my Office and other 
human rights organizations in matters related to counter-terrorism. The CTED, under the 
direction of the Committee, should incorporate human rights into their communications strategy. 
This policy note fed into the appointment of a Human Rights Adviser in CTED, which is an 
important development. OHCHR is cooperating with CTC and CTED through the work of this 
Adviser and I attach particular importance for the need to enhance the work of human rights with 
CTED. 
</p>
<p>13. The Security Council renewed CTED&#8217;s mandate by resolution 1805 on 20 March 2008. 
The resolution again reminded States that they must ensure that any counter-terrorism measures 
comply with their international law obligations, including human rights. It also recalled that 
&#8220;CTED should continue in accordance with its mandate, to advise the CTC on issues relating to 
such law in connection with the identification and implementation of effective measures to 
implement resolutions 1373 (2001) and 1624 (2005)&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>14. The CTC conducted its fifth special meeting with international, regional and subregional 
organizations on the &#8220;Prevention of Terrorist Movement and Effective Border Security&#8221; in 
Nairobi from 29-31 October 2007 with the support of the CTED. The meeting focused on States&#8217; 
obligations under relevant Security Council resolutions to take measures related to border 
security, the restriction of the international movement of terrorists and individuals suspected of 
terrorist acts, as well as measures linked to the provision of asylum and migration. During the 
meeting, OHCHR outlined the human rights perspective of these issues, particularly in the 
context of ensuring border security, and the treatment and the screening of individuals when 
crossing an internationally-recognized State border.

</p>
<p>implementation of resolution 1624 (2005), Chap. VII, paras. 27-32, on the compliance with 
obligations under international law. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>C.  The work of the United Nations human rights mechanisms 
</b></p>
<p>15. The United Nations human rights treaty bodies have continued to take up issues related to 
terrorism in their examinations of State party reports and individual complaints. In their 
concluding observations, different committees have urged States parties to recognize and ensure 
that the human rights treaties apply at all times, whether in peace, war or armed conflict, in any 
territory under their jurisdiction. The Human Rights Committee, in its consideration of some 
States&#8217; periodic reports, expressed concerns regarding the potentially overbroad reach of the 
definitions of terrorism under domestic law; the practice by some States parties of detaining 
people secretly and in secret places for months and years, as well as holding individuals. They 
also raised allegations of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in 
detention facilities in different locations; and of ill-treatment or poor conditions of detention in 
addition to issues of profiling and discrimination. Other serious concerns included the practice 
by some States parties of sending, or assisting in the sending of, suspected terrorists to third 
countries, for purposes of detention and interrogation, without the appropriate safeguards to 
prevent treatment in violations to human rights treaties. 
</p>
<p>16. The issue of respect for human rights while countering terrorism was also raised during the 
examination of country reports at the first session of the Human Rights Council&#8217;s Working 
Group on the Universal Periodic Review in April 2008.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>D.  Other developments 
</b></p>
<p>17. On 14-18 April 2008, a meeting was organized in South Africa by the Inter-Parliamentary 
Union, in the context of its 118th Assembly. The meeting focused on three areas of human 
rights: security in the context of countering terrorism, xenophobia and trafficking in persons. The 
meeting was attended by the Regional Representative for Southern Africa on behalf of OHCHR. 
Background documents on human rights, terrorism and counter-terrorism were provided to it for 
background and guidance. 
</p>
<p><b>II.  CERTAIN ISSUES OF CONCERN 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  National legislation:  legality and definition 
</b></p>
<p>18. Terrorism is not a new phenomenon. It has been on the international agenda since 1934, 
when the League of Nations took the first major step towards outlawing this scourge by 
discussing a draft convention for the prevention and punishment of terrorism. Although the 
Convention was eventually adopted in 1937, it never came into force. Since 1963, the 
international community has elaborated no fewer than 13 universal legal instruments to prevent 
terrorist acts. Currently Member States are negotiating a fourteenth international treaty, a draft 
comprehensive convention on international terrorism. This keystone convention would 
complement the existing framework of international anti-terrorism instruments and would build 
on key guiding principles already present in recent anti-terrorist conventions. It focuses on the 
importance of criminalization of terrorist offences, making them punishable by law and calling 
for prosecution or extradition of the perpetrators. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. Most countries have ratified the international human rights treaties as well as anti-terrorism 
conventions. Obligations arising from these conventions reinforce and complement each other 
when properly read together. In particular, the principle of legality, that is, sufficient clarity and 
certainty of law, is a non-derogable human rights principle and has been interpreted by the 
Human Rights Committee from article 15 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political 
Rights (ICCPR). States must observe this principle when drafting anti-terrorism laws and/or 
amending existing legislations. 
</p>
<p>20. However, many States have adopted national legislations with vague, unclear or overbroad 
definitions of terrorism. These ambiguous definitions have led to inappropriate restrictions on the 
legitimate exercise of fundamental liberties, such as association, expression and peaceful 
political and social opposition. 
</p>
<p>21. The principle of legality is one of the non-derogable principles of human rights and is 
embodied in article 15 of ICCPR. It states that &#8220;No one shall be held guilty of any criminal 
offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under 
national or international law, at the time when it was committed&#8221;. States must be guided by this 
principle when drafting anti-terrorism laws and/or amending existing legislations. 
</p>
<p>22. Some States have included non-violent activities in their national definitions of terrorism. 
This has increased the risk and the practice that individuals are prosecuted for legitimate, 
non-violent exercise of rights enshrined in international law, or that criminal conduct that does 
not constitute &#8220;terrorism&#8221; may be criminalized as such. 
</p>
<p>23. Defining crimes with insufficient precision can also lead to an inappropriate broadening of 
the proscribed conduct by means of judicial interpretation. There are several examples of hastily 
adopted counter-terrorism laws which introduced definitions that lacked in precision and 
appeared to contravene the principle of legality. Particular care must be taken, for instance, in 
defining offences relating to the support that can be offered to terrorist organizations or offences 
purporting to prevent the financing of terrorist activities in order to ensure that various 
non-violent conducts are not inadvertently criminalized by vague formulations of the offences in 
question. In previous reports, I have warned against counter-terrorism measures that themselves 
amount to human rights violations, notably measures that have adverse impact on particular 
groups such as human rights defenders, migrants, asylum-seekers and refugees, religious and 
ethnic minorities, political activists and the media.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Information, evidence sharing and the right to privacy 
</b></p>
<p>24. Intelligence-led policing has become a synonym for modern and effective policing. The 
acquisition, development and use of information about terrorist groups and their activities are 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>4
</b>  The Human Rights Committee has stressed that legislation enacted pursuant to Security 
</p>
<p>Council resolution 1373 must be in conformity with the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights. See CCPR/CO/77/EST, para. 8, CCPR/CO/75/NZL, para. 11, 
CCPR/CO/76/EGY, para. 16, CCPR/CO/75/MDA, para. 8, CCPR/CO/75/YEM, para. 18, 
CCPR/CO/73/UK, para. 6, CCPR/CO/83/UZB, para. 18, CCPR/C/NOR/CO/5, para. 9. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>absolutely necessary in order to prevent terrorist acts. Intelligence-gathering activities, in 
particular covert surveillance activities, must be regulated by law, monitored as much as possible 
by independent agencies, and subject to appropriate judicial review. Under international human 
rights law, any act which impacts upon a person&#8217;s privacy must be lawful; it must be prescribed 
and regulated by law. This means that any search, surveillance activity, or data collection about a 
person must be clearly authorized by law. The extent to which this is allowed to occur must not 
be arbitrary or left to discretionary authority. The law authorizing interference with privacy must 
specify in detail the precise circumstances in which the interference is to be permitted, and must 
not be implemented in a discriminatory manner. 
</p>
<p>25. All measures taken by law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism must be lawful, both 
under national and international law. Recent counter-terrorist strategies have often included 
efforts to collect, analyse and use information about large numbers of individuals. In recent 
years, many States have significantly expanded the surveillance powers and capacity of their law 
enforcement agencies. These practices all have the potential seriously to limit the privacy of the 
individuals concerned. Those measures also raise questions about how the data thus collected are 
to be protected, stored, and, when necessary, shared with other agencies of the same Government 
or indeed other jurisdictions. When personal information is collected, it must be protected 
against unlawful or arbitrary access, disclosure, or use. 
</p>
<p>26. Human rights concerns which may arise during the course of information gathering or 
evidence sharing include the impact of the sources of intelligence information on its 
admissibility as evidence; differences in the definition of the elements of terrorist crimes 
between jurisdictions, as well as &#8220;dual criminality&#8221; and legality concerns; the procedures for 
gathering evidence, in particular where interrogation of witnesses or suspects is coercive, 
involving torture or cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; the rules relating to the use of 
confession evidence, particularly where the confession was obtained under duress; appropriate 
access to classified and secret information by the accused and his or her defence; unlawful 
interferences with privacy with respect to interception, search and seizure, surveillance; 
protection of witnesses as sources of such evidence; questions related to the appropriate burdens 
of proof in legal proceedings; and the overarching right to an effective remedy for violation of 
human rights in the context of evidence-gathering and information-sharing. 
</p>
<p>27. I appreciate that techniques such as electronic surveillance, undercover operations and 
controlled deliveries may be effective in preventing and combating terrorist acts. However, 
domestic arrangements and legislation relating to these techniques must be reviewed to reflect 
technological developments, taking full account of any human rights implications and the need 
to facilitate international cooperation. New technological developments and modern methods of 
investigation have created new concerns with respect to the legitimacy in human rights terms of 
certain methods and the protection of the rights of the individuals involved in the course of an 
investigation conducted further thereto. The police, prosecutors and the courts have a duty to 
ensure that these methods are used lawfully and in accordance with applicable human rights 
standards. 
</p>
<p>28. The sharing of information and intelligence between States has raised concerns for national 
prosecutors and courts. There are notably questions around the admissibility of evidence 
collected in other States through methods that would not necessarily be acceptable in their own 
State, as well as the use of evidence obtained by officials in another State in violation of the law </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>of that latter State. The verification of the legitimacy of evidence obtained as a result of 
international police cooperation is certainly not without its procedural and practical difficulties, 
and needs to be carefully addressed. 
</p>
<p>29. Issues regarding information gathering and surveillance are closely linked to the right to 
privacy which is protected under article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
article 17 of the ICCPR which protects against the arbitrary or unlawful interference with 
privacy, family, home, or correspondence. The Human Rights Committee has elaborated on the 
meaning of arbitrary and unlawful interference with one&#8217;s privacy, family, home or 
correspondence: The term &#8220;unlawful&#8221; means that no interference can take place except in cases 
envisaged by the law. Interference authorized by States can only take place on the basis of law, 
which itself must comply with the provisions, aims and objectives of the Covenant. The 
expression &#8220;arbitrary interference&#8221; is also relevant to the protection of the right provided for in 
article 17. In the Committee&#8217;s view, the expression &#8220;arbitrary interference&#8221; can also extend to 
interference provided for under the law.<b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>30. There are a number of ways in which Governments, whether inadvertently or not, interfere 
with the right to privacy in the context of terrorism. New investigation techniques have been 
implemented to fight new threats, such as data mining, DNA tests, collecting fingerprints, 
telephone tapping, tracking devices, collection and systematic retention of private information, 
closed circuit television (CCTV) schemes, ID verification, monitoring of Internet activity, and 
interception of communications. Each of these pose their own challenges. 
</p>
<p>31. Legal safeguards should be established concerning the supervision of the relevant 
authorities granted secret surveillance powers, to ensure that they are in reality as well as in law 
subject to adequate control by judicial authorities as well as other oversight bodies. Parliaments 
should exercise oversight over security agencies to enforce their accountability, including in 
respect of surveillance and data collection, consistent with the values of a democratic society. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman and  
degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p>32. Despite the absolute prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or 
punishment, many States continue to engage in these illegal practices in the name of the fight 
against terrorism, and often in a systematic and widespread manner. Some States have also 
continued to be engaged in the practice of seeking diplomatic assurances to ensure that torture 
and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment will not be inflicted on an 
individual suspect who is transferred to a receiving State. As I have reiterated on several 
occasions, in my view diplomatic assurances per se do not work as they do not provide adequate 
protection against torture and ill-treatment, nor do they nullify the obligation of non-refoulement 
</p>

</p>
<p>which continues to apply at all times. Some States continue to use diplomatic assurances, 
memoranda of understanding, and other forms of diplomatic agreement to justify the return or 
irregular transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activity to countries where despite such 
assurances they face a real risk of torture or other serious human rights abuse, a practice which 
raises a number of serious concerns both as a matter of human rights law and policy. 
</p>
<p>33. A restrictive approach to the use of these assurances has recently been confirmed in 
regional human rights jurisprudence. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in<i> Saadi v. 
Italy<b></b></i><b>6</b> and<i> Ismoilov v. Russia</i> reaffirmed that the ban on deporting individuals to countries where 
they are at risk of torture or ill-treatment is absolute and unconditional. The judgement also 
addressed whether a State&#8217;s duty not to deport where there is a risk of torture or ill-treatment can 
be mitigated by promises of humane treatment from the State to which the individual is to be 
deported. The court held that such assurances do not automatically offset an existing risk, 
emphasizing &#8220;that the existence of domestic laws and accession to treaties were not sufficient to 
ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment&#8221;. Applying this principle in practice, 
the Court has never found assurances capable of displacing the risk of torture. National courts 
have also played a more assertive approach in critically examining such assurances.<b>7</b> 
</p>
<p>34. In my view, national and international efforts to eradicate torture must focus first and 
foremost on prevention, including through the establishment of systems of regular visits, by 
independent international and national bodies, of places where people are deprived of their 
liberty. The Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture sets out clear criteria in this 
regard. I encourage all States that have not ratified the Optional Protocol to do so as soon as 
possible to provide for enhanced system of prevention and as a sign of their good faith in this 
area. 
</p>
<p>35. The Venice Commission rendered its opinion 363/2005 on 17 March 2006 and dealt with 
the issue of rendition. In this Opinion, the Commission acknowledged that as movement around 
the world becomes easier and crime takes on a larger international dimension, it is increasingly 
in the interest of all nations that terrorist crimes be prevented and that persons who are suspected 
of having committed a very serious crime and are suspected to have acted from abroad or who 
have fled abroad should be brought to justice. In this context, the Commission specified that 
under international law and human rights law, there are four situations in which a State may 
lawfully transfer a prisoner to another State: deportation, extradition, transit and transfer of 
sentenced persons for the purposes of serving their sentence in another country. The Commission 
examined each of these categories citing the relevant international law principles involved. The 
Commission considered that the transfer of an individual which takes place outside the rule of

the receiving countries. SIAC blocked the transfers despite &#8220;memorandums of understanding&#8221; 
from the two Governments that promised that suspects would not be tortured and would receive 
fair trials upon return. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>law and without due process may lead to a number of human rights violations, notably 
infringements of the right to liberty and security of the person, the prohibition of torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment, the right to recognition everywhere 
as an individual before the law, the right to a fair trial, the right to private and family life, and the 
right to an effective remedy. Depending on the circumstances, it may amount to an enforced 
disappearance. 
</p>
<p>36. In my previous reports, I have also expressed my concern about the use of unlawful 
rendition or transfers across borders of suspected terrorists who are considered to pose a security 
risk without judicial oversight and review prior to transfer. States should as a minimum satisfy 
their positive obligations under the different treaties and standards and ensure that they are not 
complicit in the practice of rendition through adopting a number of practical procedures. States 
have an obligation to investigate the role of its agents (both military and intelligence) who may 
have been involved in directly or indirectly assisting or facilitating these renditions. This requires 
the State to sanction those that are responsible and provide reparation for the victims.  
</p>
<p>37. Concerns raised in recent years regarding improper transfers of terrorist suspects, including 
so-called renditions, have not been fully addressed; indeed, appropriately transparent 
investigations remain a priority. In my view, a more comprehensive legal system of control 
should be put in to prevent the improper and illegal use of air traffic which would be an 
important way to put an end to such transfers. States have a responsibility to ensure that their 
airspace is not used unlawfully, be it by their own agents, foreign agents, or a combination of 
both. Assurances by transferring States that there will be compliance with international and 
national laws have been shown, in reality, not to offer sufficient guarantees in this respect. As a 
result, more rigorous approaches should be put in place in order to ensure there is no impunity on 
this question.<b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>38. It is axiomatic in theory, but too often neglected in practice, that detainees suspected of 
terrorist acts and prisoners should benefit from all safeguards and guarantees given to other 
detainees or prisoners. They should be dealt with, without discrimination, in accordance with 
international human rights laws and national legislations that guarantee humane treatment.  
</p>
<p>39. The International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced 
Disappearance provides that no one should be subjected to enforced disappearance and that each 
State party should take appropriate measures to ensure that enforced disappearance constitutes an 
offence under its criminal law. Incommunicado detention and over-incarceration, &#8220;extraordinary 
rendition&#8221; and the use of secret prisons in the context of any type of counter-terrorist campaign 
whether a threat of war, a state of war, internal political instability or any other public 
emergency, cannot be invoked to justify enforced disappearances. The Convention affirms the 
right of any victim to know the truth about the circumstances of an enforced disappearance, and 
the fate of the disappeared person, and the right to freedom to seek, receive and impart 
information. States parties should take specific and effective measures to prevent the 
disappearance of individuals and establish facilities and procedures to investigate thoroughly, by

which may involve a violation of the right to life. I again call on all States to adhere to this 
important new treaty, as a sign of their good faith and commitment to the most basic principles 
of the rule of law.  
</p>
<p><b>4.  Fair trial 
</b></p>
<p>40. It has been argued by some that existing safeguards associated with the right to fair trial in 
prosecuting terrorist crimes are inappropriate to ensure that the guilty are convicted, and that 
special courts with special procedures can be more suitable instead. I fundamentally disagree 
with such an argument, which insufficiently recognizes the ultimately criminal character of 
terrorist acts. Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 14 of the 
ICCPR, which both aim at ensuring the proper administration of justice, set out the bedrock 
norms applicable in all trials, whether of alleged terrorists or otherwise. State should ensure that 
all guarantees of due process are respected when arresting, charging and prosecuting a suspect of 
terrorism-related crime. They should benefit from the usual series of specific due process rights, 
including that all persons should be equal before the courts and tribunals; that in criminal or civil 
cases everyone has a right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial 
tribunal; that everyone charged with a criminal offence should have the right to be presumed 
innocent until proved guilty according to law; and that everyone convicted of a crime should 
have the right for his conviction and sentence to be reviewed by a higher tribunal according to 
law. 
</p>
<p>41. The Human Rights Committee has recently adopted its revised general comment 32 on the 
right to a fair trial and equality before the courts and tribunals, providing important fresh 
guidance in this area. The general comment re-emphasizes that the right to a fair trial and to 
equality before the courts and tribunals are key elements of human rights protection and serve by 
procedural means to safeguard the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>42. The use of exceptional courts to try civilians has impacted upon the effectiveness of 
regular court systems and often has seriously prejudicial impacts on due process and 
non-discrimination rights, depending upon the nature of the tribunal or court and any restrictions 
placed upon a person facing charges before such a tribunal. Guaranteeing the rights of terrorist 
suspects to a fair trial is critical for ensuring that anti-terrorism measures respect the rule of law 
and that such measures are seen to be fair. In particular, the circumstances are rare that a military 
court will be the appropriate venue to try a civilian. 
</p>
<p>43. Indefinite, secret and incommunicado detention of terrorist suspects without adequate 
access to courts and due process continues to be of grave concern. Where any individual is 
detained - regardless of the context - appropriate due process, judicial review and recognition 
before the law - are essential. Incommunicado or secret detention is a violation of States&#8217; legal 
obligation under article 7 of ICCPR.<b>9</b>   
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>9
</b>  General comment No. 20 (1992) of the Human Rights Committee. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>44. The practice of detaining terrorist suspects in secret detentions results in numerous human 
rights violations. Obviously the right to fair trial will be violated. The acknowledgement of the 
existence of some places of secret detention shows that this type of detention has prevented those 
detainees from practising their right to be heard and brought before independent courts. 
Therefore, safeguards must also be put in place to ensure that these practices do not recur, that 
governments do not act outside the law and do not by-pass the judicial process. States may also 
be held responsible when their agents have acted ultra vires their formal powers. In addition, 
where such violations have taken place, States have a duty to undertake prompt and effective 
investigations to identify and prosecute those responsible for the violation, as well as ensure that 
the victims are adequately compensated. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Sanctions issues:  listing and delisting; asset-freezing and confiscation 
</b></p>
<p>45. The absence of human rights guarantees to the current international regime of targeted 
sanctions against individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity could infringe their 
right to property, right to be heard and right to effective judicial review, as has been increasingly 
recognized by a number of regional and national courts. This poses serious human rights issues. 
More effort continues to be needed to ensure a listing process which is transparent, based on 
clear criteria, and with an appropriate, explicit, and uniformly applied standard of evidence, as 
well as effective, accessible and independent review. Recent improvements to the 
United Nations sanctions procedures are a first, partial step towards ensuring fair and clear 
procedures for placement on and removal from sanctions lists, but comprehensive reform 
continues to be urgently required. 
</p>
<p>46. In the 2005 World Summit outcome document, Member States called upon the 
Security Council, with the support of the Secretary-General, to improve its monitoring of the 
implementation and effects of sanctions, to ensure that sanctions are implemented in an 
accountable manner, to review regularly the results of such monitoring and to develop a 
mechanism to address special economic problems arising from the application of sanctions in 
accordance with the Charter. They also called upon the Security Council, with the support of the 
Secretary-General, to ensure that fair and clear procedures exist for placing individuals and 
entities on sanctions lists and for removing them, as well as for granting humanitarian 
exemptions.<b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>47. The main human rights concerns regarding sanctions fall under respect for due process 
rights, notably the standards of proof and evidence in the listing procedures, the denial of a fair 
hearing, and the lack of consideration to remedies available to individuals whose human rights 
have been violated in the sanctions process. Individuals have a right to know an appropriate 
factual basis and reasons behind a listing decision, as well as the procedures available for 
challenging a decision. Open-ended periods of applicable sanctions, notably in respect of 
freezing the assets of suspects, have a direct punitive impact and readily threaten to go well 
beyond

 <p> 
</p>
<p>the purpose of the United Nations to combat the terrorist threat posed by an individual case. 
There instead needs to be regular, comprehensive review of the situation of those subjected to 
such sanctions.  
</p>
<p>48. Legal procedures are necessary to ensure that fair and clear procedures exist for placing 
individuals and entities on sanctions lists and removing them, as well as for granting 
humanitarian exemptions. In short, respect for due process rights must be guaranteed. 
International procedures under the authority of the Security Council level and at the domestic 
level should sensibly compliment each other in scope and protection. In my view, it is key that 
Parliaments debate how internationally binding obligations in this area properly transpose into 
domestic law. But at all levels, fair and clear procedures include the right of an individual to be 
informed of the measures taken and to know the case against him or her; the right of such a 
person to be heard within a reasonable time by the relevant decision-making body; the right to 
effective review by a competent, independent review mechanism; the right of such a person to 
representation with respect to all proceedings; and the right of such a person to an effective 
remedy. My Office has collaborated with the Office of Legal Affairs and the Department of 
Political Affairs in a process to &#8220;ensure that fair and clear procedures exist for placing 
individuals and entities on sanctions lists and removing them, as well as for granting 
humanitarian exemptions&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>49. Some improvements have been made recently to the procedures related to the 
United Nations targeted sanctions regime. While at present, there is no legal mechanism for 
reviewing the accuracy of the information behind a sanctions committee listing or the necessity 
for and proportionality of sanctions adopted, nor does the individual affected have a right of 
access to a review body at the international level. The only recourse for review of individuals 
and entities that may be wrongly listed, for example, is for the individual or entity to approach 
the Security Council through their State of nationality or residence. Member States are 
responsible for informing their nationals that they have been listed, but often this does not 
happen. Individuals have a right to know the reasons behind a listing decision, as well as the 
procedures available for challenging a decision. 
</p>
<p>50. Individual listings normally do not include an &#8220;end date&#8221; to the listing, which may result in 
a temporary freeze of assets becoming permanent. While targeted sanctions against individuals 
clearly have a punitive character, there is no uniformity in relation to evidentiary standards and 
procedures. The longer an individual is on a list, the more punitive the effect will be. States only 
have standing in the current sanctions regime, which assumes that the State will act on behalf of 
the individual. In practice, often this does not happen and individuals are effectively excluded 
from a process which may have a direct punitive impact on them. 
</p>
<p>51. Beyond procedural improvements in the listing process, there is a need for some form of 
appropriate review mechanism to which individuals and entities may appeal decisions regarding 
their listing. A review mechanism under the authority of the Security Council for consideration 
of delisting proposals should be established. An independent panel to consider delisting 
proposals with a judicial review of delisting decisions. All of these proposals should be taken 
into account in comprehensively addressing the human rights issues raised by asset freezing. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>6.  Victims 
</b></p>
<p>52. Victims of terrorism and their families have the right to an effective remedy when their 
rights have been violated in relation to terrorist acts. This legal right has also been recognized at 
the political level. In the 2005 World Summit Outcome, for example, Member States stressed 
&#8220;the importance of assisting victims of terrorism and of providing them and their families with 
support to cope with their loss and their grief&#8221;. Similarly, the United Nations Global 
Counter-Terrorism Strategy reflects the pledge by Member States to &#8220;promote international 
solidarity in support of victims and foster the involvement of civil society in a global campaign 
against terrorism and for its condemnation&#8221;.  
</p>
<p>53. Every State has a duty to provide reparation in case of a breach of the obligation under 
international law to respect and to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
This obligation includes, inter alia, the duty to afford remedies to victims. The purpose of 
reparation should be for relieving the suffering of and affording justice to victims by removing or 
redressing to the extent possible the consequences of the wrongful acts and by preventing and 
deterring violations. 
</p>
<p>54. According to the Declaration on Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and 
Abuse of Power, set out in General Assembly resolution 40/34 of 29 November 1985, victims 
include &#8220;persons who, individually or collectively, have suffered harm, including physical or 
mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial impairment of their fundamental 
rights, through acts or omissions that are in violation of criminal laws operative within Member 
States, including those laws proscribing criminal abuse of power&#8221;. Importantly, the Declaration 
notes that an individual may be considered a victim &#8220;regardless of whether the perpetrator is 
identified, apprehended, prosecuted or convicted and regardless of the familial relationship 
between the perpetrator and the victim&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>55. As a result of frequent shortcomings in domestic jurisdictions for victims of terrorist acts, 
guidelines should be adopted to address issues of appropriate access to remedies in criminal and 
civil proceedings. It is best practice for victims&#8217; interests to be represented by legal counsel 
during criminal proceedings, which should be available and accessible regardless of the income 
or resources of victims and families. It may also be inappropriate and unfair to condition 
compensation on victims&#8217; ability to obtain reparations from perpetrators or their estates. It is 
preferable for victims of terrorism to have the option to benefit from State-administered 
compensation and assistance schemes. The assistance could be financial, psychological, medical 
or in any other form that the victims wishes, and that such assistance should be long-term. A 
number of elements can be explored in addressing the rights of victims. These include urgent 
assistance for the material and psychiatric needs of victims, long-term assistance including 
medical and psychological follow-up; the definition of a status for victims; respect for privacy 
and family life of victims; effective access to justice for victims and the need to ensure that 
evidentiary privileges are not an obstacle to transparency in the conduct of investigations and 
access to legal remedies; the role of victims and victims&#8217; associations in criminal justice; with 
regard to reparations, the need to ensure equality and non-discrimination among victims; and the 
right to justice and to truth. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. In the same vein as the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and 
Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious 
Violations of International Humanitarian Law (General Assembly resolution 60/147), and the 
Principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity 
(E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/20/Rev.1 and E/CN.4/2005/102/Add.1), the elaboration of a statement of 
human rights principles and guidelines drawing on national and international best practice that 
would comprehensively address the victims of terrorism is both appropriate and deserving of 
serious consideration.   
</p>
<p><b>III.  CONCLUSIONS 
</b></p>
<p>57. <b>I recall again the importance of placing human rights at the core of international 
cooperation in counter-terrorism and the obligation of all States to ensure that measures 
taken to combat crimes of terrorism comply with their obligations under international 
human rights law, in particular the right to recognition as a person before the law, due 
process, and non-refoulement. Compliance with international human rights standards is 
essential, never more so than where counter-terrorism measures involve the deprivation of 
individual liberty.  
</b></p>
<p>58. <b>I am concerned with the practical obstacles to truly effective international and 
judicial cooperation in counter-terrorism which arise from unlawful interferences with 
privacy, search, seizure and surveillance; the insufficient remedies for violation of human 
rights in the context of evidence-gathering and information-sharing; the transfer and/or 
admissibility of evidence gathered by unlawful means; insufficient respect for the principle 
of legality in relation to the definition of terrorist offences; the protection of witnesses; and 
inappropriate redistributions of burdens of proof in particular legal proceedings in this 
area. My Office will continue to reflect on these issues with a view to assisting States in 
strengthening the effectiveness of mutual legal assistance, respect for human rights and 
upholding the rule of law in effectively countering terrorism.  
</b></p>
<p>59. <b>I encourage all States that have not ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention 
against Torture and the Disappearances Convention to do so. That said, ratification itself 
will not have full meaning unless it is accompanied by the compliance of national legislation 
with international human rights standards, the regular submission of periodic reports to 
the respective monitoring bodies and the implementation, at the national level, of their 
recommendations. Only through this way, can it be evenly guaranteed that all measures 
will comply with human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>60. <b>Targeted sanctions such as asset freezing and travel bans may be useful tools in 
States&#8217; efforts to combat terrorism and might be helpful in preventing terrorist activity, 
but such procedures must be improved fully to meet human rights standards.  
</b></p>
<p>61. <b>States should increase awareness and support for victims of terrorism, by pointing to 
the importance of the work that is required in order to give victims a voice that can help to 
humanize them and provide an important counterpoint to a narrative of hate and violence.  </b></p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>62. <b>States should cooperate openly and without reservation with the special procedures of 
the Human Rights Council in this area. In the sphere of the Global Counter-Terrorism 
Strategy, I encourage all States to issue a standing invitation to all special procedures of the 
Human Rights Council, in particular to the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism.  
</b></p>
<p>63. <b>Finally, States should strengthen the national capacities of their human rights 
institutions; provide training to their law enforcement authorities - including intelligence, 
customs and immigration services - on international human rights laws and standards, 
with proper remedies to ensure accountability. Failure by States to safeguard human rights 
in this area will lead directly toward increased instability and decreased legitimacy of 
Governments, to polarization in and between societies and to increasing radicalization.
