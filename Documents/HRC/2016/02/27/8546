<p><b>  Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1, held its ninth session from 1 to 12 November 
</p><p>2010.  The review of Maldives was held at the 5th meeting, on 3 November 2010. The 
delegation of Maldives was headed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Excellency Dr. 
Ahmed Shaeed. At its meeting, held on 5 November 2010, the Working Group adopted the 
report on Maldives. 
</p>
<p>2. On 21 June 2010, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Maldives: Ecuador, Ghana and Jordan. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of the annex to resolution 5/1, the following 
documents were issued for the review of Maldives: 
</p>
<p> (a) A national report submitted/written presentation made in accordance with 
paragraph 15 (a) (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MDV/1); 
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MDV/2) and a corrigendum (A/HRC/WG.6/9/MDV/2/Corr.1); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR in accordance with paragraph 15 (c) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/9/MDV/3).  
</p>
<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, 
the Netherlands, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Northern Ireland was transmitted to Maldives through the troika. Those questions are 
available on the extranet of the universal periodic review. 
</p>
<p><b>I. Summary of the proceedings of the review process 
</b></p>
<p>5. During the interactive dialogue, statements were made by 49 delegations. A number 
of delegations commended Maldives for the self-critical approach taken in its national 
report and presentation, and noted the broad consultation process with stakeholders, 
including civil society organizations, in the preparation of the national report. Several 
delegations also noted with appreciation the country&#8217;s transition to democracy and the 
holding of elections and the enactment of a new Constitution in 2008. Recommendations 
made during the interactive dialogue are listed in chapter II of the present report. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>6. Maldives acknowledged the great value of the universal periodic review process, 
which provided an opportunity for a small nation of 350,000 people to listen to the views of 
other States and to be guided by them. It stated that both the Human Rights Commission of 
Maldives and non-governmental organizations had played key roles in helping the 
Government to prepare the national report.  
</p>
<p>7. Maldives had its first-ever democratically elected Government, sworn in after a 
peaceful ballot and an orderly transfer of power. Maldives had a new Constitution, which 
guaranteed full enjoyment of human rights for all. There was effective separation of powers 
among the executive, legislative and judicial branches, and there were independent courts, 
political parties, a free press, registered human rights non-governmental organizations, and 
the National Human Rights Commission. </p>


<p>8. Maldives was a member of the Human Rights Council, was party to nearly all 
conventions and most optional protocols, and had welcomed visits by four special 
procedures mandate holders and extended a standing invitation to all others to visit. 
</p>
<p>9. In terms of challenges, Maldives could avoid or ignore the fact that serious human 
rights abuses had taken place over recent decades. The victims required a sense of justice 
and closure, and society demanded accountability. However, Maldives also could not allow 
sentiments of revenge to take hold and put at risk its still-fragile democratic transition. 
</p>
<p>10. The vast majority of the human rights now legally guaranteed in Maldives were new 
to Maldivians, and fully understanding them and exercising them responsibly would take 
time. This was the case for the general public, but also for the political class. The once all-
powerful executive was now balanced with a far stronger Parliament and a newly 
independent judiciary. 
</p>
<p>11. Maldives faced major challenges in promoting the rule of law and good governance. 
Corruption, in particular, remained a huge problem, with far-reaching consequences for the 
full enjoyment of human rights in the country. Unfortunately, Maldives, as a new 
democracy, currently lacked the institutions to effectively tackle such problems. 
</p>
<p>12. Maldives was a proud, 100 per cent Muslim nation. Islam was central to its history, 
culture and national identity. Maldives saw no conflict between a strong Islamic faith and 
its commitment to international human rights law. Unfortunately, certain interpretations of 
Islam pushed in Maldives and internationally, sought to create the impression that there was 
an inherent tension between Islam and human rights. 
</p>
<p>13. Although it was a traditionally moderate Muslim nation, Maldives had not escaped 
the global problem of religious extremism and terrorism. The Government was extremely 
concerned at the rising influence of extremists and the increasing tendency of young 
Maldivians to travel abroad and come under the influence of extremist organizations. 
</p>
<p>14. The Government was committed to achieving full equality between men and women 
in law and in practice. However, it could escape the fact that serious obstacles to that goal 
persisted, despite important steps such as the removal of the constitutional bar that had 
previously prevented women from running for President. Persistent de facto discrimination 
against women stemmed from both religious influence and a Government that had been 
characterized by strong, centralized patriarchal rule. Violence against women was also a 
real problem in Maldives. 
</p>
<p>15. The Government was committed to upholding the independence and impartiality of 
the judiciary. A strong, independent judiciary was the ultimate guarantor of the new 
democratic Maldives and of the human rights of the people. Judges must be people of 
integrity and the highest educational and professional standing.  
</p>
<p>16. It was extremely difficult for law enforcement agencies to bring a case to a 
successful conclusion because of the lack of an adequate legal framework. In particular, 
there was an urgent need to adopt the new revised Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure 
Code and the evidence bill. 
</p>
<p>17. Trafficking and consumption of drugs, and the related problems of criminality and 
gang violence, were major problems. Some 80 per cent of the prison population consisted 
of drug offenders, with approximately 30 per cent serving life sentences for drug-related 
offences. The vast majority of prisoners were young, and the criminalization of young drug 
users and the imposition of severe sentences were particularly serious problems. The 
Government was committed to a path of rehabilitation rather than of imprisonment.  
</p>
<p>18. Maldives was acutely vulnerable at the economic, social and environmental levels. 
Economically, it was heavily dependent on the tourism and fishery sectors, both of which </p>


<p>were sensitive to fluctuations in international markets. The global financial crisis had 
therefore badly affected the Maldivian economy, exacerbating an already fragile fiscal 
situation and making it increasingly difficult to promote economic, social and cultural 
rights. Global warming represented an existential threat to Maldives and had already 
undermined a wide range of human rights.  
</p>
<p>19. Maldives was the first country to have convened, under a presidential mandate, a 
universal periodic review Standing Committee comprising government, civil society and 
the national Human Rights Commission. The Standing Committee was responsible for 
producing the national report and, importantly, would also be responsible for coordinating 
the implementation of recommendations.  
</p>
<p>20. Maldives was very proud of its national Human Rights Commission, which was one 
of the most active national institutions in Asia, expressing hope that the new Commission, 
recently sworn in, would be more forthright in addressing human rights issues. The 
Commission was fully compliant with the Paris Principles, with one exception: the rule 
stating that members of the Commission must be Muslim. 
</p>
<p>21. Government efforts against gender discrimination were guided by the National 
Gender Equality Policy, which took a twofold approach to the problem: gender 
mainstreaming in all areas, and strategic action on empowerment and advancement in 
specific sectors. In 2009, the Government had launched a Gender Mainstreaming Policy to 
ensure that all policies and programmes promoted gender equality. The Government was 
working on a specific women&#8217;s rights bill that would guarantee the rights and obligations 
set out in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against 
Women.   
</p>
<p>22. Violence against women was a major problem, and its causes and consequences 
were deep and far-reaching. Maldives was in the process of adopting a new bill on domestic 
violence. It was working with the United Nations, the Inter-Parliamentary Union and others 
to ensure that the bill complied with the very highest international standards. Maldives had 
also taken steps to amend the courts&#8217; sentencing guidelines to provide more appropriate 
punishments for the perpetrators of sexual violence. 
</p>
<p>23. Trafficking was an emerging problem. Unfortunately, no official studies on the issue 
had been undertaken, and Maldives lacked the systems and procedures to deal with it. Steps 
were being taken to rectify that situation. For example, a new bill on trafficking in persons 
was being prepared with support from the Government of Australia, and a shelter for the 
victims of human trafficking was scheduled to be opened in Mal&#233;.  
</p>
<p>24. Gang-related violence was a major concern. The Government&#8217;s response had been 
twofold: it was trying to tackle the drug trade through a combination of the vigorous 
prosecution of drug dealers and rehabilitation for drug users; and the Maldives Police 
Service, supported by a new Act on the prohibition of gang crimes, was launching more 
special operations to curb gang activity. 
</p>
<p>25. The Government had taken many steps to better protect the rights of children, 
including in the context of abuse. Sentencing guidelines for child sex cases had been 
significantly strengthened in line with the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights 
of the Child. 
</p>
<p>26. Maldives greatly valued the thousands of migrant workers who contributed to its 
economy. In principle, migrant workers enjoyed the same employment rights and protection 
as Maldivian workers; however, in practice this was not the case. The Government was 
working to improve that situation by making workers aware of their rights and by 
establishing a stronger legal framework. Maldives had yet to become party to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and </p>


<p>Members of Their Families, although the Government was working to complete all the 
national formalities for accession. 
</p>
<p>27. Maldives stated that it did not have any current plans to accede to the Second 
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the death 
penalty, while noting that it had a long-standing moratorium on that penalty.  
</p>
<p>28. Maldives was committed to ratifying the eight core conventions of the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) as soon as possible. Since joining ILO in May last year, it had 
worked closely with the ILO secretariat to strengthen social protection and to prepare the 
ground for ratification. 
</p>
<p>29. Maldivian law did not provide for freedom of religion, although in practice 
foreigners were allowed to practice religions other than Islam in private. 
</p>
<p>30. Maldives maintained a reservation to article 18 of the International Covenant on 
Civil and Political Rights, and there were no plans to withdraw it. There was strong public 
support for Maldives being, and remaining, a 100 per cent Muslim country. Indeed, the 
advent of democracy, with greater freedom of expression and the diluting of central control 
over cultural matters, had intensified moves away from freedom of religion. This was 
evident in the new draft regulations on religious unity and a private member&#8217;s bill in 
Parliament on banning non-Muslim places of worship. 
</p>
<p>31. Maldives, a country with a long and tragic history of torture and other cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment, was one of the original 20 States parties to the Optional 
Protocol to the Convention against Torture; the first country in Asia to ratify, and one of the 
first countries to establish, a national preventive mechanism; and one of the first countries 
to receive the Subcommittee on the Prevention of Torture. 
</p>
<p>32. Those international efforts had been translated into real on-the-ground progress. 
Maldives&#8217; national preventive mechanism was one of the most active in the world, and a 
new prison and parole bill, which was expected to be submitted shortly, would completely 
modernize and rationalize Maldives&#8217; detention system, placing a much higher emphasis on 
rehabilitation and providing for the implementation of a large number of the 
recommendations made by the Subcommittee after its visit late in 2007. 
</p>
<p>33. While there were no plans to abolish flogging, the Government was concerned that 
the punishment was applied in a discriminatory manner, with women far more likely to be 
flogged than men. The Government was willing to consider ways to address the issue, 
including the possibility of a moratorium, and intended to consult with Parliament on it. 
</p>
<p>34. There were no plans in Maldives to promote gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender 
rights. 
</p>
<p>35. Nearly all the recommendations issued by the Special Rapporteur on the 
independence of judges and lawyers had been implemented. One area identified by the 
Special Rapporteur that remained a serious concern was the level of training and 
qualification of judges. This was difficult for the Government to address without 
encroaching on the independence of the Bar. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>36. Algeria indicated that it had closely followed Maldives&#8217; transition to democracy and 
its progress in that regard. It welcomed recent cooperation between Maldives and human 
rights mechanisms, and expressed appreciation for the country&#8217;s efforts to achieve 
Millennium Development Goals, as well as the improvement in social indicators, notably in 
public health. Algeria noted that Maldives had continued to intensify efforts to lessen the </p>


<p>impact of the consequences of its great vulnerability to environmental factors. Algeria made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>37. Austria commended Maldives for the exemplary democratic transition begun in 
2008 with the enactment of a new Constitution and the holding of the first democratic and 
multiparty elections. Austria also recognized efforts and dedication with regard to judicial 
reform. It expressed appreciation for Maldives&#8217; constructive participation in the work of the 
Human Rights Council and special procedures. Austria made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>38. Mexico congratulated Maldives on its transition to democracy and noted efforts to 
strengthen legal protection and measures to prevent torture and other ill treatment. It asked 
what technical assistance Maldives needed from the international community in order to 
develop its capacity to address cases involving the sexual abuse of women and children. 
Mexico made recommendations.  
</p>
<p>39. India noted the socio-economic progress in the country. It requested Maldives to 
share information about the causes of the high unemployment and drug addiction and steps 
taken in that regard. It also requested the country to share details about assistance required 
in the areas of judicial and prison reform. It referred to the threat posed to Maldives by 
climate change. India made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>40. The United Arab Emirates noted considerable progress made and measures taken to 
protect the right to health, including the prevention of disease, and particularly Millennium 
Development Goals 4 and 5. It welcomed plans that had made it possible to eradicate 
certain epidemics such as polio and malaria. It asked for additional information concerning 
the cooperation between the World Health Organization (WHO) and Maldives. 
</p>
<p>41. Indonesia noted Maldives&#8217; democratic reforms and that poverty was a major 
obstacle to the fulfilment of human rights. It acknowledged the impact of climate change on 
the enjoyment of a wide range of human rights. It commended Maldives for improvements 
made in connection with the right to health. Indonesia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>42. Malaysia recognized the challenges faced by Maldives and noted with appreciation 
that it would soon shed its least developed country status. It noted that the Maldivian legal 
system was a mixture of Shariah and English civil and common law traditions, and 
requested Maldives to share best practices in ensuring the rule of law in a hybrid system. It 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>43. Finland welcomed Maldives&#8217; decision to declare housing as one of its five priorities. 
It asked whether human rights were taken into account in the country&#8217;s climate change 
adaptation and post-disaster reconstruction processes. It also asked what measures were 
planned to improve housing affordability in the light of the fact that internal migration had 
led to overcrowding in the capital. Finland made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>44. Morocco referred to the impact of climate change on the enjoyment of human rights. 
It noted the progress made in the areas of freedom of expression and women&#8217;s rights. It 
encouraged Maldives to follow practices of other Muslim countries in the area of freedom 
of religion and belief. Morocco made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>45. Azerbaijan indicated its awareness of Maldives&#8217; vulnerability to climate change and 
the negative impact that it could have on human rights. It noted with appreciation that the 
Maldives would soon graduate from the list of least developed countries. It asked whether 
Maldives was considering ratifying the Palermo Protocol. Azerbaijan made 
recommendations.  
</p>
<p>46. Sri Lanka commended Maldives for the withdrawal of its reservation to article 7 of 
the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and 
welcomed the active review of the reservations under the International Covenant on Civil </p>


<p>and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It congratulated 
Maldives on becoming a member of ILO and noted the process of becoming a party to the 
International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and 
Members of Their Families. Sri Lanka also recognized the progress made in combating 
narcotics trafficking and consumption. Sri Lanka made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>47. Cuba congratulated Maldives on the achievement of Millennium Development 
Goals 4 and 5. It also referred to progress made in the areas of infant mortality and life 
expectancy, health care and vulnerable groups. Cuba made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>48. Qatar noted that the national report addressed many of the achievements, challenges 
and difficulties faced by Maldives in the field of human rights. Qatar noted with satisfaction 
the democratic transformation since the adoption of the 2008 Constitution, which enshrined 
fundamental rights and freedoms. Qatar made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>49. Maldives stated that housing, particularly in Mal&#233;, was one of the greatest 
challenges facing it. In addition, one of the Government&#8217;s key pledges was to ensure 
affordable housing in the capital. A number of programmes had been launched to make 
Mal&#233; less congested and to provide better housing, including some social housing. The 
Government aimed to reduce rents in the capital to an affordable level through a mix of 
subsidies for poor families. It was also encouraging investments in the atolls so that urban 
congestion could be reduced. Thus, the Government was trying to decentralize development 
very vigorously. 
</p>
<p>50. The issue of climate change and human rights was a very difficult and important one 
for Maldives. A number of communities were facing severe beach erosion, and many were 
facing physical dangers. The Government planned to ensure shore protection so that 
communities on those islands could be protected from encroachments of the sea. The 
Government was also investing in other utilities, such as water, so that environmental 
deterioration would not affect the enjoyment of human rights. No consideration was being 
given to any forced transfer of the population to other islands. 
</p>
<p>51. Maldives had been able to make good progress in the health sector, working with 
WHO and the donor community. It had been able to reach out to all communities in the 
country through multiple-tier networks of health-care providers, from family health workers 
to central-level medical facilities. 
</p>
<p>52. The new 2008 Constitution had heralded a new legal system for the country, with a 
modern charter of rights and a new configuration for the judiciary. Efforts had been made 
by the Government to create an independent judiciary. It had established a permanent bench 
of the Supreme Court under the new Constitution. In addition, the enactment of the Judges 
Act and the Judicature Act was aimed at making the judiciary more professional and 
accountable. 
</p>
<p>53. Maldives had embarked on a new reform agenda, and the entire structure of the legal 
system was being reviewed and revised.  Until 2010, there had been no criminal procedure 
or civil procedure codes. The judiciary and the legal system had been functioning in an ad 
hoc manner, relying on Shariah jurisprudence to a great extent. The delegation noted that 
the Government had initiated a programme of legislative reforms, and that the legislative 
agenda prioritized the formulation of a criminal procedure code that would give effect to 
proper legal reforms whereby the criminal legal system would be up to date and provide 
remedies and procedural matters that were contemporary and accepted as standards in 
modern constitutions. Those legislative measures would come into effect with a view to 
enhancing and integrating both Shariah and common law principles into the formal legal 
system. </p>


<p>54. Canada welcomed significant progress made by the Maldives in the protection of 
human rights and implementation of governance reforms since the country&#8217;s 2008 election. 
While welcoming efforts to address gender equality  and congratulating the Government for 
its efforts to promote human rights internationally, particularly human rights and climate 
change, Canada expressed the belief that more efforts should be dedicated to promoting and 
protecting freedom of religion and belief and to putting an end to such practices as 
flogging, and requested information about how that could be achieved. Canada made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>55. The Netherlands referred to the challenges remaining in the area of justice, and 
expressed concern at reports of a high incidence of child abuse. It referred to the issue of 
discrimination and violence against women and girls. The Netherlands made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>56. Germany asked whether Maldives intended to follow up on the recommendation of 
the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding discrimination in law faced by children 
born out of wedlock and the issue of birth registration. It also asked whether Maldives was 
considering ratifying the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 
Optional Protocol thereto. Germany made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>57. The Libyan Arab Jamahiriya expressed appreciation for efforts to improve the 
standard of living and to provide health care and social services for all. It welcomed the 
efforts to address discrimination against women. It expressed the hope that Maldives would 
request cooperation with States responsible for the major part of greenhouse emissions. It 
made a recommendation. 
</p>
<p>58. Bangladesh noted the considerable progress made in poverty reduction, education 
and health, although the national report acknowledged that women had faced 
discrimination. It also noted that a large portion of the population was susceptible to 
external shocks and that many challenges were faced by the country owing to climate 
change, which had resulted in responsibilities for the international community. Bangladesh 
made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>59. Hungary noted with satisfaction the new Constitution and the transparent conduct of 
the multi-candidate elections. It referred to migrant workers&#8217; rights and to Maldives&#8217; 
reservations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It requested 
information regarding the future implementation of universal periodic review 
recommendations, particularly with regard to the inclusion of civil society in the process.  
Hungary made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>60. Brazil commended Maldives for the achievement of Millennium Development Goals 
4 and 5. It expressed concern at discrimination and violence against women, impunity for 
torture, the marginalization of persons with disabilities, the lack of child protection 
mechanisms, and the absence of freedom of religion or belief. It also asked what measures 
were being considered to prevent discrimination based on religion. Brazil made 
recommendations. 
</p>
<p>61. Slovakia valued Maldives&#8217; commitment to children&#8217;s rights and praised the new 
gender mainstreaming policy. It noted that the Special Rapporteurs on freedom of 
expression and freedom of religion or belief had observed that the new Constitution granted 
citizenship only to Muslims. It also noted limitations on the right of migrant workers and 
foreigners to manifest their religious beliefs. Slovakia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>62. The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland applauded the 
commitment to accede to the Rome Statute and encouraged Maldives to curb the growth of 
radicalization while maintaining the right to freedom of belief. It expressed concern, and 
asked a question about persons beloning to potentially vulnerable groups. It underlined the </p>


<p>challenges posed by the lack of trained personnel in the legal and judicial system, and 
inquired about plans to reform the legal and judicial system. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>63. Australia welcomed the new Constitution and commended the Government for 
having drawn the attention of the Human Rights Council to the issue of climate change. It 
urged Maldives to guarantee freedom of religion. Australia made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>64. Spain congratulated Maldives for efforts to accede to international human rights 
conventions. Spain asked whether Maldives planned to review legislation to end limitations 
on freedom of religion and to reform provisions in the Constitution that prevented non-
Muslims from acquiring nationality. It also asked whether Maldives planned to stop 
applying the provisions of Shariah law criminalizing apostasy. It made recommendations. 
</p>
<p>65. Turkey welcomed that the new Constitution provided for separation of powers and 
recognized the independence of judiciary, including the appointment of women judges. 
Turkey stated that the Constitution would enhance freedom of religion with a view to 
fighting extremism. Turkey observed the achievements made in education and the 
development of private media, and encouraged Maldives to reinforce freedom of 
expression. It also encouraged States to support Maldives in addressing the threat of climate 
change. 
</p>
<p>66. Maldives stated that the Government had been decisive in taking measures against 
domestic violence. Referring to the newly submitted domestic violence bill, Maldives noted 
that, despite its wide scope of application, the bill fell short of allowing for expert evidence 
from social workers and provided for a dual role for family protection authorities: to act as 
an agency working on individual cases and as a regulatory body. To remedy those 
shortfalls, the Government had provided its comments to the political parties that had 
submitted the bill, and was working with non-governmental organizations to obtain support 
for the comprehensive bill. 
</p>
<p>67. The Ministry of Home Affairs was the main agency for implementing the South 
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation protocol on trafficking in women and children.  
The Maldives police service was working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and 
Crime to establish information-sharing mechanisms in the region. The police service had 
established a sub-unit within the organized crimes division that addressed human 
smuggling using a comprehensive database. Moreover, the Department of Immigration was 
leading efforts to draft a new national law on anti-trafficking, with financial and technical 
expertise provided by the Government of Australia. Several important pieces of legislation 
were in the pipeline that would strengthen legal safeguards for women&#8217;s rights. These 
included a sexual harassment bill, a draft evidence bill and a draft revised penal code. 
</p>
<p>68. While the Penal Code did not prescribe flogging as a punishment, it was 
administered under Shariah. The Government was looking at ways to ensure that such 
punishment was not applied to women in such a discriminatory manner, and it was 
considering a moratorium on the punishment pending national consultations, including an 
opinion from Parliament. 
</p>
<p>69. Various steps to promote equity, access and the rights of women, including the 
development of an action plan and positive statements addressing a range of such key 
concerns as health and well-being, violence and safety, decision-making relationships and 
economic security, had been taken at the national and community levels. The national 
equality policy was aimed at promoting substantive equality through gender mainstreaming 
in all areas and action on empowerment in specific sectors. 
</p>
<p>70. Work was under way to ratify the ILO Convention on discrimination in the 
workplace. Moreover, the Government had recently facilitated scholarships for girls and 
women. Media guidelines had been formulated on gender-based violence reporting. With </p>


<p>respect to divorce, the delegation noted that the court had begun to recognize agreements 
between husbands and wives. 
</p>
<p>71. There were no religious minorities in Maldives that been discriminated against. For 
more than 800 years, Islam had been the only religion practiced in the country, and what 
was faced today was a result of that legacy. The Government had an obligation to ensure 
that the rights of non-Muslims in Maldives were protected, and a number of measures were 
being taken to ensure that non-Muslims &#8211; essentially migrant workers &#8211; were able to 
exercise their right to practice their beliefs in private. 
</p>
<p>72. Sweden asked whether Maldives could elaborate on measures being taken to ensure 
the enjoyment of freedom of religion or belief as enshrined in the Universal Declaration 
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It also asked what measures 
were being taken to ensure non-discrimination and equal rights for citizens and other 
persons of different religious beliefs. In addition, it inquired about measures being taken to 
eliminate violence and discrimination against women. Sweden made recommendations. 
</p>
