When we use the terms “Silver  Bull,” “we,”  “us,” or  “our,”(cid:160)  we are referring to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. We have 
included  technical  terms  important  to  an  understanding  of  our  business  under  “Glossary  of  Common  Terms”  at  the  end  of  this  section.  Throughout  this  document  we  make 
statements  that  are  classified  as  “forward-looking.”  Please  refer  to  the  “Cautionary  Statement  Regarding  Forward-Looking  Statements”  section  of  this  document  for  an 
explanation of these types of assertions.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes certain statements that may be deemed to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section(cid:160)27A of the Securities Act of 1933, 
as amended (the “Securities Act”), Section(cid:160)21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  “Exchange Act”), and the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 
of  1995,  and  “forward-looking  information”  within  the  meaning  of  applicable  Canadian  securities  legislation.  We  use  words  such  as  “anticipate,”  “continue,”  “likely,”  “estimate,” 
“expect,” “may,” “will,” “projection,” “should,” “believe,” “potential,” “could,” or similar words suggesting future outcomes (including negative and grammatical variations) to identify 
forward-looking statements. These statements include, among other things, our planned activities at the Sierra Mojada Project in 2015, continuing to progress in securing additional 
surface rights, internally remodeling the zinc resource and the potential for a standalone zinc project, internally studying a smaller silver open pit, the timing and scope of our exploration 
activities,  the  projections  and  estimates  set  forth  in  the  PEA  Technical  Report  and  our  proposed  capital  and  operating  budgets  for  the  Sierra  Mojada  Project  and  general  and 
administrative expenses.

These factors are not intended to represent a complete list of the general or specific factors that could affect us. 
 
All forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are 
expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or 
circumstances after the date on which it is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances.(cid:160) You should not place undue reliance on these 
forward-looking statements.
Cautionary Note Regarding Exploration Stage Companies
We are an exploration stage company and do not currently have any known reserves and cannot be expected to have known reserves unless and until a feasibility study is completed 
for the Sierra Mojada concessions that shows proven and probable reserves. There can be no assurance that our concessions contain proven and probable reserves and investors may 
lose their entire investment. See “Risk Factors.”

(cid:160)   A distinct layer of sedimentary rock of similar composition. 
(cid:160)  
Mineral bearing material such as zinc, silver, gold, lead or copper that has been physically delineated by one or more of a number of 
methods including drilling, underground work, surface trenching and other types of sampling. This material has been found to contain a 
sufficient amount of mineralization of an average grade of metal or metals to have economic potential that warrants further exploration 
evaluation. While this material is not currently or may never be classified as reserves, it is reported as mineralized material only if the 
potential  exists  for  reclassification  into  the  reserves  category.  This  material  cannot  be  classified  in  the  reserves  category  until  final 
technical, economic and legal factors have been determined. Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s standards, a mineral 
deposit does not qualify as a reserve unless the recoveries from the deposit are expected to be sufficient to recover total cash and non-
cash costs for the mine and related facilities and make a profit.
(cid:160)
The process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product. Exploration continues 
during the mining process and, in many cases, mineral reserves are expanded during the life of the mine operations as the exploration 
potential of the deposit is realized.

PART I
Items 1 and 2.(cid:160) BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES  
 
Overview and Corporate Structure 
 
Silver Bull Resources, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 8, 1993 as the Cadgie Company for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. The 
Cadgie Company was a spin-off from its predecessor, Precious Metal Mines, Inc. On June 28, 1996, our name was changed to Metalline Mining Company (“Metalline”). On April 21, 
2011, we changed our name to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. We have not realized any revenues from our planned operations and we are considered an Exploration Stage Company. We 
have not established any reserves with respect to our exploration projects, and may never enter into the development with respect to any of our projects. 
 
We engage in the business of mineral exploration. We currently own or have the option to acquire a number of property concessions in Mexico within a mining district known as the 
Sierra Mojada District, located in the west-central part of the state of Coahuila, Mexico.(cid:160) We conduct our operations in Mexico through our wholly -owned subsidiary corporations, 
Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V. (“Minera Metalin”)  and Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V. (“Contratistas”) and through Minera Metalin’s wholly-owned subsidiary Minas de 
Coahuila SBR S.A. de C.V (“Minas”). 
 
In April 2010, Metalline Mining Delaware, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, was merged with and into Dome Ventures Corporation (“Dome”). As a result, Dome became a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Silver Bull.(cid:160) Dome has a wholly -owned subsidiary, Dome Asia Inc. (“Dome Asia”), which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.(cid:160) Dome Asia has a wholly -
owned subsidiary incorporated in Gabon, African Resources SARL Gabon (“African Resources”), as well as(cid:160) a 99.99% -owned subsidiary, Dome Minerals Nigeria Limited, incorporated 
in Nigeria. In January 2015 we completed the sale of our subsidiary Dome International Global Inc. (“Dome International”)  including Dome International’s  wholly-owned subsidiary 
Dome Ventures SARL Gabon (“Dome Gabon”) which held the Ndjole Prospect in Gabon. 
 
Our efforts have been concentrated in expenditures related to exploration properties, principally in the Sierra Mojada Property located in Coahuila, Mexico. We have not determined 
whether the exploration properties contain ore reserves that are economically recoverable. The ultimate realization of our investment in exploration properties is dependent upon the 
success of future property sales, the existence of economically recoverable reserves, our ability to obtain financing or make other arrangements for exploration, development and future 
profitable  production  activities.  The  ultimate  realization  of  our  investment  in  exploration  properties  cannot  be  determined  at  this  time.  Accordingly,  no  provision  for  any  asset 
impairment that may result, in the event we are not successful in developing or selling these properties, has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, except as 
disclosed in Notes 3 and 6. 
 
Sierra Mojada Project 
 
Location, Access and Infrastructure 
 
The Sierra Mojada project is located within a mining district known as the Sierra Mojada District.(cid:160) The Sierra Mojada District is located in the west central part of the state of Coahuila, 
Mexico, near the Coahuila-Chihuahua state border approximately 200 kilometers south of the Big Bend of the Rio Grande River.(cid:160) The principal mining area extends for approximately 5 
kilometers in an east-west direction along the base of the precipitous, 1,000 meter high, Sierra Mojada Range. 
 
The Sierra Mojada project site is situated to the south of the village of Esmeralda, on the northern side of a major escarpment that forms the northern margin of the Sierra Mojada range.(cid:160) 
In general, the site is approximately 1,500 meters above sea level.(cid:160) The project is accessible by paved road from the city of Torreon, Coahuila, which lies approximately 250 kilometers to 
the southwest.(cid:160) Esmerelda is served by a rail spur of the Coahuila Durango railroad.(cid:160) There is an airstrip east of Esmeralda, although its availability is limited, and another airstrip at the 
nearby  Penoles  plant,  which  we  can  use  occasionally.(cid:160)  The  Sierra  Mojada  District  has  high  voltage  electric  power  supplied  by  the  national  power  company,  Comision  Federal  de 
Electricidad, C.F.E., and is supplied water by the municipality of Sierra Mojada.(cid:160) Although power levels are sufficient for current operations and exploration, future development of the 
project, if any, may require additional power supplies to be sourced.
(cid:160)

Our facilities in Mexico include offices, residences, shops, warehouse buildings and exploration equipment located at Calle Mina #1, La Esmeralda, Coahuila, Mexico.
The map below shows the location of the Sierra Mojada project:
Property History 
 
Silver and lead were first discovered by a foraging party in 1879, and mining to 1886 consisted of native silver, silver chloride, and lead carbonate ores. After 1886, silver-lead-zinc-
copper sulphate ores within limestone and sandstone units were produced. No accurate production history has been found for historical mining during this period. 
 
Approximately 90 years ago, zinc silicate and zinc carbonate minerals (“Zinc Manto Zone”) were discovered underlying the silver-lead mineralized horizon. The Zinc Manto Zone is 
predominantly zinc dominated, but with subordinate lead – rich manto and is principally situated in the footwall rocks of the Sierra Mojada Fault System. Since discovery and up to 1990, 
zinc, silver, and lead ores were mined from various mines along the strike of the deposit including from the Sierra Mojada Property. Ores mined from within these areas were hand-sorted, 
and the concentrate shipped mostly to smelters in the United States. 
 
Activity during the period of 1956 to 1990 consisted of operations by the Mineros Norteños Cooperativa and operations by individual owners and operators of pre-existing mines. The 
Mineros Norteños operated the San Salvador, Encantada, Fronteriza, Esmeralda, and Parrena mines, and shipped oxide zinc ore to Zinc National’s smelter in Monterrey, while copper 
and silver ore were shipped to smelters in Mexico and the United States. 
 
We estimate that over 45 mines have produced ore from underground workings throughout the approximately five kilometers by two kilometer area that comprises the Sierra Mojada 
District.(cid:160) We estimate that since its discovery in 1879, the Sierra Mojada District has produced approximately 10 million tons of silver, zinc, lead and copper ore.(cid:160) The District does not 
have a mill to concentrate ore and all mining conducted thus far has been limited to selectively mined ore of sufficient grade to direct ship to smelters.(cid:160) We believe that mill -grade 
mineralization that was not mined remains available for extraction.(cid:160) No mining operations are currently active within the area of the Sierra Mojada District, except for a dolomite quarry by 
Peñoles near Esmeralda. 
 
In the 1990’s, Kennecott Copper Corporation (“Kennecott”) had a joint venture agreement involving USMX’s Sierra Mojada concessions.(cid:160) Kennecott terminated the joint venture in 
approximately 1995. We entered into a Joint Exploration and Development Agreement with USMX in July 1996 involving USMX’s Sierra Mojada concessions.(cid:160) In 1998, we purchased 
the Sierra Mojada and the USMX concessions and the Joint Exploration and Development Agreement was terminated.(cid:160) We also purchased certain other concessions during this time 
and conducted exploration for copper and silver mineralization from 1997 through 1999.

(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Title and Ownership Rights 
 
The Sierra Mojada Project is comprised of 31 concessions consisting of 20,946 hectares (about 51,758 acres). We periodically obtain additional concessions in the Sierra Mojada Project 
area and whether we will continue to hold these additional concessions will depend on future exploration work and exploration results and our ability to obtain financing. As we have 
done in prior years, we continually assess our concession ownership and in 2014 we terminated our rights to certain concessions holdings not in the core area of the Sierra Mojada 
Project and three concessions in the core area of the Sierra Mojada Project which we did not consider to be material to the PEA Technical Report described in the Preliminary Economic 
Assessment Technical Report section. 
 
Two of the concessions in the Sierra Mojada project are subject to options to purchase from existing third party concession owners. During 2014 we terminated an option agreement 
covering three concessions. We also modified the terms of the remaining option agreement to defer certain option payments. If exploration results warrant, we intend to make the 
payments described below. Pursuant to the option purchase agreement, we are required to make certain payments over the terms of this contract to obtain full ownership of these 
concessions as set forth in the table below:
Nuevo Dulces Nombres (Centenario) and Yolanda III (2 concessions)

(1)(cid:160)
million plus a lump sum payment equal to any remaining monthly payments. 
(2)(cid:160)
control.
(cid:160)If a change of control of Silver Bull occurs prior to May 30, 2016 we are required to make a payment of $200,000 within 20 days of the change of
(cid:160)Annual assessment work in excess of statutory annual requirements can be carried forward and applied to future periods.(cid:160)
Each mining concession enables us to explore the underlying concession in consideration for the payment of a semi-annual fee to the Mexican government and completion of certain 
annual assessment work.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
Ownership of a concession provides the owner with exclusive exploration and exploitation rights to all minerals located on the concessions, but does not include the surface rights to 
the real property. Therefore, we will need to negotiate any necessary agreements with the appropriate surface landowners if we determine that a mining operation is feasible for the 
concessions. We own surface rights to five lots in the Sierra Mojada Property (Sierra Mojada lot #1, #3, #4, #6 and #7), but anticipate that we will be required to obtain additional 
surface rights if we determine that a mining operation is feasible. 
 
Geology and Mineralization 
 
The Sierra Mojada concessions contain a mineral system which can be separated into two distinct zones: The “Silver Zone” and the “Zinc Zone.” These two zones lie along the Sierra 
Mojada Fault which trends east-west along the base of the Sierra Mojada range. All of the mineralization identified to date is seen as oxide, which has been derived from primary 
“sulphide” bodies which have been oxidized and remained in situ or remobilized into porous and fractured rock along the Sierra Mojada Fault. The formation of a silver rich zone (the 
Silver Zone) and a zinc rich zone (the Zinc Zone) is a reflection of the mobility’s of the metals in the ground water conditions at Sierra Mojada. 
 
The geology of the District is composed of a Cretaceous limestone and dolomite sequence sitting on top of the Jurassic “San Marcos” red sediments. This sedimentary sequence has 
then later been intruded by Tertiary volcanics, which are considered to be responsible for the mineralization seen at Sierra Mojada. Historical mines are dry and the rocks are competent 
for the most part. The thickness and attitude of the mineralized material could potentially be amenable to high volume mechanized mining methods and low cost production.

Preliminary Economic Assessment Technical Report
On December 19, 2013, JDS Energy & Mining Inc. (“JDS”) delivered Silver Bull’s amended initial Preliminary Economic Assessment (the “PEA Technical Report”) on the silver and zinc 
mineralization for the Sierra Mojada Project in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 (“NI 43-101”).(cid:160) The PEA Technical Report includes an update on the silver and zinc 
mineralization, which was estimated from 1,372 diamond drill holes, 25 reverse circulation drill holes, 9,025 channel samples and 2,345 long holes.(cid:160) At a cutoff grade of 25 grams/tonne of 
silver for mineralized material, the PEA Technical Report indicates mineralized material of 71.1 million tonnes at an average silver grade of 71.5 grams/tonne silver and an average zinc 
percentage of 1.34%. Mineralized material estimates do not include any amounts categorized as inferred resources. The PEA Technical Report included a preliminary assessment of 
capital costs, mine plan, processing and projected operating costs of a possible future mine at the Sierra Mojada Project.(cid:160) We believe the results of the PEA Technical Report, although 
preliminary in nature, were encouraging and show that the Sierra Mojada Project has the potential to continue to advance. 
 
“Mineralized material” as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although permissible under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (“SEC’s”) Industry Guide 7, does not 
indicate “reserves” by SEC standards.(cid:160)
(cid:160)We cannot be certain that any part of the Sierra Mojada Project will ever be confirmed or converted into SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant 
“reserves.”(cid:160)
(cid:160) Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can 
be economically or legally extracted. 
 
Sampling, Analysis, Quality Control and Security 
 
Our activities conform to mining industry standard practices and follow the Best Practices Guidelines of(cid:160)the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy, and Petroleum (CIM). Sampling is 
directed and supervised by(cid:160)trained and experienced(cid:160)geologists.(cid:160) Drill core(cid:160)and other samples are processed and logged using industry standard methods. Standard samples, duplicates 
and blanks are periodically entered into the stream of samples submitted for assays, and campaigns of re-sampling and duplicate analyses and round-robin inter-laboratory validations 
are conducted periodically.(cid:160) We use ALS Chemex  - Vancouver (“ALS Chemex”) laboratory(cid:160)as our independent primary laboratory.(cid:160) ALS Chemex is ISO 9001:2000 certified.(cid:160) All analytical 
results that(cid:160)are used in resource models are exclusively from the(cid:160)independent primary laboratory.
(cid:160)  
Our consultants perform technical audits of our operations, including our formal QA/QC program, and recommend improvements as needed. A systematic program of duplicate sampling 
and assaying of representative samples from previous exploration activities was completed in 2010 under the direction and control of our consultants.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Results of this study acceptably 
confirm the values in the project database used for resource modeling. 
(cid:160)  
We(cid:160)formerly  operated  a  sample  preparation  and  an  analytical  laboratory(cid:160)at  the(cid:160)project  that  prepared  samples  for  shipment,  performed  QA/QC  analyses  to  ensure(cid:160)against  cross 
contamination  of  samples  during  preparation  and  removed  most  low-value  samples  from  the  flow  to  the  primary  laboratory.(cid:160)  For  both  cost  and  perception  reasons,  the  internal 
laboratory has been shut down, and all drill samples are submitted directly to ALS Chemex for sample preparation and analyses. 
 
Prior Exploration Activities 
 
We have focused our exploration efforts on two primary locations: the Silver Zone and the Zinc Zone.(cid:160)
the Sierra Mojada Project, however, to date, we have not established any reserves, and the project remains in the exploration state and may never enter the development stage. 
(cid:160)  
Prior to 2008, exploration efforts largely focused on the Zinc Zone with surface and underground drilling. In 2008 Pincock, Allen, & Holt (“PAH”) published a resource report on the 
Zinc Zone. In fiscal year 2009, we scaled back our exploration activities and administrative costs to conserve capital while we tried to secure additional sources of capital.(cid:160)
(cid:160)  
After closing the transaction with Dome in April 2010, we focused our exploration activities at Sierra Mojada on the Silver Zone which lies largely at surface. By the end of calendar 
2013, approximately 100,000 meters of diamond drilling from surface and 10,000 meters of underground drilling had been completed. 
(cid:160)  
The silver contained within the Silver Zone is seen primarily as silver halide minerals. The zinc contained within the Zinc Zone is contained mostly in the mineral hemimorphite and, to a 
lesser amount, in the mineral smithsonite. 
 
2014 Exploration Activities 
 
Our focus for 2014 was the completion of the PEA Technical Report, continued metallurgical work and geological mapping. In December 2013, the PEA Technical Report was completed, 
together with an updated estimate on the silver and zinc mineralization. We also continued to progress our metallurgical program, as described below.
(cid:160)As further described below, we have conducted various exploration activities at

2015 Exploration Program 
 
As discussed in the “Material Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below we have approved a calendar year 2015 budget of $0.7 million for the 
Sierra Mojada Property. The focus of the 2015 calendar year program is continuing to progress in securing additional surface rights, maintenance of our property concessions, internally 
remodeling the zinc resource and the potential for a standalone zinc project and internally studying a smaller silver open pit as discussed below. 
 
During  2015  we  intend  to  internally  investigate  the  potential  for  a  high  grade  underground  zinc  oxide  mine.  To  this  purpose  we  are  completing  an  internal  remodeling  of  the  zinc 
resource, much of which was not included in the resource outlined in the PEA Technical Report. 
 
We also intend to do an internal examination on the potential for a smaller silver open pit than the one proposed in the PEA Technical Report. The focus will be to target the "at-
surface" silver mineralization with a smaller project. Although a smaller project would produce fewer ounces than proposed in the PEA Technical Report, the low strip and smaller plant 
would be expected to significantly reduce the overall capital costs needed to put the project into production. 
 
During 2015, and subject to market favorable conditions, we intend to examine the potential for fuming high grade zinc. Previous test work completed by Hazen Research Inc. at the 
request of us in 2012 focused on roasting the zinc ore in a rotary kiln to fume off the zinc and collect it as a zinc oxide concentrate. Recoveries of up to 98% of the zinc were recorded. 
 
The roasting of the zinc samples aims to simulate a "Waelz Kiln", a kiln which is used extensively to recycle zinc from steel dust and which regularly achieves recoveries in excess of 
90%. In considering this process, the zinc mineralization at Sierra Mojada has a number of possible advantages: It lies in the state of Coahuila which is the largest coal producing state in 
Mexico, and it has an existing gas pipeline nearby which may be able to be extended to the project (as contemplated in the PEA Technical Report). Either option could provide the fuel 
to run the kiln. The project also has a functioning railway right to site to potentially allow for transport of coal to the site and of the zinc concentrate from the site. 
 
Metallurgical Studies 
 
In  addition  we  previously  conducted  a  metallurgical  program  to  test  the  recovery  of  the  silver  mineralization  using  the  agitation  cyanide  leach  method  and  recovery  of  the  zinc 
mineralization using the SART process (sulfidization, acidification, recycling, and thickening). The test work on the silver zone focused on cyanide leach recovery of the silver using 
“Bottle Roll” tests to simulate an agitation leach system and to determine the recovery of low grade zinc that occurs in the silver zone and high grade zinc from the zinc zone that had 
been blended with mineralization from the silver zone to the leach solution. The silver was recovered from the cyanide leach solution using the Merrill Crowe technique and the zinc was 
recovered from the leach solution using the SART process. The SART Process is a metallurgical process that regenerates and recycles the cyanide used in the leaching process of the 
silver and zinc and allows for the recovery of zinc that has been leached by the cyanide solution. The results showed an overall average silver recovery of 73.2% with peak values of 
89.0% and an overall average zinc recovery of 44% in the silver zone. 
 
Gabon, Africa Licenses and Interests 
 
On  December  13,  2013,  we  entered  into  a  binding  letter  of  agreement,  and  on  May  21,  2014  we  executed  a  share  purchase  agreement  (the  “Transaction”)  with BHK Mining Corp. 
(formerly BHK Resources, Inc.) (“BHK”) to sell all of the issued and outstanding securities of our former subsidiary, Dome International, which holds, indirectly, a 100% interest in and 
to the Ndjole manganese and gold license through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dome Gabon, for cash consideration of $1,500,000 and reimbursement of our expenses of $75,000. In 
addition, we hold the Mitzic exploration license in Gabon whose recoverability is highly uncertain.

Competition and Mineral Prices 
 
Mineral Prices 
(cid:160)  
Silver and zinc are commodities, and their prices are volatile. From January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 the price of silver ranged from a low of $15.28 per troy ounce to a high of $22.05 
per troy ounce, and from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 the price of zinc ranged from a low of $2,008 per tonne to a high of $2,327 per tonne. Silver and zinc prices are affected by 
many factors beyond our control, including prevailing interest rates and returns on other asset classes, expectations regarding inflation, speculation, currency values, governmental 
decisions regarding the disposal of precious metals stockpiles, global and regional demand and production, political and economic conditions and other factors. The competitive nature 
of the business and the risks with which we are therefore faced are discussed further in the item entitled “Risk Factors,” below. 
 
The following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, on the London Metal Exchange, high and low silver and zinc prices in U.S. dollars per troy ounce and per tonne, respectively. 
On October 31, 2014, the closing price of silver was $16.20 per troy ounce. On October 31, 2014, the closing price of zinc was $2,277 per tonne.

Competition 
 
Our  industry  is  highly  competitive.  We  compete  with  other  mining  and  exploration  companies  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  and  exploration  of  mineral  properties.  There  is 
competition for a limited number of mineral property acquisition opportunities, some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources, staff and facilities 
than we do. As a result, we may have difficulty acquiring attractive exploration properties, staking claims related to our properties and exploring properties. Our competitive position 
depends upon our ability to successfully and economically acquire and explore new and existing mineral properties. 
 
Government Regulation 
(cid:160)  
Mineral exploration activities are subject to various national, state/provincial, and local laws and regulations, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, 
taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Similarly, if any of our properties are 
developed and/or mined, those activities are also subject to significant governmental regulation and oversight. We will obtain the licenses, permits or other authorizations currently 
required to conduct our exploration program. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and the 
regulations applicable to the mineral interests we now hold in Mexico and Gabon. 
(cid:160)  
Environment Regulations 
(cid:160)  
Our activities are subject to various national and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming 
more restrictive. We intend to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We will conduct our operational compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. 
(cid:160)  
Changes to current state or federal laws and regulations in Mexico and Gabon could, in the future, require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation 
costs.  Although  we  are  unable  to  predict  what  additional  legislation,  if  any,  might  be  proposed  or  enacted,  additional  regulatory  requirements  could  impact  the  economics  of  our 
projects. 
(cid:160)  
During fiscal year 2014, we had no material environmental incidents or non-compliance with any applicable environmental regulations. 
 
Employees 
 
We have three employees, of which, all are full time. Contratistas, our wholly-owned operating subsidiary in Mexico currently has nine employees who are all full time.(cid:160)
mineral holding company in Mexico, does not have any employees.(cid:160)
 
Corporate Offices 
 
Our corporate offices are located at 925 West Georgia Street, Suite 1908, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 3L2. Our telephone number is (604) 687-5800, and our fax number is

Item 1A.(cid:160) RISK FACTORS  
 
A purchase of our securities involves a high degree of risk. Our business, operating or financial condition could be harmed due to any of the following risks. Accordingly, investors 
should carefully consider these risks in making a decision as to whether to purchase, sell or hold our securities. In addition, investors should note that the risks described below are 
not the only risks facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us, or risks that do not seem significant today, may also impair our business operations in the future. You should 
carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein, 
before making a decision to invest in our securities. 
 
RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS: 
 
We may have difficulty meeting our current and future capital requirements. 
(cid:160)  
Our management and our board of directors monitor our overall costs and expenses and, if necessary, adjust our programs and planned expenditures in an attempt to ensure we have 
sufficient operating capital.(cid:160) We continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures for our on-going exploration efforts at our Sierra Mojada Project.(cid:160) As of October 31, 2014, we 
had working capital of $2.9 million including $1.3 million of assets of discontinued operations held for sale and cash and cash equivalents of $1.9 million. The continued exploration and 
possible development of the Sierra Mojada Project will require significant amounts of additional capital.(cid:160)If we are unable to fund future operations by way of financing, including public 
or  private  offerings  of  equity  or  debt  securities,  we  will  need  to  significantly  reduce  operations,  which  will  result  in  an  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and 
exploration activities. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not have a credit, off-take or other commercial financing 
arrangement in place that would finance continued evaluation or development of the Sierra Mojada Project and we believe that securing credit for these projects may be difficult due to 
continuing volatility in global credit markets. Moreover, equity financing may not be available on attractive terms and if available, will likely result in significant dilution to existing 
shareholders.(cid:160)  
 
We are an exploration stage mining company with no history of operations. 
 
We are an exploration stage enterprise engaged in mineral exploration, primarily in Mexico. We have a very limited operating history and are subject to all the risks inherent in a new 
business enterprise. As an exploration stage company, we may never enter the development and production stages. To date we have had no revenues and have relied upon equity 
financing to fund our operations. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications, and delays frequently encountered in 
connection with an exploration stage business, and the competitive and regulatory environment in which we operate and will operate, such as under-capitalization, personnel limitations, 
and limited financing sources. 
 
We have no commercially mineable ore body. 
 
No commercially mineable ore body has been delineated on our Sierra Mojada Project or on our exploration license in Gabon, Africa, nor have our properties been shown to contain 
proven or probable mineral reserves. The PEA Technical Report on our Sierra Mojada Project was preliminary in nature and investors should not assume that the projections contained 
therein will ever be realized. We cannot assure you that any mineral deposits we identify on the Sierra Mojada Project, in Gabon or on another property will qualify as an ore body that 
can be legally and economically exploited or that any particular level of recovery of silver or other minerals from discovered mineralization will in fact be realized. Most exploration 
projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable ore deposits. Even if the presence of reserves is established at a project, the legal and economic viability of the project 
may not justify exploitation. 
 
Mineral resource estimates may not be reliable. 
 
There  are  numerous  uncertainties  inherent  in  estimating  quantities  of  mineralized  material  such  as  silver,  zinc,  lead,  and  gold,  including  many  factors  beyond  our  control,  and  no 
assurance can be given that the recovery of mineralized material will be realized. In general, estimates of mineralized material are based upon a number of factors and assumptions made 
as of the date on which the estimates were determined, including:
ö
geological and engineering estimates that have inherent uncertainties and the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies;
ö
ö
the judgment of the engineers preparing the estimate;
estimates of future metals prices and operating costs;
13
(cid:160)
ö
ö
the quality and quantity of available data;
the interpretation of that data; and
ö
the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results.
All estimates are, to some degree, uncertain. For these reasons, estimates of the recoverable mineral resources prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different 
times, may vary substantially. As such, there is significant uncertainty in any mineralized material estimate and actual deposits encountered and the economic viability of a deposit may 
differ materially from our estimates. 
 
Our business plan is highly speculative, and its success largely depends on the successful exploration of our Sierra Mojada concessions. 
 
Although we hold an exploration license in Gabon, our business plan is focused on exploring the Sierra Mojada concessions to identify reserves, and if appropriate, to ultimately 
develop this property. Further, although we have reported mineralized material on our Sierra Mojada Project, we have not established any reserves and remain in the exploration stage. 
We  may  never  enter  the  development  or  production  stage.  Exploration  of  mineralization  and  determination  of  whether  the  mineralization  might  be  extracted  profitably  is  highly 
speculative, and it may take a number of years until production is possible, during which time the economic viability of the project may change. Substantial expenditures are required to 
establish reserves, extract metals from ore and to construct mining and processing facilities. 
 
The Sierra Mojada Project is subject to all of the risks inherent in mineral exploration and development. The economic feasibility of any mineral exploration and/or development project is 
based upon, among other things, estimates of the size and grade of mineral reserves, proximity to infrastructures and other resources (such as water and power), anticipated production 
rates,  capital  and  operating  costs,  and  metals  prices.  To  advance  from  an  exploration  project  to  a  development  project,  we  will  need  to  overcome  various  hurdles,  including  the 
completion of favorable feasibility studies, issuance of necessary permits, and the ability to raise significant further capital to fund activities. There can be no assurance that we will be 
successful in overcoming these risks. Because of our focus on the Sierra Mojada Project, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the 
impact of adverse conditions unique to the Torreon, Mexico region, as the Sierra Mojada Project is located 250 kilometers north of this area. 
 
Due to our history of operating losses, we are uncertain that we will be able to maintain sufficient cash to accomplish our business objectives. 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, we suffered net losses of $4,914,251 and $7,466,580 respectively. At October 31, 2014, we had stockholders’ equity of 
$27,368,957 and working capital of $2,947,144 including $1,281,518 of assets of discontinued operations held for sale and $8,894 of liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale. 
Significant amounts of capital will be required to continue to explore and potentially develop the Sierra Mojada concessions. We are not engaged in any revenue producing activities, 
and we do not expect to be in the near future. Currently, our sources of funding consist of the sale of additional equity securities, entering into joint venture agreements or selling a 
portion of our interests in our assets. There is no assurance that any additional capital that we will require will be obtainable on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Failure to obtain such 
additional financing could result in delays or indefinite postponement of further exploration of our projects. Additional financing, if available, will likely result in substantial dilution to 
existing stockholders. 
 
Our exploration activities require significant amounts of capital that may not be recovered. 
 
Mineral exploration activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive or extractable resources will be encountered. There can be no assurance that 
our activities will ultimately lead to an economically feasible project or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment. Mineral exploration often involves unprofitable efforts, 
including drilling operations that ultimately do not further our exploration efforts. The cost of minerals exploration is often uncertain and cost overruns are common. Our drilling and 
exploration operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including title problems, weather conditions, 
compliance with governmental requirements, including permitting issues, and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services.

Our financial condition could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso given our focus on the Sierra, 
Mojada Project. 
 
Our financial condition is affected in part by currency exchange rates, as portions of our exploration costs in Mexico and Gabon are denominated in the local currency. A weakening U.S. 
dollar relative to the Mexican peso will have the effect of increasing exploration costs while a strengthening U.S. dollar will have the effect of reducing exploration costs. The Gabon 
local currency is tied to the Euro. Some of our exploration activities in Mexico are tied to the peso. The exchange rates between the Euro and the U.S. dollar and between the peso and 
U.S. dollar have fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions, general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control. We seek to mitigate exposure to 
foreign currency fluctuations by holding a majority of our cash balances in U.S. dollars. 
 
THE BUSINESS OF MINERAL EXPLORATION IS SUBJECT TO MANY RISKS: 
 
There are inherent risks in the mineral exploration industry 
 
We are subject to all of the risks inherent in the minerals exploration industry including, without limitation, the following:
ö we are subject to competition from a large number of companies, many of which are significantly larger than we are, in the acquisition, exploration, and development of mining
properties;
ö we might not be able raise enough money to pay the fees and taxes and perform the labor necessary to maintain our concessions in good force;
ö
ö
ö
exploration for minerals is highly speculative and involves substantial risks and is frequently un-productive, even when conducted on properties known to contain significant 
quantities of mineralization, and our exploration projects may not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of ore;
the  probability  of  an  individual  prospect  ever  having  reserves  that  meet  the  requirements  for  reporting  under  SEC  Industry  Guide  7  is  remote  and  any  funds  spent  on 
exploration may be lost;
our  operations  are  subject  to  a  variety  of  existing  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  exploration  and  development,  permitting  procedures,  safety  precautions,  property 
reclamation, employee health and safety, air quality standards, pollution and other environmental protection controls and we may not be able to comply with these regulations 
and controls; and
ö
a large number of factors beyond our control, including fluctuations in metal prices, inflation, and other economic conditions, will affect the economic feasibility of mining.
Metals prices are subject to extreme fluctuation. 
 
Our activities are influenced by the prices of commodities, including silver, zinc, lead, gold, manganese and other metals. These prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous 
factors beyond our control, including interest rates, expectations for inflation, speculation, currency values (in particular the strength of the U.S. dollar), global and regional demand, 
political and economic conditions and production costs in major metal producing regions of the world. 
 
Our ability to establish reserves through our exploration activities, our future profitability and our long-term viability, depend, in large part, on the market prices of silver, zinc, lead, gold, 
manganese and other metals. The market prices for these metals are volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:
ö
ö
ö
ö
ö
ö
global or regional consumption patterns;
supply of, and demand for, silver, zinc, lead, gold, manganese and other metals;
speculative activities and producer hedging activities;
expectations for inflation;
political and economic conditions; and
supply of, and demand for, consumables required for production.
Future weakness in the global economy could increase volatility in metals prices or depress metals prices, which could in turn reduce the value of our properties, make it more difficult to 
raise additional capital, and make it uneconomical for us to continue our exploration activities.
(cid:160)
15
There are inherent risks with foreign operations. 
 
Our business activities are primarily conducted in Mexico, and we also hold interests in Gabon, and as such, our activities are exposed to various levels of foreign political, economic 
and other risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, terrorism, hostage taking, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange 
rates, high rates of inflation, labor unrest, the risks of war or civil unrest, expropriation and nationalization, renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions, licenses, permits, 
approvals  and  contracts,  illegal  mining,  changes  in  taxation  policies,  restrictions  on  foreign  exchange  and  repatriation,  changing  political  conditions,  currency  controls  and 
governmental regulations that favor or require the rewarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular 
jurisdiction. 
 
Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Mexico and/or Gabon may adversely affect our exploration and possible future development activities. 
We may also be affected in varying degrees by government regulations with respect to, but not limited to, foreign investment, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land 
use, land claims of local people, water use and mine safety. Failure to comply strictly with applicable laws, regulations and local practices relating to mineral right applications and 
tenure, could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners with carried or other interests. 
 
The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, legislation in the U.S., 
Canada, Mexico and/or Gabon regulating foreign trade, investment and taxation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
 
Our Sierra Mojada Project is located in Mexico and is subject to various levels of political, economic, legal and other risks. 
 
The Sierra Mojada Project, our primary focus, is in Mexico. In the past, Mexico has been subject to political instability, changes and uncertainties, which have resulted in changes to 
existing governmental regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities. Mexico’s status as a developing country may make it more difficult for us to obtain any required 
financing for the Sierra Mojada Project or other projects in Mexico in the future. Our Sierra Mojada Project is also subject to a variety of governmental regulations governing health and 
worker safety, employment standards, waste disposal, protection of historic and archaeological sites, mine development, protection of endangered and protected species and other 
matters. Mexican regulators have broad authority to shut down and/or levy fines against facilities that do not comply with regulations or standards. 
 
Our exploration activities in Mexico may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions 
that increase the costs related to the Sierra Mojada Project. Changes, if any, in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude may adversely affect our financial condition. 
Expansion of our activities will be subject to the need to obtain sufficient access to adequate supplies of water, assure the availability of sufficient power, as well as sufficient surface 
rights which could be affected by government policy and competing operations in the area. 
 
We also have litigation risk with respect to our operations.(cid:160) In particular, in July 2014 a local cooperative named Sociedad Cooperativa de Exploración Minera Mineros Norteños, S.C.L. 
(“Mineros Norteños”) filed an action (the “Action”) against our Mexican subsidiary, Minera Metalin, claiming that we breached an agreement regarding the development of the Sierra 
Mojada Project.(cid:160) Mineros Norteños is seeking payment of a royalty, including interest at a rate of 6% per annum from August 30, 2004, notwithstanding that no revenue has been 
produced from the applicable mining concessions, and it is also seeking payment of wages to the cooperative’s members from August 30, 2004, notwithstanding that none of the 
individuals were ever hired or performed work for us.(cid:160) Although we and our Mexican legal counsel believe this claim is without merit and have asserted all applicable defenses, we may 
incur costs associated with defending the claim.(cid:160) We have not accrued any amounts in our financial statements with respect to this claim.  
 
The occurrence of these various factors and uncertainties cannot be accurately predicted and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Future changes in applicable laws 
and regulations or changes in their enforcement or regulatory interpretation could negatively impact current or planned exploration activities with the Sierra Mojada Project or in respect 
to  any  other  projects  in  which  we  become  involved  in  Mexico.  Any  failure  to  comply  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  even  if  inadvertent,  could  result  in  the  interruption  of 
exploration operations or material fines, penalties or other liabilities.
16
(cid:160)
Title to our properties may be challenged or defective. 
 
Our future operations, including our activities at the Sierra Mojada Project and other exploration activities, will require additional permits from various governmental authorities. Our 
operations  are  and  will  continue  to  be  governed  by  laws  and  regulations  governing  prospecting,  mineral  exploration,  exports,  taxes,  labor  standards,  occupational  health,  waste 
disposal, toxic substances, land use, environmental protection, mine safety, mining royalties and other matters. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required 
licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, and that such terms will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or 
that the issuance of such licenses, permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties. 
 
We attempt to confirm the validity of our rights of title to, or contract rights with respect to, each mineral property in which we have a material interest. However, we cannot guarantee 
that title to our properties will not be challenged. The Sierra Mojada Property may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, interests or native land claims, and title may be affected 
by undetected defects. There may be valid challenges to the title of any of the claims comprising the Sierra Mojada Property that, if successful, could impair possible development 
and/or  operations  with  respect  to  such  properties  in  the  future.  Challenges  to  permits  or  property  rights,  whether  successful  or  unsuccessful;  changes  to  the  terms  of  permits  or 
property rights; or a failure to comply with the terms of any permits or property rights that have been obtained, could have a material adverse effect on our business by delaying or 
preventing or making continued operations economically unfeasible. 
(cid:160)  
A title defect could result in Silver Bull losing all or a portion of its right, title, and interest to and in the properties to which the title defect relates. Title insurance generally is not 
available, and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure title to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. In addition, we may be unable 
to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties. We annually monitor the official land and mining records in Mexico City to determine if 
there are annotations indicating the existence of a legal challenge against the validity of any of our concessions. As of January, 2015 and to the best of our knowledge, there are no 
such annotations, nor are we aware of any challenges from the government or from third parties, except for a Court order to record the Action with the Public Registry of Mines. We do 
not have evidence or information as to the enforcement of this Court order to date. However based on a subsequent ruling it is unlikely that the Court order will be enforced. 
 
In addition, in connection with the purchase of certain mining concessions, the prior management of Silver Bull agreed to pay a net royalty interest on revenue from future mineral sales 
on certain concessions at the Sierra Mojada Project, including concessions on which a significant portion of our mineralized material is located. The aggregate amount payable under 
this royalty is capped at $6.875 million, an amount that will only be reached if there is significant future production from the concessions. As noted above, this royalty is currently the 
subject of a dispute with a local cooperative. In addition, records from prior management indicate that additional royalty interests may have been created, although the continued 
applicability and scope of these interests are uncertain. The existence of these royalty interests may have a material effect on the economic feasibility of potential future development of 
the Sierra Mojada Project. 
 
We are subject to complex environmental and other regulatory risks, which could expose us to significant liability and delay and, potentially, the suspension or termination of our 
exploration efforts. 
 
Our mineral exploration activities are subject to federal, state and local environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our mineral properties are located. These regulations mandate, 
among other things, the maintenance of air and water quality standards and land reclamation. They also set forth limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of 
solid  and  hazardous  waste.  No  assurance  can  be  given  that  environmental  standards  imposed  by  these  governments  will  not  be  changed,  thereby  possibly  materially  adversely 
affecting our proposed activities. Compliance with these environmental requirements may also necessitate significant capital outlays or may materially affect our earning power. 
 
Environmental legislation is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental 
assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors and employees. As a result of recent changes in environmental 
laws in Mexico, for example, more legal actions supported or sponsored by non-governmental groups interested in halting projects may be filed against companies operating in all 
industrial sectors, including the mining sector. Mexican projects are also subject to the environmental agreements entered into by Mexico, the United States and Canada in connection 
with the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 
Future changes in environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our projects are located may adversely affect our exploration activities, make them prohibitively expensive, or 
prohibit them altogether. Environmental hazards may exist on the properties in which we currently hold interests, such as the Sierra Mojada Project, or may hold interests in the future, 
which are unknown to us at present and that have been caused by us or previous owners or operators, or that may have occurred naturally. We may be liable for remediating any 
damage that we may have caused. The liability could include costs for removing or remediating the release and damage to natural resources, including ground water, as well as the 
payment of fines and penalties.
17
(cid:160)
We may face a shortage of water. 
 
Water is essential in all phases of the exploration and development of mineral properties. It is used in such processes as exploration, drilling, leaching, placer mining, dredging, testing, 
and hydraulic mining. Both the lack of available water and the cost of acquisition may make an otherwise viable project economically impossible to complete. In November 2013 Silver 
Bull was granted the right to exploit up to 3.5 million cubic meters of water per year from six different well sites by the water regulatory body in Mexico, Comision Nacional de Agua, but 
it has yet to be determined if the six well sites can produce this much water over a sustained period of time. 
 
We may face a shortage of supplies and materials. 
 
The mineral industry has experienced from time to time shortages of certain supplies and materials necessary in the exploration for and evaluation of mineral deposits. The prices at 
which such supplies and materials are available have also greatly increased. Our planned operations could be subject to delays due to such shortages and further price escalations 
could increase our costs for such supplies and materials. Our experience and that of others in the industry is that suppliers are often unable to meet contractual obligations for supplies, 
equipment, materials, and services, and that alternate sources of supply do not exist. 
 
Competition for outside engineers and consultants is fierce. 
 
We are heavily dependent upon outside engineers and other professionals to complete work on our exploration projects. The mining industry has experienced significant growth over 
the  last  several  years  and  as  a  result,  many  engineering  and  consulting  firms  have  experienced  a  shortage  of  qualified  engineering  personnel.  We  closely  monitor  our  outside 
consultants through regular meetings and review of resource allocations and project milestones. However, the lack of qualified personnel combined with increased mining projects 
could result in delays in completing work on our exploration projects or result in higher costs to keep personnel focused on our project. 
 
Our non-operating properties are subject to various hazards. 
 
We are subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, flooding, earthquakes and periodic 
interruptions  due  to  inclement  or  hazardous  weather  conditions.  These  occurrences  could  result  in  damage  to,  or  destruction  of,  mineral  properties  or  future  production  facilities, 
personal injury or death, environmental damage, delays in our exploration activities, asset write-downs, monetary losses and possible legal liability. We may not be insured against all 
losses or liabilities, either because such insurance is unavailable or because we have elected not to purchase such insurance due to high premium costs or other reasons. Although we 
maintain insurance in an amount that we consider to be adequate, liabilities might exceed policy limits, in which event we could incur significant costs that could adversely affect our 
activities.(cid:160) The realization of any significant liabilities in connection with our activities as described above could negatively affect our activities and the price of our common stock.  
 
We need and rely upon key personnel. 
 
Presently, we employ a limited number of full-time employees, utilize outside consultants, and in large part rely on the personal efforts of our officers and directors. Our success will 
depend, in part, upon the ability to attract and retain qualified employees. In particular, we have only three executive officers, Brian Edgar, Timothy Barry and Sean Fallis, and the loss of 
the services of any of these three would adversely affect our business.
18
(cid:160)
RISKS RELATING TO OUR COMMON STOCK: 
 
Further equity financings may lead to the dilution of our common stock. 
 
In order to finance future operations, we may raise funds through the issuance of common stock or the issuance of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common stock. 
We cannot predict the size of future issuances of common stock or the size and terms of future issuances of debt instruments or other securities convertible into common stock or the 
effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our securities will have on the market price of our common stock. Any transaction involving the issuance of previously authorized but 
unissued shares, or securities convertible into common stock, would result in dilution, possibly substantial, to present and prospective security holders. Demand for equity securities in 
the mining industry has been weak, therefore equity financing may not be available on attractive terms and if available, will likely result in significant dilution to existing shareholders. 
 
No dividends are anticipated. 
 
At the present time, we do not anticipate paying dividends, cash or otherwise, on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Future dividends will depend on our earnings, if any, our 
financial requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will pay dividends. 
 
Our stock price can be extremely volatile. 
 
Our common stock is listed on the TSX and NYSE MKT. The trading price of our common stock has been, and could continue to be, subject to wide fluctuations in response to 
announcements  of  our  business  developments,  results  and  progress  of  our  exploration  activities  at  the  Sierra  Mojada  Project  and  in  Gabon,  progress  reports  on  our  exploration 
activities, and other events or factors. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility generally in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the 
market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These fluctuations could be in response to:
volatility in metal prices;
ö
ö
ö
political developments in the foreign countries in which our properties, or properties for which we perform services, are located; and
news reports relating to trends in our industry or general economic conditions.
These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. 
 
We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as to whether our common stock will sustain 
market prices at or near its offering price, or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.

Item 6.(cid:160) SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA  
 
Not applicable. 
 
Item 7.(cid:160)
 
Business Overview 
 
Silver Bull, incorporated in Nevada, is an exploration stage company, engaged in the business of mineral exploration.(cid:160)Our primary objective is to define sufficient mineral reserves on the 
Sierra Mojada Property to justify the development of a mechanized mining operation. We conduct our operations in Mexico through our wholly-owned Mexican subsidiaries, Minera 
Metalin  and  Contratistas,  and  through  Minera  Metalin’s  wholly-owned  subsidiary,  Minas.  However,  as  noted  above,  we  have  not  established  any  reserves  at  the  Sierra  Mojada 
Property, and are in the exploration stage and may never enter the development or production stage. 
 
Our principal offices are located at 925 West Georgia Street, Suite 1908, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 3L2, and our telephone number is 604-687-5800.(cid:160)  
 
Current Year Developments 
 
Sierra Mojada Property 
 
Our board of directors approved a calendar year 2014 budget of $1.8 million for the Sierra Mojada Property. The focus of the 2014 calendar year program was continuing to progress in 
securing additional surface rights, maintenance of our property concessions, further studying power and water alternatives and continued metallurgical work. 
 
Mineralized Material Estimate 
 
On December 19, 2013, JDS Energy & Mining Inc. delivered Silver Bull's amended PEA Technical Report on the silver and zinc mineralization for the Sierra Mojada Project in accordance 
with Canadian National Instrument 43-101.(cid:160)The PEA Technical Report includes an update on the silver and zinc mineralization which was estimated from 1,372 diamond drill holes, 25 
reverse circulation drill holes, 9,025 channel samples and 2,345 long holes.(cid:160) At a cutoff grade of 25 grams/tonne of silver for mineralized material, the PEA Technical Report indicates 
mineralized material of 71.1 million tonnes at an average silver grade of 71.5 grams/tonne silver and an average zinc percentage of 1.34%. 
 
“Mineralized material” as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, although permissible under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Industry Guide 7, does not indicate 
“reserves”  by  SEC  standards.(cid:160)
(cid:160)We  cannot  be  certain  that  any  part  of  the  Sierra  Mojada  Project  will  ever  be  confirmed  or  converted  into  SEC  Industry  Guide  7  compliant 
“reserves.”(cid:160)
(cid:160) Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the mineralized material will ever be confirmed or converted into reserves or that mineralized material can 
be economically or legally extracted. 
 
Mexican Tax Reform 
 
On December 11, 2013 the Mexican tax reform package was published in the official gazette and applied as from January 1, 2014.(cid:160) There are a number of significant changes in the 
Mexican tax reform package. The planned corporate tax rate reductions to 29% in 2014 and 28% thereafter have been repealed and the corporate tax rate will remain at 30%. The business 
flat tax (IETU) has been repealed. A special mining duty of 7.5% will apply to net profits derived by a property concession holder from the sale or transfer of extraction related activities. 
Net profits for the purpose of this special mining duty will be determined in a manner similar to the calculation of general taxable income with certain deductions not available including 
for investment in fixed assets and interest. In addition, owners of property concessions will be required to pay a 0.5% tax on gross income derived from the sale of gold, silver and 
platinum. Further, a 10% withholding tax on dividend distributions has been introduced but will not supercede treaty rates.

2015 Exploration Program 
 
As discussed in the “Material Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources” section below we have approved a calendar year 2015 budget of $0.7 million for the 
Sierra Mojada Property. The focus of the 2015 calendar year program is continuing to progress in securing additional surface rights, maintenance of our property concessions, internally 
remodeling the zinc resource and the potential for a standalone zinc project and internally studying a smaller silver open pit as discussed below. 
 
During  2015  we  intend  to  internally  investigate  the  potential  for  a  high  grade  underground  zinc  oxide  mine.  To  this  purpose  we  are  completing  an  internal  remodeling  of  the  zinc 
resource, much of which was not included in the resource outlined in the PEA Technical Report. 
 
We also intend to do an internal examination on the potential for a smaller silver open pit than the one proposed in the PEA Technical Report. The focus will be to target the "at-
surface" silver mineralization with a smaller project. Although a smaller project would produce fewer ounces than proposed in the PEA Technical Report, the low strip and smaller plant 
would be expected to significantly reduce the overall capital costs needed to put the project into production. 
 
During 2015, and subject to market conditions, we intend to examine the potential for fuming high grade zinc. Previous test work completed by Hazen Research Inc. at the request of us 
in 2012 focused on roasting the ore in a rotary kiln to fume off the zinc and collect it as a zinc oxide concentrate. Recoveries of up to 98% of the zinc were recorded. 
 
The roasting of the zinc samples aims to simulate a "Waelz Kiln", a kiln which is used extensively to recycle zinc from steel dust and which regularly achieves recoveries in excess of 
90%. In considering this process, the zinc resource at Sierra Mojada has a number of possible advantages: It lies in the state of Coahuila which is the largest coal producing state in 
Mexico, or we may be able to extend an existing gas pipeline to site (as contemplated in our PEA). Either option could provide the fuel to run the kiln. It also has a functioning railway 
right to site to potentially allow for transport of coal to the site and of the zinc concentrate from the site. 
 
Metallurgical Studying 
 
In  addition  we  previously  conducted  a  metallurgical  program  to  test  the  recovery  of  the  silver  mineralization  using  the  agitation  cyanide  leach  method  and  recovery  of  the  zinc 
mineralization using the SART process (sulfidization, acidification, recycling, and thickening). The test work on the silver zone focused on cyanide leach recovery of the silver using 
“Bottle Roll” tests to simulate an agitation leach system and to determine the recovery of low grade zinc that occurs in the silver zone and high grade zinc from the zinc zone that had 
been blended with mineralization from the silver zone to the leach solution. The silver was recovered from the cyanide leach solution using the Merrill Crowe technique and the zinc was 
recovered from the leach solution using the SART process. The SART Process is a metallurgical process that regenerates and recycles the cyanide used in the leaching process of the 
silver and zinc and allows for the recovery of zinc that has been leached by the cyanide solution. The results showed an overall average silver recovery of 73.2% with peak values of 
89.0% and an overall average zinc recovery of 44% in the silver zone. 
 
Gabon Property 
 
On  December  13,  2013,  we  entered  into  a  binding  letter  of  agreement,  and  on  May  21,  2014  we  executed  a  share  purchase  agreement  (the  “Transaction”)  with BHK Mining Corp. 
(formerly BHK Resources, Inc.) (“BHK”) to sell all of the issued and outstanding securities of our former subsidiary, Dome International, which holds, indirectly, a 100% interest in and 
to the Ndjole manganese and gold license through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Dome Gabon, for cash consideration of $1,500,000 and reimbursement of our expenses of $75,000. Also, 
we recorded an impairment of $188,000 during the year ended October 31, 2014 for the Ndjole concession as its carrying amount was not recoverable based on the implied fair value due 
to expected net proceeds from the Transaction. The Transaction was completed in January 2015 and we received $1,500,000 in cash upon consummation of the sale. In addition, we hold 
the Mitzic exploration license in Gabon whose recoverability is highly uncertain.

Results of Operations(cid:160)   
 
Year Ended October 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2013 
 
For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014, we reported a consolidated net loss of $4,914,000 or approximately $0.03 per share, compared to a consolidated net loss of $7,467,000 or 
approximately  $0.05  per  share  during  the  fiscal  year  ended  October  31,  2013.  The  $2,553,000  decrease  in  the  consolidated  net  loss  was  primarily  due  to  a  $1,694,000  decrease  in 
exploration and property holding costs and a $829,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses in the 2014 fiscal year from the 2013 fiscal year. 
 
Exploration and Property Holding Costs 
 
Exploration and property holding costs decreased $1,694,000 to $2,915,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $4,609,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. This decrease was mainly the result of not 
having a drilling program on the Sierra Mojada Property during the 2014 fiscal year, whereas in the 2013 fiscal year we had a small underground drill program. In addition, we had a 
significantly reduced metallurgical program in the 2014 fiscal year compared to the 2013 fiscal year and during the 2013 fiscal year we were incurring expenditures on the PEA Technical 
Report. As a result of the reduced exploration program we reduced our work force at the Sierra Mojada Property, and therefore our staffing and consultants costs were lower in the 2014 
compared to the last year. In addition, our exploration and property holding costs included a $1,559,000 concession impairment in the 2014  fiscal year as we decided not to pursue 
further work on certain concessions in the Sierra Mojada Property resulting in an impairment of $1,234,000 and we have written off the capitalized concession balance related to the 
Mitzic concession of $325,000 as the recoverability is highly uncertain compared to a $714,000 concession impairment in the 2013 fiscal year as we decided not to pursue further work on 
certain concessions in the Sierra Mojada Property. 
 
General and Administrative Costs 
 
General and administrative expenses decreased $829,000 to $1,790,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $2,619,000 in the 2013 fiscal year as described below. 
 
Personnel costs decreased $164,000 to $730,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $894,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation 
expense to $141,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $273,000 in the 2013 fiscal year as a result of stock option vesting in the 2014 fiscal year having a lower fair value than stock option 
vesting in the 2013 fiscal year. 
(cid:160)  
Office and administrative expenses decreased $444,000 to $539,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $983,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. This decrease is mainly the result of having significant 
investor relations activities and corporate travel related to the February 2013 equity financing in the 2013 fiscal year and a general decrease in investor relation activities and corporate 
travel in the 2014 fiscal year. 
 
Professional fees decreased $166,000 to $238,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $404,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in legal and accounting fees in 
the 2014 fiscal year compared to the 2013 fiscal year. 
 
Directors’ fees decreased $98,000 to $261,000 for the 2014 fiscal year as compared to $359,000 for the 2013 fiscal year. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock based 
compensation expense to $87,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $176,000 in the 2013 fiscal year as a result of stocks options vesting in the 2014 fiscal year having a lower fair value than 
stock options vesting in the 2013 fiscal year. 
 
We recorded a provision of $19,000 for uncollectible value-added taxes (“VAT”) in the 2014 fiscal year compared to a recovery of $25,000 in the 2013 fiscal year.(cid:160)
(cid:160) The allowance for 
uncollectible  taxes  was  estimated  by  management  based  upon  a  number  of  factors  including  the  length  of  time  the  returns  have  been  outstanding,  responses  received  from  tax 
authorities, general economic conditions in Mexico and Gabon and estimated net recovery after commissions. 
 
Other Income (Expenses) 
 
We recorded other expense of $10,000 in the 2014 fiscal year compared to other income of $238,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. The significant factors were a $89,000 foreign currency 
transaction  loss  in  the  2014  fiscal  year  which  was  partially  offset  by  a  $68,000  miscellaneous  income  as  compared  to  a  $52,000  foreign  currency  transaction  gain  and  a  $153,000 
miscellaneous income in the 2013 fiscal year.
24
(cid:160)
The miscellaneous income in the 2014 fiscal year was the result of a gain on office and mining equipment sales at the Sierra Mojada Property and the miscellaneous income in the 2013 
fiscal year is primarily due to a gain on office and mining equipment sales at the Sierra Mojada Property. 
 
The  foreign  currency  transaction  loss  in  the  2014  fiscal  year  was  primarily  the  result  of  the  depreciation  of  the  Central  African  Franc  (“$CFA”)  and  the  resulting  impact  on  the 
intercompany loans between Silver Bull and African Resources. The foreign currency transaction gain in the 2013 fiscal year was primarily the result of the appreciation of the Central 
African franc and the resulting impact on the intercompany loans between Silver Bull and African Resources. 
 
Income Tax Expense 
 
Income tax expense decreased $50,000 to $15,000 in the 2014 fiscal year from $65,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. The decrease was primarily due to reduced staffing in Mexico. 
 
Results of Discontinued Operations 
 
Pursuant to accounting principles general accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), Dome International and Dome Gabon have been reported in discontinued operations for 
the year ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 as described in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section. Loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense for the 
year ended October 31, 2014 was $184,000 which is mainly a result of $28,000 for exploration and property holding costs recovery and, a $188,000 concession impairment related to the 
Ndjole concession as compared to a loss from discontinued operations, net of income tax expense for the year ended October 31, 2013 of $412,000 which is mainly a result of $335,000 for 
exploration  and  property  holding  costs  and  a  $557,000  concession  impairment  related  to  Ndjole  concession,  which  was  partially  offset  by  a  $492,000  miscellaneous  income.  The 
miscellaneous income was the result of our determination that AngloGold abandoned all of its rights and benefits under the two joint venture agreements upon AngloGold's termination 
of these agreements, and therefore the VAT receivable outstanding at the termination of the agreements and subsequent cash collected is the sole property of the Company. 
 
Material Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
Cash Flows 
 
During the 2014 fiscal year, we primarily utilized cash and cash on hand to fund exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada Property and for general and administrative expenses. As a 
result of the exploration activities and general and administrative expenses, cash and cash on hand decreased from $5,206,000 at October 31, 2013 to $1,879,000 at October 31, 2014. 
 
Cash flows used in operations for the 2014 fiscal year was $2,992,000 as compared to $5,425,000 in the 2013 fiscal year.(cid:160) This decrease was mainly due to the decreased exploration work 
at the Sierra Mojada Property and decreased general and administrative expenses in the 2014 fiscal year compared to the 2013 fiscal year which was partially offset by the increase VAT 
collected in the 2013 fiscal year. 
 
Cash flows used in investing activity for the 2014 fiscal year was $377,000 as compared to $658,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. This decrease was mainly due to a decrease of $430,000 to 
$378,000 in property concessions acquisition costs in the 2014 fiscal year compared to $808,000 in the 2013 fiscal year. 
 
Cash flows provided by financing activities for the 2014 fiscal year was $nil as compared to $8,127,000 for the 2013 fiscal year. The majority of the cash flow provided by financing 
activities in the comparable period last year was due to the February 2013 equity financing. 
 
Capital Resources 
 
As of October, 2014, we had cash and cash on hand of $1,879,000 and working capital of $2,947,000 including $1,282,000 of assets of discontinued operations held for sale and $9,000 of 
liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale as compared to cash and cash on hand of $5,206,000 and working capital of $6,218,000 including $1,554,000 of assets of discontinued 
operations held for sale and $4,000 of liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale as of October 31, 2013. The decrease in our liquidity and working capital were primarily the result 
of the exploration activities at the Sierra Mojada Property and general and administrative expense.
25
(cid:160)
(cid:160)The on -going uncertainty and volatility in the global financial and capital markets have limited the availability of funding.(cid:160)
Since inception, we have relied primarily upon proceeds from sales of our equity securities and warrant exercises as our primary sources of financing to fund our operations. We 
anticipate that we will continue to rely on sales of our securities in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing 
stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to complete any additional sales of our equity securities or that we will be able arrange for other financing to fund our planned 
business activities. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K. 
 
Capital Requirements and Liquidity; Need for Subsequent Funding 
 
Our management and board of directors monitor our overall costs, expenses, and financial resources and, if necessary, will adjust our planned operational expenditures in an attempt to 
ensure we have sufficient operating capital.(cid:160) We continue to evaluate our costs and planned expenditures including for our Sierra Mojada Property as discussed below. 
 
The continued exploration of the Sierra Mojada Property will require significant amounts of additional capital. In January 2015, our board of directors approved a calendar year 2015 
budget of $0.7 million for the Sierra Mojada Property and a $1.5 million budget for general and administrative expenses. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.4 million in 
cash on hand and in January 2015 we received an additional $1.5 million from the sale of Dome International. We will continue to evaluate our ability to raise additional capital, and we 
will  reduce  expenditures  on  the  Sierra  Mojada  Property  if  we  determine  that  additional  capital  is  unavailable  or  available  on  terms  that  we  determine  are  unacceptable.  Also,  the 
continued exploration and if warranted, development, of the Sierra Mojada Property ultimately will require us to raise additional capital, identify other sources of funding or identify 
another strategic transaction.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Debt or equity financing may 
not  be  available  to  us  on  acceptable  terms,  if  at  all.  Equity  financing,  if  available,  will  likely  result  in  substantial  dilution  to  existing  stockholders.(cid:160)  If  we  are  unable  to  fund  future 
operations by way of financing, including public or private offerings of equity or debt securities, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted. 
(cid:160)  
Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, 
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our stockholders. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Year Ended October 31, 2014 
 
Effective in July, 2014, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-10: Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial reporting Requirements, 
Including  an  Amendment  to  Variable  Interest  Entities  Guidance  in  Topic  810,  Consolidation.  The  standard  removes  the  definition  of  a  development  stage  entity  from  the  Master 
Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In 
addition, the standard eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and shareholder 
equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) 
disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The standard is effective for annual 
reporting  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2014,  and  interim  periods  therein,  with  early  adoption  permitted.  As  a  result,  we  eliminated  inception  to  date  information  from  our 
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. 
 
Effective November 1, 2013, we adopted ASU 2011-11, "Balance Sheet (Topic 201): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." This ASU added certain additional disclosure 
requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the 
disclosure for our consolidated financial statements. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 
In  August  2014,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standard  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  ASU  2014-15,  Presentation  of  Financial  Statements—Going  Concern  (Subtopic  205-40):  Disclosure  of 
Uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt 
about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The update provides guidance to an organization’s management, with 
principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement 
footnotes.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods  ending  after  December  15,  2016,  and  interim  periods  within  annual  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2016.  Early 
application is permitted. We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial position, result of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time.
26
(cid:160)
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carry Forward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a 
Tax Credit Carry Forward Exists.” The updated guidance requires an entity to net its unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same jurisdiction net operating loss 
carry forwards, a similar tax loss, or tax credit carry forwards. A gross presentation will be required only if such carry forwards are not available or would not be used by the entity to 
settle any additional income taxes resulting from disallowance of the uncertain tax provision. The update is effective prospectively for our fiscal year beginning November 1, 2014. We 
do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and the disclosure requirements for our consolidated 
financial statements. 
 
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and 
Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.” Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals of a component or group of components of an entity representing a strategic shift that has 
(or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results are presented as discontinued operations. In addition, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures about 
discontinued operations that will provide additional information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 also requires disclosure of 
the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The update is effective prospectively for 
fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014. We have not determined the effects of this update on our financial position, result of operations 
or cash flows and disclosures at this time. 
 
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the SEC did not or are not believed to have a material impact on our 
present or future consolidated financial statements. 
 
 
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements. These financial statements include some estimates and assumptions that are based on informed judgments and 
estimates of management. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an on-going basis and discuss the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies with the 
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and as such requires the use of judgment. Our consolidated financial statements 
may differ based upon different estimates and assumptions. 
 
We discuss our significant accounting policies in Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — to our consolidated financial statements. Our significant accounting policies 
are subject to judgments and uncertainties that affect the application of such policies. We believe these consolidated financial statements include the most likely outcomes with regard 
to amounts that are based on our judgment and estimates. Our consolidated financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different 
conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of such policies. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from the actual amounts, adjustments are 
made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements due 
to the estimation process and business judgment involved in their application: 
 
Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about future events that affect the 
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements.(cid:160) Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to estimates and 
assumptions are accounted for prospectively. 
 
Significant areas involving the use of estimates include determining the allowance for uncollectible taxes, evaluating recoverability of property concessions, evaluating impairment of 
long-lived assets, evaluating impairment of goodwill, establishing a valuation allowance on future use of deferred tax assets and calculating stock-based compensation.
27
(cid:160)
Property Concessions 
 
Property concessions acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred and will be amortized using the units of production method following the commencement of production. If a 
property concession is subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be expensed in the period of abandonment or impairment. To date, no property concession have 
reached the production stage. 
 
Acquisition costs include cash consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of property concessions. 
 
Exploration Costs 
 
Exploration costs incurred are expensed to the date of establishing that costs incurred are economically recoverable. Exploration expenditures incurred subsequent to the establishment 
of economic recoverability are capitalized and included in the carrying amount of the related property. To date, we have not established the economic recoverability of its exploration 
prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being expensed. 
 
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
Management reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be 
recoverable.  Impairment  is  considered  to  exist  if  the  future  cash  flows  on  an  undiscounted  basis  are  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  long-lived  asset.  An  impairment  loss  is 
measured  and  recorded  based  on  the  difference  between  book  value  and  fair  value  of  the  asset  group,  as  determined  through  the  application  of  a  present  value  technique  using 
expected future cash flows to estimate fair value in the absence of a market price. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable 
cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. 
 
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when 
events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests at April 30th of each fiscal year. 
 
In performing the goodwill impairment tests we have the option to elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a 
reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we determine that this is the case or we do not chose to elect to perform a qualitative assessment, we are required to perform the 
currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting 
unit (if any). If we determine based on the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not 
required. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
We follow the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences 
between the tax basis and accounting basis of the assets and liabilities measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. We recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax 
positions only if it is at least “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax 
benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
with the taxing authorities. This accounting standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. 
 
A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe we have met the  “more likely than not” standard imposed by this guidance to allow 
recognition of such an asset. Management recorded a full valuation allowance at October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 against the deferred tax assets as it deems future realization 
would not meet the criteria “more likely than not”. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation and Warrants 
 
We use the Black-Scholes pricing model as a method for determining the estimated fair value for all stock options awarded to employees, officers, directors and consultants.(cid:160)
expected term of the options is based upon evaluation of historical and expected future exercise behavior.(cid:160)
grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life of the grant.(cid:160)

(cid:160)
We also used the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair market value of warrants.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Expected volatility is based upon weighted average of historical volatility over the 
contractual term of the warrant and implied volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based upon implied yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the 
contractual term of the warrants. The dividend yield is assumed to be none as we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. 
 
Foreign Currency Translation 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, the functional currency of Silver Bull Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar except for the Gabonese 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the CFA. 
 
During  the  years  ended  October  31,  2014  and  October  31,  2013  our  Mexican  foreign  operations  monetary  assets  and  liabilities  were  translated  into  U.S.  dollars  at  the  period-end 
exchange rate and non-monetary assets and liabilities were translated using the historical exchange rate. Our Mexican foreign operations revenue and expenses were translated at the 
average  exchange  rate  during  the  period  except  for  depreciation  of  office  and  mining  equipment  and  impairment  of  property  concessions  which  are  translated  using  the  historical 
exchange rate. Foreign currency translation gains and losses of our foreign Mexican operations are included in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, assets and liabilities of our Gabonese operations were translated into U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate, and 
revenue  and  expenses  were  translated  at  the  average  exchange  rate  during  the  period.  Exchange  differences  arising  on  translation  were  disclosed  as  a  separate  component  of 
stockholders’  equity.  Realized  gains  and  losses  from  foreign  currency  transactions  were  reflected  in  the  results  of  operations.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Intercompany  transactions  and  balances  with  our 
Gabonese subsidiaries were considered to be planned or anticipated to settle in the foreseeable future. All foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany loans which 
were considered to be planned or anticipated to settle in the foreseeable future were included in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
Reclassifications 
 
Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current year presentation. We reclassified the Dome International consolidated balance sheet amounts 
and  consolidated  statements  of  operations  from  historical  presentation  to  assets  and  liabilities  of  operations  held  for  sale  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheets  and  to  loss  from 
discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The consolidated statements of cash flow have not been adjusted to reflect assets held 
for sale and discontinued operations for all periods presented.

(cid:160) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Our  disclosure  controls  and  procedures  are  designed  to  ensure  that  information  required  to  be  disclosed  in  our  reports  filed  or  submitted  under  the  Exchange  Act  is  recorded, 
processed,  summarized  and  reported  within  the  time  periods  specified  in  the  SEC’s  rules  and  forms.(cid:160)  Disclosure  controls  and  procedures  include,  without  limitation,  controls  and 
procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including 
our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
(b)(cid:160)
 
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. 
Under  the  supervision  and  with  the  participation  of  our  management,  including  our  principal  executive  and  principal  financial  officers,  we  assessed,  as  of  October  31,  2014,  the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment was based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 1992.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Based on our assessment using those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over 
financial reporting as of October 31, 2014 was effective. 
(cid:160)  
Internal control over financial reporting is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our 
board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;
ö
ö
ö
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are  recorded  as  necessary  to  permit  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  in  accordance  with  U.S.  generally  accepted 
accounting principles and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorization of our management and directors; and
provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the internal control system are met.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Because 
of the inherent limitations of any internal control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. 
 
(c)(cid:160) Changes in (cid:160) Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended October 31, 2014 that materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our 
internal control over financial reporting. (cid:160)

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Silver Bull Resources, Inc. 
 
We  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets  of  Silver  Bull  Resources,  Inc.  (an  exploration  stage  company)  as  of  October  31,  2014  and  2013,  and  the  related 
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. 
 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the 
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an 
audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are 
appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion. 
 
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Silver Bull Resources, Inc. (an exploration stage 
company)  as  of  October  31,  2014  and  2013,  and  the  results  of  its  operations  and  its  cash  flows  for  the  years  then  ended,  in  conformity  with  U.S.  generally  accepted  accounting 
principles.

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND LIQUIDITY 
 
Silver Bull Resources, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 8, 1993 as the Cadgie Company for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral 
properties. The Cadgie Company was a spin-off from its predecessor, Precious Metal Mines, Inc. On June 28, 1996, the Company’s name was changed to Metalline Mining Company. 
On April 21, 2011, the Company’s name was changed to Silver Bull Resources, Inc. The Company’s fiscal year-end is October 31. The Company has not realized any revenues from its 
planned operations and is considered an Exploration Stage Company. The Company has not established any reserves with respect to its exploration projects and may never enter into 
the development stage with respect to any of its projects. 
 
The Company engages in the business of mineral exploration. The Company currently owns or has the option to acquire a number of property concessions in Mexico (collectively 
known as the “Sierra Mojada Property”). The Company conducts its operations in Mexico through its wholly-owned subsidiary corporations, Minera Metalin S.A. de C.V. (“Minera”) 
and Contratistas de Sierra Mojada S.A. de C.V. (“Contratistas”) and through Minera’s wholly-owned subsidiary Minas de Coahuila SBR S.A. de C.V. (“Minas”). 
 
On April 16, 2010, Metalline Mining Delaware, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, was merged with and into Dome Ventures Corporation (“Dome”).(cid:160)  As a result, Dome 
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Dome has a wholly-owned subsidiary Dome Asia Inc. (“Dome Asia”), which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Dome 
Asia has a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Gabon, African Resources SARL Gabon (“African  Resources”), as well as a 99.99%-owned subsidiary, Dome Minerals Nigeria 
Limited, incorporated in Nigeria. In January 2015 the Company completed the sale of its subsidiary Dome International Global Inc. (“Dome International”) including Dome International’s 
wholly-owned subsidiary Dome Ventures SARL Gabon (“Dome Gabon”) which held the Ndjole Prospect in Gabon (Note 3). 
 
The Company’s efforts have been concentrated in expenditures related to exploration properties, principally in the Sierra Mojada Property located in Coahuila, Mexico. The Company 
has  not  determined  whether  its  exploration  properties  contain  ore  reserves  that  are  economically  recoverable.  The  ultimate  realization  of  the  Company’s  investment  in  exploration 
properties is dependent upon the success of future property sales, the existence of economically recoverable reserves, and the ability of the Company to obtain financing or make other 
arrangements  for  exploration,  development,  and  future  profitable  production  activities.  The  ultimate  realization  of  the  Company’s  investment  in  exploration  properties  cannot  be 
determined at this time. Accordingly, no provision for any asset impairment that may result, in the event the Company is not successful in developing or selling these properties, has 
been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed in Notes 3 and 6. 
 
Liquidity, Financial Commitments and Management’s Plans 
 
Since its inception in November 1993, the Company has not generated revenue and has incurred a deficit of $99,301,107.(cid:160) Accordingly, the Company has not generated cash flow from 
operations, and since inception the Company has relied primarily upon proceeds from private placements and registered direct offerings of the Company’s equity securities and warrant 
exercises as the primary sources of financing to fund the Company’s operations. As of October 31, 2014, the Company had working capital of $2,947,144 including $1,281,518 of assets 
of discontinued operations held for sale and $8,894 of liabilities of discontinued operations held for sale, and cash and cash equivalents of $1,879,318. Management will continue to 
evaluate the Company’s ability to raise additional capital, and if it determines that additional capital is unavailable or available on terms that the Company determines are unacceptable 
then the Company will reduce exploration expenditures on the Company’s property concessions and reduce general and administrative expenditures. 
 
 
NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 
This summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements and notes are 
representations of the Company’s management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. 
 
Basis of Presentation 
 
The  Company’s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”)  and 
prepared using the accrual method of accounting.
F-8
(cid:160)
Principles of Consolidation 
 
The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company  and  its  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  and  the  Company’s  previously  wholly  owned  subsidiaries  Dome 
International and Dome Gabon, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company are listed in Note 1. 
 
Use of Estimates 
 
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates based on assumptions about future events that affect the 
amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements.(cid:160) Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and 
assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant under the circumstances. Revisions to estimates and 
assumptions are accounted for prospectively. 
 
Significant areas involving the use of estimates include determining the allowance for uncollectible taxes, evaluating recoverability of property concessions, evaluating impairment of 
long-lived assets, evaluating impairment of goodwill, establishing a valuation allowance on future use of deferred tax assets and calculating stock-based compensation. 
 
Revenue Recognition 
 
The  Company  recognizes  revenue  when  the  title  and  risks  and  rewards  of  ownership  pass  to  the  buyer,  the  selling  price  is  fixed  and  determinable,  persuasive  evidence  of  an 
arrangement exists and collection of the sale proceeds is considered probable. As of October 31, 2014, the Company has not recognized any revenues. 
 
Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 
Cash and cash equivalents include all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase. 
 
Property Concessions 
 
Property concessions acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred and will be amortized using the units of production method following the commencement of production. If a 
property concession is subsequently abandoned or impaired, any capitalized costs will be expensed in the period of abandonment or impairment. To date, no property concession have 
reached the production stage. 
 
Acquisition costs include cash consideration and the fair market value of shares issued on the acquisition of property concessions. 
 
Exploration Costs 
 
Exploration costs incurred are expensed to the date of establishing that costs incurred are economically recoverable. Exploration expenditures incurred subsequent to the establishment 
of economic recoverability are capitalized and included in the carrying amount of the related property. To date, the Company has not established the economic recoverability of its 
exploration prospects; therefore, all exploration costs are being expensed. 
 
Property and Equipment 
 
Property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Assets under construction are depreciated when they are substantially complete and 
available for their intended use, over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred to enhance the service 
potential of property and equipment are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the improved asset. Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line, 
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:
ö Mining equipment – 5 to 10 years
ö Vehicles – 4 years
ö
ö
ö Well equipment – 10 to 40 years
ö Office equipment – 3 to 10 years
Building and structures – 40 years
Computer equipment and software – 3 years

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 
Management reviews and evaluates its long-lived assets for impairment when events and changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts of its assets may not be 
recoverable.  Impairment  is  considered  to  exist  if  the  future  cash  flows  on  an  undiscounted  basis  are  less  than  the  carrying  amount  of  the  long-lived  asset.  An  impairment  loss  is 
measured  and  recorded  based  on  the  difference  between  book  value  and  fair  value  of  the  asset  group,  as  determined  through  the  application  of  a  present  value  technique  using 
expected future cash flows to estimate fair value in the absence of a market price. In estimating future cash flows, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable 
cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other asset groups. 
 
Goodwill 
 
Goodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when 
events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment tests at April 30th of each fiscal year. 
 
In performing the goodwill impairment tests the Company has the option to elect to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair 
value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines that this is the case or the Company does not chose to elect to perform a qualitative assessment, 
the Company is required to perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If the Company determines based on the qualitative assessment that the fair value of a reporting unit is not less than its carrying 
amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. 
 
Income Taxes 
 
The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary 
differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of the assets and liabilities measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. The Company recognizes the tax benefit 
from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least “more likely than not” that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the 
position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized 
upon settlement with the taxing authorities. This accounting standard also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and 
disclosure. 
 
A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if management does not believe the Company has met the “more likely than not” standard imposed by this guidance to 
allow  recognition  of  such  an  asset.  Management  recorded  a  full  valuation  allowance  at  October  31,  2014  and  October  31,  2013  against  the  deferred  tax  assets  as  it  deems  future 
realization would not meet the criteria “more likely than not”. 
 
Stock-Based Compensation and Warrants 
 
The  Company  uses  the  Black-Scholes  pricing  model  as  a  method  for  determining  the  estimated  fair  value  for  all  stock  options  awarded  to  employees,  officers,  directors  and 
consultants.(cid:160)
-free interest rate is based upon U.S. Treasury rates 
at the date of grant with maturity dates approximately equal to the expected life of the grant.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Volatility is determined upon historical volatility of the Company ’s stock and adjusted if 
future volatility is expected to vary from historical experience.(cid:160)
(cid:160)The dividend yield is assumed to be none as the Company has not paid dividends nor does the Company anticipate 
paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.(cid:160)
 
The Company also used the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair market value of warrants. Expected volatility is based upon weighted average of historical volatility over 
the contractual term of the warrant and implied volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based upon implied yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the 
contractual term of the warrants.(cid:160) The dividend yield is assumed to be none as the Company has(cid:160)not(cid:160)paid dividends nor does(cid:160)not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable 
future. 
 
Loss Per Share 
 
Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. 
Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity similar to fully diluted loss per share. Although there were stock options 
and warrants in the aggregate of 11,422,144 shares and 21,848,977 shares outstanding at October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, they were not included in the calculation of loss per 
share because they would have been considered anti-dilutive. 
(cid:160)
(cid:160)The Company uses the graded vesting attribution method to recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period.

Foreign Currency Translation 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, the functional currency of Silver Bull Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar except for the Gabonese 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the Central African Franc (“$CFA”). 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 the Company’s Mexican foreign operations monetary assets and liabilities were translated into U.S. dollars at the period-
end exchange rate and non-monetary assets and liabilities were translated using the historical exchange rate. The Company’s Mexican foreign operations revenue and expenses were 
translated at the average exchange rate during the period except for depreciation of office and mining equipment and impairment of property concessions which are translated using the 
historical exchange rate. Foreign currency translation gains and losses of the Company’s foreign Mexican operations are included in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
During the years ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 assets and liabilities of the Company’s Gabonese operations were translated into U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange 
rate, and revenue and expenses were translated at the average exchange rate during the period. Exchange differences arising on translation were disclosed as a separate component of 
stockholders’  equity.  Realized  gains  and  losses  from  foreign  currency  transactions  were  reflected  in  the  results  of  operations.(cid:160)
(cid:160)Intercompany  transactions  and  balances  with  the 
Company’s Gabonese subsidiaries were considered to be planned or anticipated to settle in the foreseeable future. All foreign currency transaction gains and losses on intercompany 
loans which were considered to be planned or anticipated to settle in the foreseeable future were included in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
Accounting for Loss Contingencies and Legal Costs 
 
From time to time, the Company is named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities. The Company records an accrual for the estimated loss from a loss 
contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements 
and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.(cid:160) Disclosure of a loss contingency is made by the Company if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been 
incurred, and either an accrual has not been made or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the amount accrued. In cases where only disclosure of the loss contingency is required, 
either  the  estimated  loss  or  a  range  of  estimated  loss  is  disclosed  or  it  is  stated  that  an  estimate  cannot  be  made.  Legal  costs  incurred  in  connection  with  loss  contingencies  are 
considered period costs and accordingly are expensed in the period services are provided. 
 
Reclassifications 
 
Certain reclassifications of prior year balances have been made to conform to the current year presentation. The Company reclassified the Dome International consolidated balance 
sheet amounts and consolidated statements of operations from historical presentation to assets and liabilities of operations held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets and to loss 
from discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented. The consolidated statements of cash flow have not been adjusted to reflect assets 
held for sale and discontinued operations for all periods presented. 
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in the Year 
 
Effective  in  July,  2014,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Update  (“ASU”)  2014-10:  Development  Stage  Entities  (Topic  915):  Elimination  of  Certain  Financial  reporting 
Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation. The standard removes the definition of a development stage entity from the 
Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from 
GAAP. In addition, the standard eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements of income, cash flows, and 
shareholder equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, 
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. The standard is effective for annual 
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein, with early adoption permitted. As a result, the Company eliminated inception to date information from 
the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2014. 
 
Effective November 1, 2013, the Company adopted ASU 2011-11, "Balance Sheet (Topic 201): Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities." This ASU added certain additional 
disclosure requirements about financial instruments and derivative instruments that are subject to netting arrangements. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on 
the disclosure for the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 
In  August  2014,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standard  Board  (“FASB”)  issued  ASU  2014-15,  Presentation  of  Financial  Statements—Going  Concern  (Subtopic  205-40):  Disclosure  of 
Uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 is intended to define management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt 
about an organization’s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The update provides guidance to an organization’s management, with 
principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement 
footnotes.  The  amendments  are  effective  for  annual  periods  ending  after  December  15,  2016,  and  interim  periods  within  annual  periods  beginning  after  December  15,  2016.  Early 
application is permitted. The Company has not determined the effects of this update on the Company’s financial position, result of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time. 
 
In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carry Forward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a 
Tax Credit Carry Forward Exists.” The updated guidance requires an entity to net its unrecognized tax benefits against the deferred tax assets for all same jurisdiction net operating loss 
carry forwards, a similar tax loss, or tax credit carry forwards. A gross presentation will be required only if such carry forwards are not available or would not be used by the entity to 
settle any additional income taxes resulting from disallowance of the uncertain tax provision. The update is effective prospectively for the Company's fiscal year beginning November 1, 
2014. The Company does not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and the disclosure 
requirements for the Company’s consolidated financial statements. 
 
In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and 
Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.” Under ASU 2014-08, only disposals of a component or group of components of an entity representing a strategic shift that has 
(or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results are presented as discontinued operations. In addition, ASU 2014-08 requires expanded disclosures about 
discontinued operations that will provide additional information about the assets, liabilities, income, and expenses of discontinued operations. ASU 2014-08 also requires disclosure of 
the pre-tax income attributable to a disposal of a significant part of an organization that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. The update is effective prospectively for 
fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2014. The Company has not determined the effects of this update on the Company’s financial position, 
result of operations or cash flows and disclosures at this time. 
 
Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the SEC did not or are not believed to have a material impact on the 
Company's present or future consolidated financial statements. 
 
 
NOTE 3 – DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS 
 
On December 13, 2013, the Company entered into a binding letter of agreement and on May 21, 2014, the Company executed a share purchase agreement (the “Transaction”) with BHK 
Mining  Corp.  (formerly  BHK  Resources,  Inc.)  (“BHK”)  to  sell  all  of  the  issued  and  outstanding  securities  of  the  Company’s  former  subsidiary  Dome  International,  which  holds, 
indirectly,  a  100%  interest  in  and  to  the  Ndjole  concession,  for  cash  consideration  of  $1,500,000  and  reimbursement  of  the  Company’s  expenses  of  $75,000.  The  Transaction  was 
completed on January 23, 2015. 
 
As at October 31, 2014, the Company classified Dome International and its wholly-owned subsidiary Dome Gabon as an asset held for sale as assets held for sale criteria were met. 
Consequently, for all of the periods presented, loss from Dome International and Dome Gabon has been presented within discontinued operations in the consolidated statement of 
operations and comprehensive loss. During the year ended October 31, 2014 the Company recorded an impairment of $187,981 for the Ndjole concession as its carrying amount was not 
recoverable based on the implied fair value due to expected net proceeds from the Transaction. 
 
The following table details selected financial information included in the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended October 31, 2014 and 2013.

The miscellaneous income in the year ended October 31, 2013 was the result of the Company’s legal interpretation that AngloGold Ashanti Limited (“AngloGold”) abandoned all of its 
rights and benefits under two joint venture agreements upon their termination. As a result the Company has concluded that the VAT receivable outstanding at the termination of the 
agreements and subsequent cash collected related to this VAT receivable of $491,448 was determined to be the sole property of the Company. 
 
During the year ended October 31, 2013, the Company determined that the Ndjole license was impaired as its carrying amounts were not recoverable from its implied fair value based on 
the binding letter of agreement with BHK described above. This impairment resulted in the Company writing off a portion of the capitalized property concession balance of $556,935 
related to the Ndjole license.

NOTE 4 – VALUE-ADDED TAX RECEIVABLE 
 
Value-added tax ("VAT") receivable relates to VAT paid in Mexico and Gabon. The Company estimates net VAT of $163,032 will be received within twelve months of the balance sheet 
date.  The  allowance  for  uncollectible  VAT  taxes  was  estimated  by  management  based  upon  a  number  of  factors  including  the  length  of  time  the  returns  have  been  outstanding, 
responses received from tax authorities, general economic conditions in Mexico and Gabon and estimated net recovery after commissions. During the year ended October 31, 2014, a 
provision of uncollectible VAT of $19,170 has been recorded. 
 
A summary of the changes in the allowance for uncollectible VAT taxes for the year ended October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 is as follows:

NOTE 7 – GOODWILL 
 
Goodwill represents the excess, at the date of acquisition, of the purchase price of the business acquired over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired.(cid:160) At 
October 31, 2014 the Company did not elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its 
carrying amount and therefore performed the two-step goodwill impairment test. Based on this test the Company determined the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying 
amount and no impairment was necessary. 
 
The following is a summary of the Company’s goodwill balance as at October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively:
Goodwill – October 31, 2012 
Goodwill – October 31, 2013

NOTE 8 – SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN 
 
On June 11, 2007, the Board of Directors adopted a Shareholders’ Right Plan through the adoption of a Rights Agreement, which became effective immediately.(cid:160)
(cid:160)In connection with the 
adoption of the Rights Agreement, the Board of Directors declared a distribution of one Right for each outstanding share of the Company’s common stock, payable to shareholders of 
record at the close of business on June 22, 2007.(cid:160)
(cid:160)In accordance with the Rights Plan, one Right is attached to each share of Company common stock issued since that date.(cid:160) Each Right 
is attached to the underlying common share and will remain with the common share if the share is sold or transferred.(cid:160) As of October 31, 2014, there are 159,072,657 shares outstanding 
with Rights attached. 
 
In certain circumstances, in the event that any person acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock, each holder of a Right, 
other than the acquirer, would be entitled to receive, upon payment of the purchase price, which is initially set at $20 per Right, a number of shares of the Company’s common stock 
having a value equal to two times such purchase price. The Rights will expire on June 11, 2017.
NOTE 9 - COMMON STOCK

On February 14, 2013, the Company closed a public offering (the “Offering”) for the sale of 22,912,500 units at a price of $0.40 per unit for gross proceeds of $9,165,000. Each unit was 
comprised of one share of common stock of the Company and one-half of one common stock purchase warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable to purchase one share of common 
stock, at an exercise price of $0.55, for a period of 18 months from the closing of the Offering. The Company paid the agents on the Offering a cash commission equal to 6.0% of the 
gross proceeds, except for $2.5 million in units sold to purchasers arranged by the Company for which the agents received a 3.0% cash commission. In addition, the agents received 
1,187,250 compensation warrants with the same terms as the other warrants issued in the Offering. The total cash commission paid to the agents was $474,900, the fair value of the 
agents’ compensation warrants was determined to be $51,672 (Note 11), and the Company incurred other offering costs of $595,375.

(cid:160)The Company has approximately
At October 31, 2014 the Company has U.S. net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $31 million which expire in the years 2019 through 2034.(cid:160)
$36 million of net operating loss carry-forwards in Mexico which expire in the years 2015 through 2024. 
 
The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of $21.9 and $19.8 million at October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, relates principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain 
deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss carry forwards in various tax jurisdictions. The Company continually assesses both positive and negative evidence to determine whether 
it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets can be realized prior to their expiration. Based on the Company’s assessment it has determined the deferred tax assets are not 
currently realizable. 
(cid:160)  
Mexico Tax Legislation 
 
On December 11, 2013, the Mexican tax reform package was published in the official gazette and is effective as from January 1, 2014. Amongst other changes the planned corporate tax 
reductions to 29% in 2014 and 28% thereafter have been repealed and the corporate tax rate will remain at 30%. A special mining duty of 7.5% will apply to net profits derived by a 
property concession holder from the sale or transfer of extraction related activities. Net profits for the purpose of this special mining duty will be determined in a manner similar to the 
calculation of general taxable income with certain deductions not available including for investment in fixed assets and interest. 
 
Net Operating Loss Carry-forward Limitation 
 
The Tax Reform Act of 1986 contains provisions that limit the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards if there has been a change in ownership as described in 
Section(cid:160)382 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result of the Dome merger in April 2010, substantial changes in the Company ’s ownership have occurred that may limit or reduce the 
amount of net operating loss carry-forward that the Company could utilize in the future to offset taxable income.(cid:160)
(cid:160)We have not completed a detailed Section 382 study at this time to 
determine what impact, if any, that ownership changes may have had on our operating loss carry forwards. In each period since our inception, we have recorded a valuation allowance 
for the full amount of our deferred tax assets, as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain.(cid:160)
(cid:160)As a result, we have not recognized any federal or state income tax benefit in our 
consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
 
Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes 
 
 
During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company has not identified any unrecognized tax benefits or had any additions or reductions in tax positions and therefore 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not presented. 
 
The Company does not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2014 and accordingly the Company’s effective tax rate will not be materially affected by unrecognized tax 
benefits.

NOTE 13 – FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
 
Fair Value Measurements 
 
All financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded at fair value on initial recognition. Transaction costs are expensed when they are incurred, unless they are directly attributable to 
the acquisition of qualifying assets, in which case they are added to the costs of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. 
 
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)  
 
(cid:160)  
(cid:160)  
Under fair value accounting, assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.(cid:160)
2014 and October 31, 2013, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities required to be reported for fair value purposes. 
 
The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, other receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and 
expenses approximate fair value at October(cid:160) 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 due to the short maturities of these financial instruments.  
 
Credit Risk 
 
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the Company by failing to discharge its obligations. To mitigate exposure to credit risk 
on financial assets the Company has established policies to ensure liquidity of funds and ensure counterparties demonstrate minimum acceptable credit worthiness. 
 
The Company maintains its US Dollar and Canadian Dollar (“$CDN”) cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions with high credit 
standings.(cid:160) Cash deposits held in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( “FDIC”) for up to $250,000 and $CDN cash deposits held in Canada are 
insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (“CDIC”) for up to $CDN 100,000. Certain United States and Canadian bank accounts held by the Company exceed these federally 
insured limits or are uninsured as they related to US Dollar deposits held in Canadian financial institutions. As of October 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company’s cash and cash equivalent 
balances held in United States and Canadian financial institutions included $1,681,759 and $4,844,049 respectively, which was not insured by the FDIC or CDIC. The Company has not 
experienced any losses on such accounts and management believes that using major financial institutions with high credit ratings mitigates the credit risk in cash and cash equivalents.
Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market 
activity).
Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability;
Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;

(cid:160)  
The Company also maintains cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash in bank accounts in Mexico and Gabon.(cid:160) These accounts are denominated in the local currency and are 
considered uninsured. As of October 31, 2014 and 2013, the US dollar equivalent balance for these accounts was $115,686 and $87,889, respectively. 
 
Interest Rate Risk 
 
The Company holds substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in bank and demand deposit accounts with major financial institutions. The interest rates received on 
these balances may fluctuate with changes in economic conditions. Based on the average cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash balances during the year ended October 31, 
2014, a 1% decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a reduction in interest income for the period of approximately $3,584. 
 
Foreign Currency Exchange Risk
Certain  purchases  of  labor,  operating  supplies  and  capital  assets  are  denominated  in  $CDN,  Mexican  Peso  (“$MXN”),  $CFA  or  other  currencies.(cid:160)  As  a  result,  currency  exchange 
fluctuations may impact the costs of our operations. Specifically, the appreciation of the $MXN, $CDN or $CFA against the US dollar may result in an increase in operating expenses 
and capital costs in US dollar terms. As of October 31, 2014, the Company maintained the majority of its cash balance in US Dollars. The Company currently does not engage in any 
currency hedging activities. 
 
 
NOTE 14 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations 
 
The Company’s exploration activities are subject to laws and regulations controlling not only the exploration and mining of mineral properties, but also the effect of such activities on 
the  environment.  Compliance  with  such  laws  and  regulations  may  necessitate  additional  capital  outlays  or  affect  the  economics  of  a  project,  and  cause  changes  or  delays  in  the 
Company’s activities. 
 
Property Concessions Mexico 
 
To properly maintain property concessions in Mexico, the Company is required to pay a semi-annual fee to the Mexican government and complete annual assessment work. 
 
In  addition  two  of  the  concessions  in  the  Sierra  Mojada  project  are  subject  to  options  to  purchase  from  existing  third  party  concession  owners.  Pursuant  to  the  option  purchase 
agreements, the Company is required to make certain payments over the terms of these contracts to obtain full ownership of these concessions as set forth in the table below:

Property Concessions Gabon 
 
The Company holds title to the Mitzic concession (Note 6) in Gabon, Africa that requires the Company to spend minimum amounts each term to renew the concession. The concession 
is renewable twice with each renewal lasting for three years. The initial renewal of the Mitzic concession was granted on July 24, 2012. Per the renewed concession license, the Company 
must spend $CFA 901,000,000 ($1,736,031) on exploration work on the Mitzic concession in order to renew the concession for a third term of three years. The expenditures during the 
second period are reduced by $CFA 272,389,955 ($524,836) which represent amounts spent in the second period to October 31, 2014 and amounts carried forward from the initial term for 
expenditures incurred in excess of the renewal requirements. The Company must spend $CFA 800,000,000 ($1,541,426) in the third term per Gabonese law. The Company may apply for a 
mining license at any time during these periods.(cid:160) As of October 31, 2014, one U.S. dollar approximates $CFA 519.  
 
Royalty 
 
The Company has agreed to pay a 2% net smelter return royalty on certain property concessions within the Sierra Mojada Property. Total payments under this royalty are limited to 
$6.875 million (the "Royalty"). 
 
Litigation and Claims 
 
In July 2014 a local cooperative named Sociedad Cooperativa de Exploración Minera Mineros Norteños, S.C.L. (“Mineros  Norteños”) filed an action before the First Court in Civil 
Matters in Chihuahua City, Mexico against the Company’s subsidiary, Minera Metalin, claiming that the Company breached an agreement regarding the development of the Sierra 
Mojada Project.(cid:160) Mineros Norteños is seeking payment of the Royalty, including interest at a rate of 6% per annum from August 30, 2004, notwithstanding that no revenue has been 
produced from the applicable mining concessions, and it is also seeking payment of wages to the cooperative’s members from August 30, 2004, notwithstanding that none of the 
individuals were ever hired or performed work for the Company. The Company and the Company’s Mexican legal counsel believe this claim is without merit and have asserted all 
applicable defenses. The Company has not accrued any amounts in our financial statements with respect to this claim. 
(cid:160)  
From time to time, the Company is involved in other disputes, claims, proceedings and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company intends to vigorously 
defend all claims against the Company, and pursue our full legal rights in cases where the Company has been harmed. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be 
accurately predicted due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, in the opinion of management, based upon current information, no other currently pending or overtly threatened 
proceeding is expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 
Office Lease Commitment 
 
The Company entered into a five-year office lease agreement from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2017 for the Company’s corporate office in Vancouver, Canada. The monthly lease payment 
is $CDN 7,743 until March 31, 2016, increasing to $CDN 7,981 on April 1, 2016. As of October 31, 2014, one U.S. dollar approximates $CDN 1.13.
