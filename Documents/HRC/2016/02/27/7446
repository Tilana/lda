<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. Pursuant to its resolution 25/22, the Human Rights Council held an interactive panel 
</p>
<p>discussion of experts on &#8220;ensuring use of remotely piloted aircraft or armed drones in 
</p>
<p>counterterrorism and military operations in accordance with international law, including 
</p>
<p>international human rights and humanitarian law&#8221; on 22 September 2014. The panel 
</p>
<p>discussion examined issues related to the use of remotely piloted aircraft or armed drones in 
</p>
<p>counterterrorism and military operations in accordance with international law, including 
</p>
<p>international human rights and humanitarian law. It also addressed questions raised in the 
</p>
<p>report of the Special Rapporteur on the protection of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms while countering terrorism (A/HRC/25/59). 
</p>
<p>2. The panel discussion was chaired by the President of the Human Rights Council and 
</p>
<p>moderated by Dapo Akande, Co-Director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and 
</p>
<p>Armed Conflict, Oxford University. The United Nations Deputy High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights gave an opening address. The panellists were Shahzad Akbar, Legal 
</p>
<p>Director of the Foundation for Fundamental Rights; Alex Conte, Director of International 
</p>
<p>Law and Protection Programmes at the International Commission of Jurists; the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism; the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>executions and Pardiss Kebriaei, Senior Attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights. 
</p>
<p>3. In resolution 25/22, the Council requested the Office of the High Commissioner for 
</p>
<p>Human Rights to present a summary of the deliberations of the panel discussion at its 
</p>
<p>twenty-eighth session and the present report is submitted pursuant to that request. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Opening statement by the United Nations Deputy High 
Commissioner for Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Deputy High Commissioner noted that the discussion on the use of remotely 
</p>
<p>piloted aircraft or armed drones in compliance with international law was both very timely 
</p>
<p>and essential, because the development of such technologies was running ahead of our 
</p>
<p>understanding of their human rights implications. The recent emergence of a range of new 
</p>
<p>weapons technologies has raised a number of legal questions, including under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law. She stated that, since its emergence 15 years ago, drone technology had 
</p>
<p>developed remarkably and the use of drones had grown exponentially in the context of 
</p>
<p>military operations and counter-terrorism measures. An increasing number of States were 
</p>
<p>seeking to acquire armed drone technologies and there was concern that non-State actors 
</p>
<p>might possess such technology as well. 
</p>
<p>5. The Deputy High Commissioner made clear that States had the duty under 
</p>
<p>international law to take measures to protect individuals from terrorist acts, but those 
</p>
<p>measures must be consistent with international human rights law.  
</p>
<p>6. The Deputy High Commissioner made three main points. The first related to the 
</p>
<p>legal framework applicable to the use of armed drones. She emphasized that international 
</p>
<p>human rights law applied at all times, including in situations of armed conflict. She noted 
</p>
<p>that the human right to life placed stringent conditions on the use of lethal force. In any 
</p>
<p>situation other than active hostilities in an armed conflict, the prohibition of the arbitrary 
</p>
<p>deprivation of life implied that the intentional use of lethal force was lawful only when an 
</p>
<p>individual posed an imminent threat to the life of another and where the use of lethal force 
</p>
<p>was strictly unavoidable to protect life. Additionally, such use of lethal force would be 
</p>
<p>lawful only where other, less lethal, measures &#8211; including restraint, capture, and the </p>


<p>graduated use of force &#8211; could be employed. Those international human rights standards 
</p>
<p>governed the use of armed drones in law enforcement situations. 
</p>
<p>7. The Deputy High Commissioner&#8217;s second point dealt with the human rights impact 
</p>
<p>of the use of drone strikes. Research had highlighted the grave and wide-ranging impact 
</p>
<p>strikes were having on individuals &#8211; including children, the elderly and disabled &#8211; and their 
</p>
<p>communities. In some situations, drone strikes had compromised the daily life of the 
</p>
<p>society affected and the enjoyment by individuals of their human rights including their right 
</p>
<p>to peaceful assembly, freedom of association, freedom of religion, education and health, 
</p>
<p>among others. She stressed that irrespective of claims related to their precision, the use of 
</p>
<p>armed drones created an atmosphere of fear in affected communities. In addition to the 
</p>
<p>documented loss of life through individual casualties, including bystanders, in some places 
</p>
<p>the fear of drone strikes had had a negative impact, resulting in education being interrupted, 
</p>
<p>as families kept children home from school; in interrupted cultural and religious practices, 
</p>
<p>as community members avoided gathering in groups for fear of being targeted; or in 
</p>
<p>reluctance to assist victims, for fear of being caught in secondary strikes. 
</p>
<p>8. Third, the Deputy High Commissioner referred to the concepts of transparency and 
</p>
<p>accountability. She noted that both were key to ensuring the enjoyment by victims of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations of their associated right to a meaningful remedy. Lack of 
</p>
<p>transparency concerning the circumstances in which armed drones were used, as well as the 
</p>
<p>involvement of intelligence agencies in their use, created obstacles to determining the 
</p>
<p>applicable legal framework and ensuring compliance. It also hampered the delivery of 
</p>
<p>justice and redress for victims, and was a barrier to preventing violations from occurring in 
</p>
<p>the first place. The Deputy High Commissioner recalled that the previous High 
</p>
<p>Commissioner had expressed particular concern at the lack of transparency surrounding 
</p>
<p>drone strikes, for those reasons. It was important that State policies on the use of armed 
</p>
<p>drones be spelled out more clearly, including the legal basis that would legitimate specific 
</p>
<p>attacks. The Deputy High Commissioner also recalled that the Secretary-General had urged 
</p>
<p>States to take all necessary measures to ensure that attacks involving drones complied with 
</p>
<p>applicable international law. She emphasized that States had an obligation to carry out 
</p>
<p>prompt, independent and impartial investigations whenever there were credible indications 
</p>
<p>of a serious violation of international human rights law and, where applicable, international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, which had allegedly occurred because of an armed drone strike. As an 
</p>
<p>inherent part of the right to life, international human rights law required accountability for 
</p>
<p>any violation of that right. Perpetrators of any such violation must be held to account. 
</p>
<p>9. Finally, the Deputy High Commissioner drew attention to the important work that 
</p>
<p>had been done on those issues by the special procedures mandate holders. She recalled that, 
</p>
<p>12 years earlier, the then Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>executions had raised concerns about targeted killings through the use of drone strikes in 
</p>
<p>Yemen. In 2010, her successor had conducted a critical study on targeted killings, including 
</p>
<p>through the use of armed drones. The Deputy High Commissioner noted that the panel 
</p>
<p>discussion would benefit from the analysis of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and 
</p>
<p>protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism and the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, as they had 
</p>
<p>continued to address those issues. Finally, the Deputy High Commissioner highlighted that, 
</p>
<p>as more States and non-State actors obtained the technology that enables the deployment of 
</p>
<p>armed drones, compliance with international human rights law and accountability for their 
</p>
<p>use would become increasingly urgent.  </p>


<p><b>  III. Contributions of the panellists 
</b></p>
<p>10. In response to questions from the moderator, the panellists&#8217; initial remarks focused 
</p>
<p>on issues linked to the international legal framework applicable to the use of drones. They 
</p>
<p>highlighted the aspects of international human rights law relating to the use of armed 
</p>
<p>drones, including the human rights standards applicable to the use of lethal force. 
</p>
<p>11. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions noted that, 
</p>
<p>while armed drones are not illegal per se, because of the ease with which they could 
</p>
<p>unlawfully be used for targeted killings, they created specific challenges and were therefore 
</p>
<p>necessarily subject to special scrutiny. He noted that armed drones were used in the 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism and military contexts, but also increasingly in ordinary policing and law 
</p>
<p>enforcement contexts, when they might be weaponized with, inter alia, tear gas and tasers. 
</p>
<p>He stated that the key issue was the legality of the use of armed drones and emphasized that 
</p>
<p>the law should not follow drones; rather, the use of drones must follow the law. 
</p>
<p>12. Regarding the protection of the right to life under international human rights law, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur noted that international human rights law applied to all positive actions 
</p>
<p>of the State. As a rule of customary international law and a general principle of 
</p>
<p>international law, the obligation to protect the right to life applied at all times, including 
</p>
<p>when a State was acting on the territory of another State, irrespective of the treaties they 
</p>
<p>were bound by. He noted that the right to life included a prohibition of arbitrary deprivation 
</p>
<p>of the right to life. That implied that an agent of the State might take or endanger the life of 
</p>
<p>an individual only if it was strictly necessary and proportionate to protect against an 
</p>
<p>imminent threat to life. There must be no other means than the use of lethal force, such as 
</p>
<p>capture or incapacitation, to protect the life of another person. In its second component, 
</p>
<p>however, the right to life also required that those responsible for violations be held to 
</p>
<p>account. He reiterated a point made by the Deputy High Commissioner that where there 
</p>
<p>were allegations that the right to life had been violated, States had a duty to carry out 
</p>
<p>prompt, independent and impartial investigations and, where applicable, punish those 
</p>
<p>responsible. A failure to do so would in itself constitute a violation of the right to life. In 
</p>
<p>cases where it had been established that an armed conflict existed, international human 
</p>
<p>rights law continued to apply, but the protection afforded to the right to life was interpreted 
</p>
<p>in accordance with international humanitarian law. Accountability for the arbitrary 
</p>
<p>deprivation of the right to life was also a key element of international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>including a duty to investigate and, where appropriate, punish those responsible.  
</p>
<p>13. The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism recalled that in situations of armed 
</p>
<p>conflict, international human rights law and international humanitarian law both applied 
</p>
<p>and overlapped &#8211; it was not a question of choosing between the two. He noted that the 
</p>
<p>notion of targeted killings had a very different connotation, depending upon the prism of 
</p>
<p>law through which it was approached. Under international humanitarian law, &#8220;targeting&#8221; 
</p>
<p>was usually considered positively, whereas under international human rights law, the 
</p>
<p>targeting of individuals was rarely lawful. The critical question when examining targeted 
</p>
<p>killings in this context was whether the use of armed drones had taken place within a 
</p>
<p>situation of armed conflict.  
</p>
<p>14. The Special Rapporteur noted that the key criteria for determining whether a non-
</p>
<p>international armed conflict existed between a State and a non-State armed group, or 
</p>
<p>between two non-State armed groups, were the intensity and length of the conflict and the 
</p>
<p>degree of organization of the parties. He explained that those criteria were based on an 
</p>
<p>assumption of territorial limitation. By way of example, intensity was a relative criterion 
</p>
<p>traditionally measured by analysing the frequency and severity of an armed attack in a 
</p>
<p>defined geographic area.  </p>


<p>15. The Director of International Law and Protection Programmes at the International 
</p>
<p>Commission of Jurists noted that the application of international law to the use of armed 
</p>
<p>drones was too often based on an incorrect point of departure. He noted that, as was 
</p>
<p>concluded by the Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, Counter-Terrorism and Human 
</p>
<p>Rights of the International Commission of Jurists, States had inappropriately used the war 
</p>
<p>paradigm to contextualize counter-terrorism operations, and that this also applied to the use 
</p>
<p>of armed drones.1 He noted first, that armed drones had not always been used in situations 
</p>
<p>of armed conflict under international humanitarian law. Many instances of targeted killings 
</p>
<p>appeared to have occurred outside the context of hostilities between two or more parties to 
</p>
<p>an identifiable conflict within the meaning of international humanitarian law (see, for 
</p>
<p>example, A/68/389 and A/HRC/25/59). In a number of instances in which drones had been 
</p>
<p>deployed, including in the context of countering terrorism, the level of intensity of armed 
</p>
<p>operations and/or of organization of the armed groups had not reached the level which 
</p>
<p>would engage international humanitarian law. He also emphasized that a careful assessment 
</p>
<p>must be made as to whether each situation did in fact rise to the level of armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>When armed drones were not used in a situation of armed conflict, domestic law and 
</p>
<p>international human rights law were the primary laws that applied to the lethal use of 
</p>
<p>drones. In a situation that did rise to the level of an armed conflict, international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law was relevant in determining whether a killing was unlawful or arbitrary, 
</p>
<p>but international human rights law remained applicable concerning investigations, criminal 
</p>
<p>accountability and the need for effective remedies and reparations. 
</p>
<p>16. The Legal Director of the Foundation for Fundamental Rights elaborated on the 
</p>
<p>principles of proportionality and necessity in the use of lethal force. He recalled that where 
</p>
<p>a State claimed that it was necessary to use deadly force because it had no other means of 
</p>
<p>capturing a suspected terrorist, it must prove that the individual in question posed an 
</p>
<p>imminent threat to human life. He noted that armed drones were often not used to counter 
</p>
<p>an imminent threat or where there were no other alternatives and that he had documented 
</p>
<p>dozens of drone strikes in North Waziristan where there was no evidence that the individual 
</p>
<p>killed posed an imminent threat to another individual, or to the State. In order to illustrate 
</p>
<p>the point, he referred to the case of Tariq Aziz, a teenager involved in documenting the 
</p>
<p>effect of drone strikes in North Waziristan. Three days before he died, he had attended an 
</p>
<p>international conference on drones in Islamabad. Upon his return home, he was killed in a 
</p>
<p>drone strike together with his younger cousin, outside his aunt&#8217;s house. Mr Akbar recalled 
</p>
<p>that in all cases, the onus was on the State using armed drones to prove that the use of force 
</p>
<p>was absolutely necessary and proportional.  
</p>
<p>17. Mr. Akbar also referred to the practice of engaging in &#8220;signature strikes&#8221;, a term 
</p>
<p>used to distinguish strikes conducted against individuals who match a pre-identified 
</p>
<p>&#8220;signature&#8221; of behaviour, which is said to be linked to militant behaviour, which takes no 
</p>
<p>account of the principles of necessity and proportionality in the use of force. To illustrate 
</p>
<p>this, he referred to three drone strikes between 2006 and 2009, on a <i>jirga</i> (grand council) 
</p>
<p>meeting in which 40 attendees were killed; on a madrasa, in which 80 children, the 
</p>
<p>youngest aged seven, were killed; and on a funeral at which 80 individuals were killed. He 
</p>
<p>stressed that in none of those cases was there evidence, or even a claim, that &#8220;high value 
</p>
<p>targets&#8221; or &#8220;named, known militants&#8221; were killed. He concluded that the current use of 
</p>
<p>drones in Pakistan threatened and undermined the right to life and the rule of law more 
</p>
<p>broadly.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 1 Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, Counter-Terrorism and Human Rights, <i>Assessing Damage, 
</i></p>
<p><i>Urging Action</i> (International Commission of Jurists, Geneva, 2009). </p>


<p>18. The panel discussion addressed questions of accountability for, and transparency in, 
</p>
<p>the use of armed drones, with a focus on the rights of victims to reparations and the right to 
</p>
<p>the truth. 
</p>
<p>19. Focussing on the right of access to justice for people affected by the use of drones, 
</p>
<p>the Senior Attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights noted that it was important to 
</p>
<p>remember that when a person was killed &#8211; whether because of an erroneous interpretation 
</p>
<p>of the law or faulty intelligence &#8211; the harm was irreparable. The most that could be sought 
</p>
<p>were answers to questions about whether the power of the State was lawfully exercised and 
</p>
<p>the right to life fully respected and, where wrongdoing was found, acknowledgement made, 
</p>
<p>redress offered and corrective measures taken to prevent the same harm from recurring.  
</p>
<p>20. Ms. Kebriaei noted that the main obstacle faced by claimants trying to access courts 
</p>
<p>was the position taken by States that judicial inquiry into decisions regarding the use of 
</p>
<p>drones was inappropriate. Drawing on her experience of courts in the United States of 
</p>
<p>America, she noted that responses to requests for judicial review had included assertions of 
</p>
<p>exclusive executive decision-making authority in matters of national security, immunity for 
</p>
<p>officials, and the need for secrecy with regard to relevant government information. She 
</p>
<p>noted that similar arguments had been made in the past decade with regard to national 
</p>
<p>security policies in the context of detention, where gross human rights violations were 
</p>
<p>alleged and those had presented obstacles to accountability. Ms. Kebriaei stressed that 
</p>
<p>when courts deferred to those kinds of arguments, they left victims unable even to be heard 
</p>
<p>in court and without hope of the possibility of any justice, with serious allegations of 
</p>
<p>human rights violations left unaddressed. 
</p>
<p>21.  The Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and 
</p>
<p>fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism noted that the lack of transparency by 
</p>
<p>States regarding their use of drones was the single greatest obstacle to an evaluation of the 
</p>
<p>impact of armed drones on civilians, as it made it extremely difficult to assess the legality 
</p>
<p>of their use and ensure accountability. Regarding the duty of States to investigate, he noted 
</p>
<p>that under international human rights law, whenever there was evidence of an alleged 
</p>
<p>violation of the right to life, there was an obligation on States to conduct a prompt, 
</p>
<p>independent and impartial investigation, with transparent results. Turning to the obligations 
</p>
<p>of States under international humanitarian law, he highlighted the work done by the Public 
</p>
<p>Commission to Examine the Maritime Incident of 31 May 2010, the Turkel Commission,2 
</p>
<p>which had examined the extent to which the obligation to investigate applies as a matter of 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law in situations where an armed conflict has arisen. The view 
</p>
<p>of the Commission, which he shared, was that, in any case where there were unintended or 
</p>
<p>unanticipated civilian casualties, there was an obligation to conduct an independent and 
</p>
<p>impartial investigation. That did not preclude an investigation in the context of military 
</p>
<p>justice systems, as long as those conducting the investigation were genuinely independent 
</p>
<p>of those under investigation and not subject to the same chain of command. The 
</p>
<p>Commission found that there was, first, an obligation to conduct a fact-finding inquiry, and 
</p>
<p>if circumstances gave rise to a reasonable suspicion of of international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>having been violated, there should be a full criminal investigation. The results of both 
</p>
<p>processes should be made public. He noted that as Special Rapporteur, he had applied that 
</p>
<p>test to 37 drone strikes, where it was alleged that civilian casualties had occurred and had 
</p>
<p>found that 30 cases required an independent and impartial investigation and transparent 
</p>
<p>results.  
</p>
<p>22. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions focused 
</p>
<p>on the importance of accountability for violations of the prohibition of the arbitrary 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 Available from http://www.turkel-committee.gov.il/files/wordocs/8808report-eng.pdf. </p>


<p>deprivation of life under international human rights law. He noted that irrespective of the 
</p>
<p>context, there must be accountability if there was arbitrary deprivation of the right to life. 
</p>
<p>That obligation was reflected in customary, international and regional human rights law, 
</p>
<p>and had been elaborated on in non-binding law instruments. Regardless of the language 
</p>
<p>used in the instrument considered, where a case or allegation was made, the State must 
</p>
<p>investigate the situation and the investigation must be prompt, effective, independent and 
</p>
<p>thorough.3 He emphasized the importance of transparency as a precondition to 
</p>
<p>accountability, noting that it was a composite concept that involved public scrutiny and 
</p>
<p>public trust that ensuring accountability was possible. Transparency applied both to the 
</p>
<p>decision-making process to use force, which meant that there must be a legal framework 
</p>
<p>within which force was used, and also to the investigative process. 
</p>
<p>23. The Director of International Law and Protection Programmes at the International 
</p>
<p>Commission of Jurists looked at the two key requirements to be considered when 
</p>
<p>examining the legality of targeted killings under international humanitarian law. First, the 
</p>
<p>principle of distinction, which must be observed to ensure that the target was either a 
</p>
<p>combatant (within an international armed conflict), or a civilian participating directly in 
</p>
<p>hostilities (within either an international or non-international armed conflict). He noted the 
</p>
<p>position taken by the International Commission of Jurists according to which the lethal use 
</p>
<p>of armed drones by the United States did not currently take place in the context of an 
</p>
<p>international armed conflict. The United States drone programme might therefore in 
</p>
<p>principle only target a civilian who was directly participating in hostilities in the context of 
</p>
<p>a non-international armed conflict. Second, the principle of proportionality of measures in 
</p>
<p>armed conflict, which required a graduated response that was proportional in its effects. 
</p>
<p>Mr. Conte referred to rule 14 of the Study on customary international humanitarian law of 
</p>
<p>the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which made it clear that launching 
</p>
<p>an attack, which might be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to 
</p>
<p>civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in 
</p>
<p>relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated, was prohibited.4 He 
</p>
<p>further emphasized that violation of that rule might amount to a war crime under the Rome 
</p>
<p>Statute of the International Criminal Court.5  
</p>
<p>24. Mr. Conte stated that the lack of transparency associated with the use of armed 
</p>
<p>drones prevented external and objective verification of whether drone targets were 
</p>
<p>legitimate and the distinction and proportionality requirements were satisfied in each case, 
</p>
<p>giving States &#8220;a virtual and impermissible licence to kill&#8221; (see A/HRC/14/24/Add.6, para. 
</p>
<p>88). That lack of transparency also obstructed the right to a remedy and reparation, as well 
</p>
<p>as the requirement to hold persons criminally accountable for crimes under international 
</p>
<p>law. It potentially involved a violation of common article 51 of the Geneva Conventions, 
</p>
<p>which prohibited any contracting party from absolving itself of any grave breach of the 
</p>
<p>Conventions. 
</p>
<p>25. In examining the requirements for transparency, the Senior Attorney at the Center 
</p>
<p>for Constitutional Rights highlighted the fact that there must be transparency about the law 
</p>
<p>itself. There should be no secret laws relating to the right to life: respect for, and protection 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 3 The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials also require 
</p>
<p>that there be transparency in the investigation process, as well as participation by those affected: see 
</p>
<p>principles 22&#8211;24. 
</p>
<p> 4 See Jean-Marie Henckaerts, &#8220;Study on customary international humanitarian law: a contribution to 
</p>
<p>the understanding and respect for the rule of law in armed conflict&#8221;, <i>International Review of the Red 
</i></p>
<p><i>Cross</i>, vol. 87, No. 857 (March 2005) and the database on customary international humanitarian law, 
</p>
<p>available from www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/home. 
</p>
<p> 5 See article 8 (2 ) (b) (iv) of the Statute. </p>


<p>of, the right to life required that individuals know the circumstances in which they might be 
</p>
<p>subject to lethal force by a Government. She also noted that meaningful responses needed 
</p>
<p>to be provided when plausible allegations of violations of the right to life were presented. 
</p>
<p>Those should include a careful explanation regarding the circumstances in which armed 
</p>
<p>drones had been used.6 She noted that this was a challenge. She referred to a drone strike 
</p>
<p>that took place in Yemen in 2013, in which at least 27 people attending a wedding 
</p>
<p>procession were killed or injured. While there was acknowledgement of the strike and an 
</p>
<p>investigation, the official response was that there had been no civilian casualties. She 
</p>
<p>suggested that meaningful accountability required more than a statement that there were no 
</p>
<p>violations of the right to life or that the operations complied with the principle of legality.  
</p>
<p>26. Ms. Kebriaei noted that States must be transparent about the legal criteria that were 
</p>
<p>applied including when, where and against whom lethal force could be used, as well as the 
</p>
<p>number of casualties, where the armed drone had been used, who the individuals killed 
</p>
<p>were, and how they were classified. She noted that there was consensus across the political 
</p>
<p>divide in the States concerned that Governments could and should be more transparent. 
</p>
<p>While States had taken some steps in that direction, which was proof in itself that it could 
</p>
<p>be done, further urgent steps were needed.  
</p>
<p>27. Turning to the rights of victims of drone strikes to an effective remedy, the Legal 
</p>
<p>Director of the Foundation for Fundamental Rights said that since June 2014, 77 more 
</p>
<p>people had been killed in drone strikes in Pakistan. Like thousands of other victims, their 
</p>
<p>identity was not known. There were also tens of thousands of other individuals who 
</p>
<p>suffered psychologically from living under the constant threat of being targeted. As the 
</p>
<p>States using armed drones refused to disclose the numbers of casualties or the dates of 
</p>
<p>drone strikes, or investigate when there were credible reports that civilians had been killed, 
</p>
<p>the Foundation for Fundamental Rights had been trying to identify those who were &#8220;on the 
</p>
<p>other side of the missile&#8221; as a first step towards accountability.  
</p>
<p>28. Mr. Akbar noted that judicial review in the domestic courts had so far been the most 
</p>
<p>successful accountability strategy for victims of armed drones. Referring to his own work, 
</p>
<p>he highlighted two successful cases before the courts in Pakistan. On 11 May 2013, the 
</p>
<p>Peshawar High Court7 declared drone strikes illegal, ordered the Government of Pakistan to 
</p>
<p>stop them and gave comprehensive orders to the Government to seek international redress 
</p>
<p>on behalf of the victims.8 A court-ordered investigation also showed that over the course of 
</p>
<p>five years, drone strikes had killed 1,449 civilians, in contrast to a small number of 
</p>
<p>militants. A recent ruling by the High Court in Islamabad requested that the officials 
</p>
<p>responsible for the use of drones inside Pakistan be held criminally responsible for the 
</p>
<p>violation of the right to life and ordered the initiation of criminal proceedings against them. 
</p>
<p>However, he noted that despite those judgments, drone strikes continued and not a single 
</p>
<p>victim in over 350 drone strikes had been compensated, nor had any information been 
</p>
<p>released as to why those individuals had been targeted.  
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 6 This was recalled by the European Parliament in its resolution on the use of armed drones 
</p>
<p>(2014/2567(RSP)). 
</p>
<p> 7 See <i>Foundation for Fundamental Rights </i>v.<i> Federation of Pakistan and four others</i> (PLD 2013 
</p>
<p>Peshawar  94). 
</p>
<p> 8  This included orders to take the matter to the Security Council and, in the event that it did not succeed 
</p>
<p>there, to request an urgent meeting of the General Assembly in order to resolve the matter, as well as 
</p>
<p>to request formally that the Secretary-General establish a war crimes tribunal to investigate the 
</p>
<p>matter. </p>


<p><b> IV. Summary of the discussion 
</b></p>
<p>29. During the plenary discussion, delegations from Algeria, Bolivia (Plurinational State 
</p>
<p>of), Brazil, Chile, China, Cuba, Ecuador, France, Germany, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic 
</p>
<p>Republic of), Ireland, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, 
</p>
<p>South Africa, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Switzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
</p>
<p>Northern Ireland, the United States of America and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) 
</p>
<p>took the floor. 
</p>
<p>30. Delegates of the following non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also took the 
</p>
<p>floor: Amnesty International, the Organization for Defending Victims of Violence, the 
</p>
<p>American Civil Liberties Union, the Open Society Institute (on behalf of Open Society 
</p>
<p>Foundations), and the Women&#8217;s International League for Peace and Freedom. A 
</p>
<p>representative of ICRC also took the floor. 
</p>
<p><b> A. General remarks  
</b></p>
<p>31. Most delegations welcomed the discussion at the Human Rights Council of the 
</p>
<p>human rights implications of countering terrorism, including the use of armed drones. Some 
</p>
<p>delegations suggested that the issue of armed drones should also be discussed in other 
</p>
<p>forums, to encompass the wide-ranging aspects of the topic. Some States noted that the 
</p>
<p>conduct of military operations in conformity with international humanitarian law was not of 
</p>
<p>primary relevance to the mandate of the Human Rights Council, with one delegation 
</p>
<p>referring to the initiative of Switzerland and ICRC on enhancing compliance with 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, as a forum more conducive to engagement on issues 
</p>
<p>involving the law of armed conflict. Other delegations noted that discussions on weapons 
</p>
<p>on a thematic basis would be more appropriate in the context of arms control and 
</p>
<p>disarmament forums, with the informal meeting of experts on the Convention on 
</p>
<p>Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be 
</p>
<p>deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects noted by way of 
</p>
<p>example. 
</p>
<p>32. In their responses to the questions and remarks of delegations the panellists all 
</p>
<p>emphasized the relevance of the Human Rights Council to any discussion on the use of 
</p>
<p>armed drones. The Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions 
</p>
<p>recalled that the essence of the discussion related to targeted killings, which was an issue of 
</p>
<p>primary relevance to the &#8220;supreme&#8221; human right to life. As the Human Rights Council was 
</p>
<p>the prime international body for the examination of human rights issues, the discussion fell 
</p>
<p>squarely within its jurisdiction. He noted that the international law principles relating to the 
</p>
<p>right to life and the use of force were well established and tested over time and that the 
</p>
<p>Human Rights Council should not relinquish its responsibility as their custodian. The 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms while countering terrorism noted that the discussion was not about arms control, 
</p>
<p>but about the human rights implications of the use of armed drones. That required 
</p>
<p>consideration of the applicable legal regime, to determine whether international human 
</p>
<p>rights law operated alone or together with international humanitarian law, noting that 
</p>
<p>whatever the context, international human rights law applied to the use of armed drones and 
</p>
<p>governed the situation. It was also about the duty to investigate violations of the right to life 
</p>
<p>and the duty to be transparent about the results of the investigations, which was &#8220;classic&#8221; 
</p>
<p>human rights law territory.  
</p>
<p>33. Delegations recalled the obligation to respect the general principles of international 
</p>
<p>law in the use of drones. Respect for State sovereignty, territorial integrity, including 
</p>
<p>sovereign air space, and the political independence of all States were referred to. Speakers </p>


<p>emphasized that non-armed drones were widely and effectively used for peaceful purposes, 
</p>
<p>for example in disaster relief, while others noted their effective use in countering terrorism, 
</p>
<p>in particular in the areas of intelligence and reconnaissance. Some suggested that the 
</p>
<p>surveillance capabilities of drones in an armed conflict could help to improve overall 
</p>
<p>situational awareness before an attack, thereby reducing the risk of casualties resulting from 
</p>
<p>an attack.  
</p>
<p>34. Some delegations recalled that armed drones were not illegal and that their use, like 
</p>
<p>any other weapon, must comply with long-standing rules of international law. In the case of 
</p>
<p>the use of armed drones, reference was made to Article 2, paragraph 4, of the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations, noting that, except where the use of force takes place with the express 
</p>
<p>consent of the State on whose territory force is employed, in strict accordance with a 
</p>
<p>Security Council resolution based on Chapter VII of the Charter, or in a legitimate act of 
</p>
<p>self-defence against an armed attack, the use of force on the territory of a third State may 
</p>
<p>amount to an act of aggression. Other delegations raised ethical questions regarding the use 
</p>
<p>of armed drones and some raised doubts as to the ability to use them in compliance with 
</p>
<p>international law, with particular concerns relating to the ability to comply with the 
</p>
<p>principles of distinction, precaution and proportionality. Some referred to the involvement 
</p>
<p>of the intelligence agencies in their use and the remoteness of the operator from the 
</p>
<p>battlefield as factors hindering proper accountability. Some delegations called for their use 
</p>
<p>to be regulated at the international level and one delegation suggested that a moratorium be 
</p>
<p>placed on the use of new forms of warfare until issues of the legality of their use had been 
</p>
<p>clarified under international law. Delegations also referred to concerns related to the 
</p>
<p>acquisition or development of armed drones by non-State actors, which would create a 
</p>
<p>serious threat to international peace, security and human rights. 
</p>
<p>35. In response to delegations&#8217; comments, the Senior Attorney at the Center for 
</p>
<p>Constitutional Rights noted that there were legal and ethical questions linked to the use of 
</p>
<p>armed drones, as well as the impact that the weapons technology might have on human 
</p>
<p>rights. Concerns over the &#8220;individualization&#8221; of warfare (through the targeting of specific 
</p>
<p>individuals); de-sensitization to the use of force, owing to the remoteness of the drone 
</p>
<p>operator; and sharpened asymmetry between State and non-State actors, were also raised. 
</p>
<p>Ms. Kebraiei suggested that there was a risk that claims of enhanced precision targeting 
</p>
<p>provided by drones might be understood as equivalent to claims of enhanced legality 
</p>
<p>provided by the use of drones, as opposed to other weapons, in the use of force. There were 
</p>
<p>also concerns that the use of armed drones might lead to a lowering of the threshold for the 
</p>
<p>use of force. Finally, she highlighted the psychological impact of drones, both on affected 
</p>
<p>communities and on the remote drone operators.  
</p>
<p><b> B. International human rights framework 
</b></p>
<p>36. Many States reaffirmed the broad consensus that all measures adopted by States to 
</p>
<p>counter terrorism must comply with international law, including international human rights 
</p>
<p>and humanitarian law. That applied to the use of drones which needed to be in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the Charter of the United Nations, international human rights law and, in situations of 
</p>
<p>armed conflict, international humanitarian law, in particular the principles of precaution, 
</p>
<p>distinction, humanity and proportionality. Many speakers noted that the existing 
</p>
<p>international legal framework constituted an adequate and sufficient framework to regulate 
</p>
<p>the use of drones. Some States noted that there was a need to clarify international law 
</p>
<p>obligations, with guidance on how they should be implemented by States in that context. 
</p>
<p>One delegation noted that it was important to distinguish between principles that were 
</p>
<p>desirable and those that followed from existing legal obligations. It was also stressed that 
</p>
<p>the limitations imposed by international law on the use of lethal force must not be 
</p>
<p>weakened by relaxing interpretations of international legal standards. One delegation noted </p>


<p>that standards for the respect of international law should not be lowered in the fight against 
</p>
<p>terrorism, while another stated that the gruesome activities of terrorists should not blind 
</p>
<p>States to their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>37. Many delegations expressed concern that armed drones had been used outside the 
</p>
<p>international legal framework. Some expressed specific concerns that drone strikes could 
</p>
<p>amount to extrajudicial or arbitrary executions or, depending on the context, war crimes. It 
</p>
<p>was recalled that outside armed conflict, the key international framework was international 
</p>
<p>human rights law and some delegations recalled that international law prohibited arbitrary 
</p>
<p>and extrajudicial executions as a violation of the most fundamental right to life. Some 
</p>
<p>suggested that targeted killings could almost never be legal, either under international 
</p>
<p>human rights law, because of the strict conditions for the use of force, or under international 
</p>
<p>humanitarian law, because the killing of an individual could never be considered as the only 
</p>
<p>goal of a military operation. Some reiterated concerns over the practices of &#8220;signature 
</p>
<p>strikes&#8221; and &#8220;secondary strikes&#8221; aimed at those rescuing the victims of the first drone strike, 
</p>
<p>while others noted the disproportionate impact of drone strikes on individuals, including 
</p>
<p>women and children.  
</p>
<p>38. In response to a question on the international standards for the use of lethal force 
</p>
<p>outside armed conflict, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
</p>
<p>executions reiterated that the use of lethal force might be lawful under international human 
</p>
<p>rights law in a limited set of very exceptional situations, where there was absolute necessity 
</p>
<p>and an imminent threat. The Director of International Law and Protection Programmes at 
</p>
<p>the International Commission of Jurists noted that the principle of proportionality required 
</p>
<p>a graduated response, both in the context of law enforcement and in the context of non-
</p>
<p>international armed conflicts. In the context of law enforcement, the use of lethal force was 
</p>
<p>lawful only if it was strictly and directly necessary to save lives. Proportionality required an 
</p>
<p>examination as to whether other measures could be employed to protect the threatened 
</p>
<p>person, while necessity required an examination as to whether some lesser degree of force 
</p>
<p>could be employed, such as the use of warnings, restraint, or capture.9  
</p>
<p>39. Some speakers noted that international humanitarian law and international human 
</p>
<p>rights law were principally aimed at protecting human life and that international human 
</p>
<p>rights law was applicable to everyone within the jurisdiction of a State in both times of 
</p>
<p>peace and of armed conflict. In that regard, one delegation expressed the view that in a time 
</p>
<p>of armed conflict, international humanitarian law constituted <i>lex specialis</i>. In relation to one 
</p>
<p>speaker&#8217;s comment about the extraterritorial use of drones, the Special Rapporteur on the 
</p>
<p>promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering 
</p>
<p>terrorism recalled that article 2 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
</p>
<p>required each State party to respect and ensure to all persons subject to its jurisdiction the 
</p>
<p>rights guaranteed by the Covenant without any distinction of any kind. Guided by the 
</p>
<p>principle that a State cannot avoid its international human rights obligations by taking 
</p>
<p>action outside its territory which it would be prohibited from taking at home, State parties 
</p>
<p>were required to respect and ensure the rights laid down in the covenant to anyone within 
</p>
<p>their power or effective control, even if not situated within the territory of a State party.10 
</p>
<p>He noted that States could not avoid their human rights responsibilities simply by refraining 
</p>
<p>from bringing some powers within the bounds of the law, as this would undermine both the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 9 See also ICRC, <i>Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities under 
</i></p>
<p><i>International Humanitarian Law</i> (adopted by the Assembly of ICRC on 26 February 2009) and 
</p>

</p>
<p>obligation imposed on States parties to the Covenant.  </p>


<p>universality and the essence of international human rights law, as well as create structural 
</p>
<p>incentives for States to outsource human rights violations.  
</p>
<p>40. One observer made the point that that in all cases where the use of armed drones 
</p>
<p>under international humanitarian law was being assessed, a careful evaluation should be 
</p>
<p>undertaken to establish whether an armed conflict existed and if so, what type. However, 
</p>
<p>States had sometimes denied that international humanitarian law applied to a situation that 
</p>
<p>might be said to amount to an armed conflict, whereas on other occasions they had 
</p>
<p>extended the applicability of international humanitarian law to situations that did not fit the 
</p>
<p>legal description of an armed conflict. The observer noted that many questions related to 
</p>
<p>the applicability of humanitarian law to drone strikes could be more easily resolved if the 
</p>
<p>classification of situations of violence were carried out with a focus on the existing legal 
</p>
<p>criteria.  
</p>
<p>41. In response to a question about the criteria used to determine the existence of a non-
</p>
<p>international armed conflict, particularly with regard to non-State armed groups,  the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental 
</p>
<p>freedoms while countering terrorism noted that the two core criteria used were the degree 
</p>
<p>of organization of the armed groups involved and the intensity of hostilities. Indicators of 
</p>
<p>the degree of organization included a common command structure, adequate 
</p>
<p>communications, joint mission planning and execution and cooperation in the acquisition 
</p>
<p>and distribution of weaponry. In that respect, he noted that many had questioned whether 
</p>
<p>Al-Qaida continued to meet the criterion of organization, because its leadership and 
</p>
<p>command structure might appear to have become so degraded that it no longer constituted 
</p>
<p>in itself a sufficiently organized armed group. Regarding the question of &#8220;co-belligerency&#8221;, 
</p>
<p>he noted that there was considerable doubt that the various armed groups that operated 
</p>
<p>under the name of Al-Qaida in different parts of the world, or claimed to be affiliated to Al-
</p>
<p>Qaida, shared a sufficiently integrated command structure or mounted enough joint 
</p>
<p>operations as to be regarded as a single armed group. Turning to the criterion of intensity of 
</p>
<p>conflict, he noted that it had been argued with some justification that this criterion was no 
</p>
<p>longer being met outside the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq, given the time that had 
</p>
<p>elapsed since the events of 11 September 2001 and the relative infrequency of organized 
</p>
<p>armed attacks against the United States since then. 
</p>
<p>42. Many delegations expressed concerns that armed drones had a negative impact on 
</p>
<p>families and communities, on the right to education and to religion and on individuals that 
</p>
<p>tried to assist victims for fear of secondary strikes. Some noted that the deaths of civilians 
</p>
<p>could not be qualified as &#8220;collateral damage&#8221;, while another noted that no threat to security 
</p>
<p>could justify such attacks. Some speakers noted that victims of armed drones did not benefit 
</p>
<p>from due process rights, access to judicial review or rights of defence. One NGO noted that 
</p>
<p>States had an obligation to provide due process to individuals suspected of acts of terrorism. 
</p>
<p>43. It was stressed that States must honour their legal obligations with regard to targeted 
</p>
<p>killings taking place within their territory, including by recognizing that they could not 
</p>
<p>consent to violations of international human rights law or international humanitarian law 
</p>
<p>committed on their territory by foreign States. The Director of International Law and 
</p>
<p>Protection Programmes at the International Commission of Jurists noted that, before giving 
</p>
<p>consent to a particular operation, a State must, at a minimum, require the targeting State to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate verifiably that the person against whom lethal force was to be used was a 
</p>
<p>legitimate target, to ensure that the targeting State would comply with all applicable law, 
</p>
<p>including the requirement to use a graduated response before resorting to lethal force, and 
</p>
<p>would comply with the prohibition against excessive or disproportionate loss of civilian life 
</p>
<p>or damage to civilian objects.  
</p>
<p>44. One State emphasized that the use of drones was counterproductive, as it fomented 
</p>
<p>hatred in a population, further nurturing and fuelling terrorism. Another delegation noted </p>


<p>that it was essential that States focus on support for victims of terrorism as this would 
</p>
<p>reduce social tensions, as well as other conditions conducive to terrorism. The Legal 
</p>
<p>Director of the Foundation for Fundamental Rights noted that, as part of an effective 
</p>
<p>counter-terrorism strategy, States should bring to justice any person suspected of acts of 
</p>
<p>terrorism, and respect their rights of access to justice and due process. The use of drones, 
</p>
<p>combined with the absence of any accountability and reparation for victims, brought new 
</p>
<p>threats and was in fact counterproductive.  
</p>
<p><b> C. Accountability and transparency 
</b></p>
<p>45. Many delegations emphasized that States must take responsibility for their actions 
</p>
<p>and that there could not be impunity for violations of international law that might result 
</p>
<p>from the use of armed drones. States must make every effort to avoid casualties and take 
</p>
<p>steps to address and investigate the harm caused to individuals because of their use.  
</p>
<p>46. Many delegations emphasized that lack of transparency created an accountability 
</p>
<p>vacuum and prevented access to an effective remedy for victims. Transparency played an 
</p>
<p>important role in assessing and enhancing respect for the rule of law. It was required for an 
</p>
<p>evaluation of the consequences of the use of armed drones, a determination of the 
</p>
<p>applicable legal framework and, consequently, a determination of the lawfulness of each 
</p>
<p>strike. States that were using drones were urged to be as transparent as possible concerning 
</p>
<p>the use of armed drones, as a significant step towards ensuring accountability.  
</p>
<p>47. It was emphasized, therefore, that States should release information about their use 
</p>
<p>of armed drones. It was noted that they should publicly disclose the legal criteria governing 
</p>
<p>their lethal targeting operations, including any legal advice received, the records of their 
</p>
<p>targeting decisions and operations, and should specify the safeguards in place to ensure 
</p>
<p>compliance with international law. Speakers also noted that States must make public the 
</p>
<p>identity and number of individuals killed or injured in targeted killing operations and the 
</p>
<p>measures in place to prevent civilian casualties, and ensure redress when such casualties 
</p>
<p>occurred. It was noted that the onus is on the State to provide the basic information and to 
</p>
<p>demonstrate the legality of such operations and any consent or assistance provided. 
</p>
<p>48. The Senior Attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights recalled that 
</p>
<p>transparency was connected to accountability, which was an obligation under international 
</p>
<p>law, not a policy choice. She noted that, despite a commitment to greater transparency, 
</p>
<p>States that used drones had publicly acknowledged very few strikes and had not made their 
</p>
<p>legal standards public. In addition to more transparency about the law and the criteria that 
</p>
<p>governed the use of armed drones, States should also offer public explanations to satisfy the 
</p>
<p>right to truth of victims when investigations were conducted.  
</p>
<p>49. Delegations also noted that States must facilitate prompt, independent and impartial 
</p>
<p>investigations where civilian deaths or injuries were reported, and victims must have access 
</p>
<p>to an effective remedy. A coalition of NGOs noted that much more could be done by States 
</p>
<p>to provide redress for victims whose harm had been well documented, but who were denied 
</p>
<p>much needed assistance, as well as their basic dignity. Other speakers noted that victims 
</p>
<p>must be appropriately compensated and that there must be judicial accountability at the 
</p>
<p>national level. One delegation noted that its Government was committed, in its use of 
</p>
<p>armed drones, to providing the greatest possible transparency consistent with national 
</p>
<p>security needs. It noted that, where civilians were killed or injured, after-action reviews 
</p>
<p>were conducted to determine why and to ensure that effective steps were taken to minimize 
</p>
<p>the risk of civilians being killed or injured in the future. In addition, condolences or ex 
</p>
<p>gratia payments might be available.  </p>


<p>50. The Director of International Law and Protection Programmes at the International 
</p>
<p>Commission of Jurists addressed the specific obligations of a State on whose territory a 
</p>
<p>drone strike had taken place, as a result of which there had been casualties, whether the 
</p>
<p>State had consented to the use of drones on its territory or not. He noted that in addition to 
</p>
<p>the obligation to investigate if there was any doubt that the killing was unlawful, the State 
</p>
<p>must ensure, where applicable, that individuals were held criminally responsible if they 
</p>
<p>were within the power or effective control of that State, and ensure the provision of 
</p>
<p>effective remedies and adequate reparation to victims, including in upholding the right to 
</p>
<p>the truth. 
</p>
<p>51. In response to a question on best practices for accountability and transparency, the 
</p>
<p>Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions underscored the 
</p>
<p>importance of action at different levels, noting a role for the international community, for 
</p>
<p>regional bodies, for United Nations field offices and for domestic institutions, such as the 
</p>
<p>legislature and national human rights institutions. He also referred to the transparency 
</p>
<p>requirement enshrined in Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, which provided 
</p>
<p>that a State acting in self-defence must report the measures it had adopted in that regard to 
</p>
<p>the Security Council, noting that this could apply to the use of drones. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms 
</p>
<p>while countering terrorism emphasized that there was no justification for States to keep 
</p>
<p>secret their own estimates of the number of civilian casualties that had been inflicted by 
</p>
<p>drone strikes. The obligation to investigate and to make public the results was triggered 
</p>
<p>whenever there was a plausible indication from any source that civilian casualties might 
</p>
<p>have been sustained, including when the facts were unclear, or the information was partial 
</p>
<p>or circumstantial. He further noted that to entrust methods of warfare to a secret intelligence 
</p>
<p>agency that by nature cannot confirm or deny the existence of its operations, necessarily 
</p>
<p>frustrated the duties of accountability and transparency and made it impossible for the State 
</p>
<p>involved to make public the results of its post-strike investigations. Military activity that 
</p>
<p>claimed the lives of human beings could never lawfully reach the requirements of 
</p>
<p>accountability and transparency if it was carried out by secret intelligence agencies. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>52. <b>In their concluding remarks, the panellists emphasized that the human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>implications of the use of armed drones was an issue firmly within the remit of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Human Rights Council. They affirmed that the existing legal framework was 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient and clear. They recalled that international human rights law was applicable 
</b></p>
<p><b>at all times and that armed drones were not always used in the context of an armed 
</b></p>
<p><b>conflict. In such situations, international human rights law and domestic law were the 
</b></p>
<p><b>primary, and often the exclusive, sources of law applicable to the use of armed drones. 
</b></p>
<p><b>Where the situation did amount to an armed conflict, international human rights law 
</b></p>
<p><b>remained applicable and the right to life was interpreted through the lens of 
</b></p>
<p><b>international humanitarian law.  
</b></p>
<p>53. <b>The panellists emphasized that current practices in the use of drones raised 
</b></p>
<p><b>serious questions regarding compliance with international law, including international 
</b></p>
<p><b>human rights law. The right to life must be respected in its two components: the right 
</b></p>
<p><b>not to be subject to arbitrary deprivation of life and accountability for violations of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the right to life. The violation of either is a violation of the right to life itself. There 
</b></p>
<p><b>were serious concerns related to the ability of signature strikes and other such 
</b></p>
<p><b>practices to comply with international law that needed to be addressed.  
</b></p>
<p>54. <b>The lack of accountability for violations of international human rights law, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>particular the right to life, must be addressed. Where there were credible allegations </b></p>


<p><b>of violations of international law, States were under an obligation to carry out 
</b></p>
<p><b>prompt, independent and impartial investigations, and to make the results publicly 
</b></p>
<p><b>available. States had a duty of public explanation to victims and to the international 
</b></p>
<p><b>community. States should permit judicial review of the claims alleging grave 
</b></p>
<p><b>violations of domestic and international law, and should be more transparent in their 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of drones as a precondition to any meaningful accountability, including by 
</b></p>
<p><b>providing information about the legal basis for the use of drones and facts about 
</b></p>
<p><b>specific strikes.  
</b></p>
<p>55. <b>The plight of victims must be recognized, and their rights to effective remedy, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including reparation and the right to truth, must be respected. The impact of drone 
</b></p>
<p><b>strikes on individuals and communities must also be recognized, including their 
</b></p>
<p><b>impact on the right to work, to education, to health, to religion and to association. 
</b></p>
<p><b>With regard to individuals suspected of terrorist activity, the rights of due process, to 
</b></p>
<p><b>a fair trial, to the presumption of innocence, and to respect for the rule of law must 
</b></p>
<p><b>also be respected. 
</b></p>
<p>56. <b>Finally, the panellists noted that it was important that the Human Rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>Council remain actively engaged on issues related to the human rights aspects of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>use of armed drones. The starting point of any legal analysis on armed drones should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be existing international law, in particular the prohibition against the arbitrary 
</b></p>
<p><b>deprivation of life. Modifying well-established rules of international law to 
</b></p>
<p><b>accommodate the use of drones might have the unintended long-term consequence of 
</b></p>
<p><b>weakening those rules. The existing legal framework was sufficient and did not need 
</b></p>
<p><b>to be adapted to the use of drones, rather, it was the use of armed drones that must 
</b></p>
<p><b>comply with international law.  
</b></p>
<p>    </p>
