<p><b>  Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human 
Rights on the situation of human rights in Colombia</b>*, ** 
</p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> 
 In accordance with the mandate set forth in the 1996 agreement between the 
Government of Colombia and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Human Rights (OHCHR), the present report analyses the most important developments 
relating to the situation of human rights and international humanitarian law in Colombia in 
2009. It records, among other issues, the significant progress made in terms of a drastic 
reduction in the number of complaints of extrajudicial executions and the continuous 
prosecution of members of Congress and public officials for alleged links with paramilitary 
organizations. 
</p>
<p> The report recognizes the Government&#8217;s openness to international scrutiny, which it 
has demonstrated by receiving four Special Rapporteurs and self-monitoring the 
recommendations of the universal periodic review. The High Commissioner acknowledges 
the spirit of cooperation that exists between the Government and OHCHR-Colombia and 
the commitment of the Government to address human rights challenges. 
</p>
<p> The report demonstrates how the internal armed conflict continues to pose many 
challenges for the country, including the complete disregard for international humanitarian 
law by guerrilla groups. This situation is exacerbated by violence against civilians 
committed by illegal armed groups that emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary 
organizations, links between illegal armed groups and drug trafficking, and the particularly 
acute impact of the internal armed conflict on indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian 
communities.

</p>
<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. On 29 November 1996, the Government of Colombia and the Office of the United 
Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) agreed on the establishment of 
an office in Colombia of OHCHR (&#8220;OHCHR-Colombia&#8221;). This agreement was extended, 
with no changes, until 30 October 2010. 
</p>
<p>2. In the framework of its mandate, OHCHR-Colombia observes the situation of 
human rights and international humanitarian law in order to assist authorities in the 
development and application of policies, programmes and measures to promote and protect 
human rights, and submits analytical reports to the High Commissioner. The present report 
covers 2009 and focuses on a number of priority issues, which were regularly discussed 
with the Government.  
</p>
<p>3. In 2009, Colombia demonstrated a high level of openness towards international 
mechanisms for the protection of human rights. Upon invitation of the Government, visits 
were made by four special rapporteurs: (a) the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, 
summary or arbitrary executions (8&#8211;18 June); (b) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people (22&#8211;27 July); (c) the Special 
Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders (7&#8211;18 September); and (d) the 
Special Rapporteur on independence of judges and lawyers (7&#8211;16 December).1  
</p><p>4. The Deputy High Commissioner visited Colombia between 28 November and 4 
December 2009 to participate in the Second Review Conference of the Convention on the 
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and 
on Their Destruction (Ottawa Convention). She held meetings with the Vice-President, 
ministers and high-level public officials, representatives of civil society organizations and 
the international community. She travelled to Putumayo for a first-hand observation of the 
local challenges to human rights and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>5. Three treaty bodies analysed the situation in the country: the Committee on the 
Protection of the Rights of all Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (21 and 22 
April 2009), the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (12 and 13 
August), and the Committee against Torture (10 and 11 November).2 The Government also 
underwent the universal periodic review of the Human Rights Council in March, and on 19 
August the Secretary-General presented to the Security Council the first report on the 
situation of children in armed conflict in Colombia pursuant to resolution 1612 (2005).3  
</p><p>6. The main challenge for 2010 is to advance in the effective implementation of the 
recommendations emanating from these reviews and all previous pending recommendations 
of the High Commissioner, a process in which OHCHR-Colombia offers its cooperation 
and advice. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Context 
</b>7. The full realization of human rights in Colombia continues to be affected by a 
complex internal armed conflict, which is exacerbated by organized violence, particularly 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>1
 Colombia was the most visited country in 2009 by special procedures mandate holders. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>2
 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the Human Rights Committee 
</p>
<p>formulated their lists of issues to be addressed in the review of the periodic reports of Colombia. The 
actual review of those reports will take place in May and July 2010, respectively. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>

</b></p>
<p>related to drug trafficking. This situation has negatively affected the functioning of 
democratic institutions and the socio-economic development of the country. The security 
improvements of the past years and the overall reduction of homicides in 2009 at the 
national level were affected by a sharp increase in killing rates in some cities, such as 
Medell&#237;n, a rise in intimidation and the number of death threats against, inter alia<i>,</i> youth 
and human rights defenders, and the expansion of, and the violence against civilians from, 
illegal armed groups that emerged after the paramilitary demobilization.  
</p>
<p>8. Other developments which affected human rights were serious irregularities 
involving the Department of National Security (DAS); on-going tension between the 
Government and the Supreme Court, including the impasse in the selection of the Attorney 
General; difficulties in achieving more releases after the release of, inter alia<i>,</i> various 
kidnapped policemen and politicians by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-
People&#8217;s Army (FARC-EP) in the first half of the year; continued disregard for 
international humanitarian law by guerrilla groups and their attacks on the civilian 
population; and the political polarization fuelled by the uncertainty around a possible 
referendum that could allow President Alvaro Uribe to run for a third term. 
</p>
<p>9. A number of normative advances and policies adopted by the Government have 
helped improve the human rights situation, including the drastic reduction in the number of 
complaints of extrajudicial executions attributed to the army. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Human rights and international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Situation of the judiciary 
</b>10. Tension and public disputes between the executive and judicial branches during 
2009 may have undermined the independence of the judiciary. OHCHR-Colombia 
documented public statements by high-level government officials and social and political 
actors discrediting the Supreme Court and its magistrates, as well as undue interference, 
direct or indirect, into their functions through lobbying, pressure and threats. These acts 
could constitute a violation of the United Nations principles of judicial independence4 and 
raise concerns over some magistrates&#8217; personal security. 
</p>
<p>11. Persistent structural problems in the administration of justice5 and disagreements 
within the judicial branch have prompted claims for reform of the judiciary. Any reform 
should be participatory and transparent to ensure the full realization of the right to a 
competent, independent, impartial and prompt justice for all. 
</p><p>12. It is essential to strengthen the work of the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, 
guaranteeing its ability to exercise its responsibilities with independence, security, freedom 
and professionalism, without restrictions or pressure. 
</p>
<p>13. During her visit in December, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges 
and lawyers advocated for better protection for all judicial actors to secure their 
independence. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>

 General Assembly resolutions 40/32, 29 November 1985, and 40/146, 13 December 1985. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>5
 OHCHR-Colombia has consistently reported problems such as &#8220;the underreporting of crimes to the 
</p>
<p>authorities, difficulties of access to the judicial system, the insufficiency of funds and technological 
resources (despite increased budgets), the lack of uniform criteria in the application of the law, the 
high workload of judges and prosecutors, the slow pace of proceedings and cases of corruption&#8221; 
(A/HRC/7/39, para. 12). </p>


<p><b>6</b> GE.10-11819 
</p>
<p><b> B. Intelligence services </b></p>
<p>14. Information was made public in 2009 that DAS (the national civil intelligence 
agency reporting directly to the President) had conducted widespread and systematic illegal 
intelligence operations going at least as far back as 2003. These operations targeted, inter 
alia<i>,</i> human rights defenders, political opposition leaders, journalists and high-level 
Government officials, such as the Vice-President. Furthermore, disturbing information 
appeared in the public domain that even magistrates of the Supreme Court were subject to 
surveillance. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, a United Nations special 
rapporteur and OHCHR-Colombia itself were targeted as well. These actions, in many 
cases, had the objective of invalidating the work of the victims, who were considered as 
&#8220;legitimate targets&#8221; for being potential opponents to Government policies. 
</p>
<p>15. Illegal activities by DAS included wiretapping of phones and Internet lines, 
surveillance, harassment and threats, theft of information and break-ins into offices and 
homes. This has provoked a climate of fear and insecurity and, in some instances, sabotage 
and discrediting of the work of human rights defenders. Actions against women included 
direct threats against their children, at times with violent sexual content.  
</p>
<p>16. These activities appear to have been carried out by informal structures created by 
high-ranking officials within DAS, which provided the semblance of legality and hierarchy 
necessary to obtain, administer and exchange information, as well as access to the human, 
technical, and financial resources of the institution. In some cases, even DAS protection 
schemes for human rights defenders and others were used to obtain information. 
</p>
<p>17. The Procurator General and the Attorney General initiated investigations against 
approximately 40 DAS officials, including 4 former directors. The Government took 
measures to restructure DAS, including accepting resignations, conducting internal 
investigations and separating judicial police functions from intelligence activities. In 
September 2009, the President ordered the closing of DAS and the creation of a new 
intelligence agency. 
</p>
<p>18. Additionally, some members of the public security forces continued to use State 
intelligence services to conduct illegal and clandestine operations against social and 
political sectors that were critical of the Government, using similar methods as described 
above. Such activities were also directed against public officials working in defence of 
human rights. Illegally obtained information was occasionally used by different units of the 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office to bring charges against human rights defenders and social 
activists. 
</p>
<p>19. Of particular concern was a case of theft of information regarding children&#8217;s rights 
from a United Nations staff member by unknown perpetrators.  
</p>
<p>20. The challenge now is to establish the responsibilities and circumstances that 
facilitated these illegal DAS activities and to identify those who allowed them to happen 
and/or benefited from them. Difficulties faced by the prosecutors in the initial phase must 
be overcome to enable the investigations to continue safely and independently, without 
pressure or threats. Impunity, as well as a lack of democratic control and oversight of 
intelligence services, has made such criminal conduct possible.  
</p>
<p>21. Therefore, beyond the announced closing of DAS, the necessary legal, political and 
administrative conditions as well as robust controls and oversight of its intelligence services 
should be established. The new Intelligence Law and its corresponding Decree should be 
enabling in this regard. The Government is urged to take specific, time-bound and 
transparent measures for their implementation. In this respect, a plan of action for the 
creation of a national mechanism to purge files should be expedited by the relevant 
Government institutions, in consultation with all relevant stakeholders and victims, </p>


<p>GE.10-11819 <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>facilitating an active role of the Procurator General, as previously recommended by 
OHCHR-Colombia. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists 
</b>22. OHCHR-Colombia has registered cases of, inter alia, killings, threats, arbitrary 
detentions, sexual offences, break-ins into homes and offices and information theft directed 
against human rights defenders. These violations have been attributed to members of illegal 
armed groups that emerged after the paramilitary demobilization and guerrilla groups, in 
particular FARC-EP, as well as, in some cases, members of security forces. 
</p>
<p>23. In 2009, there was an increase in intimidation and death threats through pamphlets 
and e-mail against human rights defenders, social and community leaders, as well as 
members of marginalized groups. While progress has been made in some investigations, 
most of the threats remain unaccounted for, and, at times, authorities were quick to dismiss 
them without prior investigation. 
</p>
<p>24. Meanwhile, some charges of rebellion, terrorism, defamation and/or slander brought 
against human rights defenders and journalists who question Government policies or 
denounce corruption and human rights violations have been promptly investigated. The 
Attorney General&#8217;s Office must act with transparency, impartiality and in a timely manner 
in every case, regardless of whether a human rights defender is a victim or accused of a 
crime. 
</p>
<p>25. Of particular concern are the threats against and killings of trade union members,6 
journalists, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) persons and those who promote 
their rights. Similar concern is held for those advocating for the ethno-territorial rights of 
Afro-Colombian communities and indigenous peoples. Representatives and supporters of 
victims in the framework of Law 975 (2005), particularly if they advocate for the restitution 
of stolen lands, were subject to harassment, and even killed, as were peace activists, 
community leaders and public officials who promote and defend human rights, such as the 
analysts of the Early Warning System7 and municipal ombudsmen. 
</p>
<p>26. In the past few years, the Government has invested large amounts of human and 
financial resources into protection programmes for different groups at risk. This important 
effort, however, requires better coordination and must be expanded, for instance, to include 
staff of the Early Warning System, incorporate a gender focus, and expedite and reduce 
delays between the adoption of protection measures and their implementation. The ongoing 
transfer of protection schemes to private companies and other related reforms should be 
made in consultation with beneficiaries, in the understanding that the State obligation to 
uphold, protect and ensure the full enjoyment of rights within its jurisdiction cannot be 
delegated. 
</p>
<p>27. Between April and May 2009, the Government and national networks of human 
rights, social rights and peace activists agreed on a procedure to discuss the guarantees 
required by human rights defenders to undertake their work. In April, actively supported by 
the international community, a national round table was established to this end and a series 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>6
 Between January and October, the Presidential Programme for Human Rights registered 27 killings of 
</p>
<p>trade unionists, 14 of which were teachers. In the same period, the Unitary Workers Union (Central 
Unitaria de Trabajadores, CUT) reported 37 killings, including 4 women. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>7
 The Early Warning System, in its Spanish acronym SAT, is a system housed in the Ombudsman&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>Office with a mission to produce risk alerts about gross violations of human rights and international 
humanitarian law. </p>


<p><b>8</b> GE.10-11819 
</p>
<p>of discussions took place in approximately half the departments. OHCHR-Colombia 
welcomes this exercise and the specific commitments reached, and it calls for their prompt 
implementation by the Government. A number of death threats were received by human 
rights defenders involved in this exercise. They have yet to be properly investigated. 
</p>
<p>28. OHCHR-Colombia notes with concern that public officials and military personnel 
have continued making statements against human rights defenders, accusing or suggesting 
that their work is contrary to the interests of the State or sympathetic to guerrilla groups. 
Such statements increase security risks for human rights defenders and can limit their 
activities, engender self-censorship and deepen the distrust between State and civil society. 
</p>
<p>29. In this respect, OHCHR-Colombia welcomes regulations issued and statements 
made by the President, the Vice-President and the Minister of Interior about the legitimacy 
of the work of human rights defenders.8 High-level officials are encouraged to maintain a 
consistent and active public discourse in support of human rights defenders and lower-level 
public officials should follow it. The Government and the Procurator General should apply 
sanctions to public officials who continue to stigmatize human rights defenders. 
</p>
<p>30. During her visit in September, the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human 
rights defenders recognized that the Government had undertaken important efforts 
supporting human rights defenders, but confirmed that they continue to operate in a non-
conducive environment of hostility and fear.  
</p>
<p>31. Some progress has been achieved in the construction of national plans for human 
rights. The National Round Table on Guarantees is an important step towards a concerted 
national action plan on human rights and international humanitarian law. The National Plan 
for Education on Human Rights, which should be promptly implemented in all departments 
and municipalities by the Ministry of Education, was launched in November 2009.  
</p>
<p><b> D. Investigations into alleged links of members of Congress and public 
officials with paramilitary organizations 
</b></p>
<p>32. Since the detention of three members of Congress in November 2006, the number of 
politicians and public officials investigated for alleged links with paramilitary 
organizations, or cases of &#8220;<i>parapolitica</i>&#8221;, continued to increase. By November 2009, there 
were 93 open cases against members of Congress consisting of 268 elected 
parliamentarians for the period 2006&#8211;2010, from 15 different political parties. As of 
December 2009, there was a total of 13 convicted persons, 5 acquitted and 9 released due to 
lack of sufficient evidence to proceed.9 By November 2009, 249 cases had been initiated 
against 12 governors, 166 mayors, 13 departmental representatives and 58 councillors. 
</p>
<p>33. Forty-three members of Congress have resigned in order to be investigated by the 
Attorney General instead of the Supreme Court. In September 2009, however, the Court 
ruled that it would continue to exercise jurisdiction when the alleged crime is related to 
their position and function as members of Congress.10 The new jurisprudence should 
promote a more standardized investigation of these cases. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>8
 In a public statement made on 17 September 2009, the President acknowledged that &#8220;the defense of 
</p>
<p>human rights is a necessary and legitimate action for democracy&#8221;.

<p>GE.10-11819 <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>34. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes measures taken by the Supreme Court that have 
improved due process, such as the explicit separation of roles within the Court between the 
investigative and prosecutorial function and adjudication.11 Further measures, however, are 
still necessary, such as the right to appeal, which the Supreme Court seems to be 
considering. 
</p>
<p>35. &#8220;<i>Parapolitica</i>&#8221; cases underscore the need for the State and civil society to closely 
monitor the electoral processes scheduled for 2010 and 2011, including those at the 
municipal and departmental levels, to prevent the recurrence of such cases. Relevant 
authorities should undertake all necessary measures to ensure fair, transparent and 
democratic election processes. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Extrajudicial executions 
</b>36. Since November 2008, complaints of extrajudicial executions attributed to security 
forces, particularly the army, have drastically decreased,12 primarily as a result of the 
implementation and monitoring of the measures adopted in October and November 2008 by 
the President and the Ministry of Defense.13 In 2009, new rules of engagement and an 
Operational Law Handbook, containing important rules for the respect and protection of 
human rights, were issued by the Ministry of Defense. Total and sustained elimination of 
extrajudicial killings will require continued efforts by the Ministry of Defense and the 
army. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes that the Ministry of Defense accepted its offer to 
monitor the implementation of some of the policy measures aimed at strengthening 
compliance by the army with human rights and international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>37. The large caseload of alleged extrajudicial executions is a matter of serious concern 
for the coming years. By September 2009, the National Human Rights and International 
Humanitarian Law Unit of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office had been assigned the 
investigation of 1,273 cases, with a total of 2,077 victims (122 of them were women and 59 
minors) in 29 departments. These figures demonstrate that the alleged executions were not 
isolated acts and that it is necessary to allocate sufficient human, technical and financial 
resources for this Unit to effectively function to ensure that the cases do not go unpunished.  
</p>
<p>38. During his visit in June, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions acknowledged the efforts undertaken by the Government, but noted 
with concern the gap between policies and their implementation. 
</p>
<p>39. Further efforts are required to reinforce full assimilation and adherence by all 
military personnel to the policies adopted by the Ministry of Defense regarding 
extrajudicial executions. Indeed, some members of the security forces continued to make 
statements that discredit those who denounce cases of executions, adopt corrective 
measures, investigate cases and punish those responsible. Some of these statements suggest 
that military personnel are frequently faced with frivolous judicial charges of extrajudicial 
executions with a view to questioning military operations. However, there are 109 
indictments, 38 convictions and three acquittals that put into question the validity of such 
allegations, at least in some cases.

 Supreme Court agreement number 001, 19 February 2009. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>12
 In 2009, the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law National Unit of the Attorney 
</p>
<p>General&#8217;s Office recorded 7 cases compared to 144 in 2008 and 464 in 2007. 
 
</p>
<p>13
 Among other measures, 3 Generals and another 24 officers and sub-officers were separated from 
</p>
<p>service by the President. </p>


<p><b>10</b> GE.10-11819 
</p>
<p>40. A series of procedural practices by defence lawyers in legal proceedings have been 
considered as dilatory and unjustified and a number of private lawyers of military personnel 
are illegally presenting themselves as officials of the Ministry of Defense and/or the so-
called Military Defense (DEMIL) to pressure witnesses into changing their testimonies. 
These activities openly violate the policies of the military high command and the Ministry 
of Defense, and should be rejected and duly sanctioned.  
</p><p>41. The military jurisdiction continued to hand over cases of human rights violations to 
the ordinary justice system.14 However, the fact that there are 249 jurisdictional disputes yet 
to be resolved regarding alleged extrajudicial executions demonstrates that these efforts 
need to be reinforced to ensure that such disputes do not become a systematic practice to 
unnecessarily delay judicial proceedings. Military jurisdiction should be limited exclusively 
to cases of service-related offences, as clearly stipulated in the revised Military Criminal 
Code. 
</p>
<p>42. In 2009, there was also evidence of serious shortcomings in the protection of the 
families of victims, witnesses, prosecutors and judges. OHCHR-Colombia registered death 
threats, a killing and an assassination attempt against two relatives of victims. Threats were 
received even by active members of security forces who cooperated with the justice 
process. Together with attempts to discredit or delay judicial proceedings, this could 
constitute a pattern of harassment to prevent the processes from moving forward. The 
Government should adopt measures to increase the protection of witnesses, families of 
victims, and judicial officials, publicly legitimize their work and counteract any actions that 
promote impunity. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Sexual violence 
</b></p>
<p>43. Statistics on cases of sexual violence, including those committed in the context of 
the internal armed conflict, continue to be incomplete and fragmented. According to the 
National Institute of Legal Medicine, the number of registered cases of sexual violence, 
occurring in different contexts including the internal armed conflict, increased from 12,732 
in 2000 to 21,202 in 2008. It is of particular concern that in almost 86 per cent of these 
cases the victims were girls, most of whom were between 10 and 14 years (31.5 per cent). 
Several efforts are under way to address sexual violence and it is imperative to properly 
assist victims, encourage the pressing of charges and ensure effective reporting and 
investigation of cases.  
</p>
<p>44. In 2009, OHCHR-Colombia received an alarming amount of information on cases of 
sexual violence against women and girls that were attributed to members of FARC-EP and 
the illegal armed groups that emerged after the paramilitary demobilization. The latter were 
accused of committing acts of sexual violence and creating networks of prostitution, human 
trafficking, and sexual slavery, occasionally with the acquiescence and even collaboration 
of some members of the National Police, particularly in Medell&#237;n. OHCHR-Colombia was 
informed of cases of rape in Tolima and recruitment by FARC-EP of women and girls in 
Antioquia, who were also victims of forced contraception. 
</p>
<p>45. Of particular concern are several cases where the alleged perpetrators are members 
of security forces in Antioquia, Arauca, Bogot&#225;, Bolivar, Cesar, Choc&#243; and Guaviare. In the 
majority of these cases, the victims were girls. In some cases, military and legal authorities 
have implemented adequate measures, such as public recognition of wrong-doing and 
expediting investigations, but, in other cases, members of security forces contributed to the 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>14
 By November 2009, 251 cases have been handed over to the ordinary justice system. </p>


<p>GE.10-11819 <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>stigmatization of the victims or pressured them to withdraw their accusations through 
coercion, threats or payoffs. 
</p>
<p>46. These cases indicate the need for security forces to undertake firm, clear and 
definitive measures of &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; regarding sexual violence, including separation 
from service. Without waiting for or excluding the results of prosecutions and disciplinary 
proceedings, it is necessary to adopt preventive measures, publicly recognize the facts 
(without exposing or re-victimizing victims) and ensure reparations and minimum 
guarantees of non-repetition. Some good efforts in this regard include the creation of round 
tables on gender-based violence organized by the Ministry of Defense and the United 
Nations and the adoption of measures to assist and protect victims and to prevent sexual 
violence. 
</p>
<p>47. Despite the significant efforts by the Attorney General to train his personnel and 
create special investigative units, impunity for acts of sexual violence remains widespread. 
The Constitutional Court ruled in its order 036 of 2009 that investigations of 183 cases of 
sexual violence by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office were not satisfactory. Further progress is 
also needed to implement the court-ordered prevention programmes against sexual 
violence, which, by November 2009, were still only in the design stage and require the 
active participation of women. 
</p>
<p>48. The corresponding Decree should be promptly issued for Law 1257 (2008) on 
measures for raising awareness and prevention and punishment of all forms of violence and 
discrimination against women. Meanwhile, there are existing legal provisions, such as non-
compulsory conciliation, which should be directly and immediately applied by competent 
authorities. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or 
punishment 
</b></p>
<p>49. Colombia continues to lack a reliable source of official data on torture and cruel, 
inhuman and degrading treatment. The existing data do not seem to reflect either the 
magnitude or the real impact of the problem. The victims&#8217; fear of reprisals, the lack of trust 
in institutions, the absence of appropriate legal and psychosocial support, the lack of 
adequate and differentiated protection, and the social stigmatization of victims hamper the 
full understanding of the extent of the problem.  
</p>
<p>50. By June 2009, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office was investigating 10,545 cases of 
torture. These cases relate to both physical and psychological torture and, for the most part, 
the victims had been tortured in conjunction with other crimes, such as enforced 
disappearance, kidnapping or sexual violence. That they are associated with other human 
rights violations do not diminish the gravity of the crime of torture.  
</p>
<p>51. Some social groups are particularly vulnerable to torture, such as women, children, 
youth, incarcerated persons, and LGBT persons, in particular in Antioquia. 
</p>
<p>52. Ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other 
Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as an instrument for prevention 
and technical cooperation, would contribute to a more efficient protection against this 
scourge. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p>53. Enforced disappearance continues to be of major concern. By December 2009, the 
National Registry of Disappeared Persons reported 37,300 cases, of which almost 10,000 </p>


<p><b>12</b> GE.10-11819 
</p>
<p>were cases of enforced disappearance.15 Most of these cases remain unsolved, and their 
perpetrators and motives unidentified. In the fight against criminal gangs, especially in 
Medell&#237;n, there have been a number of cases of enforced disappearance attributed to the 
National Police. 
</p>
<p>54. Victims of enforced disappearance continued to be primarily young, unemployed 
men from poor families, living in shanty towns or in isolated rural areas. The impact on 
their families, especially on those headed by women, including the suffering from not 
knowing the whereabouts of their loved ones, has been tortuous.  
</p>
<p>55. The Attorney General&#8217;s Office has continued conducting exhumations.16 By 
December 2009, under Law 975 (2005), there were 2,520 cases of enforced disappearance, 
out of a total of 35,664 crimes confessed. As a result, 2,388 graves with 2,901 bodies have 
been found. However, the identification and return of the remains and bodies continued to 
be very slow: 910 have been fully identified, of which 796 have been handed over to the 
families. 
</p>
<p>56. Investigations prior to the exhumation process are essential to determine the 
circumstances of the events and identify the victims. However, it is difficult to ensure full 
participation of the victims&#8217; family in the proceedings, as the identity of the person to be 
exhumed is usually unknown. This requires improved institutional coordination between 
the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and national institutions responsible for the search for 
disappeared persons, in order to exchange and cross-reference all available information. 
OHCHR-Colombia welcomes the efforts made during 2009 and notes that there is still a 
long way to go before relatives can fully participate in these processes. 
</p>
<p>57. The Law to Respect, Locate and Identify Victims of Enforced Disappearance, 
adopted in November 2009, is a step forward in the recognition of victims&#8217; rights. OHCHR-
Colombia further welcomes the initial steps taken by the Senate towards the integral and 
prompt ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from 
Enforced Disappearance, which will require aligning national legislation to international 
standards. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Illegal armed groups which emerged after demobilization of 
paramilitary organizations 
</b></p>
<p>58. Across the country, OHCHR-Colombia notes with great concern the expansion, 
increasing activities and violence against civilians perpetrated by illegal armed groups that 
emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary organizations. 
</p>
<p>59. Among the violent acts perpetrated by these groups in 2009, there were massacres, 
selective murders, threats, forced displacement and sexual violence. Victims include social 
leaders, indigenous and Afro-Colombian persons as well as local public officials, in 
particular if they were involved in processes of restitution of lands or if they controlled 
public resources. The attacks have targeted those who resisted the demands of these groups, 
possessed property of interest to a particular group, were seen as collaborating with or 
belonging to other groups, or happened to be in an area of dispute between rival groups. 
There are also a number of demobilized persons among victims, due to a &#8220;settling of 
personal scores&#8221; or for refusing to join these groups.

<p>GE.10-11819 <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>60. The organized violence perpetrated by these groups in rural and urban areas allows 
them to enforce visible &#8220;social control&#8221;, forcing people to directly or indirectly support 
their activities. They continue to forcibly recruit and use children and youth, through deceit 
or economic incentives, inter alia, for drug trafficking, killings or intelligence work. 
</p>
<p>61. Some of these groups operate in similar ways to old paramilitary organizations, 
participating in criminal activities such as drug trafficking, extortion, stealing of lands, 
prostitution, and human trafficking, as well as engaging in lawful but at times irregular 
activities, such as lotteries and security services. Their ranks include demobilized and non-
demobilized former members of paramilitary organizations, some recruited voluntarily and 
others forcibly. Several former paramilitary middle-ranking fighters and former military 
personnel now hold senior positions in these groups.  
</p>
<p>62. These groups occasionally reach agreements amongst themselves or with local 
combat units of FARC-EP or the National Liberation Army (ELN) to facilitate illegal 
businesses, particularly drug trafficking. They engage in bloody disputes with rival groups 
or even amongst themselves, generating further violence against civilians who are caught in 
the middle. OHCHR-Colombia has identified cases of collusion, principally as a result of 
corruption, but also tolerance and acquiescence, of members of the security forces with 
these groups. 
</p>
<p>63. These groups are evolving rapidly and continuously. While the Popular 
Revolutionary Anti-Communist Army of Colombia (ERPAC), which operates in the Los 
Llanos region, has a structure similar to that of the former United Self-Defense Forces of 
Colombia (AUC), other groups have adopted a cellular operational structure, co-opting and 
contracting criminal organizations to carry out their activities. OHCHR-Colombia is 
increasingly receiving information about some groups, such as ERPAC or the <i>Rastrojos, 
</i>which, in some regions of the country, would exhibit the operational and organizational 
capacity typical of armed actors, as defined by international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>64. The scope of organized violence committed by these groups, their substantial 
economic power, capacity to corrupt authorities and State institutions, links with local 
authorities and local networks of influence, their impact on social actors and the alarming 
levels of violence against civilians make them a daunting challenge to the rule of law. 
</p>
<p>65. Government efforts against these groups have achieved positive results, but the 
challenge posed by these groups goes well beyond common criminality. The fact that these 
groups operate in regions where former paramilitary groups once operated, using their 
economic and political structures, reiterates the need to both redouble preventive 
mechanisms for the population at risk (especially youth in urban and rural areas) and 
protect and attend those affected. 
</p>
<p><b> J. International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p>66. In recent years, the internal armed conflict has moved towards the periphery and 
border regions of the country, forcing guerrilla groups to retreat and operate in small 
groups, at times dressed as civilians, using small arms and anti-personnel mines in a 
widespread manner. In these areas of retreat, FARC-EP and ELN have had a long-term 
presence and have been able to obtain resources from illicit crops, smuggling and extensive 
extortion.  </p>


<p><b>14</b> GE.10-11819 
</p>
<p>67. In 2009, a large number of civilian killings were attributed to FARC-EP and ELN.17 
Among other breaches of international humanitarian law attributed to guerrilla groups, 
there were at least 27 massacres,18 indiscriminate attacks, acts of terrorism, forced 
displacement, torture, sexual violence against women and girls, hostage takings and attacks 
on medical missions and on infrastructure. Their victims included elected local public 
officials, community leaders, teachers, women, children and adolescents. FARC-EP, in 
particular, has resorted to collective threats in a systematic manner, obstruction of the 
freedom of movement of persons and goods, and, in general, enforcement of strong social 
control in areas of their influence, limiting overall freedom. 
</p>
<p>68. In 2009, the number of killings of indigenous people increased by 63 per cent 
compared to 2008. Indigenous leaders and representatives were frequently victims of 
accusations and threats. Some of the most affected communities are located in Antioquia, 
Caldas, Cauca, Nari&#241;o and Putumayo. The two massacres perpetrated against members of 
the Aw&#225; people in February and August, where 23 persons died including 8 children, are 
tragic examples of the vulnerability of indigenous peoples. 
</p>
<p>69. In a difficult social context of poverty and lack of opportunities, FARC-EP and ELN 
continue to recruit children.19 OHCHR-Colombia continues to call on the guerrilla groups 
to immediately stop recruiting children and release those already recruited. To prevent this 
practice, the Inter-institutional Committee for the Prevention of Recruitment has provided 
technical support to authorities and communities in over 100 municipalities and, as a result 
of significant efforts by mayors and municipal ombudsmen, at least 61 municipalities now 
have a policy to prevent recruitment. 
</p>
<p>70. The planting of anti-personnel mines has generated numerous victims and has led to 
the isolation of a large number of Afro-Colombian and indigenous communities. According 
to the Presidential Programme for Comprehensive Action against Anti-Personnel Mines, in 
2009, 67 members of the military and 44 civilians died and 373 military personnel and 148 
civilians were injured; of the civilians, 11 were women and 49 were minors. In December 
2009, the Government hosted the Second Review Conference of the Ottawa Convention in 
Cartagena. 
</p>
<p>71. Guerrilla groups also continued kidnapping. In December 2009, the Governor of the 
department of Caquet&#225; was taken hostage and later murdered by FARC-EP, which 
continues to keep civilians and members of security forces as hostages under cruel and 
inhuman conditions, some of whom have been held hostage for over 10 years. Reiterating 
the call for the release of all without distinction, immediately and unconditionally, 
OHCHR-Colombia calls on all parties involved to prioritize the interests of those being 
held in captivity. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Security forces 
</b></p>
<p>72. To a lesser degree, security forces, and particularly the army, have also been 
responsible for breaches of international humanitarian law. There are reports of killings, 
indiscriminate attacks, forced displacement, looting, torture and cruel, inhuman and 
degrading treatment, threats and arbitrary restrictions to freedom of movement of persons 
and goods. Occasionally, restrictions on the circulation of food could have affected the 
levels of malnutrition, in particular of children.

<p> 
</p>
<p>17
 The Presidential Programme for Human Rights recorded 142 killings in Arauca in the first semester

</b></p>
<p>73. Members of security forces continued to intermittently occupy schools, homes or 
other civilian premises, and set up military posts nearby. To the extent that these are 
deliberate actions, it is necessary to thoroughly review the reasons why the training 
received in international humanitarian law is being ignored, and why soldiers on the ground 
do not comply with directives issued by the Ministry and the army command. 
</p>
<p>74. In some areas, the progressive militarization of civilian life and the involvement of 
civilians, including children, in intelligence work or military actions are putting civilians at 
risk of being threatened and attacked by guerrilla groups. It is thus imperative that the 
governmental coordination mentioned in Presidential Directive No. 01 of March 2009 on 
territorial consolidation, which includes civilian and military actors, fully respects the 
precautionary approach and the &#8220;do no harm&#8221; principle, securing the humanitarian space 
necessary to assist civilians. 
</p>
<p>75. OHCHR-Colombia welcomes Constitutional Court Sentence C-728 of October 
2009, which urged Congress to adopt a law on conscientious objection to military service. 
</p>
<p><b> K. Forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p>76. Forced displacement continued to increase in 2009, although at a lower rate than in 
past years, with a continuous under-registration of cases. Forced displacement occurred 
throughout the country, with higher frequency in areas of hostilities. In 2009, the impact of 
forced displacement by illegal armed groups in the departments of Antioquia, C&#243;rdoba, 
Choc&#243; and Nari&#241;o were particularly worrisome. 
</p>
<p>77. In early 2009, the Constitutional Court issued Order 008 of 2009 to follow up on 
Sentence T-025 of 2004 evaluating how the Government addressed forced displacement 
and assisted internally displaced persons. The Order underscored the persistence of the 
&#8220;unconstitutional state of affairs&#8221; assessment and noted the absence of effective public 
policies to prevent displacement. OHCHR-Colombia encourages the processes that have 
been initiated in response to Sentence T-025, which should include the Procurator General, 
the Ombudsman and civil society organizations. 
</p>
<p>78. The Early Warning System continued to be underutilized. Although the number of 
risk reports issued in 2009 was similar to that in 2008, fewer actions were taken in 2009. 
There continued to be mass displacements in regions where early warnings and/or risk 
reports were ignored, or imperfectly implemented by the Inter-institutional Committee for 
Early Alert. The financial commitment made by the Government in 2009 to cover the 
budget of the system with national resources is welcomed. 
</p>
<p>79. Land grabbing by illegal armed groups is a decisive element in many displacement 
situations. Displaced populations may have lost between 1.2 million to 10 million hectares 
of land as a direct result of displacement.20 Most of these lands remain in the hands of 
perpetrators and their proxies. The numerous threats against, and murders of, leaders or 
participants in processes for the restitution of land that have been registered are a matter of 
great concern.

</p>
<p><b> L. Victims&#8217; rights and Law 975 (2005) 
</b>80. The importance of the Colombian process of transitional justice has been 
internationally recognized, as recent references in the Secretary-General and the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s report on human rights and transitional justice demonstrate.21 Based on the 
analysis of past years, OHCHR-Colombia suggests that judicial and non-judicial 
mechanisms be tried in parallel to uphold the rights of victims in a timely and 
comprehensive manner. 
</p>
<p>81. Despite efforts made by the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, progress in the realization of 
victims&#8217; rights under Law 975 (2005) has been modest. By December 2009, there had been 
no convictions under this Law;22 the possibilities for victims to know the truth about what 
happened to them and their loved ones have been mostly restricted to the voluntary 
depositions,23 and no reparations have been provided under these proceedings. This 
situation has caused, among the victims who participate in the process, increasing 
scepticism, re-victimization and fractures in their efforts to become organized. 
</p>
<p>82. However, the need for such a legal instrument to enable individual criminal 
prosecution remains undiminished. Currently, the right to justice under Law 975 (2005), as 
previously noted by OHCHR-Colombia, is limited by the excessive leniency in the process 
of individualization of punishment. Moreover, the introduction of certain procedural 
changes in the Law should be considered, such as the need to distinguish between crimes 
&#8220;not subject to pardon&#8221;24 and less serious and punishable offences; the possibility of 
collective indictments; or that the Attorney General&#8217;s Office not be required to prove the 
veracity of all the crimes mentioned during the voluntary depositions, as currently required 
by the Law, but rather only those &#8220;not subject to pardon&#8221;.25 
83. The right to truth under the Law has achieved some positive results, thanks to the 
efforts of the Attorney General&#8217;s Office. There have been important advances in seeking 
truth, such as in the cases of &#8220;<i>parapolitica</i>&#8221;, the more than 6,000 evidences obtained that 
served to reopen unresolved criminal investigations, and the above-mentioned efforts in the 
search for disappeared persons. However, the right to truth warrants the implementation of 
non-judicial mechanisms as well. In this regard, OHCHR-Colombia notes the proposal of 
the Supreme Court to begin exploring the possibility of a truth commission.26 
</p>
<p>84. Regarding the right to reparations, Decree 1290 (2008) on the administrative 
reparations programme does not seem to have yet attained the necessary distribution of 
financial resources. By December 2009, of the over 275,000 requests received, resources 
had been approved for 10,593 persons. Other efforts, such as the Regional Commissions for 
Restitution of Property of the National Commission on Reparations and Reconciliation

depositions were under way. 
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>23
 As a result of the extradition of the most important paramilitary commanders to the United States of 
</p>
<p>America in 2008, due to the absence of legal cooperation mechanisms with that country, even this 
was further restricted.

<p>24
 It might be necessary to consider a reform of the list of crimes not subject to pardon, in order to 
</p>
<p>incorporate those mentioned in articles 6 to 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. 
 
</p>
<p>25
 Other aspects are, for example, partial indictments, which were questioned by the Supreme Court, 
</p>
<p>even if they appeared to be an option originally accepted by the Court (Sentence 32022, 21 September 
2009). In December 2009, however, the Court reiterated the viability of partial indictments (Sentence 
32575, 14 December 2009).

<p>remain isolated and limited. The Trust Fund for victims provided for in Law 975 (2005) 
(which is meant to receive cash and properties from perpetrators admitted in the procedures 
provided by the Law), has not received expected resources.27 In this respect, proceedings 
for the confiscation of property rights (<i>extinci&#243;n de dominio</i>) should be expedited and 
property in the hands of paramilitary proxies should be reverted to legitimate owners. 
</p>
<p>85. A key opportunity was lost when Congress failed to adopt a victims&#8217; law in June 
</p><p>2009. Such a law that is consistent with international standards remains a desirable addition 
to the transitional justice framework for Colombia. It could fill the gaps in the judicial and 
administrative reparation processes, incorporate mechanisms for restitution of goods and 
property, including lands transferred to third parties or proxies, and provide for reparations 
for violations of social, economic, and cultural rights, with differentiated attention 
according to age, ethnicity and gender. 
</p>
<p><b> M. Poverty and economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p>86. Poverty and extreme poverty, inequality and the internal armed conflict continue to 
restrict enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. It remains an imperative for the 
Government to fight poverty and to reduce the significant gaps between the rich and the 
poor. Poverty reduction strategies and policies must seek a fair distribution of the benefits 
of social development for all. 
</p>
<p>87. The Mission to Link Employment, Poverty and Inequality Surveys (MESEP) 
revealed that overall poverty levels have reached 46 per cent of the population and are even 
higher in rural areas (65.2 per cent). Extreme poverty has reached a national average of 
17.8 per cent, but it is almost double in rural areas (32.6 per cent).28 Disparities are also 
found in other social indicators, such as illiteracy rates.29 Enjoyment of the right to health is 
also more restricted in rural areas, because of, inter alia, physical obstacles to access to 
services, lack of infrastructure and information, and the impact of the internal armed 
conflict. Profound socio-economic disparities can be detected between departments.30 The 
data on the Millennium Development Goals, disaggregated by region, show that while 
some departments have achieved their proposed objectives, others are lagging far behind. 
</p><p>88. In the framework of the Millennium Development Goals, some areas require 
particular attention by decision-makers. Gender equality, environmental sustainability and 
housing are among the areas that have received fewer resources in departmental 
development plans.31 
</p>
<p>89. There are an estimated 4.3 million undernourished persons in Colombia, equivalent 
to 10 per cent of the total population.32 As a result of the internal armed conflict, activities 
to obtain traditional sources of food, such as fishing and hunting, have been interrupted or

disabilities are subject to various human rights violations, especially in the context of the 
internal armed conflict, and in particular with regard to education, health and work.34 The 
ratification by Colombia of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 
July 2009 is an opportunity to move forward in ensuring differential attention and 
protection of the rights of these persons. The Government is urged to also ratify the 
Optional Protocol to the Convention. 
</p>
<p>91. Attacks against the LGBT community have been on the rise in cities such as Bogot&#225;, 
Cali, Medell&#237;n and C&#250;cuta. The Constitutional Court, through sentence C-029 of 2009, 
underlined the lack of protection for same-sex couples. 
</p>
<p>92. The Government&#8217;s decision to support the United Nations Declaration on the Rights 
of Indigenous Peoples, its spirit and guiding principles is welcomed. However, there are 
still major challenges with respect to ethnic minorities, including the adoption of a law to 
punish racial discrimination, reaffirming commitments made in the Durban Review 
Conference of April 2009, and the creation of a statistical system with disaggregated data 
on indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombians. 
</p>
<p>93. Available data appears to indicate that indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian 
communities are marginalized and subject to de facto racial discrimination. The five 
departments with the highest percentage of population living below the poverty line or in 
conditions of extreme poverty (Bol&#237;var, Cauca, Choc&#243;, C&#243;rdoba and Nari&#241;o) coincide with 
those where there is a high concentration of Afro-Colombian and indigenous populations.35 
</p>
<p>94. Several indigenous communities face malnutrition. Cases of death related to child 
malnutrition were reported in Cauca, Choc&#243;, Nari&#241;o and Risaralda. 
</p>
<p>95. Government efforts to overcome ethnic inequalities have led to the formulation of 
specific policies for these communities.36 However, some of these efforts did not involve 
sufficient consultation and lacked an ethnically differential approach. Policies need to be 
translated into tangible improvements in the living conditions of these groups as soon as 
possible. 
</p>
<p>96. Several indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities have reported the lack of free, 
prior and informed consultation with regard to the &#8220;mega-projects&#8221; for exploration and 
exploitation of natural resources in their territories in Antioquia, Caldas, Cauca and Choc&#243;.

<p>spaces have been killed. In 2009, the Constitutional Court declared the Rural Development 
Statute invalid, because of the absence of consultation.37 The Government initiative to 
prepare a draft law to regulate the right to consultation is welcomed. This process must 
involve consultations with the indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities and guarantee 
their active participation. 
</p>
<p>97. In Order 004 of 2009, the Constitutional Court ruled that the internal armed conflict 
could cause the cultural or physical extermination of many indigenous peoples and ordered 
the formulation and implementation of plans for ethnic preservation of 34 peoples. To date, 
and despite efforts undertaken by the Government and indigenous organizations, these 
plans are still in a preliminary stage and require a significant boost to ensure rapid 
protection. Moreover, in Order 005 of 2009, the Court declared that the fundamental rights 
of Afro-Colombian communities were being systematically and continuously ignored. 
</p>
<p>98. Unlike in 2008, demonstrations promoted by indigenous organizations (<i>Minga</i>) in 
2009 were conducted in an overall peaceful manner, due to the constructive cooperation 
between indigenous organizations, governmental authorities and security forces. 
Investigations into the violence produced during the 2008 <i>Minga</i>, however, should be 
advanced in order to identify and punish those responsible for acts of violence and 
excessive use of force. 
</p>
<p>99. Recognizing Government initiatives to promote rights to health, education and 
territory of indigenous peoples, during his visit in July, the Special Rapporteur on the 
situation of human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people stressed that all 
measures should be strengthened and their effective implementation ensured in consultation 
with the indigenous peoples affected. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Summary of activities of OHCHR-Colombia 
</b>100. OHCHR-Colombia continues to fulfil its mandate to observe and promote human 
rights, as well as to advise and provide technical cooperation. As of 30 December 2009, 
1,387 complaints had been received and OHCHR-Colombia had followed up on 1,279. A 
total of 264 observation missions were undertaken, which represented a total of 788 days in 
the field. Such missions, frequently undertaken in areas with weak or non-existent State 
presence, made it possible to monitor regional and municipal situations, support local 
processes, and provide advice to authorities and civil society organizations. In 2009, the 
President requested OHCHR-Colombia to support and monitor the investigations into the 
August massacre against Aw&#225; peoples. In response, OHCHR-Colombia travelled to the 
crime scene, supported victims and the prosecutor in charge of investigations and shared its 
observations and recommendations with national authorities. 
</p>
<p>101. OHCHR-Colombia supported the review of the country by treaty bodies as well as 
the mechanism to follow up on the recommendations of the universal periodic review. It 
further cooperated with the Government to organize a database for tracking international 
recommendations and requests for action, including those of OHCHR-Colombia and 
special procedures mandate holders. It also organized seminars on indigenous justice, the 
rights of persons with disabilities, and human rights and private business with emphasis on 
the role of the Global Compact. It provided the Attorney General&#8217;s Office with expert 
support in investigations of sexual violence. It undertook or participated in a total of 3,047 
meetings: 1,542 with public institutions, 981 with civil society, 263 with United Nations 
organizations and 261 with the international community.

<p>102. In November, OHCHR-Colombia and the Government exchanged letters on the 
cooperation to be provided for the 2010/2011 biennium and made a commitment to monitor 
measures adopted by the Ministry of Defense to overcome extrajudicial executions. 
</p><p>103. OHCHR-Colombia provided logistical support for the visits of four special 
rapporteurs and the Deputy High Commissioner, and expresses its thanks for the full 
cooperation received from the Colombian State and civil society organizations in this 
endeavour. 
</p>
<p>104. During 2009, OHCHR-Colombia printed and distributed 103,179 copies of various 
publications, of which 18 were new and 10 reprinted; 1,008 press notes appeared in mass 
media about OHCHR-Colombia; 31 press releases were issued; and, for the first time, a 24-
hour Internet concert was organized to celebrate International Human Rights Day. 
OHCHR-Colombia has opened Facebook and Twitter accounts, where news, issues and 
human rights promotion tools are publicly discussed and disseminated. 
</p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>The High Commissioner reiterates her previous recommendations and again 
urges the Government, illegal armed groups, and civil society at large to give priority 
to full respect for human rights and international humanitarian law. Further, the 
High Commissioner, with a view to contributing to achieve lasting peace through 
dialogue and negotiations:</b> 
</p>
<p><b> (a) Reiterates the call on all parties to the conflict to fully accept and abide 
by international humanitarian law, respecting the life, integrity, property and

immediately and unconditionally, immediately stop child recruitment and release all 
children recruited; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (b) Urges the Government to implement the 15 measures established by the 
Ministry of Defense in an effective manner, and to protect victims, witnesses and 
judicial officials involved in the prosecution of extrajudicial executions, and requests 
strict adherence to the limitations of military jurisdiction; 
 (c) Also urges the Government to guarantee the protection of the civilian 
population from the organized violence perpetuated by illegal armed groups that 
emerged after the demobilization of paramilitary organizations, by implementing 
appropriate strategies to combat them; and recommends increased efforts to prevent, 
investigate, prosecute and punish, firmly and without ambiguity, any links, tolerance 
or acquiescence by security forces towards these groups; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (d) Encourages the Attorney General to create a system of reliable 
information collection on the occurrence of acts of sexual violence and gender-based 
crimes and calls on the Ministry of Defense to undertake a &#8220;zero tolerance&#8221; policy for 
these violations, including the separation from service of those responsible;

<p><b> (e) Encourages the relevant authorities to strengthen the work of the Early 
Warning System to effectively respond to the alerts issued and to provide adequate 
protection to its members; 
</b></p>
<p><b> (f) Invites the Government to form an inter-institutional working group to 
consider, in a concerted, transparent and participatory manner, thorough structural 
and procedural reforms to Law 975 (2005), as well as the establishment of non-judicial

</p>
<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Illustrative cases of violations of human rights and breaches 
of international humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p> As a complement to the High Commissioner&#8217;s report on the situation of human 
rights in Colombia, and by way of illustration, a number of cases of human rights violations 
and breaches of international humanitarian law that have come to the attention of the office 
in Colombia of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (&#8220;OHCHR-Colombia&#8221;) during 
the reporting period are described below. 
</p>
<p><b>  Situation of the judiciary 
</b> The following cases illustrate the tension and public disputes between the executive 
and judicial branches during 2009, as well as the security difficulties sustained by certain 
magistrates of High Courts:  
</p>
<p> (a) In a press release issued on 25 November, the Government stated that the 
President of the Supreme Court had &#8220;not told the truth&#8221; when he denied that he had 
informed the President of the Republic that the difficulties identified by the Court to elect 
the Attorney General had been overcome after the withdrawal of one of the three 
candidates; 
</p>
<p> (b) A Supreme Court magistrate, former President of the Court, was subject to 
illegal surveillance attributed to the Department of National Security (DAS). In May 2009, 
the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights granted precautionary measures in 
favour of the magistrate. 
</p>
<p><b>  Intelligence services 
</b></p>
<p> Information was made public in 2009 that DAS (the national civil intelligence 
agency reporting directly to the President) had conducted widespread and systematic illegal 
intelligence operations going back at least as far as 2003. These operations targeted, inter 
alia, human rights defenders, political opposition leaders, journalists and State officials. The 
cases below illustrate how the operations affected the human rights situation:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) On 11 and 13 February, in Santa Fe de Antioquia and Marinilla (Antioquia), 
several people in plain clothes, without requesting authorization, videotaped prosecutors of 
the Human Rights National Unit while they were performing official activities relating to 
cases of extrajudicial executions attributed to the army. When these people were asked who 
they were by the prosecutors, they identified themselves as members of military 
intelligence units; 
</p>
<p> (b) On 27 May, in a rural area of Yopal (Casanare), while prosecutors were 
performing official activities relating to an alleged extrajudicial execution in which 
members of the Army Unified Action Groups for Personal Freedom (Spanish acronym, 
GAULA) were involved, a vehicle with polarized windows, parked in front of the GAULA 
premises and driven by armed men in plain clothes, was seen on a number of occasions 
following those prosecutors and staff members of OHCHR-Colombia who were supporting 
them; </p>


<p>GE.10-11819 <b>23 
</b></p>
<p> (c) In 2009, OHCHR-Colombia learned that, in 2004 and 2005, the DAS 
Intelligence Special Team G-3 ordered operations similar to the following, with the 
intention to instil fear in victims and force them to cease their activities. In 2005, a female 
lawyer, who is a human rights defender, received at home a package reading &#8220;For my 
beloved daughter&#8221; with a puppet and a note: &#8220;You have a beautiful family, take care of it 
and do not sacrifice it&#8221;. The puppet had the head and the arms separated from the body, a 
broken leg and torn clothes. The puppet also had the pelvic area painted in red, like blood, 
and a cross on the chest, with cigarette burns on one of the arms, the back and the eyes;  
</p>
<p> (d) A journalist, who is a human rights defender, has been the subject of threats 
since she started investigating the murder of prominent journalist Jaime Garz&#243;n in 1999. As 
a result, she and her young daughter had to leave the country in 2004. In 2009, OHCHR-
Colombia learned that at least one of the threats was ordered and executed by DAS. 
</p>
<p><b>  Human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists 
</b> The following are illustrative cases of killings, threats, arbitrary detentions, sexual 
offences, break-ins into homes and offices and information theft directed against human 
rights defenders, which have been attributed to members of illegal armed groups that 
emerged after the paramilitary demobilization and guerrilla groups, in particular the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People&#8217;s Army (FARC-EP), as well as, in some 
cases, members of security forces:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) In May, in Arauca, the Attorney General&#8217;s Office released a prominent 
human rights defender, who had been in detention for more than six months on rebellion 
charges. No evidence was found against him; 
</p>
<p> (b) In Antioquia and Santander, five peasant leaders were released as evidence 
was not enough to proceed against them. They were detained for periods between 5 and 16 
months;  
</p>
<p> (c) A human rights defender, who was detained in Sucre more than a year ago, is 
still in detention. He was accused of criminal association with paramilitary groups, 
although he himself had denounced these groups. The prosecutor who ordered the detention 
is under investigation for corruption;  
</p>
<p> (d) Between February and March, pamphlets proffering threats against sectors of 
the population appeared in at least 24 of the 32 departments in the country. These 
pamphlets, designed in a standard format, were distributed in just two weeks in places as 
distant as Armenia, Barranquilla, Bogot&#225;, Choc&#243;, C&#250;cuta, Medell&#237;n and Valle del Cauca. 
The document promoted the so-called &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; of, among others, sex workers, 
homosexuals, drug addicts and persons with HIV. The pamphlets warned that &#8220;[whoever] is 
found [&#8230;] after 10 p.m. [in the streets], we are not responsible&#8221;, ordered people to &#8220;spend 
more time with their family&#8221; and demanded &#8220;forgiveness from society if innocents are 
killed&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (e) At the beginning of May, threatening pamphlets were distributed in Cesar, La 
Guajira and Magdalena. The pamphlets referred to &#8220;a gang of lawyers, public officials from 
Social Action, the Ombudsman&#8217;s Office, municipal ombudsmen and leaders of displaced 
persons&#8221; as criminals, because they defended the rights of internally displaced persons. The 
pamphlets threatened to &#8220;eradicate them&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (f) On 17 and 24 February, unidentified individuals forced their way into the 
offices of two organizations undertaking social work in Commune 13 and north-eastern 
Medell&#237;n and stole only the hard drives of the computers containing information on their 
work; </p>


<p><b>24</b> GE.10-11819 
</p>
<p> (g) On 11 August, two computers were stolen from the premises of the 
Ombudsman&#8217;s Office in C&#243;rdoba (Monter&#237;a), located in the offices of the Regional 
Ombudsman and the Community Ombudsman of Alto Sin&#250;;  
</p>
<p> (h) On 24 April, in Pat&#237;a (Cauca), a journalist from <i>Radio Super Popay&#225;n</i>, 
recognized for his work in denouncing abuses, was killed by an unidentified individual who 
broke into his home and shot him dead; 
</p>
<p> (i) On 20 May, in Currillo (Caquet&#225;), the director of a local television station, 
recognized for his work in denouncing abuses, was shot dead by unidentified individuals 
who violently broke into his home; 
</p>
<p> (j) Between 15 and 18 June, two men and one woman, members of the National 
Movement of Victims of State Crimes (MOVICE) in Sucre, received death threats via e-
mail, text messages and telephone calls. A few days before, on 12 June, these persons had 
actively participated in the Regional Round Table on Guarantees for human rights 
defenders in Sincelejo (Sucre). 
</p>
<p><b>  Extrajudicial executions 
</b> The following cases show that total and sustained elimination of extrajudicial 
executions, of which complaints have drastically decreased during the reporting period, 
requires continued efforts, including ensuring that those found responsible are properly 
punished in an environment of security for all parties involved:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) In Salento (Quind&#237;o), two men and one 18-year-old woman were killed on 16 
January during a joint operation between the Army High Mountain Battalion No. 5 and 
DAS. The victims were reported by the army as members of FARC-EP killed in combat; 
</p>
<p> (b) In Tumaco (Nari&#241;o), on 23 May, the army allegedly killed a person whom 
they had previously detained. The Military Criminal Judge of Ipiales (Nari&#241;o) was in 
charge of the investigation for several months;  
</p>
<p> (c) In Yond&#243; (Antioquia), on 17 October, soldiers from the Army Energy and 
Highways Battalion No. 7 were allegedly responsible for the death of two teenagers, 15 and 
16 years of age. The victims were reported to be travelling on a motorcycle when they were 
shot several times without any prior warning or order to stop; 
</p>
<p> (d) In Zaragoza (Antioquia), on 15 May, a retired army sub-officer who had 
denounced an extrajudicial execution was killed by unknown individuals;  
 (e) In Bogot&#225;, on 4 February, the brother of a victim of extrajudicial execution 
was murdered after instigating the investigation of his disappeared brother in Soacha. His 
brother had been reported as killed in combat by the army in Norte de Santander, shortly 
after his disappearance; 
</p>
<p> (f) In Cali (Valle del Cauca), on 10 May, a murder attempt against the brother of 
a victim of an extrajudicial execution was reported. The attempt was reported five days 
after the beginning of the judicial hearing against the individuals allegedly responsible for 
the execution;  
</p>
<p> (g) In Pitalito (Huila), on 8 March, a police patrol unit with two agents arrived at 
&#8220;Los Pinos&#8221; neighbourhood and stopped a man. One of the agents, who stated that he 
thought that the victim was a criminal, getting out of his vehicle, shot him in the chest. 
Several neighbours witnessed the scene and claimed that the police agents did not allow 
them to immediately assist the victim. He died in a hospital two days later; </p>


<p>GE.10-11819 <b>25 
</b></p>
<p> (h) On 2 June, the Third Penal Court of Monter&#237;a (C&#243;rdoba) sentenced a major, a 
captain and four soldiers of Army GAULA of Monteria to 28 years of imprisonment for the 
extrajudicial execution of two youths. Their defence included false accusations against the 
female prosecutor in charge of the case of bribing a witness to testify against the members 
of the army. 
</p>
<p><b>  Sexual violence  
</b></p>
<p> The cases below exemplify how girls and women are exposed to the sexual violence 
generated by all parties to the conflict, as well as by illegal armed groups which emerged 
after the demobilization of paramilitary organizations: 
</p>
<p> (a) In August, OHCHR-Colombia received information that criminal gangs, 
&#8220;<i>combos</i>&#8221; (small criminal groups of youth) and unidentified illegal armed groups were 
recruiting and using children from Communes 5, 6 and 7 of Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), for 
prostitution and sexual slavery activities, drug dealing and collection of extortions 
payments. It was reported that members of the National Police had a permissive attitude 
vis-&#224;-vis these activities; 
</p>
<p> (b) On 16 August, in Puerto Caicedo (Putumayo), a 15-year-old girl was raped, 
and received death threats if she denounced the abuse. The abuse was allegedly committed 
by a demobilized paramilitary member, who is currently a member of the illegal armed 
group &#8220;Los Rastrojos&#8221;; 
 (c) In Puerto As&#237;s (Putumayo), it was reported that in May members of the 
illegal armed group &#8220;Los Rastrojos&#8221; offered money to girls at their schools to convince 
them to engage in prostitution activities; 
</p>
<p> (d) In March, in Riosucio (Choc&#243;), it was reported that the commander of the 
police station was allegedly responsible for the sexual abuse of two girls, aged 8 and 10; 
</p>
<p> (e) On 14 June, in the Tercer Milenio park of Bogot&#225;, a junior police officer 
allegedly raped a displaced girl while other junior officers videotaped the rape; 
 (f) On 11 August, a 5-year-old Nukak girl from the El Refugio indigenous 
territory in San Jos&#233; del Guaviare (Guaviare) was sexually assaulted, allegedly by a soldier 
from the Joaqu&#237;n Par&#237;s Army Battalion. Four other girls from the same indigenous 
communities, aged between 13 and 17, were said to have suffered similar assaults and to 
have been subjected to sexual exploitation by soldiers from the same army battalion; 
 (g) In March, in Yond&#243; (Antioquia), two 15-year-old girls were allegedly raped 
by a soldier from the Calib&#237;o Army Battalion. The solider was also accused of having 
detained the two girls for several hours and injured them;  
 (h) In March, in the rural area of Casabianca (Tolima), a woman was raped and 
subjected to other acts of sexual violence, reportedly by members of FARC-EP. In addition, 
the woman and her children received threats warning they would be killed if the case was 
reported; 
</p>
<p> (i) In accordance with the statement of a girl who had been recruited by FARC-
EP, it was reported that the 18th Front of FARC-EP forced pregnant young girl members of 
the group to abort; 
</p>
<p> (j) In Cauca, through information reported by the health centre in 2009, it was 
charged that a girl recruited by FARC-EP was forced to use contraceptive measures. </p>

<p><b>  Torture, other inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment 
</b></p>
<p> The existing data does not seem to reflect either the magnitude or the real impact of 
the violation. The cases below are a few examples of the seriousness of the situation: 
</p>
<p> (a) On 26 January, more than 260 inmates from the Bellavista prison (Medell&#237;n) 
were ordered out of their cells by members of the National Police and the Penitentiary 
Guards. Around 150 inmates were separated from the group and sent to two different 
locations within the prison, where they were allegedly held in overcrowded conditions with 
no access to water, food, toilets and toilette facilities; 
</p>
<p> (b) On 9 February, it was reported that two handcuffed youths were doused with 
gasoline and burned alive in a police station in Bogot&#225;;  
</p>
<p> (c) In Plato (Magdalena), it was reported that, on 21 June, two detained youths 
were beaten and threatened to death in the police station; 
</p>
<p> (d) On 26 August, in Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), two youths who had been arrested by 
members of the National Police suffered physical and verbal assaults, cigarette burns, and 
injuries produced with a steel can, and were doused with aerosol spray on their faces and 
bodies; 
</p>
<p> (e) In Mesetas (Meta), on 15 November, a youth was illegally detained and 
allegedly tortured by three National Police officers, who suffocated him by covering his 
head with a plastic bag. 
</p>
<p><b>  Enforced disappearance 
</b></p>
<p> Enforced disappearance continues to be a major concern of OHCHR-Colombia. 
Most of the situations remain unsolved, and their perpetrators and motives unidentified. 
Below are illustrative cases of this violation:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) On 15 February, a woman, member of the trade union SINTRAGRIM, 
disappeared in Miravalles, El Castillo (Meta), after having denounced that civilians had 
been ill-treated by members of the Army Battalion 21 Vargas; 
</p>
<p> (b) On 26 March, in Medell&#237;n (Antioquia), a man disappeared after having been 
arrested by National Police officers allegedly for not carrying ownership documents of the 
motorcycle he was riding. There is no record of him having been transferred to the police 
station and he was allegedly handed over to a criminal gang;

<p><b>  Illegal armed groups that have emerged after the demobilization of 
paramilitary organizations 
</b></p>
<p> OHCHR-Colombia notes with great concern the expansion, increasing activities and 
violence against civilians perpetrated by illegal armed groups that emerged after 
demobilization of paramilitary organizations, as illustrated below:<b> 
</b></p>
<p> (a) On 1 March, five members of the same family, including a man with a 
disability, a woman and two children aged 2 and 8, were killed in Pat&#237;a (Cauca), 
presumably by members of the illegal armed group &#8220;Los Rastrojos&#8221;; </p>

</b></p>
<p> (b) The killing of two fishermen and the enforced disappearance of another five

illegal armed group &#8220;Los Rastrojos&#8221;;  
 (c) Between 2 and 3 November, eight Afro-Colombians, members of the same 
family, were killed in Barbacoas (Nari&#241;o) by individuals who presented themselves as 
members of the illegal armed group &#8220;&#193;guilas Negras&#8221;; 
 (d) In the Bajo Cauca region (Antioquia), during the first semester of 2009, 
members of the different illegal armed groups in the region were recruiting and using 
children for logistics activities, intelligence work and selective killings (<i>sicariato</i>); 
 (e) In July, officers of the National Police in C&#243;rdoba captured two demobilized 
paramilitary members, who were travelling in a public bus with 16 newly recruited youths. 
The youths were recruited to join the different illegal armed groups conducting activities in 
the south of the department; 
</p>
<p> (f) In Meta, in mid-2009, the illegal armed group Popular Revolutionary Anti-
Communist Army of Colombia (ERPAC) was reported to have been recruiting and using 
youths from marginalized neighbourhoods from various municipalities, primarily with 
promises of short-term employment. The families have not heard from these youths since 
their reported recruitment. 
</p>
<p><b>  International humanitarian law 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Guerrilla groups 
</b></p>
<p> Guerrilla groups continued to disregard and reject international humanitarian law, 
attacking and killing civilians, especially members of indigenous peoples, planting 
antipersonnel mines, recruiting and using children, causing forced displacements and 
kidnapping, among other breaches, as exemplified below: 
</p>
<p> (a) On 4 January, in La Vega (Cauca), members of the National Liberation Army

</p>
<p> (f) In Villavicencio (Meta), on 6 March, members of FARC-EP were allegedly 
responsible for attacks against the aqueduct that provides drinking water to the city, leaving 
its 300,000 inhabitants without water for more than 10 days; 
</p>
<p> (g) Between April and June, over 180 people from different rural communities in

places; 
</p>
<p> (l) On 29 May, members of FARC-EP entered the municipality of Garz&#243;n 
(Huila) and took hostage of an elected municipal official. Two private security guards and 
one policeman were killed during this action; 
</p>
<p> (m) In Quibd&#243; (Choc&#243;), on 7 June, members of FARC-EP launched a grenade 
against a liquor store, supposedly because the owner did not pay an illegal tax imposed by 
the group (<i>vacuna</i>). The attack caused serious injury to six civilians who happened to be 
there;

Antioquia, Cauca, Cesar, Choc&#243;, Nari&#241;o, Putumayo, Tolima and Valle del Cauca. 
</p>
<p><b>  Security forces 
</b></p>
<p> OHCHR-Colombia continued to register complaints about breaches of international 
humanitarian law by members of the security forces, especially against children: 
</p>
<p> (a) In February, in several regions of Cauca, the army temporarily occupied a 
number of schools; 
</p>
<p> (b) In February and March, in several rural areas of Valle del Cauca, it was 
reported that the army offered food to children in exchange for information on the 
whereabouts of illegal armed groups in the region; 
</p>

attending school were injured by army gunshots discharged in response to an attack by a 
FARC-EP sniper who had killed a soldier; 
</p>
<p> (d) In May, troops of the Divisionary Reaction Force (FURED) from the Army 
Third Division established a camp within the school premises of a village in Florida (Valle 
del Cauca); 
 (e) It was reported that in July, the army had restricted free access to food in 
Frontino (Antioquia); 
 (f) In Santa Rosa (Bol&#237;var), on 16 November, a 4-year-old child died as a 
consequence of an armed confrontation between the army and FARC-EP;  
</p>
<p> (g) In La Macarena (Meta), on 24 November, a farmer travelling with his 5-year-
old son was shot dead in the head by a soldier of the Army Mobile Brigade No. 1. The case 
was presented as a &#8220;military error&#8221;. 
</p>
<p><b>  Forced displacement 
</b></p>
<p> Forced displacement continued to increase in 2009, although at a lower rate than in 
past years, with a continuous under-registration of cases, throughout the country, with 
higher frequency in areas of hostilities. As illustrated below, forced displacement as a result 
of the internal armed conflict and caused by illegal armed groups was particularly worrying 
in the departments of Antioquia, C&#243;rdoba, Choc&#243; and Nari&#241;o: 
</p>
<p> (a) Following the February massacre by FARC-EP in Barbacoas (Nari&#241;o), 500 
persons mostly children, were massively displaced; 
</p>
<p> (b) Between June and July, in Ituango (Antioquia), over 1,000 persons were 
displaced as a result of landmines allegedly laid by FARC-EP and threats from this group; 
</p>
<p> (c) On 8 June, a confrontation between the illegal armed groups &#8220;&#193;guilas 
Negras&#8221; and &#8220;Los Rastrojos&#8221; caused the displacement of 513 persons in Tumaco (Nari&#241;o); 
 (d) On 7 July, confrontations between the army and FARC-EP caused the 
displacement of 49 families in the Zen&#250; indigenous territory in C&#243;rdoba; 
</p>
<p> (e) On 23 July, a displaced population leader was murdered in Santa Fe de 
Ralito, Tierralta (C&#243;rdoba) by unknown individuals. The victim had been working since 
2007 on a process to claim over 1,400 hectares of land stolen by former paramilitary 
members; </p>


<p><b>30</b> GE.10-11819 
</p>
<p> (f) In Choc&#243;, on 17 August, 117 people from an Afro-Colombian community 
were displaced due to confrontations between two illegal armed groups for the control of 
the Bajo Baud&#243; River area; 
 (g) Between 5 and 20 September, military operations carried out by the army 
against the illegal armed group &#8220;Los Rastrojos&#8221; caused the displacement of approximately 
50 families in Bol&#237;var (Valle del Cauca); 
 (h) During 2009, in Barranc&#243;n (Guaviare), several displaced groups from various 
indigenous peoples (Jiw/Guayabero, Nukak Mak&#250;) still lacked access to drinking water and 
health care was only provided once a month. In addition, the ability of the school to provide 
education was insufficient to cover all needs. 
</p>
<p><b>  Poverty and economic, social and cultural rights 
</b></p>
<p> As shown below, poverty and extreme poverty, inequality and the internal armed 
conflict continue to restrict enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights: 
 (a) It has been reported that the inhabitants of the rural area of San Jos&#233; del 
Guaviare, near the Guayabero River (Guaviare), were denied health care by municipal 
authorities on the grounds that they were members of guerrilla groups or their collaborators; 
</p>
<p> (b) In some rural areas of Guaviare, several education institutions lack 
infrastructure and proper sanitary conditions, as well as study materials. Several teachers 
abandoned such institutions because of fear for their lives, as a result of the intensity of the 
internal armed conflict in the region. 
</p>
<p><b>  Discrimination 
</b></p>
<p> As shown below, attacks against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) 
community have been on the rise in cities such as Bogot&#225; and Medell&#237;n. Moreover, cases 
have been registered of attacks and massacres against members of indigenous peoples, as 
well as lack of and unsuitable free, prior and informed consultation: 
</p>
<p> (a) Cases of abuse attributed to members of the National Police against the 
LGBT community in various communes of Medell&#237;n (Antioquia) have been reported; 
 (b) In April, in Bogot&#225;, the manager of a bar regularly attended by members of 
the LGBT community was physically and verbally assaulted. He also received death threats 
by unidentified individuals. The victim had previously received a threatening pamphlet 
from the so-called &#8220;Chapinero Social Cleansing Group, for a society free of gays&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (c) Three indigenous communities of Choc&#243; and Antioquia requested the 
suspension of the exploratory works for the &#8220;Careperro&#8221; mine in their territories. In some 
cases, the requests were made on the basis of lack of prior consultation and, in others, on 
the basis of irregularities in the process. Furthermore, the army entered the indigenous 
territories to provide protection to the construction of a heliport on a place considered as 
sacred by the communities; 
</p>
<p> (d) On 2 August, an indigenous leader from the Inga Villa Catalina indigenous 
territory of Puerto Guzm&#225;n (Putumayo) was killed by unknown individuals. The victim had 
been leading a consultation process since 2006 for the exploitation of 18 oil deposits 
located in the indigenous territory. As a result of the killing, and several threats against 
other indigenous leaders of the region, the Permanent Working Table of the Inga 
Indigenous Peoples of Puerto Guzm&#225;n withdrew from the consultation process;  </p>


<p>GE.10-11819 <b>31 
</b></p>
<p> (e) On 26 August, in the indigenous territory of Gran Rosario in Tumaco 
(Nari&#241;o), an unidentified group of armed men broke into a private house and fired their 
guns at close range and without consideration to women or children, against a group of 
people. Twelve Aw&#225; indigenous people, including two girls, five boys and an 8-month-old 
baby were killed during the attack. Another three people, including a girl, were wounded.
