<p>472. In a letter dated 11 April 2008, the Royal Thai Government responded to the allegations 
regarding the seizure of ancestral lands of the Akha indigenous people living in the Hooh Yoh 
villages in Chiangrai Province, Thailand. The Government stated that it categorically denies all 
the allegations contained in the 8 October 2007 letter. It noted that it attaches great importance to 
community rights and participation of local people in the management of natural resources and 
environment. The Government stated that it has consistently pursued effective measures and 
activities to develop the highland areas and upgrade the living conditions of all highlanders, 
including through projects to ensure that highlanders possess sufficient lands and by promoting 
natural resource development and conservation. The Government stated that it has not received 
any complaints whatsoever from the Akha communities.  </p>

473.  The Royal Thai Government stated that it does not recognize the existence of indigenous 
peoples in Thailand. It maintains that the Hill Tribes peoples in Thailand are migrants to the 
country, who by nature and historical background are not indigenous to the country. The 
Government noted that, since there are no indigenous peoples in Thailand, it is under no 
obligation to make clarifications pertaining to indigenous issues, but since the allegations 
presented, according to the Government, defame and tarnish the reputation and noble image of 
the royally-sponsored Project, which has been recognized worldwide as a model for sustainable 
alternative development and community empowerment, the Government considered it necessary 
to respond. 
 
474. With respect to the information concerning the alleged forceful seizure of a total of 
8500 rai (1600 hectares) of the traditional lands of the Hooh Yoh village leading to the alleged 
massive dispossession of land of the Akha community members, as well as the allegation that 
Hooh Yoh Akha villagers were not consulted before the establishment of the project in their 
traditional lands, the Government categorically denied the veracity of all of these allegations. 
The Government stated that the land &#8220;traditionally owned and occupied by the Akha 
communities&#8221; is situated within an area designated as National Reserved Forest. According to 
Thailand&#8217;s National Reserve Forest Act, BE 2501 (1964), no person shall occupy, possess, 
exploit and inhabit the land unless they are granted official permission. On 30 June 1998, the 
Cabinet issued a resolution on land utilization in the national forest reserve that allows local 
people who have long inhabited the reserved area to continue living on the land. The 
Government noted that further encroachment on nearby reserved areas is strictly prohibited. 
 
475. The Government stated that on 14 January 2003, it authorized the royally-sponsored 
Highland Research and Development Institute to use a certain part of the land within the national 
forest reserve to launch the Highland Development Station project. It noted that, at this time, few 
Akha households were located within the project area. Prior to the establishment of the project in 
2003, the Akha people had used the forest lands for farming. In so doing, they were engaged in 
unsustainable practices, such as forest encroachment, crop rotation and slash and burn farming, 
all of which posed a threat to the natural environment. The Government noted that the 
communities&#8217; engagement in opium poppy cultivation has also lead to serious problems related 
to drug trafficking.  
 
476. The Government mentioned that the Highland Research and Development Institute&#8217;s 
Project was initiated for the following reasons: (1) to provide training to local Akha people so 
that they may gain knowledge of various agricultural techniques and apply them in their own 
lands; (2) to increase the living standards of the local Akha people by providing assistance on 
agricultural and vocational training, education healthcare services, basic infrastructure, and 
alternative employment opportunities; (3) to raise local Akha people&#8217;s awareness of 
environmental conservation and to restore and conserve national reserved forests; (4) to tackle 
the problem of drugs; and (5) to strengthen local communities through self-sufficient and 
sustainable development while preserving their cultures and traditional livelihoods. 
 
477. The Government stressed that prior to the establishment of the Project, the Thai 
authorities concerned had consulted widely with the community leaders and villages living </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/9/Add.1/Corr.1 
page 3 
</p>
<p> 
within and outside the Project area, and explained the Project to them, in particular the goal of 
the project to introduce sustainable land use in the reserved area. 
</p><p> 
478. The Government stated that, while there was some misunderstanding about the Project at 
the beginning, after a series of consultations, the Akha communities began to have full 
understanding of the objectives of the Projects and its benefits. On 20 August 2005 an 
&#8220;Agreement on the Allocation and Demarcation of Agricultural Areas&#8221; was signed between the 
Chief of the Highland Development Station, forestry officials, military officers and 55 local 
Akha. The agreement stated that the villages would stop encroaching and using unsustainable 
practices within the demarcated areas. The Highland Research and Development Institute agreed 
that it would not undertake any actions that would have an adverse impact on the interests of the 
village. 
 
479. The Government emphasized that there was no forceful seizure of lands or any massive 
dispossession of the Hooh Yoh villagers by the Project.  Instead, a proper demarcation of 
traditional lands for the purpose of sustainable land use was carried out, with the consolidation of 
scattered individual holdings into an agricultural zone.  
 
480. The Government stated that, at the time the letter was written, the local Akha people were 
still living on their lands and engaging in agricultural work in the zone area. Hooh Yoh villagers 
possess an average of 2 hectares of lands per household, which is consistent with an average plot 
of arable land owned by hill tribes in Thailand. The Government stated that they are also 
learning to appreciate and enjoy the benefits from the Project, which has raised their well being, 
particularly through increased crop productivity and discouraging them from being involved in 
narcotic drugs and promoting environmental conservation. 
 
481. Regarding the allegation that the villagers have not been compensated for their loss, and 
have been offered employment by the project in order to perform agricultural work in the lands 
that they previously possessed, in exchange for salaries for salaries that fail to meet the minimum 
wage, the Government stated, because of the tremendous success of royally sponsored projects 
and the belief of the villagers that these initiatives would benefit them, some villagers willingly 
offered their lands to the Project and were compensated by new plots totally 150 acres. Some 
donated parts of the land which they had previously occupied and became local employees of the 
Project in exchange for salaries at a rate higher than other agricultural workers in the area.  
 
482. With respect to the allegation that the Project led to the loss of the Akha&#8217;s traditional 
livelihoods, and that the implementation of the Project has further involved the destruction of 
standing crops on which Hooh You villagers relied for subsistence economies, the Government 
stated that this information was inaccurate. On the contrary, under the Project, crop yields have 
increased and the quality of life of the Akra has improved. The Government stated that the Akha 
people have been encouraged to participate in various activities under the Project such as 
agricultural, fishery, livestock and forestry so that they could apply these skills to their land use. 
The Project also assisted with the supplying of seedlings, fish for fish farming, and cattle and 
pigs for their farms, so the villagers do not have to rely on standing crops. With their increased 
income, the Akha have started to build new houses and a school and nursery in the Hooh Yoh 
village has been set up.

</p><p> 
483. Regarding the allegation that as a result of the seizure of the traditional lands, many 
young Akha women have been compelled to work as prostitutes to support their families, the 
Government stated that the Akha actually now have more income, and that no women have been 
compelled to work as prostitutes. On the contrary, the Project has implemented activities 
specifically geared towards women, including handicraft marketing. The Government stressed 
that this has helped empower women and helped them to be more self-reliant. 
 
484. With respect to the allegation that the seizure of the land of the Hooh Yoh village was 
reportedly accompanied by widespread harassment of local Akha villagers by members of the 
military and forestry personnel involved in the Highland Development Station project; villagers 
were threatened with arrest if they continued to work their lands; in November 2003, several 
forestry trucks came to Hooh Yoh with armed forestry officials who arrested eight villagers, 
including pregnant women, working in or near their fields; and that the villagers were taken at 
Ampur Mae Fah Luang police station, and were requested to pay a fine of 100,000 baht ($2,500), 
the Government clarified that in May 2003, 8 villagers were charged with encroaching, slashing 
and burning, and exploiting the forest reserve by forestry officials. Following examination of the 
case by the Chiangrai Provincial Court, each villager was found guilty and charged and 
sentenced with 6 months imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 baht ($125), sentence suspended for 2 
years. The Government stated that, first; the forestry officials were acting under their duties and 
not harassing the villagers. Second, the Project gives the right to villagers to work within 
demarcated lands, and the Project is applying an approach of consultation, not threats. Third, not 
forestry trucks or armed officials have ever come to Hooh Yoh village to arrest the villagers. 
Finally, the villagers were not charged a fine of 100,000 baht ($2,500), which would be 
considered an unreasonable fine to charge to poor Akha villagers. 
 
485. Regarding the allegations that in March 2004 two foreign volunteers were reportedly 
arrested by the military and later released without charges, and in April 2004, a foreign advocate 
was jailed for nine days with no formal charges before being deported from the country, the 
Government clarified that two female tourists, one of Australian nationality, and one of Canadian 
nationality, visited Hooh Yoh village, and were caught trying to remove flags marking the 
boundary of the Project. After review, it was determined that there were misunderstandings, and 
that they had no intention of destroying the boundary. The Government stressed that the tourists 
were not threatened in any way, nor were they under a state of arrest. With respect to the second 
case, the Government noted that the foreign advocate in question, an American, was deported 
from Thailand on 24 April 2004 for engaging in a pattern of aggressive and offensive behaviour 
that the Government deemed to pose a danger to public safety and national security pursuant to 
the 1979 Immigration Act. In its letter, the Government detailed the actions of the foreign 
advocate in question that related to her deportation from Thailand and stressed that Akha leaders 
have repeatedly disassociated themselves from the alleged advocate in question. 
 
486. With respect to the question of the Special Rapporteurs regarding the measures that have 
been taken to ensure that the affected communities are consulted and provide their free and 
informed consent to any development projects affecting their traditional lands, the Government 
stated that it is now implementing its 10th National Economic and Social Development Plan, 
which attaches great importance to community rights and participation regarding land initiatives. 
It noted that zoning and land management initiatives must be carried out through agreement with </p>

<p>A/HRC/9/9/Add.1/Corr.1 
page 5 
</p>
<p> 
the local people. It further noted that part 12 of the Thailand&#8217;s 2007 Constitution recognizes the 
rights of traditional local communities to preserve their customs and local community culture.  
 
487. Any project that might affect the quality of life of a community is not permitted, unless 
the affected communities have been consulted. A community has a right to sue a government 
agency, local government organization or other State authority if a project may seriously affect 
the quality of the environment or natural resources of people in a community. 
 
488. The Government clarified that no complaints have been lodged by Akra communities 
with Thai officials, at the local or national level. 
 
489. With respect to question of the Special Rapporteurs regard what measures the relevant 
authorities intend to take to prevent the re-occurrence of similar events as the project expands, 
the Government stated that this question assumes that the Project has been at fault and is 
factually misleading. The Government invited the Special Rapporteurs to comment on measures 
that could be taken to cope with such misinformation so that such allegations will not reoccur in 
the future. 
 
<b>Observations 
 
</b>490. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government of Thailand for the detailed response it 
provided to the 8 October 2007 letter, and he takes this response into consideration and will 
continue to monitor the situation for any possible further action on his part.
