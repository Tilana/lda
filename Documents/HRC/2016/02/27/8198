<p><i>Summary 
</i></p>
<p> The Independent Expert on the effects of foreign debt and other related international 
financial obligations of States on the full enjoyment of all human rights, particularly 
economic, social and cultural rights, visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 25 
July to 5 August 2011. The primary objective of the mission was to assess the impact of the 
country&#8217;s external debt burden on the capacity of the Government to create the necessary 
conditions for the realization of all human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural 
rights, and to progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. He also explored the 
impact of the global economic recession on the country&#8217;s debt burden and the impact of 
commercial creditor ligation on debt relief, human rights and development.  
</p>
<p> The Democratic Republic of the Congo has made important socio-economic 
progress since 2001. In 2010, it reached the completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor 
Countries Initiative, gaining access to debt relief expected to significantly reduce its 
external debt (estimated at $13.1 billion in 2009) and to provide fiscal space for poverty 
reducing expenditure. Despite an increase in poverty reducing spending, access to basic 
services is insufficient and the costs and quality of services remain a concern.

<p>The country also faces a number of critical development challenges, including the key 
post-conflict challenges of reconstruction and rehabilitation of its dilapidated socio-
economic infrastructure, an unstable security situation in parts of the country, lack of 
transparency and accountability in public finance management, widespread corruption and 
ineffective domestic resource mobilization. It also remains at high risk of debt distress. 
Unless these challenges are addressed, they will continue to undermine the country&#8217;s 
development agenda.

<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. In the present report, the Independent Expert presents the findings of his official 
visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, from 25 July to 5 August 2011. The purpose 
of the mission was (a) to assess the impact of the country&#8217;s external debt burden on the 
capacity of the Government to create the necessary conditions for the realization of all 
human rights, especially economic, social and cultural rights, and to progress towards the 
Millennium Development Goals; (b) to explore the impact of the global economic recession 
on the country&#8217;s external debt burden; and (c) to evaluate the impact of commercial creditor 
litigation against the country on debt relief, the realization of human rights and 
development. 
</p>
<p>2. The Independent Expert met with senior Government officials, including the Deputy 
Prime Minister in charge of Social Affairs, the Minister for Justice and Human Rights, the 
Deputy Minister for Finance, the Minister for Health, the Minister for Social Affairs and 
the Governor of Katanga. He also met with representatives of the country&#8217;s bilateral and 
multilateral development partners, including the World Bank, the African Development 
Bank, and countries with representation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Furthermore, he held round-table meetings with civil society organizations in Kinshasa and 
Lubumbashi. The Independent Expert delivered a public lecture at the University of 
Lubumbashi on the negative impact of vulture funds on human rights and development. He 
regrets that, despite several attempts, he was unable to meet members of the National 
Assembly committees responsible for public finance and social affairs or representatives of 
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the country. 
</p>
<p>3. The Independent Expert is grateful to the Government of the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo for its invitation and cooperation. He is also thankful to the United Nations 
Joint Human Rights Office for its support and interest in his visit, and to all those that met 
with him. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Political and economic context 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Overview 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire), a country with vast natural 
resources, has recently emerged from several decades of dictatorship and armed conflict. 
For most of the period since independence from Belgium in 1960, the country was ruled by 
Mobutu Sese Seko, who usurped power in a military coup in 1965. Mobutu&#8217;s rule was 
epitomized by economic mismanagement, pervasive corruption, embezzlement of the 
country&#8217;s resources and repression.  
</p>
<p>5. In May 1997, the Alliance of the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-
Zaire, led by Laurent Desire Kabila, ousted the Mobutu regime. In 1998, war broke out 
again with a rebel movement against Kabila.  
</p>
<p>6. In August 1999, the Security Council authorized the deployment of United Nations 
military liaison personnel to the country. In November, the Council adopted resolution 
1279 (1999), in which it affirmed that the previously authorized United Nations personnel 
would constitute the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>5</b> 
</p>
<p>the Congo (MONUC).1 Subsequently, the Council adopted a number of resolutions to 
strengthen MONUC and its mandate. 
</p>
<p>7. In 2001, Laurent Kabila was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards and was 
succeeded by his son, Joseph. In December 2002, a peace agreement signed in South Africa 
by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Congolese Democratic 
Rally, the Movement for Congolese Liberation and representatives of the unarmed political 
groups called for a transitional Government, to be headed by President Kabila and four 
vice-presidents.  
</p>
<p>8. In July 2006, the country held its first democratic election in four decades. In 
October, President Kabila won the second round of presidential elections.2 
</p>
<p>9. Since 2001, there has been progress in moving the country from political instability 
and armed conflict to relative stability, in most regions of the country. Nevertheless, the 
presence of armed groups in the eastern part of the country remains a key source of 
instability and a significant challenge to the Government&#8217;s development plans. Moreover, 
</p>
<p>socio-economic conditions remain desperate following years of armed conflict, which 
exacted an enormous human cost and the destruction of the country&#8217;s infrastructure. 
Consequently, although endowed with vast natural resources, the country&#8217;s per capita 
</p>
<p>income and human development indicators remain among the lowest in the world.  
</p>
<p><b> B. External debt 
</b></p>
<p>10. As at the end of the 2008, the total public and publicly guaranteed external debt of 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo was estimated at $13.1 billion, equivalent to 93 per 
cent of GDP, 150 per cent of exports and 502 per cent of Government revenues, ratios that 
pointed to a &#8220;high level of debt distress&#8221;.3 Of the $13.1 billion, $7.1 billion was owed to 
bilateral creditors, $4.4 billion to multilateral institutions and $1.5 billion to commercial 
creditors. Arrears were estimated at $3.3 billion, of which $1.5 billion was owed to Paris 
Club creditors. Debt servicing amounted to 25 per cent of total expenditure.  
</p>
<p>11. The total external debt stock was projected to fall to $5.4 billion in 2011 and to rise 
to $6.4 billion and $7.8 billion in 2012 and 2014, respectively.4 In 2008, debt service 
payments were estimated at $891 million, but were projected to fall to $346.6 in 2011 
before rising to $430.4 million in 2012.  
</p>
<p>12. The bulk of the country&#8217;s external debt was contracted before 1990, when Mobutu 
was President and a significant proportion of the funds that flowed into the country were 
</p>
<p>  
 1 On 1 July 2010, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1925 (2010), the United Nations 
</p>
<p>Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO) took over 
from MONUC. Its mandate, which the Council, in its resolution 1991 (2011), extended until 30 June 
2012, is to protect civilians, humanitarian personnel and human rights defenders under imminent 
threat of physical violence and to support the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
in its stabilization and peace consolidation efforts. At 31 January 2012, the country had the largest 
United Nations peacekeeping operation in the world, with 19,070 uniformed personnel (including 
16,975 military personnel, 723 military observers and 1,372 police), 976 international civilian 
personnel, 2,868 local civilian staff and 588 United Nations volunteers.      
</p>
<p> 2 President Kabila was re-elected for another term in November 2011.

</p>
<p>embezzled by his Government. Arrears constitute a considerable proportion of the debt 
stock. 
</p>
<p>13. In 1970, the total external debt was $346 million. At the time of Mobutu&#8217;s ousting in 
1997, the country&#8217;s total debt stock stood at $12.3 billion; in 1998, it was $13.187 billion. 
During the 1970s, a number of loans were extended by IMF, the World Bank and other 
creditors for projects that were neither assessed for their feasibility nor properly planned. 
Most of these projects failed, leaving the country with massive debts to be repaid by the 
citizens of the country who derived no benefit from them. Furthermore, creditors extended 
loans to the Mobutu regime with full knowledge of its pervasive corruption, extravagance 
and repression because of its strategic importance in the Cold War and because of the 
perception that there were no viable alternatives to Mobutu.5 The absence of constitutional 
safeguards made it easy to borrow irresponsibly and for projects that had no developmental 
benefit and failed to generate resources necessary to service external debts. 
</p>
<p>14. In 1982, Erwin Blumenthal, the resident representative of IMF in the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, reported that there was &#8220;no, I repeat no, chance on the horizon for 
Zaire&#8217;s numerous creditors to get their money back ... Mobutu and his government show no 
concern about the question of paying off loans and the public debt ... [There] was and there 
still is, one sole obstacle that negates all prospect: the corruption of the team in power.&#8221;6 
Despite this warning and widespread knowledge of its corruption, IMF lent the Mobutu 
regime over $600 million in the early 1980s, while the World Bank provided $650 million. 
Western Governments lent over $3 billion over the same period.7 
</p>
<p>15. Although the Democratic Republic of the Congo is today the world&#8217;s poorest 
country, its creditors have never acknowledged that its debt should be cancelled because of 
their irresponsible behaviour or that it is odious.8 The Independent Expert calls upon the 
country&#8217;s creditors to unconditionally cancel what remains of the Mobutu era debt and, in 
this way, afford the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo an opportunity to 
make a fresh start and to consolidate the stability that the country has achieved after 
decades of economic mismanagement and plunder of its resources. Creditors can accept 
shared responsibility for mistakes made in the past. In 2006, Norway cancelled $80 million 
worth of debt owed by five developing countries, thereby acknowledging that it &#8220;shared 
</p>
<p>responsibility&#8221; for these debts. 
</p>
<p>16. In July 2003, the Democratic Republic of the Congo reached the decision point 
under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, thereby qualifying for interim 
debt relief.9 In November 2003, the Paris Club creditors agreed to reschedule the country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>  
 5 In 2005, the Commission for Africa declared that much of the debt in Africa had been incurred by 
</p>
<p>dictators who were enriching themselves through their countries&#8217; oil, diamonds and other resources 
</p>
<p>and who were supported during the Cold War by the very countries now receiving debt repayment. 
Many of these rulers siphoned billions of dollars out of their country using the financial systems of 
developed countries.

</p>
<p> 9 When countries enter the HIPC Initiative, a decision point document sets out what they must do to 
complete the process. Typically, these conditions include measures to address poverty, but also 
include different types of economic policy conditions that can undermine poverty reduction efforts;

<p>debt under Cologne flow terms. According to IMF, the amount of debt relief committed at 
the decision point was $6.3 billion in present value terms calculated as at December 2002.10 
This relief represented an overall reduction of 80.2 per cent in present value of all public 
and publicly-guaranteed external debt as at end December 2002 after traditional debt relief.  
</p>
<p>17. In June 2006, however, IMF suspended interim assistance when the Poverty 
Reduction and Growth Facility programme &#8220;went off track&#8221;.11 The Paris Club also 
discontinued its interim debt relief and only resumed it in February 2010, following IMF 
approval, in December 2009, of a new poverty reduction and growth facility arrangement 
that allowed the Democratic Republic of the Congo to draw $551 million over three years, 
provided that the Government implemented the fiscal and economic reforms supported by 
the facility.12 According to the Government, the macroeconomic programme went off track 
because &#8220;the momentum of the reform proved difficult to sustain on account of the 
continued conflict in the eastern provinces and the preparations for the first national 
election in 40 years.&#8221;13 
</p>
<p>18. From 2003 to 2009, the Democratic Republic of the Congo received interim debt 
relief of $1.3 billion (approximately $187 million per year). During the same period, 
poverty reduction expenditure rose from 4 per cent to 18 per cent of total national 
spending.14 
</p>
<p>19. In June 2010, the country reached the HIPC Initiative completion point, thereby 
gaining access to $12.3 billion in debt relief: $11.1 billion under the HIPC Initiative and 
$1.2 billion under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative.15 Of this, $491 million was to be 
provided by IMF $1,832 million from the International Development Association, and the 
balance from bilateral and commercial creditors. 
</p>
<p>20. Under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, the International Development 
Association would provide debt relief by cancelling the country&#8217;s debt service obligations 
for credits disbursed before the end of2003 and still outstanding at the end of September 
2010, averaging debt service savings of $28.4 million per year until 2043. The African 
Development Bank would provide relief amounting to $162.8 million in nominal terms 
beginning from completion point. This amount is based on debt disbursements as of 31 
</p>
<p>  
for example, countries have to cut public spending (meaning fewer teachers or doctors); privatize 
basic services, like water or electricity (meaning higher prices and reduced access for the poor); or 
liberalize trade, leaving poor farmers and producers unable to compete with cheaper imports from 
developed countries.

 15 To reach completion point, the country had to fulfil seven conditions: (a) completion of a full poverty 
</p>
<p>reduction strategy through a participatory process and its implementation for one year; (b) continued 
maintenance of macroeconomic stability, as demonstrated by satisfactory performance under the IMF 
extended credit facility-supported programme; (c) use of budgetary savings resulting from enhanced 
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative-related debt relief; (d) strengthened public expenditure 
management; (e) improvements in governance and service delivery in priority sectors; (f) adoption of 
satisfactory sectoral development strategies and related implementation plans for health, education 
and rural development; and (g) improved debt management systems and strategies. </p>

</p>
<p>December 2004 and still outstanding on 1 July 2010, providing savings of $3.9 million per 
year until 2053.  
</p>
<p>21. In February 2010, the Paris Club announced that it would cancel or reschedule 
almost half of the $6.9 billion owed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The 
restructuring agreement covered $3 billion, of which $1.3 billion would be cancelled and 
$1.7 billion rescheduled. In addition, the Paris Club deferred all debt service payments by 
the country until July 2012 owing to the &#8220;exceptional circumstances of the Government&#8217;s 
inability to service its debt&#8221;.16 Nonetheless, the Independent Expert is of the view that the 
rescheduling of the country&#8217;s debt service obligations does not resolve the debt crisis; it 
merely postpones the problem. In addition, given the historical circumstances surrounding 
the build up of the country&#8217;s external debt, and in particular the odious nature of most of it, 
it is important that creditors fully acknowledge their role in the build-up of the debt and 
unconditionally cancel the remaining debt. This proposal is fully consistent with the 
principle of shared responsibility of creditors and debtors for preventing and resolving 
unsustainable debt situations, which is enshrined in the Monterrey Consensus. The 
Independent Expert also encourages the Government and its partners to commit fully to the 
responsible financing framework proposed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and 
Development, as well as the proposed guiding principles on foreign debt and human rights. 
</p>
<p>22. According to IMF, full delivery of HIPC Initiative debt relief, additional bilateral 
assistance beyond debt relief under that Initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative 
at the completion &#8220;would reduce the DRC&#8217;s external debt burden significantly&#8221;.17 Thus, the 
ratio of present value of debt-to-exports at the end of December 2010 would fall to 57.5 per 
cent after delivery of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative assistance; this ratio is predicted to 
increase until end December 2013 mainly owing to new borrowing. IMF estimated, the 
present value of external debt at the end of 2010 at $3.7 billion, and that this would rise to 
$4.9 billion in 2011 and $5.9 billion in 2012.18  
</p>
<p>23. It is estimated that debt relief reduced debt servicing to 2.9 per cent of goods and 
services exports in 2010 (from 21.2 per cent in 2009) and to approximately 1 per cent in 
</p><p>2011. External debt service after full debt relief was estimated at $216.2 million for 2010, 
$92.3 million in 2011 and $107.4 million in 2012. According to the Government, however, 
the projected service payments for 2011 amounted to $159.3 million. These contradictions 
underscore the need for an audit of the country&#8217;s public debt. 
</p>
<p>24. The resources freed up by HIPC Initiative debt relief are meant to be spent on 
poverty reduction. According to IMF, however, in 2003, spending on health, education and 
agriculture was &#8220;extremely modest&#8221;.19 In the period from 2003 to 2009, the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo received interim debt relief of $1.3 billion (approximately $187 
million per year), while on average non-security priority spending increased. In 2003, the 
country received $90 million of debt relief, while its expenditure on health, education, and 
agriculture and rural development was $22.4 million.20 In 2009, debt relief amounted to 
$376 million and total expenditure was $374 million: $63.3 million (or 3 per cent of the 
budget) was allocated to health, $225.4 million (10.8 per cent) to education and 85.3 
</p>
<p>  
 16 The main Paris Club creditors are the United States of America (15.5 per cent) and France (10.8 per 
</p>
<p>cent) of Highly Indebted Poor Countries eligible debt stock at the end of December 2002, followed by 
Belgium and Japan (approximately 7 per cent). Non-Paris Club relief amounts to $229 million: 
United Arab Emirates (1.6 per cent of HIPC eligible debt) and Kuwait (0.9 per cent). In 2008, China 
cancelled its claim of $27 million in full.

<p>million (4.1 percent) to agriculture and rural development. As a share of total Government 
expenditure, spending on health, education and agriculture rose from 4 per cent in 2003 to 
18 per cent in 2008 and 2009.21 These figures suggest that the use of budgetary savings 
from HIPC-related debt relief for poverty-related expenditure increased in the period 2003-
</p><p>2009. 
</p>
<p>25. Owing to the lack of up-to-date information, however, it is difficult to ascertain the 
gains from debt relief in monetary terms. According to some of the country&#8217;s development 
partners, although debt relief provided to the country amounted to $12.3 billion in 2010, in 
reality the fiscal space afforded by debt relief amounted to about $300 million. The reason 
for this is that the country had long been unable to service its debt, and the relief provided 
included loans that were not being repaid. Consequently, the size of the budget has not 
increased as much as one would expect. In addition, most creditors have continued to 
record debt relief as official development assistance (ODA), inflating aid figures and 
thereby presenting an incorrect picture of the amount of actual aid that can contribute to 
poverty reduction. Significantly, debt relief has not been accompanied by fresh additional 
ODA. 
</p>
<p>26. What remains unclear, however, is how the amount of $300 million has been 
allocated to basic social services. Government officials indicated that it would only be 
possible to make this assessment once the 2012 budget, the first since the country reached 
Heavily Indebted Poor Country completion point, has been finalized.  
</p>
<p>27. Notwithstanding the lack of information concerning the actual gains from debt 
relief, the Independent Expert considers that, in line with the aim of debt relief, the fiscal 
space provided by debt relief should be directed to poverty alleviation and the 
establishment of conditions for the realization of human rights, particularly economic, 
social and cultural rights (such as education, health and water). In this connection, he 
emphasizes that the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to 
which the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a party, imposes an obligation on the State 
to use the maximum of its available resources for the realization of the human rights 
elaborated in the Covenant. 
</p>
<p>28. It is important to underscore that debt relief has not been delivered exclusively in the 
form of debt cancellation; rather, most relief has been delivered through debt service 
reduction, restructuring of arrears, moratoriums on interest and rescheduling of arrears. 
This does not necessarily free up new money, because the country has had limited capacity 
to repay its debts. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Debt sustainability 
</b></p>
<p>29. In 2009, IMF and the World Bank estimated that all of the country&#8217;s debt burden 
indicators would deteriorate significantly that year owing to declines in GDP, exports and 
Government revenue in the wake of the global economic recession and the decline in world 
commodity prices.22 The joint IMF/World Bank debt sustainability analysis concluded that 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo remained in debt distress and that &#8220;even after 
HIPC/DRI debt relief, the external debt outlook would be vulnerable to adverse shocks&#8221;.23 
In 2010, IMF reported that the country &#8220;would continue to face a high risk of debt distress 
after receiving debt relief from all creditors under the enhanced HIPC Initiative and

</p>
<p>MDRI&#8221;, and that &#8220;the [present value] of external debt-to-GDP indicator breaches the 
policy-dependent threshold in the baseline scenario and the external debt outlook is 
vulnerable to adverse shocks&#8221;.24 However, it attributed the breach to &#8220;a public guarantee on 
external borrowing to finance public infrastructure projects under the [Sino-Congolese 
cooperation agreement]&#8221; and argued that, &#8220;without the guarantee, all indicators would 
remain well below their respective thresholds&#8221; and the risks to debt sustainability 
manageable.25 IMF noted, however, that &#8220;the future evolution of these indicators is highly 
uncertain and will depend on several factors, particularly economic growth and the terms of 
new external financing&#8221;.26 As the global recession has demonstrated, the country is highly 
vulnerable to external shocks; there is therefore a need for its development partners to 
provide grants or concessional loans in order to prevent the build-up of unsustainable debt. 
</p>
<p>30. As indicated in previous reports, the Independent Expert considers that the 
IMF/World Bank debt sustainability analyses have severe shortcomings, including the fact 
that they are based on over-optimistic assumptions. More particularly, he is concerned that 
these analyses fail to take into account other demands on public resources, including those 
required for the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and social investment. 
</p>
<p>31. The Independent Expert welcomes the Government&#8217;s commitment to pursue a 
&#8220;cautious external borrowing strategy&#8221; and to seek foreign loans on highly concessional 
</p>
<p>loans with a minimum grant element of 35 per cent.27 He urges the country&#8217;s development 
partners to provide grants.  
</p>
<p><b> III. Legal and policy frameworks on human rights, debt and 
development 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Human rights obligations 
</b></p>
<p>32. The Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo reaffirms the adherence 
of the State to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples&#8217; Rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and other international human 
rights instruments. Title II of the Constitution (which has three chapters devoted to human 
rights and one to the duties of the citizen) provides for human rights, fundamental liberties 
and the duties of the citizen and the State. Chapter 1 guarantees a number of civil and 
political rights, including equality and equal protection of the law (art. 12); non-
discrimination (art. 13); equality and non-discrimination against women (art. 15); life, 
physical integrity and free development of personality, and the prohibition of slavery, cruel, 
inhumane and degrading treatment, and forced or compulsory labour (art. 16); personal 
liberty (art. 17); due process (arts. 18-21); freedom of thought, conscience and religion (art. 
22); freedom of expression (art. 23); freedom of information (art. 24); freedom of peaceful 
assembly (art. 25); freedom of demonstration (art. 26); right to submit petitions to public 
authorities (art. 27); inviolability of domicile (art. 29); freedom of movement (art. 30); 
privacy (art. 31) and asylum (art. 33).

</b></p>
<p><b>11</b> 
</p>
<p>33. Chapter 2 enshrines a number of economic, social and cultural rights, including the 
rights to property (art. 34); work, equitable and satisfactory pay and social protection (art. 
36); freedom of association (art. 37); to establish or belong to trade unions (art. 38); to 
strike (art. 39); to marry a person of the opposite sex (art. 40); education, including free and 
compulsory primary education in public institutions (arts. 43 and 45); culture and 
intellectual property (art. 46); health and food security (art. 47); and decent housing, access 
to drinking water and electric energy (art. 48). There are also provisions for the protection 
of the young and the elderly. 
</p>
<p>34. In chapter 3, the Constitution guarantees a number of collective rights, including the 
rights to national and international peace and security (art. 52) and to a healthy environment 
favourable to development (art. 53). Articles 56 to 58 contain provisions that are designed 
to ensure that the country&#8217;s wealth benefits its people. Article 56 provides that any action or 
</p>
<p>convention that deprives the nation, individuals or legal entities of their natural resources 
constitutes the crime of &#8220;pillage&#8221;. This provision is a potentially useful one, given that the 
country has suffered and continues to suffer from illegal exploitation of its natural 
resources. Article 58 provides for the right to national wealth and the duty of the State to 
redistribute wealth equitably and to safeguard the right to development.  
</p>
<p>35. These constitutional guarantees are complemented by the standards in the core 
international human rights treaties to which the State is a party.28  
</p>
<p><b> B. Human rights institutions 
</b></p>
<p>36. Article 150 of the Constitution provides that the courts are the guarantors of the 
fundamental rights and civil liberties of citizens. Nonetheless, there are concerns about the 
ability of the courts to enforce the rights enshrined in the Constitution effectively. 
According to reports and information received by the Independent Expert during his 
mission, the country&#8217;s judicial sector is largely underresourced, corrupt and inefficient.29 
</p>
<p>37. The Independent Expert is concerned about the lack of a national institution for the 
promotion and protection of human rights in conformity with the Principles relating to the 
status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris 
Principles). 
</p>
<p>38. During his visit, the Independent Expert was informed of a bill on a national human 
rights commission currently before the National Assembly for discussion and adoption. The 
Independent Expert urges the Government to ensure that the bill provides for a national 
institution that is fully compliant with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>  
 28  The country is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the 
</p>
<p>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the First Optional Protocol thereto, the 
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention 
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the Convention against Torture 
and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the Convention on the 
Rights of the Child and the two optional protocols thereto. At the regional level, it is a party to the 
African Charter on Human and Peoples&#8217; Rights.

<p><b>A/HRC/20/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b> 
</p>
<p><b> C. Legal provisions and policy on public debt 
</b></p>
<p>39. Although the Constitution contains a number of provisions relating to public finance 
management, there is no specific law governing loan negotiation, debt contraction or the 
management and use of loan funds. According to article 122 of the Constitution, public 
finances, public loans and the financial commitments of the State, and public monetary and 
fiscal matters all fall under the legislative branch of Government; in other words, 
Parliament is meant to play a legislative role in public financial management. This role is, 
however, largely confined to adoption of the annual budget of the State. Although article 
131 gives the National Assembly an oversight role, it appears that this role is limited.  
</p>
<p>40. Article 177 establishes an audit office <i>(</i>Cour des comptes) subject to the authority of 
the National Assembly, with responsibility for controlling the conditions for the 
management of public finances. Article 181 provides for the establishment of a national 
trust for equal development <i>(</i>Caisse nationale de p&#233;r&#233;quation) to finance public investment 
projects and programmes in order to address the problem of uneven development among 
the provinces. 
</p>
<p>41. In terms of Decree No. 09/61 of 3 December 2009, responsibility for the analysis 
and management of the country&#8217;s public debt, including external debt, lies with the 
</p>
<p>Directorate for Public Debt Management (Direction g&#233;n&#233;rale de la dette publique), an 
agency within the Ministry of Finance. The decree does not, however, provide for a role for 
Parliament in public debt management. Furthermore, although the Directorate is meant to 
produce biannual statistical bulletins and quarterly forecasts of public debt service, it was 
unable to provide the Independent Expert with up-to-date information on the country&#8217;s debt 
stock and debt service obligations. In the absence of up-to-date information released in a 
timely fashion, it is difficult for the Government to manage its debt properly or to be held 
accountable. The Independent Expert urges the Government to make a greater effort to 
address this problem. 
</p>
<p>42. The Independent Expert encourages the Government to include provisions on public 
debt in the Constitution and to enact comprehensive legislation on debt.  
</p>
<p><b> D. National development policy 
</b></p>
<p>43. In February 2007, the National Assembly approved a five-year development 
programme known as <i>cinq chantiers</i>. The programme, based on the poverty reduction and 
growth strategy paper adopted in 2006, focuses on five pillars: (a) to promote peace and 
good governance; (b) to consolidate macroeconomic stability and promote economic 
growth; (c) to improve access to social services; (d) to combat HIV/AIDS; and (e) to 
promote a dynamic community.30 The strategy aims to align the poverty reduction strategy 
paper with the prospect of attaining the Millennium Development Goals. 
</p>
<p>44. The Government also has a long-term development strategy, known as Vision 26/25, 
which envisages building a society of hope based on (a) national unity and territorial 
integrity; (b) security, justice, equality and the rule of law; (c) work, wealth, prosperity and 
sustainable development; and (d) peace and national solidarity. The Vision aims to help the 
country progress towards human development and the Millennium Development Goals. In 
addition, the Government has adopted sectoral development strategies. On 18 March 2010, 
the Council of Ministers adopted the Basic Education Strategy,31 together with a plan of 
</p>
<p>  
 30 See IMF, Letter of Intent, (see footnote 27), pp. 42-53. 
 31 Basic education is defined as primary and secondary education. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>13</b> 
</p>
<p>action. The strategy is aimed at ensuring more equitable and sustainable access to basic 
education of acceptable quality. 
</p>
<p>45. On 31 March 2010, the Ministry of Health and its development partners adopted a 
national health sector strategy and a national health development plan for the period  2011-
</p><p>2015. The strategy focuses on, inter alia, the revitalization of health zones, the 
strengthening of Government ownership and leadership, the development of human 
resources, and health financing reform. The overarching objective of the plan, which also 
serves as the common framework for the Government and its partners in the realization of 
the Millennium Development Goals, is to contribute to the improvement of the general 
health status of the population and the containment of endemics and contagious diseases, 
while the sector objective is to ensure the population&#8217;s access to primary health care, with a 
special focus on vulnerable groups. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Impact of debt on human rights and development 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. External debt and human rights 
</b></p>
<p>46. It is widely accepted that excessive external debt burdens can have an adverse effect 
on the enjoyment of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights, as well 
as on human development.32 As indicated above, a significant proportion of the national 
budget of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is spent on debt service. Although the 
attainment of the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and 
anticipated debt relief has raised a high level of expectation in the country, it is yet unclear 
how the debt relief savings will translate into improved general living standards. 
</p>
<p>47. Nevertheless, based on the examples of other countries that have benefitted from 
international debt relief (such as Bolivia (Plurinational State of), Malawi, Uganda, the 
United Republic of Tanzania, and Zambia,), and provided they are properly invested, it can 
be argued that the gains from debt relief can contribute to the establishment of conditions 
necessary for the realization of human rights, such as education, health, water and 
sanitation

</b></p>
<p><b>14</b> 
</p>
<p><b> B. Millennium Development Goals 
</b></p>
<p>48. Poor quality or almost non-existent statistical data undermine efforts to assess and 
monitor the Millennium Development Goals and their indicators.33 Nonetheless, reports and 
anecdotal information provided by the Government indicate that the country has made 
some progress on health and education, but progress on the Goals for reducing extreme 
poverty and hunger, gender equality and the fight against HIV/AIDS, malaria and other 
diseases remains insufficient. The country is unlikely to achieve most of the Goals by the 
target date.34  
</p>
<p>49. The percentage of the national budget allocated to education rose from 5 per cent in 
2001 to 11.17 per cent in 2008, although this remains well below the 20 per cent allocation 
advocated by the Global Campaign for Education.35 Net primary school enrolment 
increased to 62 per cent in 2007 (from 52 per cent in 2001). In September 2010, the 
Government introduced free primary schooling for the first three years throughout the 
country, except in Kinshasa and Lubumbashi.36  
</p>
<p>50. The effective delivery of quality education has been hampered by several factors, 
including poor infrastructure, shortage of human and financial resources, underqualified 
teachers, poor salaries (which are irregularly paid), widespread corruption, lack of 
transparency and poor management of funds.37 An additional factor is the division of 
responsibility for education among a number of ministries, leading to lack of coordination 
and dispersal of already low levels of expertise.38 Educational planning is also hampered by 
deficits in the baseline data about the present state of the education system. Poor 
management of education funds makes it difficult to mobilize international support. 
</p>
<p>51. As a share of total expenditures, Government spending on health increased from 1 
per cent ($5.8 million) in 2003 to 3 per cent ($63.3 million) in 2009. The reason for such 
modest increases is that the Government has been forced to spend more on security owing 
to the instability in the eastern part of the country. Nevertheless, this expenditure is 
insufficient for a country the size of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
</p>
<p>52. With help from its development partners, the Government is trying to increase 
access to the basic water supply and to sanitation. The World Bank has launched an urban 
water programme (Projet d&#8217;eau en milieu urbain) to reform Regideso, the State water 
company. The Independent Expert is concerned, however, that if these reforms entail 
privatization and the introduction of user fees, access to water for most of the population, 
especially the poorest, may be limited.

<p>53. In comparison with other countries in the region, the Democratic Republic of the 
Congo fares poorly in human development terms: it is ranked 187 out of 187 countries; its 
gross national income per capita is $280 (regional average is $1,966); the under-5 mortality 
rate is 199 per 1,000 live births (regional average is 127); the maternal mortality ratio is 670 
per 100,000 live births (regional average is 620); life expectancy at birth is 48.4 years (the 
regional average is 54.4 years); 71.3 per cent of the population live beneath the poverty line 
(with 46.5 per cent of the population living in extreme poverty); 55.5 per cent lack access to 
safe water; and 62 per cent lack access to improved sanitation.39 
</p>
<p><b> C. Vulture funds, debt relief, human rights and development</b>40<b> 
</b></p>
<p>54. The Democratic Republic of the Congo currently faces a number of lawsuits from 
commercial creditors (commonly termed &#8220;vulture funds&#8221; or &#8220;distressed debt funds&#8221;) that 
</p>
<p>have purchased its debt at significant discounts and then aggressively sought to recover 
amounts that are vastly in excess of what they paid for the debt. The Government does not 
seem to have a complete picture of the debts involved; however, one of the most widely 
publicized cases is that involving FG Hemisphere Associates LLC (now FG Capital 
Management). The debt in question arose from a 1980s agreement for the construction of 
energy infrastructure by Yugoslavian company Energoinvest DD. The project was financed 
through a credit provided by Energoinvest to the State-owned electricity company (Soci&#233;t&#233; 
nationale d&#8217;&#233;lectricit&#233;) and guaranteed by the Government, both of which defaulted on 
repayments. In accordance with the agreement, the matter was referred to arbitration by the 
International Chamber of Commerce, which the Democratic Republic of the Congo did not 
attend. In 2003, two arbitral awards were granted in favour of Energoinvest for a total of 
$39 million, including 9 per cent interest and the cost of arbitration. In 2004 and 2005, the 
United States District Court for the District of Columbia confirmed the awards.41 
Energoinvest then sold its interests in the arbitral awards and judgements to FG 
Hemisphere. Since 2005, FG Hemisphere has sued the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
for more than $100 million in the Bahamas, Europe, Hong Kong, South Africa, Australia 
and the United States of America in a bid to enforce the arbitral awards.42 
</p>
<p>55. Apart from FG Hemisphere, two other vulture funds &#8211; Themis Capital and Des 
Moines Investment Ltd &#8211; have filed suits against the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and its Central Bank to recover approximately $74 million in principal and interest 
allegedly owing to them under a refinancing and credit agreement dated 31 March 1980.  
</p>
<p>56. By forcing such an impoverished country to divert its scarce resources from social 
investment and poverty reduction programmes, vulture funds are undermining the core 
objectives of international debt relief efforts. They are also undermining the country&#8217;s 
development and the capacity of its Government to create the conditions for the realization 
of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights.

</p>
<p>57. The Independent Expert is concerned that the Government does not have the 
capacity to respond effectively to the claims of the vulture funds owing due to the weakness 
of State institutions and the inadequacy of information concerning vulture fund claims. In 
particular, there appears to be a lack of coordination between the Ministry of Justice and 
other relevant State entities, including the Directorate for Public Debt Management. In 
order to be able to effectively resist the claims of vulture funds, the Government needs a 
comprehensive picture of the country&#8217;s external debt, including amounts and entities 
involved, and must ensure proper sharing of information between relevant Government 
departments.  
</p>
<p>58. Additionally, there is a need for more robust international action to curb the 
predatory activities of vulture funds. The Independent Expert notes that some of the 
country&#8217;s creditors (notably the Paris Club) have resolved not to sell sovereign debts to 
</p>
<p>third parties. Such political declarations are, however, insufficient; legislative action 
(similar to that adopted in the United Kingdom in 2010) is required to deal with the 
problem. As the Independent Expert has underlined on previous occasions, it is illogical for 
sovereign creditors to grant debt relief while allowing vulture funds to use their courts to 
recover excessive amounts from impoverished countries. 
</p>
<p>59. Lastly, the Independent Expert notes that there is nothing that legally prevents 
vulture funds from seeking to recover payments for debts owed by poor countries. 
Nevertheless, he considers that the odious nature of many of the debts incurred by the 
country may make it unethical or even illegal to seek repayment.  
</p>
<p><b> V. International assistance and cooperation 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Development partners 
</b></p>
<p>60. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, net 
ODA to the Democratic Republic of the Congo amounted to $2.3 billion in 2009 and $3.4 
billion in 2010. Of this amount, a large proportion was devoted to debt relief, while the 
balance was devoted to humanitarian relief, health and population, and education.43  
</p>
<p>61. The country&#8217;s multilateral development partners include the World Bank, IMF, the 
African Development Bank and the United Nations. In 2011, the African Development 
Bank had a portfolio of $696.88 million, devoted to infrastructure (72.2 per cent), 
agriculture and rural development (14.1 per cent), social sectors (9.1 per cent) and multi-
sectoral activities (4.6 per cent). The World Bank has a portfolio of $2.9 billion, focusing 
on infrastructure (60 per cent), human development (20 per cent) and governance (20 per 
cent). The governance aspect of the Bank&#8217;s portfolio is mainly concerned with improving 
economic governance and the business climate.  
</p>
<p>62. United Nations assistance to the country is provided through the United Nations 
Development Assistance Framework (2008-2012), which identifies good governance, pro-
poor growth, basic social services and HIV/AIDS as priority areas for the Organization&#8217;s 
intervention. United Nations agencies and programmes also provide technical assistance in 
several areas, including transitional justice (OHCHR), anti-corruption (the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP)), literacy programmes for the military (United Nations 
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) and immunization (United Nations 
Children&#8217;s Fund).

</p>
<p>63. The country also has partnerships with emerging countries, including Brazil, China, 
India and the Republic of Korea. China is involved in several economic sectors and projects 
as part of a long-term cooperation agreement with the Government, whereby China builds 
infrastructure in exchange for mining concessions.44 It is also assisting with major projects 
in education (two universities), health (31 hospitals and 145 health clinics), water supply, 
electricity and rural development, funded in the period 2009-2010 by grants amounting to 
CNY 140 million, interest-free loans (CNY 150 million) and soft loans. The latter consists 
of CNY 2.348 billion (including CNY 490 million to upgrade telecommunications and 
CNY 1.758 billion to build a national optic fibre network).  
</p>
<p>64. India is providing low-interest credit lines over a period of at least 25 years, together 
with capacity-building. It is also providing training and university scholarships. 
Development assistance from Brazil and the Republic of Korea focuses on technology 
transfer and provision of training and university scholarships. 
</p>
<p>65. Emerging partners generally attach no sensitive conditions to aid, such as good 
governance, privatization and trade liberalization, which are typically imposed by 
&#8220;traditional&#8221; partners and focus on neglected sectors.45 Moreover, these partnerships, which 
subcontract to local firms, have produced significant benefits, including employment, 
cheaper consumer goods and technology transfer. These are investments desperately needed 
in a country ravaged by more than 30 years of economic decline, political instability and 
armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>66. The multiplicity of development partners poses a challenge for aid coordination. 
Nonetheless, it is unclear which Government department is responsible for aid 
coordination. In June 2009, a high-level forum on aid effectiveness adopted the Kinshasa 
agenda, which provides for better coordination of resources provided by international 
development partners. The agenda also called on the Government to take certain measures, 
including the formulation of a policy on the management of external resources and reforms 
in the areas of public procurement, decentralization, the public sector, the fight against 
corruption, and accountability. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Foreign investors 
</b></p>
<p>67. In recent years, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has attracted large volumes 
of foreign direct investment (FDI), particularly in the extractive industries sector. 
Numerous concerns have, however, been raised about the lack of transparency in the 
negotiation and signing of agreements relating to these investments, as well as with regard 
to the failure to properly assess Congolese assets prior to deals and the lack of real benefit 
to the Congolese people.46 One notable example is the Tenke Fungurume Mining SARL 
project, a joint venture between Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. (United States,

<p>poverty reduction and social investments. See Afrodad, <i>Mapping Chinese Development Assistance in 
Africa: An Analysis of the Experiences of Angola, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe</i> (Harare, 
Afrodad, 2008), pp. 17-18, 23.

entreprises du portefeuille de l&#201;tat (COPIREP) and the World Bank, 26 May 2006. In a 2007 report 
submitted to the Senate Committee on Economy, Finance and Good Governance, the Central Bank of 
Congo stated that, of 237 mining companies operating in Katanga province, only six had published 
information on their activities. See Amed&#233;e Mxarabu Koboko, &#171; Six entreprises mini&#232;res seulement

<p>57.75 per cent), Lundin Mining Corporation (Canada, 24.75 per cent) and the Congolese 
State-owned company, Gecamines (17.5 per cent).47 The project contract was signed in July 
2005 (during the country&#8217;s transition period) after a hasty and mostly opaque negotiation 
process. In July 2007,  when the contract was being reviewed by an inter-ministerial 
commission established by the Government to &#8220;examine partnership contracts and their 
impact on the recovery of these companies and national development, to propose, if 
necessary, modalities for their revision with a view to correcting any imbalances and 
related faults&#8221;, the European Investment Bank extended a EUR 100 million loan for the 
project. Such irresponsible investment casts doubts on the Bank&#8217;s professed commitment to 
the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which aims to strengthen transparency 
and accountability in the extractives sector.48 The commission reviewed more than 60 
contracts signed between private companies and the State or State-owned enterprises, and 
recommended that some contracts (including that of the project) be renegotiated.49 It is 
unclear, however, whether the Government has implemented the recommendations of the 
commission. 
</p>
<p>68. During the Independent Expert&#8217;s visit, a number of non-governmental organizations 
and development partners also raised concerns about the lack of transparency concerning 
foreign investment projects. Moreover, studies have documented cases of non-compliance 
by some foreign investors with the country&#8217;s labour laws and international labour standards 
in Katanga, and cases of child labour in the mining industry in Katanga, Kivu and Kasai.50  
</p>
<p>69. The Independent Expert welcomes the new measures taken by the Government to 
increase transparency in the management of public resources, including through the 
publication of future mining, forestry and oil sector concessions, production sharing 
agreements and partnership contracts within 60 days of signature.51 He considers that the 
transparency of existing and future contracts is essential to combating corruption and 
protecting the interests of the Congolese people. He therefore urges the Government to 
implement these measures fully. 
</p>
<p>70. Unless the benefits of foreign investments are shared fairly by the Congolese people, 
the country&#8217;s development will be undermined. The Independent Expert therefore 
commends the provincial administration of Katanga for its decision to raise the minimum 
wage in the mining sector from $20 to $100. He urges the Government and its partners to 
do more to ensure that the activities of foreign investment firms do not violate international 
human rights and labour standards. This requires the adoption and enforcement of 
appropriate legislative frameworks informed by, inter alia, such international standards as 
the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.52 
</p>
<p><b> C. Non-governmental organizations 
</b></p>
<p>71. International non-governmental organizations have played an important role in 
providing humanitarian assistance and demanding transparency and accountability,

<p>particularly with regard to foreign investment projects. For example, in March 2007, a 
coalition of more than 100 international and Congolese organizations launched an appeal 
calling upon the new Government and its partners to ensure that the Congolese population 
derived its fair share of income from the exploitation of the country&#8217;s natural resources. In 
response, the Government established the above-mentioned inter-ministerial commission. 
</p>
<p><b> VI. Main challenges 
</b></p>
<p>72. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has made important progress in restoring 
political and macroeconomic stability since 2001. Nonetheless, the country faces a number 
of critical development challenges.  
</p>
<p>73. According to a recent report, the country faces &#8220;possibly the most daunting 
infrastructure challenge&#8221; in Africa.53 The conflict has seriously damaged the infrastructure, 
thereby undermining the country&#8217;s economic and human development. Although much 
</p>
<p>progress has been made since the return of peace in 2003, the country faces a challenge in 
mobilizing resources for the development of new infrastructure. It is estimated that the 
country will require about $5.3 billion per year until 2015 to rebuild its infrastructure. This 
problem is compounded by the large size of the country, low population density, extensive 
forest lands and numerous rivers. 
</p>
<p>74. The security situation in the east of the country remains fragile, despite 
peacekeeping efforts.54 In 2008 and early 2009, this situation led to greater security 
expenditure, which placed immense pressure on the scarce national budgetary resources. A 
more secure environment is a prerequisite for the rule of law, enjoyment of human rights 
and the realization of sustainable development. 
</p>
<p>75. Corruption was a pervasive feature of the Mobutu regime and contributed to the 
build-up of the country&#8217;s external debt and underdevelopment. It remains widespread in the 
country,55 and a key obstacle to sustainable development. To its credit, the Government 
acknowledges the problem and has ratified the United Nations Convention against 
Corruption, promulgated the Anti-Corruption Law (No. 5/006), adopted a &#8220;zero-tolerance&#8221; 
policy on corruption and established an anti-corruption institution. Despite these efforts, 
corruption remains widespread, largely because it became ingrained in all sectors of private 
and public life during the Mobutu era and became very difficult to root out. The country&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>development partners (including UNDP) are currently implementing a capacity-building 
programme to strengthen the anti-corruption institution, which is perceived to be weak and 
ineffective.56 The Independent Expert welcomes this initiative and urges the Government to 
increase its efforts to fight corruption.  
</p>
<p>76. According to IMF, there is a lack of transparency and accountability in public 
financial management, manifested in the circumvention of budgetary procedures and 
ineffective budget controls, that have resulted in reduced fiscal discipline and

</p>
<p>accountability.57 Lack of transparency renders it difficult to assess how public debt is being 
contracted and on what terms. The Independent Expert encourages the Government to take 
measures to strengthen public financial management and to improve accountability in the 
use of public resources, including by strengthening the oversight role of Parliament and 
non-governmental organizations through enabling legislation. 
</p>
<p>77. Effective domestic resource mobilization is critical to ensuring debt sustainability 
and avoiding over-reliance on external aid. This is only possible, however, in circumstances 
where the public service is well managed, corruption is robustly addressed and salaries are 
paid on a regular basis. Measures to address the country&#8217;s economic challenges should also 
take into account the specific vulnerabilities of the poorest members of the population.  
</p>
<p>78. The narrow tax base poses significant challenges for domestic resource mobilization. 
The Independent Expert notes that the Government is taking measures to broaden the tax 
base; these include the introduction of a value added tax, reform of the tax administration 
department dealing with large companies, and rationalization of the tax regime applicable 
to transnational corporations. Nonetheless, he considers that tax reforms (particularly 
regressive taxes) designed to contribute to domestic resource mobilization should not result 
in further impoverishment of the Congolese people. 
</p>
<p>79. The Constitution establishes the principle of revenue-sharing between the central 
Government and the provinces, with the latter retaining 40 per cent. The purpose of this 
arrangement is to improve the quality of public services at the local level. During his visit, 
however, the Independent Expert was informed that the arrangement had not been 
implemented, leaving the provinces with scant resources to invest in the provision of social 
services. The Independent Expert urges the Government to endeavour to implement this 
constitutional arrangement fully in order to enhance the capacity of provincial 
administrations. 
</p>
<p>80. The above-mentioned challenges can only be addressed through a concerted effort of 
the Government and its development partners.  
</p>
<p><b> VII. Conclusions and recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>81. <b>The Democratic Republic of the Congo has made important socio-economic 
progress since 2001, as demonstrated by the political transition to a democratically 
</b></p>
<p><b>elected Government and improvements in living standards. Nevertheless, socio-
</b></p>
<p><b>economic conditions remain dire, </b>the country&#8217;s infrastructure is dilapidated<b>, and its 
</b></p>
<p><b>external debt remains unsustainable. Despite an increase in poverty reduction 
</b></p>
<p><b>spending, access to basic services remains insufficient and the cost and quality of 
</b></p>
<p><b>services a concern. 
</b></p>
<p>82. <b>The attainment of completion point of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries 
Initiative has given the country access to debt relief amounting to $12.3 billion. Debt 
</b></p>
<p><b>relief alone, however, is insufficient to put the country on the path of sustainable 
</b></p>
<p>development. The country&#8217;s high dependence on mineral exports, lower development 
</p>
<p><b>partner support, the unresolved security situation in parts of the country, less 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessional terms of external financing and weak implementation capacity could all 
</b></p>
<p><b>compound </b>the country&#8217;s external debt situation and undermine its development 
</p>
<p><b>prospects. The extent to which additional resources </b>&#8211;<b> particularly grants, non-
</b></p>
<p><b>concessional financing, FDI and export revenues </b>&#8211;<b> will be available will therefore be 
</b></p>
<p><b>critical to ensuring that the country stays on the path of sustainable development.

</p>
<p>83. <b>The </b>country&#8217;s<b> burden of odious and unpayable external debt underscores key 
shortcomings of the global economic system and, in particular, raises concerns about 
</b></p>
<p><b>the failure of creditors to acknowledge their share of responsibility for the 
</b></p>
<p>development of the country&#8217;s debt crisis and to design debt relief mechanisms that 
</p>
<p><b>respond in a fair and equitable manner to the crisis. 
</b></p>
<p>84. <b>On the basis of the above findings, the Independent Expert makes the 
recommendations below, addressed to the Government of the Democratic Republic of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the Congo and to its development partners. 
</b></p>
<p><b> A. Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Independent Expert recommends that the Government: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) Consider adopting a national human rights action plan, as recommended 
</b></p>
<p><b>in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, to inform the design and 
</b></p>
<p><b>implementation of its development strategies; such an approach would enhance the 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectiveness of national development strategies and contribute to sustainable results; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Take steps to establish a national human rights institution that conforms 
</b></p>
<p><b>fully to the Paris Principles; in this regard, it should avail itself of the technical 
</b></p>
<p><b>assistance of OHCHR and of its development partners; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Take immediate measures to strengthen its efforts to combat corruption, 
</b></p>
<p><b>including by ensuring that the anti-corruption institution is independent and allocated 
</b></p>
<p><b>sufficient national budgetary resources to ensure its effective functioning; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Increase its efforts to address the security situation in the east of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>country. A more secure environment is a prerequisite for the rule of law, the 
</b></p>
<p><b>enjoyment of human rights and sustainable development; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) Maintain a cautious external borrowing strategy and adhere fully to its 
</b></p>
<p><b>commitment to seek grants and concessional financing for infrastructure 
</b></p>
<p><b>development; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Implement the resource-sharing arrangement provided for under the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution to improve the capacity of provincial governments to deliver public 
</b></p>
<p><b>services; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Undertake a comprehensive, transparent and participatory debt audit in 
</b></p>
<p>order to ensure an accurate picture of the country&#8217;s debt<b>; such an audit would be an 
</b></p>
<p><b>important step in establishing an effective public debt management system and 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensuring transparent public debt management; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(h) Strengthen oversight mechanisms for public finances, use of public 
</b></p>
<p><b>resources and foreign investment contracts by, inter alia, adopting legislation to 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantee access to information and to ensure the availability and accessibility of 
</b></p>
<p><b>accurate, comprehensive and current information on these issues; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(i) Consider including detailed provisions on public debt in the Constitution 
</b></p>
<p><b>and/or adopting detailed legislation on public debt; examples in this regard can be 
</b></p>
<p><b>found in the constitutional provisions adopted in Ecuador and Uganda, and in 
</b></p>
<p><b>legislation adopted in Viet Nam; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(j) When implementing </b>measures to address the country&#8217;s economic 
</p>
<p><b>challenges, pay attention to the specific vulnerabilities of the poorest and marginalized 
</b></p>
<p><b>in order to fully safeguard their rights. In particular, the Government should ensure 
</b></p>
<p><b>that public enterprise reform (including through privatization) and its efforts to </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/20/23/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>22</b> 
</p>
<p><b>broaden the tax base do not compromise the enjoyment of all human rights, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly economic, social and cultural rights. In the event of privatization, it 
</b></p>
<p><b>should implement social programmes to assist redundant public enterprise employees; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(k) In line with the objectives of international debt relief, ensure that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>fiscal space provided by debt relief, however limited, is directed towards poverty 
</b></p>
<p><b>reduction and the realization of basic rights to, inter alia, health, education, housing, 
</b></p>
<p><b>water and sanitation. Additionally, it should use the fiscal space provided by debt 
</b></p>
<p><b>relief in a transparent and accountable manner to ensure that the benefits of debt 
</b></p>
<p><b>relief are shared by all through improved access to basic public services on an equal 
</b></p>
<p><b>basis. 
</b></p>
<p><b> B. Development partners 
</b></p>
<p>86.<b> The Independent Expert recommends that development partners: 
</b></p>
<p><b>(a) </b>Continue to support the Government&#8217;s development efforts, including 
</p>
<p><b>progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, by providing grants or 
</b></p>
<p><b>concessional financing; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(b) Support the Government in its efforts to develop a national human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights action plan and to establish a national human rights institution in conformity 
</b></p>
<p><b>with the Paris Principles; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(c) Scrupulously avoid providing finance with intrusive policy conditions 
</b></p>
<p>that may undermine the country&#8217;s national <b>development strategies and the realization 
</b></p>
<p><b>of human rights, particularly economic, social and cultural rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(d) Where applicable, acknowledge their share of responsibility for the 
</b></p>
<p>country&#8217;s debt burden and unconditionally cancel debts that a comprehensive, 
</p>
<p><b>transparent and participatory public debt audit would find to be odious; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(e) With regard to, in particular, IMF and the World Bank, ensure that 
</b></p>
<p><b>their debt sustainability analyses take into account the other demands on the 
</b></p>
<p>Government&#8217;s financial resources, part<b>icularly those needed for social investment and 
</b></p>
<p><b>the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(f) Commit to help the country to regulate the activities of foreign investors 
</b></p>
<p><b>and to regulate corporations of which they are the States of nationality in order to 
</b></p>
<p><b>ensure that the activities of such corporations are consistent with international human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights standards, including the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; 
</b></p>
<p><b>(g) Support Government efforts to enhance the capacity of non-
</b></p>
<p><b>governmental organizations </b>to contribute to the country&#8217;s development<b> more 
</b></p>
<p><b>effectively.
