<p><b>Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), established in accordance 
with Human Rights Council resolution 5/1 of 18 June 2007, held its second session from 5 to 19 
May 2008.  The review of Sri Lanka was held at the 12th meeting on 13 May 2008. The delegation 
of Sri Lanka was headed by Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Disaster Management and 
Human Rights. For the composition of the delegation, composed of 17 members, see annex below. 
At its 17th meeting held on 19 May 2008, the Working Group adopted the present report on Sri 
Lanka.<b> 
</b></p>
<p>2. On 28 February 2008, the Human Rights Council selected the following group of 
rapporteurs (troika) to facilitate the review of Sri Lanka: Ukraine, Cameroon and Bangladesh. 
</p>
<p>3. In accordance with paragraph 15 of  the annex to resolution 5/1,  the following documents 
were issued for the review of Sri Lanka: 
</p>
<p> (a)  A national report submitted in accordance with paragraph 15 (a) 
(A/HRC/WG.6/2/LKA/1);  
</p>
<p> (b) A compilation prepared by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
(OHCHR), in accordance with paragraph 15 (b) (A/HRC/WG.6/2/LKA/2); 
</p>
<p> (c) A summary prepared by OHCHR, in accordance with paragraph 15 (c)

<p>4. A list of questions prepared in advance by Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Latvia, 
Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was 
transmitted to Sri Lanka through the troika. These questions are available on the extranet of the 
UPR.<b> 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  SUMMARY OF THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE REVIEW PROCESS 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Presentation by the State under review 
</b></p>
<p>5. At the 12th meeting, on 13 May 2008, Hon. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Minister of Disaster 
Management and Human Rights of Sri Lanka, introduced the national report of Sri Lanka, which, 
he stressed, presents a descriptive and accurate picture of the prevailing human rights situation and 
identifies national priorities and capacity-building needs. He said that the national report highlights 
strengths and identifies challenges Sri Lanka faces as a nation in its efforts to promote and protect 
human rights. He welcomed the opportunity to candidly discuss vital human rights issues pertaining 
to Sri Lanka. He said that Sri Lanka is committed to full cooperation with the Human Rights 
Council and views its voluntary participation in this process as a further indication of this 
commitment. Sri Lanka has taken an active part in institution-building initiatives of the Council. Sri 
Lanka has worked to develop the UPR process. He stated that Sri Lanka expects the process to be 
cooperative in nature, based on an open dialogue with Sri Lanka&#8217;s full involvement, involving also 
due consideration to capacity-building needs.  Hon. Samarasinghe said that all rights are mutually 
reinforcing and interdependent, and the Government believes equal attention should be given to 
civil and political and economic, social and cultural rights as well as the right to development.  It is 
the Government&#8217;s primary duty to safeguard the human rights of all Sri Lankan people. A positive 
obligation is cast upon the branches of Government to safeguard those rights, which find expression 
in Sri Lanka&#8217;s Constitution. The Government has fulfilled international obligations through </p>

 <p> 
participation in most key human rights instruments and labour conventions, the full implementation 
of which is also one of its goals.  
</p>
<p>6. The Government&#8217;s ultimate aim is to implement a National Action Plan on the Protection 
and Promotion of Human Rights (NAP).   
</p>
<p>7. The Government firmly believes in building strong and independent national institutions 
which can sustain and deliver on their mandates to promote and protect human rights. The 
Government welcomes technical assistance and capacity-building initiatives but view them as 
temporary remedial measures. The Government does not want to supplant national institutions with 
international bodies, as the best guarantee of sustainable progress in any field is through generation 
of national ownership.  
</p>
<p>8. Hon. Samarasinghe said that he would like to respond to two interlinked themes noted in 
some of the questions put in advance. The first is the establishment in Sri Lanka of an Office of the 
High Commissioner for Human Rights. He said that in fact, the Office is already represented since 
June 2004 in Sri Lanka by a Human Rights Adviser within the United Nations Country Team, 
supported by a national legal officer and an assistant. The Government is not in agreement with the 
suggestion for the establishment of a monitoring mission. The imposition of foreign institutions will 
stifle the potential for growth of national institutions charged with these functions at present. Sri 
Lanka cherishes and wishes to nurture national institutions which benefits all its people.  
</p>
<p>9. The second theme related to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of Sri Lanka. 
This national commission is a vital cog in the human rights promotion and protection machinery. It 
is a vibrant, independent institution of the State and supports and buttresses the range of 
institutional frameworks outlined in the national report. It can do with technical support. An 
initiative has been taken to propose to Parliament that it should focus attention on strengthening the 
constituting enactment of the Commission. A Parliamentary Select Committee will look into this 
and propose legislative measures to ensure that lessons learned are taken heed of and any 
shortcomings are corrected. 
</p>
<p>10. The 17th Amendment to the Constitution created a multi-party body &#8211; the Constitutional 
Council &#8211; that contributes to the appointment of certain independent national institutions and 
offices of Sri Lanka. The Parliamentary Select Committee on the 17th Amendment has drafted an 
interim report, which makes recommendations for the reformulation of the Amendment so as to 
overcome perceived deficiencies and avoid impasses such as those which prevented the formation 
of the Constitutional Council in the past. Once the report is endorsed by Parliament, the President of 
Sri Lanka has stated that he will take immediate steps to place before the Cabinet of Ministers the 
relevant constitutional amendments, so as to bring them before the legislature to overcome such 
roadblocks to the effective functioning of the Constitutional Council. 
</p>
<p>11. Sri Lanka has maintained a record of openness and constructive engagement with the 
special procedures associated with the United Nations human rights system. Over the years, Sri 
Lanka has not hesitated to invite special procedure mechanisms even under difficult circumstances 
brought about by the grave threat of terrorism. They all acknowledged the Government&#8217;s 
facilitation of their visits and engaged in free and frank dialogue with the Government and other 
stakeholders. In the context of the policy of constructive engagement, Sri Lanka will consider each 
request for an invitation on its merits, and so the question of a standing invitation does not arise. 
</p>
<p>12.  The Government of Sri Lanka has taken several measures to ensure the safety of 
humanitarian workers and has given them access to populations in need. Restrictions, if any, are to 
ensure that these persons are not caught up in the conflict or its fallout. All fatalities and incidents </p>

 <p> 
where these workers have been harmed in any way are being and will be investigated and any 
breaches of the law punished.  
</p>
<p>13. The  Thamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TMVP) is a lawfully and validly registered 
political party under the electoral laws of Sri Lanka. It took part in two highly competitive electoral 
campaigns, the second of which has just successfully concluded with 65.78% of voters exercising 
their franchise. The Government has thus successfully created a conducive environment for 
democratic pluralism and facilitated the entry into the political mainstream of groups who hitherto 
resorted to armed violence in the pursuit of a separate State. This constitutes the first step in the 
realization of effective devolution of power based on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. The 
high voter turnout in the Eastern Province also demonstrates not only an interest in protecting 
democratic rights, denied for two decades by the forces of terror, but also confidence in the 
commitment of the Government to devolve far-reaching powers to the provinces to address the 
genuine grievances of the people in these areas.   The induction of groups who have previously 
resorted to terror into the mainstream of politics is a gradual process which cannot be achieved 
overnight. This development, which is entirely salutary in the context of re-democratization of the 
Eastern Province, should not be confused with the existence of armed paramilitary groups. 
Complete disarming of paramilitaries will take place when normality is restored, sporadic threats 
from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam(LTTE) die down and democracy takes a firmer 
foothold.  
</p>
<p>14. Hon. Samarasinghe said that a very important factor confronting States in fighting terrorism 
is the phenomenon of terrorist fund-raising. It is universally acknowledged that such fund-raising, 
both direct and indirect through so-called charitable fronts, provides a vital resource to sustain 
terrorist campaigns that destabilize democracies and lead to violations of human rights. It is 
therefore imperative that the States of the international community effectively discharge its 
obligations in terms of relevant Security Council resolutions and international conventions by 
taking effective measures to counter fund-raising efforts in their territories and the transmission of 
such funds to other States to perpetrate acts of terror. 
</p>
<p>15. Sri Lanka believes that a strong, independent and vigilant media is a sine qua non for 
democracy to thrive. The Constitution enshrines the freedom of thought, the right to hold opinions 
and the freedom of expression. Courts have gone further in holding that this also encompasses the 
right to receive and impart information. The Government is perturbed by the alleged attacks on 
media workers and especially repulsed by the killing of media workers. The Government in no way 
condones or endorses any such attacks. All complaints will be impartially and thoroughly 
investigated.  
</p>
<p>16.  As regards the issue of child soldiers, the Hon. Samarasinghe stated that the Government of 
Sri Lanka reiterates the position taken in its national report and emphasizes its zero-tolerance policy 
supported by strong legislative measures. The Government was encouraged that the TMVP 
facilitated the release in April of 39 children held by the paramilitary group known as the Karuna 
Faction. The Government is pleased to note that UNICEF has recorded a drop of children held by 
the Karuna Faction from 164 in January 2008 to 76 at the end of April. Unfortunately the figures 
for the LTTE are not as encouraging. The Government has called on all groups that have used 
children in armed conflict to cease the practice immediately and to release all minors in their 
custody.   
</p>
<p>17. In respect of the rights of freedom of religion, Sri Lanka has a non-derogable constitutional 
provision guaranteeing freedom of religion. This is the standard against which all proposed 
legislation, including anti-conversion legislation, is assessed. The question of unethical conversion </p>

 <p> 
has been examined by a committee of experts appointed by the Minister of Human Rights to assess 
the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief. 
</p>
<p>18.  The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) was established under the Ceasefire 
Agreement, which was terminated by the Government for the reason that it was continuously being 
breached by the LTTE. With the termination of the Ceasefire Agreement (CFA) the SLMM 
automatically ceased to exist. Conversely, the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons 
(IIGEP) was the outcome of an attempt of the Government to synthesize the domestic inquiry 
process with an international observer group with a defined mandate with respect to specific cases 
in order to ensure the observance of international norms and standards. It would be evident 
therefore that the mandate of these two mechanisms were specific and not of a general nature to 
monitor human rights. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Interactive dialogue and responses by the State under review</b> 
</p>
<p>19. During the ensuing interactive dialogue, statements were made by 56 delegations. A number 
of delegations praised Sri Lanka for the quality of its national report, which identified national 
priorities, capacity-building and technical assistance needs. The open and positive approach taken 
in the preparation of the review was also commended. A number of delegations also highlighted Sri 
Lanka&#8217;s meaningful contributions to the Human Rights Council, Sri Lanka&#8217;s ratification of most 
core international human rights instruments, its cooperation with United Nations mechanisms; its 
democratic standing; the well developed institutional framework to promote human rights; inter alia 
the establishment of the Permanent Inter- Ministerial Standing Committee on Human Rights and of 
the NHRC; the adoption of the NAP.  Delegations further stressed Sri Lanka&#8217;s valuable 
commitments and efforts made despite a number of long lasting challenges; including prolonged 
armed conflict and natural disasters. Remarkable achievements were also noted in the advancement 
of economic, social and cultural rights, including women&#8217;s health and survival. 
</p>
<p>20. Ukraine encouraged the cooperation with international mechanisms in order to implement 
human rights at all levels of society and to participate in the core human rights treaties as well as 
special procedures of the Human Rights Council. It welcomed the establishment in 2006 of the 
NHRC, but expressed concern about the lack of implementation of the Commission&#8217;s 
recommendations. It recommended that Sri Lanka strengthen the NHRC with the purpose of 
implementing all its recommendations. 
</p>
<p>21. Canada noted that the human rights situation in Sri Lanka continues to deteriorate and that 
the IIGEP has pointed to the fact that a year-long history of its recommendations remains 
unaddressed. It recommended that Sri Lanka (a) provide for the independence of national human 
rights protection institutions, including through implementation of the 17th Amendment; (b) take 
measures to ensure access to humanitarian assistance for vulnerable populations and to protect 
civilians, including human rights defenders and humanitarian workers; (c) continue to take steps to 
ensure that those organizations, with which it is affiliated, like the TMVP, stop recruiting child 
soldiers and release them, and (d) investigate all allegations of extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary 
executions and bring the perpetrators to justice in accordance with international standards in order 
to combat impunity for human rights violations. Canada specifically referred to the public hearings 
of the Commission of Inquiry which implicated members of the Government and security forces in 
the murder of workers of <i>Action Contre le Faim</i> and of five boys in Trincomalee. 
</p>
<p>22. Bahrain noted Sri Lanka&#8217;s continuous efforts to eliminate poverty and strengthen the right 
of health and education. It requested additional information on the human rights concepts included 
in the school curricula and their impact on the quality of teaching. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>23. India noted that Sri Lanka has identified its own national priorities and technical assistance 
needs. It sought further information about the laudable initiative to facilitate greater communication 
amongst communities through language study. It also noted the success achieved by Sri Lanka in 
providing free education to its people and the establishment of the Steering Group to draft a 
constitutional charter of rights, as well as the country&#8217;s cooperation with the United Nations system. 
</p>
<p>24. Cuba noted the difficult situation Sri Lanka faced, with prolonged internal conflict, and that 
a solution was sought through national reconciliation and development of a structure to restore 
national security and social welfare. It welcomed the considerable success achieved in the areas of 
health and education and recommended that OHCHR work in coordination with the Government to 
develop capacity and strengthen the national institutions; and that OHCHR make an effective 
contribution to strengthen the NHRC. 
</p>
<p>25. Palestine congratulated Sri Lanka for conducting the first ever elections of the Eastern 
Provincial Council, which is a vivid indication of its commitment to human rights and democracy. 
It encouraged Sri Lanka to enter into further agreements with countries hosting Sri Lankan migrant 
workers. 
</p>
<p>26. Sweden raised the issue of numerous disappearances and child recruitment, not only related 
to the LTTE. In spite of numerous national efforts, impunity persists. Calls made for independent 
international monitoring of the situation has not yet been accepted by Sri Lanka. Sweden urged that 
(a) measures against impunity in relation to disappearances and child recruitments as well as (b) an 
acceptance of independent international monitoring be taken up as recommendations. 
</p>
<p>27. Belgium condemned the continued recruitment of child soldiers by the LTTE troops. 
TMPV, which remains close to the Government, also recruits child soldiers. It recommended to Sri 
Lanka to take judicial and other measures to put an end to the complicity of the army and police in 
the recruitment of child soldiers in zones under its control. It noted efforts underway with the 
assistance of the international community for the rehabilitation of child soldiers. The Special 
Rapporteur on the question of torture noted cases of child soldiers who were arrested and remain 
under the authority of the anti-terrorist department. Belgium recommended to Sri Lanka to (a) step 
up its efforts for the rehabilitation of child soldiers &#8211; in particular through enhanced cooperation 
with the international community &#8211; and to adopt measures necessary for their rehabilitation in an 
appropriate environment, (b) allow OHCHR to strengthen its presence in Sri Lanka in order to 
reinforce its cooperation and monitoring given the particular serious human rights situation and (c) 
take the necessary measures to ensure the return and restitution of housing and lands in conformity 
with international standards for internally displaced persons. 
</p>
<p>28. Portugal noted the visits of two Special Rapporteurs who reported the widespread practice 
of torture and extrajudicial killings, and enquired about the measures taken to combat impunity; that 
Sri Lanka lacks an effective international human rights monitoring system and has ignored the High 
Commissioner&#8217;s request to establish an independent OHCHR presence; security problems, sexual 
abuse, child recruitment, and poor living conditions with respect to housing, health care and 
education in IDP camps. It recommended to Sri Lanka: (a) to address torture and implement 
safeguards to prevent torture and extrajudicial executions and (b) combat impunity; (c) reconsider 
establishing a local OHCHR presence with monitoring capacities; (d) increase its cooperation with 
UNHCR, provide unrestricted access for international humanitarian aid, (e) ensure protection and 
security in IDP camps; and while safeguarding the rights to return and restitution, adopt a policy to 
provide IDPs with adequate interim housing solutions. 
</p>
<p>29. Nepal noted that despite the difficult situation resulting from the armed conflict, Sri Lanka 
has deployed resources in the fields of education, health, women&#8217;s empowerment and the protection </p>

 <p> 
of children. Nepal noted with satisfaction the impressive rank of Sri Lanka in the global Human 
Development Index and the efforts made in resolving the ethnic conflict through a negotiated 
settlement. It also noted that Sri Lanka&#8217; judiciary is independent. 
</p>
<p>30. Luxembourg noted numerous concerns regarding violations of children&#8217;s rights, as well as 
conscriptions and abductions of children in the immediate vicinity of the official security sites. 
Luxembourg recommended to Sri Lanka to (a) pursue the ongoing inquiries into allegations of 
violations of children&#8217;s rights, such as conscriptions and abductions of children in the near vicinity 
of official security sites, and to adopt vigorous measures to prevent such grave violations, in 
particular in areas held by the government; and (b) take other urgent measures for the re-integration 
of children who have surrendered to the governmental forces asking for special protection and that 
are currently held in prisons. Luxembourg also noted the weak representation of women in political 
decision-making bodies, and regretted a drastic increase in domestic violence and inquired about 
the measures envisaged in this regard.  
</p>
<p>31. The Russian Federation asked how Sri Lanka took into account the need to protect human 
rights during anti-terrorist operations and in dealing with the consequences of the Tsunami. Also, 
noting the considerable needs for technical assistance with regards to human rights capacity, it 
asked whether Sri Lanka had sent any request to OHCHR, and with what result. 
</p>
<p>32. Ireland recommended that Sri Lanka (a) take measures to safeguard the freedom of 
expression and effectively investigate allegations of attacks on journalists and media personnel and 
prosecute those responsible; (b) take measures to protect human rights defenders and their work and 
effectively investigate allegations of attacks on human rights defenders and prosecute those 
responsible; (c) ensure that the NHRC is a pluralist and independent body and that its establishment 
is in compliance with the Paris Principles; (d) address the concerns raised by the Special 
Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders regarding the 
registration of NGOs with particular regard to the need to avoid unduly constraining the activities 
of civil society; and (e) permit the establishment of an OHCHR presence to monitor the human 
rights situation in the country as well as to take measures to improve the humanitarian access, with 
particular regards to ensuring that access to vulnerable populations and ensuring the safety of 
humanitarian workers. 
</p>
<p>33. France asked what measures are envisaged to ensure the independence of the NHRC and 
how it will ensure follow-up to the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture. France recommended that Sri Lanka (a) sign and ratify the International Convention for the 
Protection of All persons from Enforced Disappearance, (b) adopt measures to shed light on a 
number of existing enforced disappearances and comply with the request to visit by the Working 
Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances. France enquired what steps were intended to 
address impunity and recommended (c) that Sri Lanka ratify the Rome Statute on the International 
Criminal Court and (d) that the recommendations of the Special Rapporteur on the question of 
torture be implemented in accordance with a set timetable. 
</p>
<p>34. Finland enquired how protection of civilians is ensured during the conflict and expressed 
particular concern for the situation of journalists and abducted children. It noted the departure of the 
SLMM and how the discontinuation of IIGEP has created a gap in the monitoring and reporting of 
the human rights situation. It recommended to Sri Lanka (a) to accept an independent OHCHR 
presence and allow the entry of international human rights monitors; (b) to take measures to protect 
the rights of IDPs, including long-term housing and property restitution policies that meet 
international standards, and protecting the rights to a voluntary, safe return and adequate restitution. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>35. Bhutan noted and commended Sri Lanka on the success in the area of economic, social and 
cultural rights, manifested through the achievement of the highest Human Development Index 
ranking in the sub-region. It recommended that Sri Lanka further continue its programmes to 
develop former conflict zones in order to bring afflicted communities at par with those living in 
other provinces. It recommended that the international community, particularly those in a position 
to do so, consider how support may be extended to assist Sri Lanka in bridging existing gaps in 
order to enable them to move closer to the effective realization of the full range of human rights for 
all Sri Lankans. 
</p>
<p>36. The Holy See commended Sri Lanka on the numerous national human rights mechanisms 
put in place and attention was drawn to the plight of the many child soldiers who are enrolled by the 
Tigers, but also, as confirmed by many reports, by the Karuna group, which seems close to the 
Government. The Holy See encouraged the authorities of Sri Lanka to investigate the involvement 
of the paramilitary Karuna Group of abducting children for use as soldiers. The Holy See requested 
Sri Lanka to share the findings of the special bodies created to stop the persistent pattern of 
enforced disappearances and the measures put into place to address this problem. 
</p>
<p>37. China noted the setting up of the NHRC and the inter-ministerial committee on human 
rights, and the active cooperation with human rights mechanisms. Good progress has also been 
made with regard to the Millennium Development Goals, as well as in the Human Development 
Index. China also noted the continuous efforts to promote and protect human rights despite huge 
difficulties due to terrorism and armed conflict, and asked about the status of the preparation of the 
NAP and recommended that Sri Lanka, with the support of the international community, continue 
to enhance the capacity-building of its national human rights institutions. 
</p>
<p>38. Saudi Arabia commended the efforts made to ensure conformity with international civil and 
political rights as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and noted that inter alia the 
adoption of the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
(ICCPR) proves its commitment to promote and protect human rights for all its citizens. Saudi 
Arabia asked about steps taken to protect social, political, cultural, and economic rights of 
minorities in Sri Lanka. 
</p>
<p>39. Mexico noted the moratorium on capital punishment, asked for additional information on 
the bill for the protection of victims and witnesses, and enquired whether there is a timeframe for its 
approval and whether it will apply to victims of human rights violations. Mexico recommended that 
(a) Sri Lanka step up its activities to eliminate discrimination against ethnic minorities in terms of 
enjoyment of the full range of human rights, in line with the comments of the Committee on 
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR), Committee on the Elimination of Racial 
Discrimination (CERD), Committee on the Rights of the Child and Committee on the Elimination 
of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). Mexico also noted the drafting of a human rights 
charter under the Constitution and recommended that (b) Sri Lanka take into account the comments 
of the Human Rights Committee that it include all the substantive provisions of the ICCPR within 
its national legal structure. Finally, Mexico urged Sri Lanka to (c) implement various 
recommendations made by treaty bodies and special procedures to ensure that security measures 
adopted in the context of armed violence including the state of emergency the 2005 emergency laws 
and measures to combat terrorism comply with international human rights law. 
</p>
<p>40. The Syrian Arab Republic noted the progress made in vital sectors, in particular social 
services, education, and the empowerment of women, in addition to the establishment of the NHRC 
and the possible introduction of a human rights charter. It recalled, also, that the Special Rapporteur 
on freedom of religion and belief had previously indicated that Sri Lanka enjoys a high level of 
religious harmony and freedom of belief. Syria enquired, however, about how Sri Lanka could </p>

 <p> 
provide services, aid and salaries to areas under the control of the LTTE and the challenges it is 
facing in this respect. 
</p>
<p>41. Austria highlighted the high number of IDPs and asked for additional information about 
their situation as well as Sri Lanka&#8217;s strategy to find durable solutions, in particular for those 
remaining in camps and whose return to their places of origin is impeded by the designation of 
High Security Zones. Austria recommended that necessary measures be taken to safeguard the 
human rights of IDPs in accordance with applicable international standards and that particular 
emphasis should inter alia be given to increased information-sharing as well as consultation efforts 
as a means to reduce the prevailing sense of insecurity among IDPs and facilitate reintegration in 
areas of return. Austria furthermore recommended that measures be taken to ensure the provision of 
assistance to IDPs and the protection of human rights of those providing such assistance. Austria 
lastly recommended that measures be taken to ensure the effective implementation of legislative 
guarantees and programmes for the protection of witnesses and victims. 
</p>
<p>42. Colombia requested information about the results of the campaign to eradicate violence 
against women as well as about measures taken to ensure greater representation of women in public 
life. 
</p>
<p>43. Slovenia asked for clarification on the situation of Up-Country Plantation Tamil and what 
Sri Lanka is doing to alleviate their difficult situation, especially in regard to the denial of rights to 
register on voter lists or have Tamil recognized as an official language.  Slovenia enquired what the 
minimum age for voluntary recruitment into Sri Lanka&#8217;s armed forces exist, and if so what it is, and 
about safeguards to ensure that recruitment is not forced. Slovenia recommended to Sri Lanka to: 
(a) take measures to award Up-Country Tamils with the full set of civil rights, including the right to 
vote; (b) investigate allegations of forced recruitment of children by the TMVP/Karuna faction and 
hold accountable persons found in violation of CRC and its Optional Protocol; and (c) promptly 
invite the United Nations to establish a presence in Sri Lanka, the mandate of which would include 
protection, monitoring, investigation and reporting. 
</p>
<p>44. The Philippines appreciated that, despite major challenges such as a separatist group that 
sows terror and an unforgiving nature, Sri Lanka improved its ranking in Gender Equality, Global 
Competitiveness and other indexes, particularly ranking first in terms of  women&#8217;s health and 
survival, , which indicates Sri Lanka&#8217;s consistent progress in political, cultural, social and economic 
spheres, and has built up an environment conducive to the promotion and protection of human 
rights. 
</p>
<p>45. Belarus noted that the fight against terrorism has been diverting Sri Lanka&#8217;s resources. It 
asked whether Sri Lanka is satisfied with its cooperation with international organizations on anti-
terrorism measures, and asked what the international community could do to increase the 
effectiveness of the fight against terrorism. Belarus recommended that Sri Lanka actively draw 
upon the assistance of the international community in the anti-terrorism process and in overcoming 
its negative consequences. 
</p>
<p>46. Pakistan enquired about the proposed Constitutional Charter of Rights and the status of the 
13th Amendment to the Constitution. Pakistan recommended to OHCHR work closely with Sri 
Lanka to build the capacity of its national institutions and the international community to assist Sri 
Lanka&#8217;s counter-terrorism strategies, especially by countering terrorist&#8217;s fund-raising efforts in their 
territories and in accordance with Security Council resolutions and international conventions. 
</p>
<p>47. New Zealand expressed concern about the reported increase in enforced disappearances, 
extra judicial killings and violations of international humanitarian law since the resumption of </p>

 <p> 
hostilities, and about the little concerted efforts to effectively investigate such violations. It asked 
about steps to protect the human rights of victims from minority communities which are 
disproportionately affected. While noting the zero- tolerance policy for child recruitment and steps 
made to rehabilitate former child soldiers, New Zealand remained concerned at reports that child 
recruitment continues. New Zealand recommended that Sri Lanka take further steps to improve the 
effectiveness of its measures to combat the recruitment of child combatants and welcomed Sri 
Lanka&#8217;s comments on this proposed recommendation. 
</p>
<p>48. Brazil, while welcoming the adoption of institutional measures, expressed concern about the 
implementation of international human rights treaties and about integration and harmonization of its 
national legislation therewith. Brazil enquired about measures taken to strengthen the 
independence, impartiality and effectiveness of the NHRC and to guarantee the rule of law, 
particularly in the context of the &#8216;Emergency Regulations.&#8217; Brazil recommended to Sri Lanka to (a) 
extend standing invitations to the special procedures and (b) ratify the Optional Protocol to the 
Convention against Torture. 
</p>
<p>49. Romania noted the creation of a commission to investigate allegations of abduction and 
recruitment of child soldiers by various forces, and enquired about how it operates, results 
achieved, and other measures Sri Lanka will take to fully implement its obligations under Optional 
Protocol to CRC on the involvement of children in armed conflict. It recommended to Sri Lanka to 
investigate the role of security forces in child recruitment and hold those responsible accountable. 
Romania requested information on Sri Lanka&#8217;s intentions to combat child labour, the results 
achieved, and the lack of minimum age for marriage. 
</p>
<p>50. Addressing the Working Group, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United 
Nations Office at Geneva, Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka, stated that, the political component of the 
Government&#8217;s approach to the resolution of the ethnic conflict is the maximum devolution of power 
within a unitary constitutional framework. The 13th Amendment, strives precisely to achieve 
political autonomy. Having militarily liberated the Eastern Province, the Government has just 
concluded the elections which has re-empowered the eastern Provincial Council. The Government 
intended to do the same in the northern province. The President of Sri Lanka has promised that the 
north, just like the east, will be militarily liberated and politically empowered by the holding of 
elections to an autonomous provincial council in the north. The President has appointed a high-level 
National Task Force for the northern province which will implement the programme of 
reconstruction and rehabilitation. The Government is attempting to revive, restore and re-activate 
the 13th Amendment which provides for full devolution of powers within a unitary State.  
</p>
<p>51. Responding to questions raised by States, Sri Lanka&#8217;s Attorney General Hon. C.R. De Silva, 
PC, stated that notwithstanding the serious nature of the security situation prevailing in Sri Lanka 
resulting from a reign of terror unleashed by the most ruthless terrorist organization in the world, 
the LTTE, it is not the policy of the State to adopt and enforce extraordinary measures that are 
outside the framework of the law. The Government has steadfastly insisted that all agents of the 
State should necessarily carry out arrests, detentions and investigations including interrogations, in 
accordance with the due process of the law and in a manner that would not infringe human rights.   
</p>
<p>52. As regards the issue of disappearances, it is not safe to consider the nature and the 
magnitude of the problem on the basis of unsubstantiated statistics. The Government is studying 
credible reports and information so as to identify the nature of the problem, its magnitude, possible 
reasons, and the identities of those who are responsible. It is not the policy of the State to illegally 
and surreptitiously arrest persons and detain them in undisclosed locations or to extrajudicially 
eliminate arrested and detained suspects. He said that the Government is determined to ensure that 
all complaints are comprehensively and impartially investigated into, perpetrators identified, and </p>

 <p> 
evidence against them collected, so that such persons can be prosecuted. During the past decade, 
criminal proceedings have been instituted against 599 members of the security forces and the police 
with regard to their alleged involvement in abducting persons, detaining them unlawfully and 
extrajudicially eliminating persons in custody. The process of investigation and prosecution may 
not be as expeditious as one would like it to be. What is important is that the due process of the law 
and justice has been set in motion and is moving in the correct direction.    The allegation of torture 
is also one that concerns our Government. Both the Committee against Torture (CAT) and the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture concluded that the practice of torture was not 
systematic in Sri Lanka. Unfortunately torture may be possibly occasionally used by certain 
overzealous investigators on certain occasions as an investigative tool to extract the truth from 
persons under interrogation. Perpetrating torture is a violation of an important fundamental right 
enshrined in the Constitution and an offence under the criminal law of Sri Lanka, which imposes 
very serious punishment. A special agency of the police has been specially mandated to carry out 
criminal investigations into all complaints of torture. During the last 12 months alone, criminal 
proceedings have been instituted against 61 police officers with regard to their alleged use of torture 
in the course of criminal investigations.    All alleged perpetrators of human rights violations would 
be prosecuted. Measures necessary to expedite the process of investigation, launch prosecutions and 
conduct trials would be adopted. The Government refutes the allegation of impunity. 
</p>
<p>53. Latvia commended Sri Lanka on its decision to let a certain number of the Special 
Rapporteurs to visit Sri Lanka and encouraged Sri Lanka to build on these visits and to issue 
standing invitations and to agree to all outstanding requests by the special procedures of the Human 
Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>54. Germany regretted the abrogation of the ceasefire agreement with the LTTE, which led to 
the termination of the SLMM in March 2008. Clarifications were sought about concrete measures 
intended to compensate for the void created in terms of monitoring and effectively addressing 
human rights violations committed in the wake of ongoing civil war hostilities and in anti-terrorist 
strategies. Germany recommended that Sri Lanka restore and ensure the independence of its 
National Human Rights Commission, in accordance with the Paris Principles. 
</p>
<p>55. The Czech Republic enquired about the measures Sri Lanka has adopted to eliminate 
torture, especially regarding human rights defenders and detained persons, and ensure torture 
victim&#8217;s access to justice, including witness protection and assistance programmes.  The Czech 
Republic recommended to Sri Lanka to: (a) adopt measures to strengthen the rule of law; prevent 
human rights violations, including enforced disappearances, extrajudicial executions and torture; 
ensure punishment of those responsible; and include, inter alia, systematic review of all detention 
areas;  establish an independent complaint mechanism in prisons, and prompt, impartial 
investigation into allegations of torture as well as protection for witnesses and others alleging 
torture or ill-treatment against reprisals, intimidation and threats; (b) ensure full incorporation and 
implementation of the provisions of international human rights instruments  at the national level, in 
particular ICCPR and CAT; (c) adopt concrete measures to strengthen the function and 
independence of the National Human Rights Commission; and (d) ratify the Optional Protocol to 
CAT and, (e) support the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur on the question of torture  and 
establish an OHCHR field presence with the mandate to monitor Sri Lanka&#8217;s human rights situation 
and provide technical assistance, particularly regarding judicial, police and prison reform. 
</p>
<p>56. Italy (a) recommended that Sri Lanka take further active measures in order to put an 
immediate end to forced recruitment and to the use of children in armed conflicts by all factions, 
including the Karuna Group; It enquired whether Sri Lanka was considering to take further steps 
towards a complete abolition of the death penalty, and recommended that (b) Sri Lanka allow </p>

 <p> 
United Nations human rights mechanisms and OHCHR to establish and reinforce their presence in 
the country in order to guarantee an independent monitoring of the human rights situation in Sri 
Lanka.  
</p>
<p>57. The Netherlands emphasized that the fight against terrorism has to remain within the 
boundaries enshrined in the international human rights instruments. The Netherlands welcomed the 
national plan of action and recommended (a) that the national plan of action provide specific 
benchmarks within a given timeframe, (b) that it establish the Constitutional Council as foreseen by 
17th Amendment to the Constitution as soon as possible, and that this Council be mandated to 
appoint a number of commissioners to public Commissions, such as the NHRC and the Police 
Commission. The Netherlands remained concerned at allegations of serious human rights violations 
and recommended that (c) Sri Lanka agree to the re-establishment of an international human rights 
monitoring presence in the country. 
</p>
<p>58. Poland noted that freedom of expression is subjected to restrictions, which seems to give 
rise to cases of violence and intimidation of representatives of the media. Poland enquired about 
steps taken to implement the recommendations made by the Human Rights Committee in 2003 and 
recommended to Sri Lanka undertake effective measures to ensure full realization of the right to 
freedom of expression by all persons.  It enquired about steps taken to combat sexual exploitation 
of children and child prostitution, especially in coastal resorts. Poland recommended to Sri Lanka to 
ensure that its domestic legislation is in full compliance with the Convention on the Rights of the 
Child. It also recommended to Sri Lanka to ensure a safe environment for human rights defenders 
and that perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice. 
</p>
<p>59. Turkey noted the achievements made in the political, economic and social development 
fields and appreciated steps taken on human rights training, gender equality and the empowerment 
of women&#8217;s status. Turkey enquired if Sri Lanka is considering taking the necessary steps to shorten 
the worrying number of trial proceedings on violence against women and encouraged Sri Lanka to 
try to respond in a timely manner to questionnaires sent by the special procedures. 
</p>
<p>60. Japan regretted the IIGEP&#8217;s decision to terminate its mission in April. It underlined the 
importance for Sri Lanka to implement the recommendations made by the IIGEP to establish a 
workable, effective and permanent system for victims and witness protection, to ensure that all 
State bodies provide cooperation and the provision of immediate and necessary financial resources 
to the Commission of Inquiry. Japan noted the existence of fewer cases of kidnappings, forced 
disappearances and extrajudicial killings compared to before and expressed its hope that Sri Lanka 
would double its efforts to prevent similar cases and to ensure bringing all perpetrators to justice. 
Japan also attaches importance to Sri Lanka&#8217;s efforts to resolve its human rights problems and 
expected it to enhance its capacity in the areas of crime investigations, the judiciary and NHRC, 
with the assistance of the international community.  
</p>
<p>61. Denmark was pleased to hear that Sri Lanka wants to focus attention on improving freedom 
of the press and enquired about the measures taken to that end. It recommended that (a) Sri Lanka 
undertake measures to improve safeguards for freedom of the press; it also   recommended that (b) 
Sri Lanka accept the presence of an OHCHR field office. Noting steps taken by Sri Lanka to 
combat torture, torture is still widely practiced and, referring to 25 recommendations made by the 
Special Rapporteur on the question of torture, enquired what steps will be taken to implement them. 
Denmark recommended that (c) Sri Lanka immediately implement the Special Rapporteur&#8217;s 
recommendations. It further enquired about the measures Sri Lanka employs to combat caste-based 
discrimination. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>62. Guatemala welcomed the self-critical character of the national report. It enquired what 
measures are being adopted to combat cases of abuse by authorities and torture by members of the 
police and the armed forces, in particular cases of abuse against women in areas of conflict in Sri 
Lanka. Guatemala also enquired whether there are any plans to alter the minimal age of criminal 
responsibility. 
</p>
<p>63. Egypt commended Sri Lanka on the maintenance of its vibrant democracy, as well as on its 
genuine commitment to upgrade its national human rights architecture and requested information on 
internally displaced persons, and the adequacy of support from international organizations and 
donors on this matter. Egypt further enquired about steps taken to uphold and guarantee the rights 
of its minorities and afford them protection from military operations, and legal framework to 
protect them from discrimination. 
</p>
<p>64. Azerbaijan expressed its full support to efforts to preserve its territorial integrity and to 
completely wipe out terrorism and aggressive separatism. Sri Lanka tries to protect human rights in 
the conflict-affected areas and called upon Sri Lanka to continue its efforts to better ensure it. Close 
and frank cooperation with relevant United Nations agencies and human rights mechanisms, 
including the special procedures, is crucial in this process. Azerbaijan asked how the voluntary 
character of the return of internally displaced is ensured in the resettlement process and secondly, 
measures taken to address psychological trauma caused by armed conflict. 
</p>
<p>65. Indonesia stressed that Sri Lanka has maintained a continuous supply of essential goods and 
services to &#8220;uncleared areas&#8221;, thereby ensuring that basic needs of people are met even in times of 
conflict. It welcomed the restoration of democracy in parts of the country. It asked about measures 
taken to ensure facilitated humanitarian access to local and international agencies to enhance 
protection of civilians in conflict-affected areas. And, while applauding the engagement with 
special procedures and mechanisms, it asked about steps taken to follow up on and implement their 
recommendations. Regarding the downgrading of the NHRC, Indonesia asked what measures the 
Government intends taking to strengthen the mandate and powers of the NHRC. 
</p>
<p>66. Malaysia noted that Sri Lanka demonstrated unreserved commitment to enhancing the 
wellbeing of its people and in addressing challenges, constraints and gaps in human rights 
protection. It enquired about Sri Lanka&#8217;s legislation providing for protection of witnesses and 
victims and asked how child soldiers are dealt with and re-integrated into society.   
</p>
<p>67. Morocco noted that Sri Lanka&#8217;s national report was in harmony with the Human Rights 
Council Guidelines and that the Government consulted with stakeholders in its preparation. It 
encouraged Sri Lanka to continue its efforts to full implement international human rights 
instruments, and requested clarification about its intention to include additional voluntary 
commitments. Additional information was also requested about the administrative parliamentary 
commission and the competencies of the Ombudsman. 
</p>
<p>68. The Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea noted progress made in providing essential 
services as well as the efforts to reach its Millennium Development Goals, especially to increase the 
literacy rates, school enrolment and health care outcomes. It encouraged Sri Lanka to continue with 
its efforts and requested to elaborate further on its plans to protect migrant workers, including 
women. 
</p>
<p>69. Tunisia encouraged the parties to seek a lasting peace in the conflict zones. It welcomed the 
results shown in the right to health and asked for more information on Sri Lanka&#8217;s efforts to ensure 
the right to health for all citizens. </p>

 <p> 
</p><p>70. Venezuela noted with appreciation the efforts made to promote and protect human rights 
and to mitigate poverty levels. Sri Lanka&#8217;s national plans to promote social cultural and political 
rights were highlighted, in particular the right to health and implementation of the national health 
plan, on which it requested more information. 
</p>
<p>71. The Republic of Korea welcomed efforts made by the Government to promote and protect 
human rights, as reflected by the establishment of human rights infrastructure, despite the challenge 
of armed conflict. It asked about concrete measures taken to prevent the alleged abductions and 
recruitment of child soldiers. In addition, Sri Lanka was asked about measures taken to address the 
issues of discrimination against women in employment and occupation in the private sector. Sri 
Lanka was encouraged to continue close dialogues with the United Nations human rights 
mechanisms and OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>72. The United Kingdom condemned all terrorism and noted that counter-terrorism measures 
must be in accordance with human rights norms. It recommended that Sri Lanka (a) strengthen and 
ensure the independence of its human rights institutions in accordance with the Paris Principles, 
including the NHRC. The United Kingdom recognized a decrease in abductions and extrajudicial 
killings in some areas of Sri Lanka, and a strong, independent system to bring those responsible to 
justice, protecting against the resurgence of such activities. Sri Lanka was recommended to (b) 
implement the recommendations made by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or 
arbitrary executions and take steps to verifiably disarm all paramilitary groups. The United 
Kingdom also recommended that (c) civil society organizations, including those from multi-ethnic 
communities and conflict-affected areas in Sri Lanka&#8217;s north and east, be involved in the follow-up 
to the UPR process. 
</p>
<p>73. Algeria recommended that Sri Lanka further support human rights machinery and capacity-
building in its national institutions to implement the human rights instruments, and that special 
attention be given to women in promoting education and development to increase their wages and 
their representation in politics and public life. It also recommended the continued work with the 
international community to assist with the protection of human rights, the environment, disaster risk 
management, HIV/AIDS and capacity-building. 
</p>
<p>74. Greece raised concern about the ending of the ceasefire agreement and the renewed military 
campaign and recommended that (a) Sri Lanka accept an independent international human rights 
mechanism on the ground as soon as possible; Greece also recommended that (b) Sri Lanka issue a 
standing invitation to all special procedures. It expressed concern about the increased number of 
reported enforced disappearances and unlawful killings, including of humanitarian workers, and 
requested more information on measures taken to investigate these cases. It recommended to Sri 
Lanka (c) to take all necessary measures to end impunity for perpetrators of violations of 
international human rights law and humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p>75. The United States of America noted Sri Lanka&#8217;s struggle against terrorism and 
recommended the following: (a) re-engage with international human rights monitoring and 
assistance mechanisms by agreeing to establish an OHCHR field presence, whose mandate would 
allow unfettered access to monitor, investigate and report human rights violations and promote 
remedial measures, including criminal investigation, prosecution and capacity-building of domestic 
human rights mechanisms; (b) ensure the adequate completion of investigations into the killings of 
aid workers, including by encouraging the Presidential Commission of Inquiry  to use its legal 
powers to their full extent; (c) demobilize child soldiers by assuring children serving with pro-
government militias (forced or voluntary) are released and adequate resources allocated for 
disarmament, demobilization, reintegration, repatriation and other activities to halt the unlawful </p>

 <p> 
recruitment of children; (d) Sri Lanka&#8217;s plan to address the forcible recruitment of child soldiers 
should be publicized and (e) Sri Lanka should work with international and domestic non-State 
actors to halt the recruitment and use of child soldiers. 
</p>
<p>76. The Islamic Republic of Iran noted with interest a number of measures adopted to enhance 
the promotion and protection of human rights and to consolidate cooperation with United Nations 
human rights mechanisms. It encouraged Sri Lanka to increase its efforts to strengthen its legal 
safeguards to eliminate all forms of ill-treatment or torture in the prisons and detention centres. 
</p>
<p>77. Uruguay hoped that the recommendations made by special procedures are taken in account 
and duly applied. Uruguay asked about measures to ensure that detained children, including those 
suspected of belonging to the LTTE and those who were forcibly recruited and escaped, are 
separated from adults and receive special care and attention. 
</p>
<p>78. Sudan noted that terrorism is an exceptional circumstance, which impacts on the right to 
development and other economic and social rights. It recommended that Sri Lanka share its 
experience with regard to fighting rebellion and terrorism and how to overcome them, as well as on 
measures taken to improve its social and economic development. 
</p>
<p>79. The Secretary General of the Secretariat for the Coordinating of the Peace Process in Sri 
Lanka, Prof. Rajiva Wijesinha, welcomed questions regarding education and language policy, since 
these would serve to make clear the commitment of the Government to pluralism and equitable 
development. Though for many years the Official Languages Act had not been implemented 
properly, this was now being promoted apace and over the last decade bilingualism through 
education had been implemented, while making English more widely available for reasons of 
equity. With regard to the abrogation of the Ceasefire Agreement, it had proved positive in allowing 
for action based on discussion with moderate Tamils. The situation had not got worse inasmuch as 
for instance with regard to IDPs, United Nations figures showed that the number of displaced had 
risen altogether by just 149 between the end of December and the end of April 2008. Though there 
were about 2,500 more in the North, these were offset by nearly the same number being resettled in 
the east. With regard to civilian casualties, the majority of those killed in the last four months had 
been civilians in the South due to terrorist suicide attacks etc.  With regard to journalists, freedom 
of speech was total, with media outlets being extremely critical of the Government in the crudest 
terms. The real danger had been for Tamil language journalists due largely to rivalries between 
Tamil groups. Former Tamil militants who had accepted previous peace agreements had been 
decimated by the LTTE when they were disarmed under the Ceasefire Agreement. These violations 
had reduced considerably in 2007, and the Government was committed to preventing them totally.   
</p>
<p>80. The Deputy Solicitor General, Mr. Yasantha Kodagoda, responding to questions raised by 
States submitted that the IIGEP was appointed by the President of Sri Lanka to observe the 
functioning of the Commission of Inquiry established to investigate and inquire into serious 
violations of human rights. The IIGEP was not established to monitor the overall situation of human 
rights in Sri Lanka. Its mandate was only to observe the functioning of the Commission of Inquiry, 
and to comment on its observance with internationally accepted norms and standards. It is 
unfortunate that certain members of the IIGEP who were seldom present at sessions of the 
Commission of Inquiry, proceeded to comment publicly on matters outside the mandate of the 
IIGEP. However, the former Chief Justice of India the Hon. Justice P.N. Bhagawatie who 
functioned as the Chairman of the IIGEP in a written communication dated 26 April 2008 stated 
that, &#8216;the IIGEP has not accused the GoSL of any lack of political will in so far as the functioning 
of the CoI is concerned. In so far as the Commission of Inquiry is concerned, it has been doing very 
good work and Members of the IIGEP have had the best of cooperation from the Chairman and </p>

 <p> 
Members of the CoI. I have no doubt that the CoI will continue to carry on its work with the same 
zeal and dedication as it has been doing so far.&#8217; Mr. Kodagoda said that the Commission of Inquiry 
continues to function independently and is presently engaged in the conduct of public inquiries into 
two high profile cases.  Mr. Kodagoda stated that the proposed new law on Victim and Witness 
Assistance and Protection has received constitutional clearance from the Supreme Court and is now 
before Parliament. Once enacted it will put in place a legislative framework to provide assistance 
and protection to not only victims of conventional crimes and witnesses of such incidents, but also 
to victims of human rights violations and witnesses of such violations. The proposed law will also 
establish a mechanism for compensation to victims of crime and facilitate the providing of 
treatment, including medical treatment, rehabilitation and counselling.  
</p>
<p>81. To conclude the interactive dialogue, the Human Rights Minister Hon. Mahinda 
Samarasinghe said Sri Lanka would continue to work with the OHCHR   Sri Lanka is a multi 
cultural, multi lingual, multi ethnic and multi religious society. The Government of Sri Lanka will 
continue its efforts to secure unity amongst all people of Sri Lanka and harness their contribution to 
the national reconstruction and development efforts and to the final objective of achieving lasting 
peace. The Minister thanked the President of the Working Group and the representatives of States 
members and observers of the Council for their participation in the review, and for comments and 
recommendations made.
