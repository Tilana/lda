Nation Energy Inc.
(A Development Stage Company)
Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Unaudited)
December 31, 2010
Note 1.  Basis of Presentation
The accompanying unaudited ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America for interim ﬁnancial information.  They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for complete ﬁnancial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included in the accompanying unaudited ﬁnancial
statements.  Operating results for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.  For
further information, refer to the ﬁnancial statements and notes thereto, included in the Company’s Form 10‐K as of and for the year ended March
31, 2010 (“The Annual Report”).
Eﬀective June 1, 2008, the Company sold all of its oil and gas properties in the Smoky Hill area of Alberta and is currently reviewing other
prospects.  To implement any new business plan, signiﬁcant ﬁnancing will be required and the Company will need to be successful in its eﬀorts to
identify, acquire and develop a new business venture.
The Company is currently in the development stage as deﬁned by Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation subtopic  915‐10 “Development Stage
Entities” (“ASC 915‐10”).  Upon the sale of all of its oil and gas assets, the Company re‐entered the development stage eﬀective June 1, 2008.
Consequently, its operations are subject to all the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise.  For the period from inception
through June 1, 2008, the Company has an accumulated (deﬁcit) of ($6,839,714) and a (deﬁcit) accumulated during the development stage of
($610,876), for the period from June 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010.
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassiﬁed for comparative purposes.
Note 2.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements
With the exception of those stated below, there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements
compared to the recent accounting pronouncements described in the Annual Report that are of material signiﬁcance, or have potential material
signiﬁcance, to the Company.
In April 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2010‐12. “Income Taxes” (Topic
740). ASU No.2010‐12 amends FASB Accounting Standards Codiﬁcation (“ASC”) subtopic 740‐10 “Income Taxes” to include paragraph 740‐10‐
S99‐4. On March 30, 2010 The President signed the “Health Care & Education Aﬀordable Care Act” reconciliation bill that amends its previous Act
signed on March 23, 2010.  ASC topic 740 requires the measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets to be based on provisions of
enacted tax law.  The eﬀects of  future changes in tax laws are not anticipated.  Therefore, the diﬀerent enactment dates of  this Act and
reconciliation measure may aﬀect registrants with a period‐end that falls between March 23, 2010 (enactment date of this Act), and March 30,
2010 (enactment date of the reconciliation measure). However, the announcement states that the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)
would not object if such registrants were to account for the enactment of both the Act and the reconciliation measure in a period ending on or
after March 23, 2010, but notes that the SEC staﬀ “does not believe that it would be appropriate for registrants to analogize to this view in any
other fact patterns.” The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s ﬁnancial position and results of operations.
In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010‐14, "Accounting for Extractive Activities — Oil & Gas."  ASU 2010‐14 amends paragraph 932‐10‐S99‐1 due
to SEC Release No. 33‐8995, "Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting”.  The amendments to the guidance on oil and gas accounting are eﬀective
August 31, 2010, and did not have a signiﬁcant impact on the Company's ﬁnancial position, as eﬀective June 1, 2008, the Company sold its oil and
gas properties in the Smoky Hill Area of Alberta, Canada (see Note 5).
In May 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010‐19 (ASU 2010‐19), “Foreign Currency (Topic 830): Foreign Currency Issues: Multiple Foreign Currency
Exchange Rates”. The amendments in this update are eﬀective as of the announcement date of March 18, 2010. Adoption of the provisions of
ASU 2010‐19 did not have a material eﬀect on the ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows of the Company.
On August 2, 2010, the FASB issued ASU 2010‐21, “Accounting for Technical Amendments to Various SEC Rules and Schedules—Amendments to
SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Release No. 33‐9026: Technical Amendments to Rules, Forms, Schedules and Codiﬁcation of Financial Reporting
Policies.” The ASU reﬂects changes made by the SEC in Final Rulemaking Release No. 33‐9026, which was issued in April 2009 and amended SEC
requirements in Regulation S‐X (17 CFR 210.1‐01 et seq.) and Regulation S‐K (17 CFR 229.10 et seq.) and made changes to ﬁnancial reporting
requirements in response to the FASB's issuance of SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations” (ASC 805), and SFAS No. 160 “Noncontrolling
Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51” (FASB ASC 810 ). Adoption of the provisions of ASU 2010‐21 did
not have a material impact on our ﬁnancial statements.
The   FASB   issued   ASU   2010‐29   “Business   Combinations   (Topic   805):   Disclosure   of   Supplementary   Pro   Forma   Information   for   Business
Combinations”, eﬀective for periods beginning on or after December 15, 2010.  This amendment aﬀects any public entity as deﬁned by Topic 805,
“Business Combinations” that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis.  The comparative ﬁnancial
statements should present and disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred in the
current period has occurred as of  the beginning of  the comparable prior annual reporting period only.    The amendment also  expands the
supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material, non‐recurring pro forma adjustments directly
7 of 22
6/23/2011 14:01
attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings.  The adoption of ASU 2010‐29 did not have a
material impact on our ﬁnancial statements.
There were various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to
speciﬁc industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's  ﬁnancial position, results of operations or cash ﬂows.
Note 3.  Going Concern
The accompanying ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The Company has incurred (losses) from inception through June
1, 2008 of ($6,839,714) and further losses of ($610,876) during the development stage.   The Company has working capital and stockholders’
(deﬁcits) of ($837,477) at December 31, 2010, and working capital and stockholders’ (deﬁcits) of ($613,996), respectively, at March 31, 2010. The
Company is reliant on raising capital to initiate its business plan.  The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon being
able to secure ﬁnancing and attain proﬁtable operations.
The ﬁnancial statements do not include any adjustments to reﬂect the possible future eﬀects on the recoverability and classiﬁcation of assets or
the amounts and classiﬁcation of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Note 4.  Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the
period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding.
Note 5.   Oil and Gas Properties
On September 18, 2008, Nation and Netco Energy, Inc. (“Netco”), entered into a sales and purchase agreement to sell their assets in the Smoky
Area of Alberta, to Encana Corporation (“Encana”) for total net proceeds of CDN $1,600,000.  The agreement was eﬀective June 1, 2008.  The
sale of the oil and gas assets closed September 18, 2008, with a second closing in April 2009, for total net proceeds to Nation of CDN $1,102,939
(US $1,029,385) from Encana, plus CDN $160,000 (US $129,325) from Netco.  The Company is now considered a shell company.  In April 2009, the
Company received its ﬁnal payment from Encana pursuant to the sale of its oil and gas properties, of CDN $105,894 (US $88,689).
Note 6.  Related Party Transactions
During March 2002, the Company entered into a verbal agreement with a related party, Caravel Management Corp (“Caravel”) in which Caravel
will provide management services on a month‐to‐month basis.  On January 1, 2009, the Company revised the previous verbal agreement with
Caravel.  The agreement provided for management and administrative services, oﬃce rent and supplies for $8,258 per month. On November 1,
2010, the Company revised its written administrative agreement with Caravel.  The agreement now provides for administrative services, oﬃce
rent and supplies for $3,500 per month.   Caravel is wholly owned by the Company’s sole oﬃcer and director. Total expenses recognized under
this agreement for the nine months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 were $64,922 and $74,324, respectively.
On March 31, 2006, we entered into a revised loan agreement with a related party.  The loan bears interest at 15% per annum, calculated and
compounded monthly and is payable quarterly.  Any principal amount outstanding under the loan is payable upon demand.  The loan payable is in
Canadian dollars and is secured by a Promissory Note.
During the nine months ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company received cash proceeds of $73,662 and $Nil, received non‐cash
advances of $21,530 and $Nil, and made principal payments of $Nil and $53,190, respectively, related to this obligation.  As of December 31,
2010, the balance of the loan and accrued interest payable was CDN $659,093 (US $662,671) compared to CDN $510,239 (US $502,402) at March
31, 2010.

Sale of Bolton Property
On September 18, 2008, Nation Energy, Netco Energy Inc., and Encana Corporation (“Encana”) entered into a Petroleum, Natural Gas and Related
Rights Conveyance pursuant to which Nation and Netco sold all of their interests in the leases and lands comprising the Bolton Property to
Encana.  As a condition of the agreement, Encana agreed to terminate the payable owing by Nation to Encana as successor in interest to Churchill
Energy (as successor to Accrete Energy, Olympia Energy’s successor) pursuant to a participation agreement between the parties dated November

6/23/2011 14:01
21, 2001.  In connection with the sale of the Bolton properties on September 26, 2008 we entered into a termination agreement with Encana
pursuant to which we agreed to terminate the Joint Operating Agreement between Nation, High Point Resources Inc. and Churchill Energy (as
Olympia Energy’s successor) eﬀective June 1, 2008 and assigned all of our rights under all operating contracts relating to the Bolton Property to
Encana.  The sale of the oil and gas assets closed on September 30, 2008 with a second closing in April 2009 for total net proceeds to Nation of
CDN $1,262,939 (US $1,158,710).
The proceeds of the sale of the Bolton Property were used to partially repay amounts owed to Caravel Management Corp. (“Caravel”)  under a
promissory note dated March 31, 2006 in the original amount of CDN $980,905 (US $840,464), including principal, interest and accounts payable.
 Caravel is a private management services company which is wholly‐owned by our sole director and oﬃcer.  As of December 31, 2010, our
balance to Caravel under this obligation was CDN $659,093 (US $662,671).
Our Current Business
We currently have no business and operate as a shell company.  We are in the process of evaluating the merits of joint venture opportunities in
the resource sector.
General
The following is a discussion and analysis of our plan of operation for the nine month period ended December 31, 2010, and the factors that
could aﬀect our future ﬁnancial condition.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited ﬁnancial statements
and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report.
Plan of Operation
For the next twelve months we plan to continue to evaluate joint venture opportunities and oil and gas development and production
opportunities.
Cash Requirements During the Next Twelve Months
Over the next twelve months we intend to use funds to evaluate new business acquisitions, as follows:
General and Administrative
 
Professional Fees
 
 
Total
$70,000
60,000
$130,000
We have suﬀered recurring losses from operations since inception.  The continuation of our company as a going concern is dependent upon our
company attaining and maintaining proﬁtable operations and raising additional capital as needed.  Management’s plan in this regard is to raise
additional capital through a debt or an equity oﬀering.  The ﬁnancial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery and
classiﬁcation of recorded asset amounts or the amount and classiﬁcation of liabilities that might be necessary should our company discontinue
operations.
Due to the uncertainty of our ability to meet our current operating expenses noted above, in their report on the annual ﬁnancial statements for
the year ended March 31, 2010, our independent auditors included an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as
a going concern.  Our ﬁnancial statements contain additional note disclosure describing the circumstances that lead to this disclosure by our
independent auditors.
The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further ﬁnancing, a successful program of exploration, and, ﬁnally achieving a
proﬁtable level of operations.  The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a signiﬁcant dilution in the equity interests of our
current stockholders.  Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash
commitments.
There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations.  We are pursuing various ﬁnancing
alternatives to meet our immediate and long‐term ﬁnancial requirements.  There can be no assurance that additional ﬁnancing will be available
to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.  If we are not able to obtain the additional
ﬁnancing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they
become due.  In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.
Disclosure of Outstanding Share Data
At the date of this quarterly report, we had 16,020,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.  We do not have any warrants, options or
share of any other class issued and outstanding as at the date of this quarterly report.

The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited ﬁnancial statements for the quarter ended
December 31, 2010, which are included herein.
Our operating results for the three months ended December 31, 2010, for the three months ended December 31, 2009 and the changes between
those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:

We generated a net (loss) of ($71,658) for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to a net (loss) of ($45,400) for the three months
ended December 31, 2009. The increase in losses was mainly attributable to an increase in general and administration expenses for the current
period.  While administration and oﬃce fees decreased, legal and accounting fees and ﬁling fees all increased due to increased ﬁnancial
statement ﬁlings in the current period. Net (loss) per common share was $Nil for both the three months ended December 31, 2010 and December
31, 2009.
Interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2010 totalled $23,007 compared to $16,826 for the three months ended December
31, 2009.  The increase in interest expense reﬂected higher loan balances in the quarter ended December 31, 2010 compared to the loan balances
at December 31, 2009.
We reported a foreign currency translation (loss) of ($21,484) for the three months ended December 31, 2010 compared to a translation (loss) of
($11,129) during the three month period ended December 31, 2009.  In addition to our loan and accrued interest, a portion of our expenses are
incurred in Canadian dollars while the reporting currency is the US dollar.  The rise in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar
during the current period resulted in a foreign currency translation (loss) primarily as a result of our loans payable being due in Canadian dollars
for the period ended December 31, 2010.  During the quarter ended December 31, 2010 the Canadian dollar strengthened slightly resulting in a
decrease in the (loss) on translation for the period then ended.
The major components of our general and administrative expenses for the three month period are outlined in the table below:

General and administrative expenses increased to $48,651 for the three months ended December 31, 2010 from $28,574 for the three months
ended December 31, 2009.  The increase of $20,077 in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal, accounting,
transfer agent and ﬁling fee expenses during the current period as a result of increased ﬁnancial statement ﬁlings with the SEC.  General expenses
included administration fees that decreased to $15,102 for the period ending December 31, 2010 compared to $24,775 for the three month
period ended December 31 2009.  Oﬃce and Management Information System fees decreased slightly from $1,123 in the quarter ended
December 31, 2009 to $739 in the same period ended December 31, 2010.  Legal fees increased signiﬁcantly during the three month period to
$4,135 for the three months ended December 31, 2010 from $176 in the three months ended December 31, 2009.  The increase in legal fees was
due to more legal reviews of our ﬁnancial statement ﬁlings with the SEC during the current period.  Accounting fees also increased for the period

6/23/2011 14:01
ended December 31, 2010 to $18,400 from $2,500 for the three month period ended December 31, 2009 as a result of the increase in accounting
reviews due to the catch up of our ﬁnancial statement ﬁlings.
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended December 31, 2010 and 2009
The following summary of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited ﬁnancial statements for the quarter ended
December 31, 2010, which are included herein.
Our operating results for the nine months ended December 31, 2010, for the nine months ended December 31, 2009 and the changes between
those periods for the respective items are summarized as follows:

We generated a net (loss) of ($208,457) for the nine months ended December 31, 2010 compared to a net (loss) of ($134,303) for the nine months
ended December 31, 2009.  The increase in general and administrative expenses, see below explanation, was the primary reason for the increased
losses in the current period.  Net (loss) per common share was $(0.01) for both the nine months ended December 31, 2010 and December 31,
2009.   Interest expense for the nine months ended December 31, 2010 totalled $62,152 compared to $47,650 for the nine months ended
December 31, 2009.  The increase reﬂected higher loan balances in the nine months ended December 31, 2010.
We reported a foreign currency translation (loss) of ($15,024) for the nine months ended December 31, 2010 compared to a (loss) of ($65,418)
during the same nine month period in ﬁscal 2010.  The unrealized foreign exchange (loss) decreased due to the stabilization of the value of the
Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar.  The unrealized foreign exchange loss is based on the revaluation of the Canadian dollar loan and
interest payable.

General and administrative expenses increased to $146,305 for the nine months ended December 31, 2010 from$86,653 in the nine months
ended December 31, 2009.  General expenses included administration fees decreasing to $64,922 for the period ended December 31, 2010 from
$74,324 for the nine month period ended December 31, 2009.  The decrease was due to the monthly administration charge decreasing eﬀective
November 1, 2010 to $3,500 from $8,258 per month.  Oﬃce and Management Information System fees decreased from $2,696 in the nine
months ended December 31, 2009 to $2,222 in the same period ended December 31, 2010.   As a result of increased ﬁnancial statement ﬁlings
during the current period, legal fees, accounting fees and ﬁling fees all rose substantially.  Legal fees increased substantially to $15,837 for the
nine months ended December 31, 2010 from $626 in the nine months ended December 31, 2009.  Filing fees and transfer agent fees amounted to
$25,174 a substantial increase compared to $523 for the nine months ended December 31, 2009.  Accounting fees rose to $38,150 from $8,484 in
the nine months ended December 31, 2009.

Net cash (used in) operating activities was $(60,996) during the nine months ended December 31, 2010, compared with net cash provided by
operating activities of $7,402 in the same period in 2009.  The increase in cash (used in) operating activities of $(92,855) is mainly attributed to a
decrease in accounts payable, and increased operating losses in the current period.  Net (loss) for the nine month period ended December 31,
2010 was ($208,457) versus a net (loss) of ($134,303) for the nine months ended December 31, 2009.
Investing Activities
Net cash provided by investing activities decreased to $Nil for the nine months ended December 31, 2010 compared to net cash provided by
investing activities of $88,689 for the nine months ended December 31, 2009.  The cash provided relates to proceeds from the sale of our oil and
gas property in the prior period ended December 31, 2009.
Financing Activities
Net cash provided by ﬁnancing activities was $73,661 in the nine months ended December 31, 2010 compared to net cash (used in) ﬁnancing
activities of ($53,190) in the same period in 2009.  The diﬀerence resulted from payments made on our loan payable to related party in ﬁscal
2010 totalling $53,190 compared to proceeds drawn on our loan payable of $73,661 during the same period ended December 31, 2010.
Loans Payable
On March 31, 2006, we entered into a revised loan agreement with a related party.  The loan bears interest at 15% per annum, calculated and
compounded monthly and payable quarterly.  Any principal amount outstanding under the loan is payable upon demand.  The loan payable is in
Canadian dollars and is secured by a Promissory Note.  As of December 31, 2010, the balance of the loan and accrued interest payable was CDN
$659,093 (US $662,671) compared to CDN $510,239 (US $502,402) at March 31, 2010.   During the nine months ended December 31, 2010, we
borrowed an additional CDN $85,094 (US $83,270 ‐ $62,240 cash, $21,030 non‐cash) compared to payments totalling CDN $60,603 (US $53,190)
applied on the loan principal for the prior period ended December 31, 2009.  Subsequent to December 31, 2010 we borrowed an aggregate total
of CDN $56,470 (US $48,331) during the period ended May 31, 2011.  The loan balance plus accrued interest (including the eﬀects of additional
interest accruals and foreign currency translation adjustments through May 31, 2011) totalled CDN $738,250 (US $749,910) at May 31, 2011.
Going Concern
The audited ﬁnancial statements accompanying our annual report on Form 10‐K for the year ended March 31, 2010 have been prepared on a
going concern basis, which implies that our company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities and commitments in the normal
course of business.  Our company has incurred losses since inception in excess of $7.45 million and had only generated modest proﬁtable
operations when we commenced gas production in ﬁscal 2006.   We have relied solely on shareholder advances to participate and continue
operations, since we sold our oil and gas properties eﬀective June 1, 2008.
Our company’s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon being able to secure ﬁnancing and attain proﬁtable operations.  Our
13 of 22
6/23/2011 14:01
company is currently evaluating business opportunities and will require ﬁnancing for the acquisition of any new business venture.
We entered into bridge loan agreements with a related party in 2003 and 2004 to fund operations.  The terms of these bridge loan agreements
provided that any principal amount outstanding is payable upon demand and bears interest at 15% per annum, payable quarterly.  On March 31,
2006, we consolidated and restructured our loans with the related party.  As part of the restructuring, we borrowed an additional CDN $250,000
(US $203,932).  The new loan bears interest at 15% per annum, calculated and compounded monthly and is payable quarterly.  Any principal
amount outstanding under the loan is payable upon demand.  The loan is payable in Canadian dollars and is secured by a Promissory Note.  At
December 31, 2010 the balance of the principal and accrued interest was CDN $659,093 (US $662,671).
During the nine months ended December 31, 2010, we borrowed a total of CDN $85,094 (US $83,270 ‐ $62,240 cash, $21,030 non‐cash).  The
balances outstanding under the loan agreement totalled CDN $659,093 (US $662,671) at December 31, 2010 versus an aggregate of CDN
$510,239 (US $502,402) at March 31, 2010.  At March 31, 2011 the balance of the principal and accrued interest was CDN $707,991 (US
$728,535), as discussed, including the eﬀects of additional interest accruals and foreign currency translation adjustments.
We have limited operating history.  We can only estimate future needs for capital based on the current status of our operation, our current plans
and current economic condition.  Due to the uncertainties regarding our future activities, we are unable to predict precisely what amount will be
used for any particular purpose.
Future Financings
As of March 31, 2011, we had cash of $9,376.  We currently do not have suﬃcient funds to acquire and develop any future joint ventures.  We
anticipate continuing to rely on shareholder loans or equity sales of our common stock in order to fund our business operations.   Issuances of
additional shares will result in dilution to our existing stockholders.  There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity
or arrange for more debt or other ﬁnancing to fund any future activities.
Oﬀ‐Balance Sheet Arrangements
We have no  oﬀ‐balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future eﬀect on our ﬁnancial condition,
changes in ﬁnancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to
stockholders.
ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLSOURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
Not Applicable.
ITEM 4 (T).   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
As required by Rule 13a‐15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, our principal executive oﬃcer and ﬁnancial oﬃcer evaluated our company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as deﬁne in Rules 13a‐15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by
this report.  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive oﬃcer and ﬁnancial oﬃcer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by
this report, these disclosure controls and procedures were not eﬀective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by our company
in reports it ﬁles or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
speciﬁed in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to
our company’s management, including our principal executive oﬃcer and ﬁnancial oﬃcer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
 The conclusion that our disclosure controls and procedures were not eﬀective was due to the presence of the following material weaknesses in
internal control over ﬁnancial reporting which are indicative of many small companies with small staﬀ:  (i) lack of a suﬃcient number of
independent directors for our board and audit committee.  We currently have no independent director on our board, which is comprised of one
director.  As a publicly‐traded company, we strive to have a majority of our board of directors be independent; (ii) inadequate segregation of
duties and eﬀective risk assessment; and (iii) insuﬃcient written policies and procedures for accounting and ﬁnancial reporting with respect to the
requirements and application of both United States generally accepted accounting principles and Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.
 Management anticipates that such disclosure controls and procedures will not be eﬀective until the material weaknesses are remediated.
We plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal controls over ﬁnancial reporting.  During the period covered by this
quarterly report on Form 10Q, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identiﬁed above.  To remediate such weaknesses,
we plan to implement the following changes during our ﬁscal year ending March 31, 2012, subject to obtaining additional ﬁnancing:  (i) appoint
qualiﬁed personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineﬀective risk management; and (ii) adopt suﬃcient written policies and
procedures for accounting and ﬁnancial reporting.  The remediation eﬀorts set out above are largely dependent upon our securing additional
ﬁnancing to cover the costs of implementing the changes required.  If we are unsuccessful in securing such funds, remediation eﬀorts may be
adversely aﬀected in a material manner.
It should be noted that while our management believes our disclosure controls and procedures provide a reasonable level of assurance, they do
not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how
well conceived or operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the
design of a control system must reﬂect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the beneﬁts of controls must be considered relative to
their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control
issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
14 of 22
6/23/2011 14:01
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls.  The design of any system of
internal control is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design
will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   Because of the inherent limitations in a cost‐eﬀective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
There were no changes in our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting during the three month period ended December 31, 2010 that have
materially aﬀected or are reasonably likely to materially aﬀect, our internal control over ﬁnancial reporting.
PART II
OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiﬀ in any material proceeding
or pending litigation.  There are no proceedings in which any of our director and oﬃcer or aﬃliates, or any registered or beneﬁcial stockholder is
an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.
ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS
Much of the information included in this quarterly report includes or is based upon estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements". 
Such forward looking statements include any projections or estimates made by us and our management in connection with our past or future
business operations.  While these forward‐looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and
reﬂect our current judgement regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any
estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested herein.
Such estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements" involve various risks and uncertainties as outlined below.  We caution the
reader that important factors in some cases have aﬀected and, in the future, could materially aﬀect actual results and cause actual results to
diﬀer materially from the results expressed in any such estimates, projections or other "forward looking statements".
Our shares of common stock are considered speculative while we continue our search for a new business opportunity.  Prospective investors
should consider carefully the risk factors set out below.
Because of the early stage of development and the nature of our business, our securities are considered highly speculative.
Our securities must be considered highly speculative, generally because of the nature of our business and the early stage of our development. We
were engaged in the business of exploring and, if warranted, developing commercial reserves of oil and gas. Our properties were in the
exploration, development and production stage and had proven reserves of oil and gas as of June 30, 2007. Accordingly, we realized limited
revenues and proﬁt from our operations. Eﬀective June 1, 2008, our oil and gas properties were sold and the Company re‐entered the
Development Stage.  Any proﬁtability in the future will be dependent upon acquiring a new business opportunity.
The Company is categorized as a “shell company” as that term is used in the Commission’s rules.
The Commission’s rules prohibit the use of Form S‐8 by a shell company, and require a shell company to ﬁle a Form 8‐K to report the same type of
information that would be required if it were ﬁling to register a class of securities under the Exchange Act whenever the shell company is
reporting the event that caused it to cease being a shell company. Being a shell company may adversely impact our ability to oﬀer our stock to
oﬃcers, directors and consultants, and thereby make it more diﬃcult to attract and retain qualiﬁed individuals to perform services for the
Company, and will likely increase the costs of registration compliance following the completion of a business combination.
A decline in the price of our common stock could aﬀect our ability to raise further working capital and adversely impact our operations.
A prolonged decline in the price of our common stock could result in a reduction in the liquidity of our common stock and a reduction in our
ability to raise capital.  Any reduction in our ability to raise equity capital in the future could have a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect on our business
plans and our ability to develop new products.  If our stock price declines, we may not be able to raise additional capital suﬃcient to acquire new
business.
Our accounts are subject to currency ﬂuctuations which may materially aﬀect our ﬁnancial position and results of operations.
We maintain our accounts in US and Canadian currencies and are therefore subject to currency ﬂuctuations and such ﬂuctuations may materially
aﬀect our ﬁnancial position and results of operations. We do not engage in currency hedging activities.
We may not be able to manage the signiﬁcant strains that future growth may place on our administration infrastructure, systems and controls.
In the event we are able to acquire a new joint venture and experience any rapid expansion over current levels, we could experience rapid growth
in revenues, personnel, complexity of administration and in other areas.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage the signiﬁcant
strains that future growth may place on our administrative infrastructure, systems, and controls.  If we are unable to manage future growth
eﬀectively, our business, operating results and ﬁnancial condition may be materially adversely aﬀected.

The loss of John Hislop would have an adverse impact on future development and could impair our ability to succeed.
We are dependent on our ability to hire and retain highly skilled and qualiﬁed personnel. We face competition for qualiﬁed personnel from
numerous industry sources, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain qualiﬁed personnel on acceptable terms. We
do not have key man insurance on our employees. The loss of service of Mr. Hislop could have a material adverse eﬀect on our operations or
ﬁnancial condition.
Our management currently engages in other oil and gas businesses and, as a result, conﬂicts could arise.
In addition to their interest in our company, our management currently engages, and intends to engage in the future, in the oil and gas business
independently of our company. As a result, conﬂicts of interest between us and management of our company might arise.
Trading of our stock may be restricted by the SEC’s “Penny Stock” regulations which may limit a stockholder’s ability to buy and sell our stock.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally deﬁne “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a
market price (as deﬁned) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions.  Our securities
are covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker‐dealers who sell to persons other than
established customers and “accredited investors.”  The term “accredited investor” refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of
$5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse.
 The penny stock rules require a broker‐dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a
standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of
risks in the penny stock market.  The broker‐dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and oﬀer quotations for the penny stock, the
compensation of the broker‐dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each
penny stock held in the customer’s account.  The bid and oﬀer quotations, and the broker‐dealer and sales person compensation information,
must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to eﬀecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with
the customer’s conﬁrmation.  In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from
these rules; the broker‐dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and
receive the purchaser’s written agreement to the transaction.  These disclosure requirements may have the eﬀect of reducing the level of trading
activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules.  Consequently, these penny stock rules may aﬀect the
ability of broker‐dealers to trade our securities.  We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in and limit the marketability
of our common stock.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted sales practice requirements which may also limit a stockholder’s ability to buy
and sell our stock.
In addition to the “penny stock” rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer,
a broker‐dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer.  Prior to recommending speculative
low priced securities to their non‐institutional customers, broker‐dealers must make reasonable eﬀorts to obtain information about the
customer’s ﬁnancial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information.  Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that
there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers.  FINRA requirements make it
more diﬃcult for broker‐dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock
and have an adverse eﬀect on the market for our shares.
Since our shares are thinly traded, and trading on the OTC Bulletin Board may be limited and sporadic because it is not an exchange, stockholders
may have diﬃculty reselling their shares or liquidating their investments.
Our shares of common stock are currently listed for public trading on the Pink OTC Markets Inc.   The trading price of our shares of common stock
has been subject to wide ﬂuctuations.  Trading prices of our shares of common stock may ﬂuctuate in response to a number of factors, many of
which will be beyond our control.  The stock market has generally experienced extreme price and volume ﬂuctuations that have often been
unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies with no current business operation.  There can be no assurance that
trading prices and price earnings ratios previously experienced by our shares of common stock will be matched or maintained.  These broad
market and industry factors may adversely aﬀect the market price of our shares of common stock, regardless of our operating performance.
In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class‐action litigation has often been instituted. 
Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs for us and a diversion of management's attention and resources.
Our By‐laws contain provisions indemnifying our oﬃcers and directors against all costs, charges and expenses incurred by them.
Our By‐laws contain provisions with respect to the indemniﬁcation of our oﬃcers and directors against all costs, charges and expenses, including
an amount paid to settle an action or satisfy a judgment, actually and reasonably incurred by him, including an amount paid to settle an action or
satisfy a judgement in a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding to which he is made a party by reason of his being or having been
one of our directors or oﬃcers to  the maximum extent permitted by Wyoming law.
Insofar as indemniﬁcation for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, oﬃcers and controlling persons of
our company under Wyoming law or otherwise, we have been advised that the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission is that such
indemniﬁcation is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable.
Investors’ interests in our company will be diluted and investors may suﬀer dilution in their net book value per share if we issue additional shares or
16 of 22
6/23/2011 14:01
raise funds through the sale of equity securities.
Our constating documents authorize the issuance of 50,000,000 shares of common stock, each with a par value of $0.001.  In the event that we
are required to issue any additional shares or enter into private placements to raise ﬁnancing through the sale of equity securities, investors'
interests in our company will be diluted and investors may suﬀer dilution in their net book value per share depending on the price at which such
securities are sold.  If we issue any such additional shares, such issuances also will cause a reduction in the proportionate ownership and voting
power of all other shareholders.  Further, any such issuance may result in a change in our control.
Our by‐laws do not contain anti‐takeover provisions which could result in a change of our management and directors if there is a take‐over of our
company.
We do not currently have a shareholder rights plan or any anti‐takeover provisions in our By‐laws.  Without any anti‐takeover provisions, there is
no deterrent for a take‐over of our company, which may result in a change in our management and directors.
Since our director and officer is not a resident of the United States, investors may find it difficult to enforce, within the United States, any
judgments obtained against our company or our director and officer.
We do not currently maintain a permanent place of business within the United States. In addition, our director and oﬃcer is not a resident of the
United States.  As a result, it may be diﬃcult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against our company or our
oﬃcers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state
thereof.
Risks Relating to the Industry
As our properties were primarily in the exploration and, development stage there can be no assurance that we will establish further commercial
discoveries.
Exploration for economic reserves of oil and gas is subject to a number of risk factors.  While the rewards to an investor can be substantial if an
economically viable discovery is made, few of the properties that are explored are ultimately developed into producing oil and/or gas wells.
 There can be no assurance that we will establish further commercial discoveries.
A decline in oil and natural gas prices would have an adverse impact on our operations.
Our revenues, cash ﬂows and proﬁtability were substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas.  In recent years, oil and
natural gas prices and, therefore, the level of drilling, exploration, development and production, have been extremely volatile.  Any signiﬁcant or
extended decline in oil or natural gas prices would have a material adverse eﬀect on our business, ﬁnancial condition and results of operations
and could impair access to future sources of capital.  Volatility in the oil and natural gas industry results from numerous factors, over which we
have no control, including:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
·
the level of oil and natural gas prices, expectations about future oil and natural gas prices and the ability of international cartels to set
and maintain production levels and prices;
the cost of exploring for, producing and transporting oil and natural gas;
the domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas;
domestic and foreign governmental regulation;
the level and price of foreign oil and natural gas transportation;
available pipeline and other oil and natural gas transportation capacity;
weather conditions;
international political, military, regulatory and economic conditions;
the level of consumer demand;
the price and the availability of alternative fuels;
the eﬀect of worldwide energy conservation measures; and
the ability of oil and natural gas companies to raise capital.
Signiﬁcant declines in oil and natural gas prices for an extended period may:
·
·
impair our ﬁnancial condition, liquidity, ability to ﬁnance future plans;
reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we could produce economically;
17 of 22
6/23/2011 14:01
·
·
·
cause us to delay or postpone some of our capital projects;
reduce our revenues, operating income and cash ﬂow; and
reduce the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties.
No assurance can be given that current levels of oil and natural gas prices will continue.  We expect oil and natural gas prices, as well as the oil
and natural gas industry generally, to continue to be volatile.
Continued ﬁnancial success depends on our ability to replace our reserves in the future.
Our future success depends upon our ability to ﬁnd, develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are proﬁtable.  Oil and natural gas are
depleting assets, and production from oil and natural gas from properties declines as reserves are depleted with the rate of decline depending on
reservoir characteristics.  If we are unable to conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved
reserves our cash ﬂows will be adversely aﬀected.  Acquiring reserves through exploration or development activities or acquisitions will require
signiﬁcant capital which may not be available to us.
Reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate.
The process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex.  It requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions,
including assumptions relating to economic factors.  Any signiﬁcant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially aﬀect
the estimated quantities and present value of  reserves shown in this annual report.   In order to prepare these estimates, we must project
production rates and timing of development expenditures.  We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering
data, and the extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary.  The process also requires economic assumptions relating to matters such as oil
and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds.
Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable
oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates.  Any signiﬁcant variance could materially aﬀect the estimated quantities and
pre‐tax net present value of reserves shown in this annual report.  In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reﬂect production
history, results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.
The potential proﬁtability of oil and gas ventures depends upon factors beyond the control of our company.
The potential proﬁtability of oil and gas properties is dependent upon many factors beyond our control.  For instance, world prices and markets
for oil and gas are unpredictable, highly volatile, potentially subject to governmental ﬁxing, pegging, controls, or any combination of these and
other factors, and respond to changes in domestic, international, political, social, and economic environments.  Additionally, due to worldwide
economic uncertainty, the availability and cost of funds for production and other expenses have become increasingly diﬃcult, if not impossible,
to project.  These changes and events may materially aﬀect our ﬁnancial performance.
Adverse weather conditions can also hinder drilling operations.  A productive well may become uneconomic in the event water or other
deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the production of oil and/or gas from the well.  In addition, production from any
well may be unmarketable if it is impregnated with water or other deleterious substances.  The marketability of oil and gas which may be acquired
or discovered will be aﬀected by numerous factors beyond our control.  These factors include the proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines
and processing equipment, market ﬂuctuations of prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, allowable production and environmental protection. The
extent of these factors cannot be accurately predicted but the combination of these factors may result in our company not receiving an adequate
return on invested capital.
Competition in the oil and gas industry is highly competitive and there is no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring desirable oil and gas
leases.
The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive. We compete with numerous individuals and companies, including many major oil and gas
companies, which have substantially greater technical, ﬁnancial and operational resources and staﬀs.  Accordingly, there is a high degree of
competition for desirable oil and gas leases, suitable properties for drilling operations and necessary drilling equipment, as well as for access to
funds.  We cannot predict if the necessary funds can be raised or that any project work will be completed.  Acreage may not become available or
if it is available for leasing we may not be successful in acquiring the leases.
The marketability of natural resources will be aﬀected by numerous factors beyond our control which may result in us not receiving an adequate
return on invested capital to be proﬁtable or viable.
The marketability of natural resources which may be acquired or discovered by us will be aﬀected by numerous factors beyond our control. 
These factors include market ﬂuctuations in oil and gas pricing and demand, the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and
processing equipment, governmental regulations, land tenure, land use, regulation concerning the importing and exporting of oil and gas and
environmental protection regulations.  The exact eﬀect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors
may result in us not receiving an adequate return on invested capital to be proﬁtable or viable.
Oil and gas operations are subject to comprehensive regulation which may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in excess of those
anticipated causing an adverse eﬀect on our company.

6/23/2011 14:01
Oil and gas operations are subject to federal and local laws relating to the protection of the environment, including laws regulating removal of
natural resources from the ground and the discharge of materials into the environment.  Oil and gas operations are also subject to federal and
local laws and regulations which seek to maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of drilling methods and
equipment.  Various permits from government bodies are required for drilling operations to be conducted; no assurance can be given that such
permits will be received.  Environmental standards imposed by federal, provincial, or local authorities may be changed and any such changes may
have material adverse eﬀects on our activities.  Moreover, compliance with such laws may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in
excess of those anticipated, thus causing an adverse eﬀect on us.
Exploration and production activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the commencement of our
operations.
In general, our exploration and production activities are subject to certain federal and local laws and regulations relating to environmental quality
and pollution control.  Such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or
continuance of a given operation.  Compliance with these laws and regulations did not had a material eﬀect on our operations or ﬁnancial
condition to date.  Legislation has been enacted which requires well and facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state
authorities.  However, such laws and regulations are frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.  Generally,
environmental requirements have not appeared to aﬀect us any diﬀerently or to any greater or lesser extent than other companies in the
industry.
We believe that our operations complied, in all material respects, with all applicable environmental regulations.
Our operating partners maintained insurance coverage customary to the industry; however, it is not fully insured against all environmental risks.
Exploratory drilling involves many risks and we may become liable for pollution or other liabilities which may have an adverse eﬀect on our
ﬁnancial position.
Drilling operations generally involve a high degree of risk.  Hazards such as unusual or unexpected geological formations, power outages, labour
disruptions, blow‐outs, sour gas leakage, ﬁre, inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labour, and other risks are
involved. We may become subject to liability for pollution or hazards against which it cannot adequately insure or which it may elect not to
insure.  Incurring any such liability may have a material adverse eﬀect on our ﬁnancial position and operations.
Any change to government regulation/administrative practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and our proﬁtability.
The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any governmental body, organization or regulatory agency in the United
States or any other jurisdiction, may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner which will fundamentally alter the ability of our company to
carry on our business.
The actions, policies or regulations, or changes thereto, of any government body or regulatory agency, or other special interest groups, may have
a detrimental eﬀect on our company.  Any or all of these situations may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and/or become
proﬁtable.
