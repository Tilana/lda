<p><b>                                            Human Rights Council 
</b> 
 
</p>
<p><b>Resolution 9/4. Human rights and unilateral coercive measures  
 
</b></p>
<p><i>The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>also all previous resolutions on human rights and unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>adopted by the Commission on Human Rights, the Council and the General Assembly, 
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming</i> its resolution 6/7 of 28 September 2007 and Assembly resolution 62/162 of 
</p>
<p>18 December 2007, 
</p>
<p>  <i>Taking note </i>of the report of the Secretary-General on this issue (A/HRC/9/2), 
</p>
<p> <i>Stressing </i>that unilateral coercive measures and legislation are contrary to international law, 
</p>
<p>international humanitarian law, the Charter of the United Nations and the norms and principles 
</p>
<p>governing peaceful relations among States,  
</p>
<p><i> Recognizing </i>the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of all 
</p>
<p>human rights and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as a universal and 
</p>
<p>inalienable right and an integral part of all human rights,  
</p>
<p><i> Expressing its concern </i>at the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures in the field of 
</p>
<p>human rights, development, international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the final document of the Fourteenth Conference of Heads of State or 
</p>
<p>Government of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in September 2006 in Havana and the final 
</p>
<p>document of the Ministerial Conference of the Non-Aligned Movement, held in Teheran in 
</p>
<p>July 2008, at which the high dignitaries of the Member States agreed to oppose and condemn 
</p>
<p>these measures or laws and their continued application, to persevere with efforts to effectively 
</p>
<p>reverse them and urged other States to do likewise, as called for by the General Assembly and </p>

 <p>other United Nations organs, and to request States applying these measures or laws to revoke 
</p>
<p>them fully and immediately,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling also </i>that the World Conference on Human Rights, held in Vienna from 14 to 
</p>
<p>25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral measure not in accordance with 
</p>
<p>international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations 
</p>
<p>among States and impedes the full realization of all human rights, and also severely threatens the 
</p>
<p>freedom of trade,  
</p>
<p><i> Deeply concerned </i>that, despite the resolutions adopted on this issue by the 
</p>
<p>General Assembly, the Council, the Commission on Human Rights and at United Nations 
</p>
<p>conferences held in the 1990s and at their five-year reviews, and contrary to norms of 
</p>
<p>international law and the Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures continue to 
</p>
<p>be promulgated, implemented and enforced, inter alia, by resorting to war and militarism, with 
</p>
<p>all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social 
</p>
<p>development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating 
</p>
<p>additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under 
</p>
<p>the jurisdiction of other States,  
</p>
<p><i> Reaffirming </i>that unilateral coercive measures are a major obstacle to the implementation of 
</p>
<p>the Declaration on the Right to Development,  
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>article 1, paragraph 2, common to the International Covenant on Civil and 
</p>
<p>Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which 
</p>
<p>provides, inter alia, that in no case may a people be deprived of its own means of subsistence,  
</p>
<p> 1. <i>Urges </i>all States to stop adopting or implementing unilateral coercive measures 
</p>
<p>not in accordance with international law, international humanitarian law, the Charter of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and the norms and principles governing peaceful relations among States, in 
</p>
<p>particular those of a coercive nature with extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade 
</p>
<p>relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal 
</p>
<p>Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments, in particular the 
</p>
<p>right of individuals and peoples to development;  </p>

 <p> 2. <i>Strongly objects </i>to the extraterritorial nature of those measures which, in addition, 
</p>
<p>threaten the sovereignty of States and, in this context, calls upon all Member States neither to 
</p>
<p>recognize these measures nor apply them, and to take effective administrative or legislative 
</p>
<p>measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral 
</p>
<p>coercive measures;  
</p>
<p> 3. <i>Condemns </i>the continued unilateral application and enforcement by certain powers of 
</p>
<p>such measures as tools of political or economic pressure against any country, particularly against 
</p>
<p>developing countries, with a view to preventing these countries from exercising their right to 
</p>
<p>decide, of their own free will, their own political, economic and social systems;  
</p>
<p> 4. <i>Reiterates its call </i>upon Member States that have initiated such measures to abide by 
</p>
<p>the principles of international law, the Charter of the United Nations, the declarations of the 
</p>
<p>United Nations and world conferences and relevant resolutions and to commit themselves to 
</p>
<p>their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to 
</p>
<p>which they are parties by putting an immediate end to such measures;  
</p>
<p> 5. <i>Reaffirms</i>, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by virtue of 
</p>
<p>which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and 
</p>
<p>cultural development;  
</p>
<p> 6. <i>Recalls </i>that, according to the Declaration on Principles of International Law 
</p>
<p>concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of 
</p>
<p>the United Nations, contained in the annex to General Assembly resolution 2625 (XXV) of 
</p>
<p>24 October 1970, and according to the relevant principles and provisions contained in the 
</p>
<p>Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States proclaimed by the Assembly in its 
</p>
<p>resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32, no State may use or 
</p>
<p>encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measure to coerce another State in 
</p>
<p>order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from 
</p>
<p>it advantages of any kind;  
</p>
<p> 7. <i>Reaffirms </i>that essential goods, such as food and medicines, should not be used as 
</p>
<p>tools for political coercion and that under no circumstances should people be deprived of their 
</p>
<p>own means of subsistence and development;  </p>

 <p> 8. <i>Underlines </i>the fact that unilateral coercive measures are one of the major obstacles 
</p>
<p>to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development and, in this regard, calls 
</p>
<p>upon all States to avoid the unilateral imposition of economic coercive measures and the 
</p>
<p>extraterritorial application of domestic laws that run counter to the principles of free trade and 
</p>
<p>hamper the development of developing countries, as recognized by the Intergovernmental Group 
</p>
<p>of Experts on the Right to Development in its report on its second session (E/CN.4/1998/29);  
</p>
<p> 9. <i>Rejects </i>all attempts to introduce unilateral coercive measures, as well as the 
</p>
<p>increasing trend in this direction, including through the enactment of laws with extraterritorial 
</p>
<p>application which are not in conformity with international law;  
</p>
<p> 10. <i>Recognizes </i>that the Declaration of Principles adopted at the first phase of the World 
</p>
<p>Summit on the Information Society, held in Geneva in December 2003, strongly urged States to 
</p>
<p>avoid and refrain from any unilateral measure in building the information society;  
</p>
<p> 11. <i>Invites </i>all special rapporteurs and existing thematic mechanisms of the Council in the 
</p>
<p>field of economic, social and cultural rights to pay due attention, within the scope of their 
</p>
<p>respective mandates, to the negative impact and consequences of unilateral coercive measures;  
</p>
<p> 12. <i>Decides </i>to give due consideration to the negative impact of unilateral coercive 
</p>
<p>measures in its task concerning the implementation of the right to development;  
</p>
<p> 13. <i>Requests</i>: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in discharging her 
</p>
<p>functions in relation to the promotion and protection of human rights, to pay due attention and 
</p>
<p>give urgent consideration to the present resolution;  
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all States 
</p>
<p>Members of the United Nations and to seek their views and information on the implications and 
</p>
<p>negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations, and to submit a report 
</p>
<p>thereon to the Council at its twelfth session;  
</p>
<p> 14. <i>Decides </i>to examine this question, on a priority basis, as appropriate, in accordance 
</p>
<p>with its annual programme of work under the same agenda item. </p>
