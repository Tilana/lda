<p><b> I. Introduction 
</b></p>
<p>1. The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, Gabriela Knaul, 
</p>
<p>visited the United Arab Emirates from 28 January to 5 February 2014 at the invitation of 
</p>
<p>the Federal Government. The purpose of the visit was to examine, in a spirit of co-operation 
</p>
<p>and dialogue, both the achievements and the shortcomings of the United Arab Emirates in 
</p>
<p>ensuring the independence of the judiciary and the free exercise of the legal profession.  
</p>
<p>2. The Special Rapporteur visited Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah and met with the 
</p>
<p>Minister of Justice and a number of senior government officials at the Federal Ministries of 
</p>
<p>Justice, the Interior, and Foreign Affairs, as well as officials at the Abu Dhabi Judicial 
</p>
<p>Department. She also met with the Chief Justice of the Federal Supreme Court and federal 
</p>
<p>judges, judges from the local judicial authorities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the Federal 
</p>
<p>Attorney General and members of the federal public prosecution, members of the public 
</p>
<p>prosecution offices of Abu Dhabi and Dubai, representatives of the Dubai Judicial Institute 
</p>
<p>and the Institute of Training and Judicial Studies in Sharjah, and lawyers. In addition, she 
</p>
<p>met with members of the diplomatic community and civil society. 
</p>
<p>3. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Government of the United Arab 
</p>
<p>Emirates for its engagement with her mandate. She notes that, as the United Arab Emirates 
</p>
<p>is a member of the Human Rights Council, the State&#8217;s cooperation with the special 
</p>
<p>procedures is essential to set a positive example. She also thanks all those who dedicated 
</p>
<p>their time to sharing their expertise and opinions with her. 
</p>
<p>4. The Special Rapporteur underlines the fact that, by inviting her to conduct an 
</p>
<p>official visit, the Government agreed to the terms of reference of such visits, which include 
</p>
<p>a guarantee that no person who has been in contact with her in relation to the visit will 
</p>
<p>suffer threats, harassment, punishment or other reprisals, or be subjected to judicial 
</p>
<p>proceedings based on their contact with her. 
</p>
<p><b> II. Justice system 
</b></p>
<p>5. The United Arab Emirates is a federal State that was formed in December 1971 
</p>
<p>when the British protectorate over the various sheikhdoms in the region ended. It comprises 
</p>
<p>seven Emirates &#8212; Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm 
</p>
<p>al-Quwain &#8212; that exercise sovereignty over their own territories in all matters that do not 
</p>
<p>fall within the jurisdiction of the Federation. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Constitutional provisions 
</b></p>
<p>6. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates was adopted on 18 July 1971 and 
</p>
<p>entered into force on 2 December of the same year. The Constitution was temporary until 
</p>
<p>constitutional amendment No. 1 of 1996 made it permanent. It does not expressly recognize 
</p>
<p>the separation of powers. 
</p>
<p>7. Judicial authority is regulated by part four, chapter V, of the Constitution, which 
</p>
<p>includes provisions recognizing the independence of judges (art. 94), establishing a Federal 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court and Federal Primary Tribunals (art. 95) and their jurisdictions (arts. 99 and 
</p>
<p>102, respectively), and stipulating the composition of the Federal Supreme Court and the 
</p>
<p>appointment of its judges (art. 96), as well as their irremovability from office (art. 97). 
</p>
<p>Chapter V also clarifies the jurisdiction of the local judicial authorities in the Emirates and 
</p>
<p>provides for the possibility of transferring all or part of their jurisdiction to the Federal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>5 
</b></p>
<p>Primary Tribunals through the enactment of specific legislation (arts. 104 and 105). 
</p>
<p>Chapter V establishes an Attorney General and the federal public prosecution (art. 106). 
</p>
<p>8. In addition, part three of the Constitution guarantees a selected list of fundamental 
</p>
<p>rights and freedoms.  
</p>
<p><b> B. Legal framework 
</b></p>
<p>9. The legal system in the United Arab Emirates is based on both civil law and sharia 
</p>
<p>(Islamic law) provisions. Sharia is recognized in the Constitution to be the main source of 
</p>
<p>legislation. Judges are bound to apply &#8220;provisions of the Islamic sharia, the federal laws 
</p>
<p>and the other laws in force in the Emirates&#8221;.1 
</p>
<p>10. Along with the relevant constitutional provisions, the federal judiciary is mainly 
</p>
<p>regulated by Federal Law No. 10 of 1973 &#8220;Concerning the Supreme Federal Court&#8221; (as 
</p>
<p>amended); Federal Law No. 6 of 1978 &#8220;On the establishment of Federal Courts and 
</p>
<p>transferral of the jurisdiction of the local judicial authorities in some Emirates to them&#8221; (as 
</p>
<p>amended); and Federal Law No. 3 of 1983 &#8220;Concerning the Federal Judicial Corps&#8221; (as 
</p>
<p>amended). 
</p>
<p>11. Federal Law No. 10 of 1973 sets out the organization of the Federal Supreme Court, 
</p>
<p>its composition and jurisdiction, and establishes a constitutional chamber. It also sets out 
</p>
<p>the recruitment conditions, appointment, tenure and retirement age of the judges; the role of 
</p>
<p>the president; and the accountability of judges, as well as disciplinary procedures and 
</p>
<p>sanctions. It regulates the composition, hierarchy and jurisdiction of the federal public 
</p>
<p>prosecution; the recruitment conditions, appointment, transfer and retirement age of 
</p>
<p>prosecutors; and the rules of procedure of the Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>12. Federal Law No. 6 of 1978 created the Federal Courts of First Instance and Appeal 
</p>
<p>and transferred the jurisdiction of existing local judicial authorities in the Emirates of 
</p>
<p>Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain to those Federal Courts. The law defines the 
</p>
<p>competence and jurisdiction of Federal First Instance Courts in criminal, civil, commercial, 
</p>
<p>personal status and administrative matters. It also establishes the supervision of the Federal 
</p>
<p>Courts by the Minister of Justice. 
</p>
<p>13. Federal Law No. 3 of 1983 sets out, inter alia, the court structure; the composition of 
</p>
<p>Federal Courts of First instance and Appeal; the composition and competence of the 
</p>
<p>Supreme Council of the Federal Judiciary; the recruitment conditions, appointment, 
</p>
<p>promotion, transfer, tenure and retirement age of judges; and the independence, duties and 
</p>
<p>accountability of judges, as well as disciplinary procedures and sanctions. It also regulates 
</p>
<p>the federal public prosecution, established as a body under the direct supervision and 
</p>
<p>control of the Minister of Justice. It determines the composition and hierarchy of the public 
</p>
<p>prosecution; the recruitment conditions, appointment, promotion, tenure and retirement age 
</p>
<p>of prosecutors; and the duties and accountability of prosecutors, as well as disciplinary 
</p>
<p>procedures and sanctions. It creates a Judicial Inspection Department in the Ministry of 
</p>
<p>Justice to probe the work of judges of the Federal Courts of First Instance and Appeal and 
</p>
<p>of the members of the public prosecution. 
</p>
<p>14. The rights and duties of lawyers are defined in Federal Law No. 23 of 1991 
</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding the regulation of the legal profession&#8221; (as amended), which also governs the 
</p>
<p>conditions for admission and registration as a practising lawyer, and disciplinary 
</p>
<p>  
 1 Federal Law No. 10 of 1973, article 75; see also Federal Law No. 3 of 1983, article 1. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>6</b>  
</p>
<p>proceedings and sanctions against lawyers. The law also establishes a seven-member 
</p>
<p>Council for the Admission of Lawyers before the Courts. 
</p>
<p>15. The legal framework also includes the Penal Code (Federal Law No. 3 of 1987, as 
</p>
<p>amended) and the Civil Code (Federal Law No. 5 of 1985, as amended); the Code of 
</p>
<p>Criminal Procedure (Federal Law No. 35 of 1992, as amended) and the Code of Civil 
</p>
<p>Procedure (Federal Law No. 11 of 1992, as amended); Federal Law No. 17 of 1978 &#8220;On the 
</p>
<p>regulation of the instances and procedures of appeal in cassation before the Federal 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court&#8221;; and a series of federal laws establishing Federal Courts of First Instance 
</p>
<p>and Appeal in Emirates and cities other than the capital city, Abu Dhabi. 
</p>
<p>16. At the international level, the United Arab Emirates is a State party to several human 
</p>
<p>rights treaties, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
</p>
<p>against Women and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or 
</p>
<p>Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>17. At the regional level, the United Arab Emirates ratified the Arab Charter on Human 
</p>
<p>Rights in 2008. The Charter contains a comprehensive set of binding provisions relevant to 
</p>
<p>the mandate of the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Court structure 
</b></p>
<p>18. Prior to the formation of the United Arab Emirates, each of the seven Emirates had 
</p>
<p>its own local judicial system. The Constitution of the United Arab Emirates provided for 
</p>
<p>the establishment of a Federal Supreme Court with exclusive jurisdiction over a specific list 
</p>
<p>of judicial matters in all the Emirates. For all other judicial matters, the Constitution allows 
</p>
<p>the Emirates to keep their local judicial authorities or to join the federal judicial system. 
</p>
<p>The Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Ras al-Khaimah have kept and developed their own 
</p>
<p>local judicial authorities, which are now organized in three-tier systems (first instance, 
</p>
<p>appeal and cassation) and function independently from the federal system. That means that 
</p>
<p>in those three Emirates, there are two justice systems functioning in parallel; the local 
</p>
<p>justice system has jurisdiction over all judicial matters that do not belong to the exclusive 
</p>
<p>competence of the Federal Supreme Court. The judgements of the local courts of cassation 
</p>
<p>are final, except when the constitutionality of a law or its application is appealed to the 
</p>
<p>Federal Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Federal Supreme Court 
</b></p>
<p>19. The Federal Supreme Court was established by the Constitution and is regulated by 
</p>
<p>Federal Law No. 10 of 1973. It is the highest court of the federal justice system and is 
</p>
<p>located in Abu Dhabi. The Court has exclusive jurisdiction over a series of matters, 
</p>
<p>including disputes between the various Emirates or with the Federal Government; the 
</p>
<p>constitutionality of federal and local legislation and regulations; the interpretation of the 
</p>
<p>Constitution and international treaties; offences directly affecting the interests of the 
</p>
<p>federation, in particular crimes related to internal and external security; and conflicts of 
</p>
<p>jurisdictions. In addition, the Court has the competence to review appeals against rulings 
</p>
<p>rendered by the Federal Courts of Appeal, in accordance with the provisions of Federal 
</p>
<p>Law No. 17 of 1978. The Court comprises various circuits or chambers, including a 
</p>
<p>constitutional chamber and a State security chamber. 
</p>
<p>20. The Supreme Court is composed of a president and four judges, as well as a 
</p>
<p>sufficient number of alternate judges, appointed by decree of the President of the United 
</p>
<p>Arab Emirates after approval by the Cabinet of Ministers and ratification by the Federal </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>7 
</b></p>
<p>Supreme Council, which is composed of the rulers of the seven Emirates.2 The Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court has a general assembly, composed of all its judges and chaired by its president, to 
</p>
<p>deal with the constitution of chambers, the distribution of tasks and other administrative 
</p>
<p>and internal affairs of the Supreme Court. It also has a technical bureau, composed of 
</p>
<p>judges, members of the public prosecution and the Division of Fatwa, Legislation and 
</p>
<p>Government Litigation of the Ministry of Justice, and other legal experts, to supervise the 
</p>
<p>transcription and printing of the Supreme Court&#8217;s judgements, extract the legal rules from 
</p>
<p>those judgements, carry out legal research required by the Supreme Court and perform 
</p>
<p>other technical functions. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Federal Courts of Appeal 
</b></p>
<p>21. Federal Courts of Appeal were established by Federal Law No. 6 of 1978 and are 
</p>
<p>located in Abu Dhabi, as well as in other Emirates when a federal law establishes them.3 
</p>
<p>Those Courts are further regulated by Federal Law No. 3 of 1983 and comprise different 
</p>
<p>circuits or chambers to hear appeals in criminal, civil, commercial, personal status and 
</p>
<p>administrative matters lodged against judgements of the Federal Courts of First Instance. 
</p>
<p>Except in a number of cases defined by law, their rulings are final and cannot be appealed 
</p>
<p>to the Federal Supreme Court. 
</p>
<p>22. Courts of Appeal consist of a president and a sufficient number of judges, appointed 
</p>
<p>by decree of the President of the United Arab Emirates upon the proposal of the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice, and supervised by the Minister of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Federal Courts of First Instance 
</b></p>
<p>23. Federal Courts of First Instance were also established by Federal Law No. 6 of 1978 
</p>
<p>and are located in Abu Dhabi, as well as in other Emirates when a federal law creates 
</p>
<p>them.4 Like the Courts of Appeal, they are governed by Federal Law No. 3 of 1983 and 
</p>
<p>comprise different circuits or chambers to hear criminal, civil, commercial, personal status 
</p>
<p>and administrative matters. 
</p>
<p>24. Courts of First Instance are composed of a president and a sufficient number of 
</p>
<p>judges, appointed by decree of the President of the United Arab Emirates upon the proposal 
</p>
<p>of the Minister of Justice, and supervised by the Minister of Justice. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Supreme Council of the Federal Judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>25. The Supreme Council of the Federal Judiciary was established by Federal Law No. 3 
</p>
<p>of 1983 to achieve the independence of the judiciary. Its competence includes expressing its 
</p>
<p>opinion on issues related to the judiciary and the public prosecution; studying and 
</p>
<p>proposing legislation related to the development of the justice system; and expressing its 
</p>
<p>opinion on the promotion, secondment and delegation of judges and members of the public 
</p>
<p>prosecution. The Council can also exercise any other function prescribed to it in accordance 
</p>
<p>with the law. 
</p>
<p>26. The Supreme Council is composed of seven members (only three of whom are 
</p>
<p>judges): the Minister of Justice (chairman); the Under-Secretary of Justice; the President of 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 2 There are currently 20 judges in total. 
</p>
<p> 3 There are Federal Courts of Appeal in the Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah and 
</p>
<p>Umm al-Quwain. 
</p>
<p> 4 There are Federal First Instance Courts in the Emirates of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Fujairah, Sharjah and 
</p>
<p>Umm al-Quwain. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>8</b>  
</p>
<p>the Federal Supreme Court; the Attorney General; the Director of the Judicial Inspection 
</p>
<p>Department; and the two oldest serving presidents of the Federal Courts of Appeal. 
</p>
<p><b> III. Challenges to the independence and impartiality of the 
judiciary and the proper administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>27. Despite the remarkable progress and modernization that has been achieved in a 
</p>
<p>limited time frame, the federal justice system of the United Arab Emirates still faces serious 
</p>
<p>challenges that directly affect the delivery of justice and the realization of human rights. 
</p>
<p>The independence and impartiality of the judiciary and the transparency and efficiency of 
</p>
<p>the administration of justice can vary between the different Emirates and between the 
</p>
<p>different local justice systems and the federal system. 
</p>
<p><b> A. Legal uncertainty 
</b></p>
<p>28. The federal system of the United Arab Emirates is complex and can be difficult to 
</p>
<p>understand, in particular for non-nationals, who constitute the majority of the population. 
</p>
<p>During her visit, the Special Rapporteur was told that, because of the complex 
</p>
<p>superposition of federal and local laws, it is sometimes difficult for the public to know 
</p>
<p>where the boundaries lie between the federal and local justice systems. There also appears 
</p>
<p>to be a lack of consistency in the application of federal laws across the different Emirates. 
</p>
<p>The Special Rapporteur is concerned about reports that it is difficult for people to know 
</p>
<p>which legal provisions are applicable to them, depending on where they are in the 
</p>
<p>Federation, and that laws are sometimes applied in an arbitrary manner. That creates 
</p>
<p>ambiguity and mistrust towards both law enforcement authorities and the justice system. 
</p>
<p>29. Furthermore, it was pointed out to the Special Rapporteur that important pieces of 
</p>
<p>legislation, including Federal Law No. 2 of 2003 (as amended by Federal Decree No. 1 of 
</p>
<p>2011) &#8220;On the State security apparatus&#8221;, Federal Decree No. 5 of 2012 &#8220;On combating 
</p>
<p>Cybercrimes&#8221; and Federal Law No. 7 of 2014 &#8220;On combating Terrorism Crimes&#8221;, contain 
</p>
<p>vague and broad definitions of criminal offences, in contravention of international human 
</p>
<p>rights standards. Such provisions also defy the principle of legality and open the door to 
</p>
<p>arbitrary interpretation and abuse. The principle of legality, fundamental in a system based 
</p>
<p>on the rule of law, requires that crimes are enshrined in legal provisions that are clear, 
</p>
<p>ascertainable, predictable and made public, thereby allowing individuals to understand 
</p>
<p>clearly the limits set out by the law in question and to regulate their behaviour accordingly. 
</p>
<p><b> B. Independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p><b> 1. Separation of powers and interference in the independence of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>30. The Special Rapporteur regrets that the principle of the separation of powers is not 
</p>
<p>explicitly guaranteed in the Constitution. Together with the rule of law, the separation of 
</p>
<p>powers opens the way to an administration of justice that provides guarantees of 
</p>
<p>independence and impartiality. There should therefore be a clear demarcation between the 
</p>
<p>respective competences of the different branches of power. As the Human Rights 
</p>
<p>Committee indicated in its general comment No. 32 (2007) on article 14: Right to equality 
</p>
<p>before courts and tribunals and to a fair trial, &#8220;a situation where the functions and 
</p>
<p>competencies of the judiciary and the executive are not clearly distinguishable or where the 
</p>
<p>latter is able to control or direct the former is incompatible with the notion of an 
</p>
<p>independent tribunal&#8221; (para. 19). </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>9 
</b></p>
<p>31. In that context, it is important to note that in the United Arab Emirates, the 
</p>
<p>legislative branch is not clearly separated from the executive. The majority of the members 
</p>
<p>of the Federal National Council are not elected by the citizens, but appointed according to 
</p>
<p>modalities defined by each Emirate. Furthermore, the Council does not have full legislative 
</p>
<p>powers. 
</p>
<p>32. The administrative and financial supervision of the courts is a competence currently 
</p>
<p>exercised by the Ministry of Justice. The composition of the Supreme Council of the 
</p>
<p>Federal Judiciary is problematic, as out of a total of seven members, only three are judges. 
</p>
<p>The other members are the Attorney General and three representatives of the executive. 
</p>
<p>Also, the Council&#8217;s mandate is very limited. Once the issue regarding its composition has 
</p>
<p>been addressed, measures should be taken to strengthen the role played by the Council. It 
</p>
<p>could include, for instance, responsibility for the selection and appointment of judges and 
</p>
<p>responsibilities related to the administration of the courts. 
</p>
<p>33. While any direct interference in the work of judges or threat against their 
</p>
<p>independence is extremely difficult to document, reports and allegations of pressure exerted 
</p>
<p>by members of the executive, prosecutors and other State agents, in particular members of 
</p>
<p>the State security apparatus, are of serious concern to the Special Rapporteur. She is 
</p>
<p>especially concerned that the judicial system remains under the de facto control of the 
</p>
<p>executive branch of government.  
</p>
<p>34. The Special Rapporteur was informed by the Government that a new federal law on 
</p>
<p>the judiciary was being drafted to replace Federal Law No. 3 of 1983. The draft law would 
</p>
<p>reportedly increase the independence of the judiciary. While she welcomes that initiative, 
</p>
<p>the Special Rapporteur is concerned about the lack of transparency in the drafting process. 
</p>
<p>At the time of her visit, it seemed that there was insufficient consultation with 
</p>
<p>representatives of the judiciary on the content of the draft law. The Special Rapporteur also 
</p>
<p>regrets that she was not provided with a copy of the draft law, which would have allowed 
</p>
<p>her to provide substantive comments. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Selection and appointment of judges 
</b></p>
<p>35. The president and judges of the Federal Supreme Court are appointed by presidential 
</p>
<p>decree after approval by the Cabinet and ratification by the Federal Supreme Council. Other 
</p>
<p>federal judges are appointed by presidential decree upon the proposal of the Minister of 
</p>
<p>Justice. Appointments and nominations by the highest representatives of the executive 
</p>
<p>branch can have a strong influence on judges&#8217; attitudes and behaviour. The Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur is concerned that the current mechanism for appointing judges lacks 
</p>
<p>transparency and may expose them to undue political pressure. 
</p>
<p>36. The Special Rapporteur wishes to highlight the importance of establishing and 
</p>
<p>applying clear, objective and transparent criteria in the selection of judges, particularly with 
</p>
<p>regard to qualifications, integrity, ability and efficiency, in order not only to identify the 
</p>
<p>most suitable candidates and increase the perception of a fair selection process, but also to 
</p>
<p>secure their independence. Competitive examinations conducted at least partly in a written 
</p>
<p>and anonymous manner provide an important tool in the selection process. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Impartiality, public perception and confidence 
</b></p>
<p>37. The Special Rapporteur is concerned at reported instances in which judges appear to 
</p>
<p>have lacked impartiality and shown bias, especially with regard to non-nationals of the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates. Among foreigners residing in the United Arab Emirates, there seems 
</p>
<p>to be a perception that the domestic courts cannot be trusted, and more specifically that 
</p>
<p>judges do not treat nationals in the same way as non-nationals. The Special Rapporteur was </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>10</b>  
</p>
<p>told that foreigners&#8217; lack of confidence in the justice system is such that many of them do 
</p>
<p>not report crimes or abuses. 
</p>
<p>38. It is worth noting that the State has the obligation, under international human rights 
</p>
<p>law, to guarantee the rights of equality before the courts and fair trial to all individuals 
</p>
<p>within its jurisdiction, regardless of nationality or any other status, including statelessness. 
</p>
<p>Judges should also perform their functions without favour, bias or prejudice and should not 
</p>
<p>manifest, by words or conduct, bias or prejudice towards any person or group on the 
</p>
<p>grounds of race, colour, sex, religion or national origin, among others.5 Those obligations 
</p>
<p>are all the more relevant when one considers that foreigners living in the United Arab 
</p>
<p>Emirates far outnumber nationals. 
</p>
<p>39. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur was told that in the federal courts, the 
</p>
<p>professional relationship between judges and prosecutors is excessively close. They are said 
</p>
<p>to be sharing chambers, entering court rooms together and discussing court minutes 
</p>
<p>together, thereby jeopardizing the perception that judges are impartial and that equality of 
</p>
<p>arms between the prosecution and the defence is respected. As noted in the Bangalore 
</p>
<p>Principles of Judicial Conduct, judges should avoid situations that might reasonably give 
</p>
<p>rise to suspicion or appearance of favouritism or partiality. 
</p>
<p><b> C. Judges who are non-nationals of the United Arab Emirates 
</b></p>
<p>40. Many judges from other Arab countries are recruited to serve in both federal and 
</p>
<p>local judiciaries on a temporary basis; in some courts, they outnumber judges from the 
</p>
<p>United Arab Emirates. Salaries are attractive and candidates are easily found, particularly in 
</p>
<p>Egypt, Lebanon, Morocco and the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Such a phenomenon is 
</p>
<p>far from common, worldwide. According to the authorities, hiring non-national judges was 
</p>
<p>necessary to cope with the lack of qualified nationals due to the relative youth of the 
</p>
<p>judicial system in the United Arab Emirates. The authorities also explained that other 
</p>
<p>professions used to be more attractive financially. That situation is said to have been 
</p>
<p>remedied in 2011 with a sharp increase in the salaries of judges. In the longer term, the 
</p>
<p>judiciary would only be composed of nationals. 
</p>
<p>41. The independence of the non-national judges is a complex issue that requires careful 
</p>
<p>consideration. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no detailed figures on non-national 
</p>
<p>judges working at either the federal and local levels were provided during the visit, 
</p>
<p>including their number, countries of origin, distribution at various hierarchical levels or the 
</p>
<p>criteria used in their selection. 
</p>
<p>42. The tenure of non-national judges is not guaranteed in the same way as that of 
</p>
<p>national judges. According to the information received, they are recruited under temporary 
</p>
<p>contracts that have to be renewed annually. The total length of the contracts nevertheless 
</p>
<p>depends on the rules regulating their secondment in their country of origin. Therefore, non-
</p>
<p>national judges&#8217; contracts can only be renewed up to a certain number of years, which may 
</p>
<p>vary depending on their country of origin. The temporary nature of non-national judges&#8217; 
</p>
<p>tenure is therefore inevitable. 
</p>
<p>43. Even though no specific cases were reported, the Special Rapporteur is concerned 
</p>
<p>that non-national judges can be dismissed at any time, which renders them particularly 
</p>
<p>vulnerable to pressure from any quarter, including from the public prosecution and 
</p>
<p>members of the executive branch. In addition, the benefits and allowances allocated to 
</p>
<p>national and non-national judges are allegedly different. 
</p>
<p>  
</p>
<p> 5 See the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>11 
</b></p>
<p>44. While the Special Rapporteur understands the rationale behind hiring non-national 
</p>
<p>judges and the limitations involved, she remains concerned about their independence. She 
</p>
<p>also believes that more could be done to secure the tenure of non-national judges, even if 
</p>
<p>only for a fixed period. Their conditions of work also need to be revised, as no 
</p>
<p>discrimination should be tolerated between national and non-national judges, except that 
</p>
<p>resulting from the rules of secondment of the countries of origin. 
</p>
<p>45. The Special Rapporteur would like to underscore that reducing the number of non-
</p>
<p>national judges is a legitimate path for the authorities to pursue. However, the process must 
</p>
<p>be implemented in full conformity with the international human rights obligations of the 
</p>
<p>State and its own domestic legislation. 
</p>
<p><b> D. Accountability and disciplinary measures 
</b></p>
<p>46. Another shortcoming affecting the independence and impartiality of the judiciary is 
</p>
<p>the absence of a written code of conduct for federal judges, as currently only a draft exists. 
</p>
<p>The local judiciary in Abu Dhabi has a code of judicial conduct containing 10 fundamental 
</p>
<p>rules and principles. The lack of a code of conduct common to all judiciaries in the United 
</p>
<p>Arab Emirates could prove problematic and lead to discrepancies between the Emirates and 
</p>
<p>between the federal and local justice systems. The Special Rapporteur nevertheless 
</p>
<p>welcomes the fact that disciplinary procedures against federal judges fall under the 
</p>
<p>exclusive purview of members of the judiciary; indeed a disciplinary board composed of 
</p>
<p>the president and the four most senior judges of the Federal Supreme Court is responsible 
</p>
<p>for disciplining federal judges. 
</p>
<p>47. In that context, it is important to remember that the independence and impartiality of 
</p>
<p>the judiciary does not aim to benefit judges themselves, but rather the court users, as part of 
</p>
<p>their inalienable right to a fair trial. Integrity and accountability are therefore essential 
</p>
<p>elements of judicial independence and are intrinsically linked to the implementation of the 
</p>
<p>rule of law. While Federal Laws No. 10 of 1973 and No. 3 of 1983 provide some elements 
</p>
<p>on the type of prohibited behaviour that might trigger disciplinary measures, detailed 
</p>
<p>guidance needs to be provided to judges on the infractions that will give rise to disciplinary 
</p>
<p>measures. 
</p>
<p><b> E. Fair trial, due process and administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>48. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned at the serious allegations of 
</p>
<p>violations of due process and fair trial guarantees made during her visit, especially with 
</p>
<p>regard to State security-related offences. The consequences that such violations might have 
</p>
<p>on people&#8217;s lives and on respect for their human rights cannot be overemphasized. 
</p>
<p><b> 1. Arbitrary arrest and pretrial detention 
</b></p>
<p>49. According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, persons who are arrested must be 
</p>
<p>referred to a prosecutor within 48 hours. The prosecutor is entitled to extend the pretrial 
</p>
<p>detention for up to a maximum of 21 days. Beyond that period, the detainee must be 
</p>
<p>presented to a judge, who can extend the detention further. The Special Rapporteur regrets 
</p>
<p>that the law does not provide for a maximum limit for pretrial detention, which would 
</p>
<p>prevent abuses. 
</p>
<p>50. The Special Rapporteur notes with concern that the limited guarantees provided 
</p>
<p>against arbitrary arrest and detention in the Code of Criminal Procedure do not apply to 
</p>
<p>persons arrested on State security or terrorism-related charges. The relevant legislation </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>12</b>  
</p>
<p>provides the prosecution with the competence to extend pretrial detention for up to three 
</p>
<p>months before presenting the detainee to a judge. 
</p>
<p>51. Moreover, while the Code of Criminal Procedure prescribes that, unless an 
</p>
<p>individual is arrested in flagrante delicto, an arrest warrant must be presented, the Special 
</p>
<p>Rapporteur received many reports of people being arrested without a warrant. Such cases 
</p>
<p>very often concern persons who were later accused of State security crimes. After being 
</p>
<p>arrested by State security agents, most of those individuals were taken to secret detention 
</p>
<p>facilities and kept incommunicado for days, weeks or even months, sometimes in solitary 
</p>
<p>confinement. Such detentions may sometimes amount to enforced disappearances, as the 
</p>
<p>authorities refuse to acknowledge that they have detained the person and/or refuse to 
</p>
<p>confirm their fate and whereabouts. It goes without saying that in those places of detention, 
</p>
<p>detainees have no access to a lawyer, in breach of the Basic Principles on the Role of 
</p>
<p>Lawyers, which require that anyone accused of a crime has access to a lawyer no later than 
</p>
<p>48 hours after his or her arrest. 
</p>
<p><b> 2. Torture and forced confessions 
</b></p>
<p>52. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur received credible information and evidence 
</p>
<p>that many of the individuals who were arrested without a warrant and taken to unofficial 
</p>
<p>places of detention were also subjected to torture or other forms of ill-treatment, including 
</p>
<p>in order to extract confessions of guilt or testimonies against other detainees. Consistent 
</p>
<p>testimonies of the following torture and ill-treatment were received: deprivation of daylight; 
</p>
<p>exposure to bright electric light 24 hours a day; being blindfolded and threatened; being 
</p>
<p>kept in very small cells without windows or a toilet; being forced to ask permission and 
</p>
<p>being forced to strip in order to go to the toilet; exposure to extreme temperatures; beatings; 
</p>
<p>extraction of fingernails and plucking of beards; being drugged; sexual assaults and threats 
</p>
<p>thereof; and insults. 
</p>
<p>53. The Special Rapporteur was told that over the past few years, more than 
</p>
<p>200 complaints relating to torture and/or ill-treatment had been presented before judges 
</p>
<p>and/or prosecutors, but that those complaints had not been received or registered, and 
</p>
<p>consequently not been taken into account in judicial proceedings. Moreover, no 
</p>
<p>independent investigation into those complaints had allegedly taken place. In one case 
</p>
<p>reported to the Special Rapporteur, a judge ordered a medical committee to investigate 
</p>
<p>allegations of torture and ill-treatment. The media reported that the resulting report proved 
</p>
<p>that the allegations were false, yet the report was never shared with the defence counsel or 
</p>
<p>presented to the court. 
</p>
<p>54. The Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that the lack of serious investigation into 
</p>
<p>that type of allegation encourages impunity for perpetrators. It also constitutes a violation 
</p>
<p>of the obligations of the United Arab Emirates under the Convention against Torture and 
</p>
<p>Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. 
</p>
<p>55. Judges and prosecutors have an obligation not only to respect and enforce the rights 
</p>
<p>of the parties, including due process and fair trial guarantees, but also to uphold human 
</p>
<p>rights. In that regard, the notions of due process and fair trial include the guarantee of a fair 
</p>
<p>and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. Any 
</p>
<p>evidence that may have been obtained through recourse to torture or ill-treatment cannot be 
</p>
<p>received in court, but rather, must be used to prosecute those who used such methods. 
</p>
<p><b> 3. Access to a lawyer 
</b></p>
<p>56. The Special Rapporteur is extremely concerned at reports that an accused person&#8217;s 
</p>
<p>access to a lawyer can be restricted by the police or the prosecution during the investigative 
</p>
<p>phase. The Special Rapporteur is particularly alarmed at reports that individuals accused of </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>13 
</b></p>
<p>having committed crimes that jeopardize State security have extremely limited access to 
</p>
<p>legal counsel. Allegedly, one defendant met his lawyer only once before his trial; another 
</p>
<p>met his lawyer for the first time in court. Meetings with lawyers are often very short, lasting 
</p>
<p>only a few minutes, and they are not held in private, but are supervised and reportedly even 
</p>
<p>recorded by the prosecution or security services. The allegations thus reflect breaches of 
</p>
<p>international human rights standards on the right to a fair trial and guarantees ensuring the 
</p>
<p>free exercise of the legal profession. 
</p>
<p><b> 4. Access to information, transparency and public hearings 
</b></p>
<p>57. The apparent lack of transparency during both the investigation phase and court 
</p>
<p>proceedings remains a matter of concern to the Special Rapporteur, particularly with regard 
</p>
<p>to criminal cases heard before the State security chamber of the Federal Supreme Court. In 
</p>
<p>those cases, lawyers also seem to face serious difficulties in accessing information, 
</p>
<p>especially investigation files. In one case, the defence lawyer could not access his clients&#8217; 
</p>
<p>file until the beginning of court hearings. Lawyers must be granted access to files already at 
</p>
<p>the investigative stage in order to allow them to prepare an adequate defence. 
</p>
<p>58. That lack of transparency is compounded when the court hearings are not public. 
</p>
<p>The notion of fair trial includes the guarantee of a fair and public hearing. The publicity of 
</p>
<p>hearings ensures the transparency of the proceedings, thereby providing an important 
</p>
<p>safeguard for the defendant. According to information received, in many high-level cases 
</p>
<p>heard before the State security chamber of the Federal Supreme Court, hearings were held 
</p>
<p>in closed sessions or with limited public access. Exceptional circumstances can warrant that 
</p>
<p>all or part of the public is to be excluded from court hearings; nevertheless, such an 
</p>
<p>exclusion must be clearly motivated, and the judgement, including essential findings, 
</p>
<p>evidence and legal reasoning must be made public. 
</p>
<p>59. The Special Rapporteur received reports of cases in which compulsory registration 
</p>
<p>and other burdensome administrative requirements had to be complied with by defendants&#8217; 
</p>
<p>relatives, international trial monitors and members of the public. Even those who fulfilled 
</p>
<p>all the requirements were not always granted access to hearings. Full searches imposed at 
</p>
<p>the entrance to court rooms has led to absurd situations, such as when a defence lawyer was 
</p>
<p>prevented from entering the room with his case file. Courts do have the power to exclude 
</p>
<p>all or part of the public in exceptional circumstances, but that cannot become the de facto 
</p>
<p>rule. The Special Rapporteur is concerned that excluding the public from hearings spreads 
</p>
<p>doubt about the fairness of judicial proceedings. 
</p>
<p>60. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned at reports that translations and 
</p>
<p>interpretation in court cases involving non-Arabic speakers, while required by law, are not 
</p>
<p>always provided in practice, or that their quality is poor. 
</p>
<p><b> 5. Review by a higher tribunal 
</b></p>
<p>61. Anyone convicted of a crime has the right to have their conviction and sentence 
</p>
<p>reviewed by a higher tribunal. Yet in the United Arab Emirates, cases related to offences 
</p>
<p>directly affecting the interests of the Federation, including so-called State security crimes, 
</p>
<p>fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Supreme Court. Those cases are 
</p>
<p>therefore considered in first and last instance by the State security chamber of the Federal 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court with no possibility of review by a higher tribunal, as the Federal Supreme 
</p>
<p>Court is the highest tribunal in the United Arab Emirates. That is in breach of international 
</p>
<p>human rights standards. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information provided by the 
</p>
<p>Government that the authorities are considering amending the legislation to provide for the 
</p>
<p>possibility of appeal in such cases. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>14</b>  
</p>
<p><b> 6. Court administration and case management 
</b></p>
<p>62. The Special Rapporteur was witness to the fact that the local justice systems in Abu 
</p>
<p>Dhabi and Dubai have developed highly advanced computer-based systems for the 
</p>
<p>management of the courts and cases. The systems provide online access to a significant 
</p>
<p>amount of information, including the status of cases, hearing dates and statistics. Impressive 
</p>
<p>applications for smartphones have also been developed, which facilitate the work of judges, 
</p>
<p>lawyers and court users alike. She hopes that such sophisticated tools will soon be made 
</p>
<p>available for criminal cases and further developed at the level of federal courts. However, 
</p>
<p>the differences in the quality of judicial services offered to the residents of the seven 
</p>
<p>Emirates remain a matter of concern that should be addressed. 
</p>
<p><b> F. Access to justice and legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>63. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about access to justice for vulnerable members 
</p>
<p>of the population, such as migrant workers, domestic workers and stateless persons, who 
</p>
<p>are also known as <i>Bidoons</i>. They face serious obstacles in accessing the justice system, 
</p>
<p>which include the lack of legal identity in the case of <i>Bidoons</i>, the lack of information about 
</p>
<p>the legal system and judicial procedures available in a language the individual understands, 
</p>
<p>and a lack of confidence in the justice system. It is therefore often impossible for vulnerable 
</p>
<p>persons to seek remedies for abuses they suffer, which is a breach of the principle of 
</p>
<p>equality before the courts. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation the information 
</p>
<p>received on the efforts undertaken by the authorities to reach out to migrant workers, 
</p>
<p>inform them about their rights and support them in their judicial proceedings, including by 
</p>
<p>waving judicial fees. She hopes that those efforts will be strengthened. 
</p>
<p>64. At the federal level, institutional legal aid is available only to defendants who do not 
</p>
<p>have the financial means to pay for a lawyer in the criminal justice system. The resources 
</p>
<p>come from the budget of the federal courts and lawyers placed on a roster are assigned to 
</p>
<p>those cases by judges. 
</p>
<p>65. Against that backdrop, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the free legal aid system 
</p>
<p>set up in the Abu Dhabi judicial department. Since 2011, free legal aid has been provided to 
</p>
<p>indigent people in that Emirate, including for civil cases. Three types of service are 
</p>
<p>provided to litigants who cannot afford legal assistance: the assignment of a lawyer; the 
</p>
<p>settlement of the fees of experts who may be required by the case in question; and legal 
</p>
<p>assistance to detainees. The authorities informed the Special Rapporteur that the majority of 
</p>
<p>the beneficiaries of those free legal services were migrant workers. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p>is encouraged by the information received from the Government that the Ministry of Justice 
</p>
<p>is willing to study that positive example with a view to strengthening the legal aid system at 
</p>
<p>the federal level. 
</p>
<p><b> G. Women in the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>66. During her visit, the Special Rapporteur looked into the integration of a gender 
</p>
<p>perspective and women&#8217;s rights in the justice system. She is extremely concerned that 
</p>
<p>women are prohibited from becoming federal judges and federal prosecutors under 
</p>
<p>articles 18 and 58, respectively, of Federal Law No. 3 of 1983 Those discriminatory 
</p>
<p>provisions are in breach of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
</p>
<p>Discrimination against Women, to which the United Arab Emirates acceded in 2004, and 
</p>
<p>are therefore unacceptable. 
</p>
<p>67. The Special Rapporteur notes with appreciation that in the local judicial systems of 
</p>
<p>Abu Dhabi and Dubai, women can become judges and prosecutors. In the local judiciary in </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>15 
</b></p>
<p>Abu Dhabi, there are currently 9 female judges and 18 female prosecutors. There are 
</p>
<p>73 women registered as lawyers with the courts of Abu Dhabi; they represent 19 per cent of 
</p>
<p>the total number of lawyers there. In the local justice system in Dubai, there are 3 female 
</p>
<p>judges and 17 female prosecutors. The Special Rapporteur was encouraged to hear that in 
</p>
<p>those two Emirates, programmes aimed at empowering women and increasing their 
</p>
<p>representation in the judiciary were in place. 
</p>
<p>68. Nevertheless, it seems that women still face institutional gender discrimination in 
</p>
<p>many facets of the justice system, including when filing complaints with the police or 
</p>
<p>appearing before the courts. Judges, prosecutors and even lawyers show the gender bias and 
</p>
<p>discriminatory attitudes and practices present in society in the United Arab Emirates; that 
</p>
<p>bias and discrimination reflect the traditional, patriarchal societal structure that is dominant 
</p>
<p>in the United Arab Emirates. 
</p>
<p>69. In that regard, the Special Rapporteur is concerned at reports indicating that the 
</p>
<p>majority of cases of sexual assault and domestic violence do not reach the courts. 
</p>
<p>Significant social pressure is placed on women not to report such abuses to the police or the 
</p>
<p>courts. The treatment and stigma faced by some women who dare to file a complaint for 
</p>
<p>sexual assault is disturbing. In a widely publicized case, a woman of foreign nationality 
</p>
<p>who went to the police to file a complaint for rape ended up being prosecuted and convicted 
</p>
<p>on the grounds that she had engaged in illicit sex. The Special Rapporteur is also worried 
</p>
<p>about the situation of female migrant workers, including domestic workers, who are in a 
</p>
<p>particularly vulnerable situation when it comes to accessing justice and gaining redress in 
</p>
<p>cases of abuse. 
</p>
<p>70. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline that a more representative and gender-
</p>
<p>sensitive judiciary could play a determining role in empowering women to gain access to 
</p>
<p>justice, claim their rights and break patterns of gender discrimination and impunity in cases 
</p>
<p>of violence against women. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the information received 
</p>
<p>about a recent initiative of the Ministry of Justice which aims to address some concerns 
</p>
<p>relating to women and the judiciary; she wishes to receive further details on the content of 
</p>
<p>that initiative. 
</p>
<p><b> H. Prosecution services 
</b></p>
<p>71. The federal public prosecution was established under the direct supervision and 
</p>
<p>control of the Minister of Justice. It is headed by the Attorney General and composed of 
</p>
<p>prosecutors of different ranks. Candidates are proposed by the Minister of Justice and 
</p>
<p>approved by the Cabinet before being formally appointed by a federal decree of the 
</p>
<p>President Such de jure control is of great concern to the Special Rapporteur as it manifestly 
</p>
<p>jeopardizes the autonomy of prosecutors. 
</p>
<p>72. Against that background, the Special Rapporteur is seriously concerned about 
</p>
<p>reports which indicate that the prosecution services are often influenced by members of the 
</p>
<p>executive and the State security services. Prosecution services should be autonomous and 
</p>
<p>prosecutors should perform their functions in an independent, objective and impartial 
</p>
<p>manner, in compliance with the law and international legal principles, including the 
</p>
<p>fundamental principle of the presumption of innocence. 
</p>
<p>73. The Special Rapporteur is troubled by credible allegations that evidence is 
</p>
<p>sometimes manipulated and fabricated by members of the police, other security agencies or 
</p>
<p>the public prosecution. She was also told that prosecution services pursue cases even when 
</p>
<p>allegations have been proven unfounded. In one case reported to the Special Rapporteur, 
</p>
<p>one of the accused was found guilty, despite the fact that he was in detention relating to 
</p>
<p>another matter at the time that the offence with which he was accused was committed, </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>16</b>  
</p>
<p>while another was outside the country and had evidence to prove it. They were nevertheless 
</p>
<p>prosecuted and later convicted for acts they could not possibly have committed, according 
</p>
<p>to clear and available evidence. 
</p>
<p>74. At both emirate and federal levels, the public prosecution forms part of the judiciary. 
</p>
<p>It is responsible for investigating crimes; issuing arrest, search and seizure warrants; 
</p>
<p>initiating criminal proceedings; and enforcing criminal judicial decisions. It also has 
</p>
<p>competence to monitor detention centres and plays an active part in disciplinary 
</p>
<p>proceedings against lawyers. Such a concentration of functions in the hands of the 
</p>
<p>prosecution is a matter of concern to the Special Rapporteur, as it may hamper the 
</p>
<p>independence and fairness of criminal investigations and proceedings. As a result, the 
</p>
<p>principle of equality of arms, which requires procedural equality between the prosecution 
</p>
<p>and the defence, could be affected. 
</p>
<p><b> I. Lawyers 
</b></p>
<p>75. Like judges and prosecutors, lawyers also play an essential role in ensuring the 
</p>
<p>independence of the judiciary and upholding the rule of law. While they are not expected to 
</p>
<p>be impartial in the same way as judges, they must be as free from external pressure and 
</p>
<p>interference as judges. The Special Rapporteur is concerned about the absence of an 
</p>
<p>independent, self-regulating bar association that oversees the process of admitting 
</p>
<p>candidates to the legal profession, provides for a uniform code of conduct and enforces 
</p>
<p>disciplinary measures, including disbarment. The establishment of such an independent 
</p>
<p>association is a key element in ensuring the independence of lawyers. 
</p>
<p>76. The conditions for admission to the bar are set out in article 6 of Law No. 23 of 1991 
</p>
<p>and include a compulsory training period of two years, but no standardized written bar 
</p>
<p>examination. As a result, there could be a significant disparity in lawyers&#8217; competence, 
</p>
<p>which is of concern to the Special Rapporteur. 
</p>
<p>77. In the United Arab Emirates, the Council for the Admission of Lawyers Before the 
</p>
<p>Courts, established in the Ministry of Justice, is in charge of the admission of lawyers and 
</p>
<p>their registration on one of the rosters provided for by law.6 The Special Rapporteur is 
</p>
<p>concerned at the extensive involvement of the executive and the extremely limited 
</p>
<p>participation of lawyers in the admission and registration of lawyers, which, in her view, is 
</p>
<p>incompatible with the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, as it undermines lawyers&#8217; 
</p>
<p>independence. She also notes with concern that practising lawyers are required to apply to 
</p>
<p>renew their enrolment every year. 
</p>
<p>78. The Special Rapporteur is also concerned about the involvement of the executive in 
</p>
<p>disciplinary procedures against lawyers and their disbarment. Indeed, the Council for the 
</p>
<p>Admission of Lawyers Before the Courts is also in charge of complaints against lawyers. 
</p>
<p>Decisions can be challenged before the Federal Supreme Court. In addition, while a 
</p>
<p>selective list of lawyers&#8217; rights and duties is provided in Law No. 23 of 1991, there is no 
</p>
<p>comprehensive code of conduct or ethics that clearly defines what constitutes an infraction 
</p>
<p>and how such infractions should be sanctioned. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the 
</p>
<p>information received on a Ministry of Justice project on further developing the legal 
</p>
<p>profession, which reportedly takes into consideration issues relating to education and 
</p>
<p>training, guarantees of independence, and the adoption of a code of conduct, inter alia. She 
</p>
<p>  
 6 The Council for the Admission of Lawyers Before the Courts is composed of two representatives of 
</p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice, one expert chosen by the Ministry of Justice, two judges from the Federal 
</p>
<p>Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal, one prosecutor and one lawyer. </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>17 
</b></p>
<p>encourages the authorities to seriously consider the relevant recommendations contained in 
</p>
<p>the present report. 
</p>
<p>79. The Special Rapporteur was alarmed at reports that some lawyers who take up cases 
</p>
<p>related to State security have been harassed, threatened and had pressure exerted on them, 
</p>
<p>including through constant surveillance, public campaigns of defamation, and the arbitrary 
</p>
<p>deportation of non-national lawyers. She was also alarmed at the long list of obstacles that 
</p>
<p>lawyers working on State security-related cases encountered on a daily basis while 
</p>
<p>discharging their professional duties and representing their clients&#8217; interests. 
</p>
<p>80. Lawyers should never be identified with their clients or their clients&#8217; causes as a 
</p>
<p>result of discharging their professional functions. Yet in at least one case, a lawyer was 
</p>
<p>arrested when he was enquiring about the whereabouts of his clients at the State security 
</p>
<p>prosecution branch. That is clearly unacceptable and should be immediately investigated. 
</p>
<p>Families of persons accused of State security-related offences are also encouraged by the 
</p>
<p>police, State security agents or prosecutors not to hire certain lawyers. That practice must 
</p>
<p>stop. 
</p>
<p>81. Impunity surrounding such breaches of the independence of the legal profession has 
</p>
<p>had a chilling effect on lawyers. It was reported to the Special Rapporteur that it has 
</p>
<p>become extremely difficult to secure a lawyer in State security-related cases. Many lawyers 
</p>
<p>refuse such cases or drop them early on owing to the pressure placed on them. That is 
</p>
<p>extremely worrying and could lead to serious violations of defendants&#8217; right to a fair trial, 
</p>
<p>including the right to be represented by counsel of one&#8217;s choice. 
</p>
<p><b> J. Education, training and capacity-building 
</b></p>
<p>82. Authorities of the United Arab Emirates at both federal and local levels have 
</p>
<p>acknowledged the importance of high-quality education and professional training for 
</p>
<p>judges, prosecutors and lawyers in order to ensure an effective administration of justice. 
</p>
<p>Efforts have been made and some measures taken to try to remedy the deficits of the United 
</p>
<p>Arab Emirates in that domain. For instance, there are scholarship programmes for judges to 
</p>
<p>study in the United States of America or Europe. 
</p>
<p>83. The Academy of Judicial Studies and Specialized Training in Abu Dhabi was set up 
</p>
<p>in 2008 and provides training for judges, prosecutors and lawyers, among others. In Dubai, 
</p>
<p>the Judicial Institute provides training for judges, prosecutors and lawyers, including 
</p>
<p>compulsory training courses for judges and prosecutors. The Special Rapporteur was 
</p>
<p>informed that a new diploma on human rights and the judicial system targeted at judges, 
</p>
<p>prosecutors and lawyers was to be offered as of spring 2014. The course should consist of 
</p>
<p>about 50 hours of training on a variety of human rights topics that are directly relevant to 
</p>
<p>the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur welcomes that initiative and hopes that similar 
</p>
<p>training courses can be offered throughout the United Arab Emirates, including to local and 
</p>
<p>federal judges. 
</p>
<p>84. Yet challenges remain, in particular when it comes to the concrete application in the 
</p>
<p>daily work of judges, prosecutors or lawyers of the knowledge gained during training. More 
</p>
<p>efforts are therefore needed to improve the expertise of judges, prosecutors and lawyers and 
</p>
<p>the quality of their work. The application of the knowledge and/or skills gained during 
</p>
<p>training should be assessed and, on the basis or the results gathered, the needs for training 
</p>
<p>should be revised. The training offered should also be diversified and include modules on 
</p>
<p>specific human rights-related topics, such as women&#8217;s rights or the rights of migrant 
</p>
<p>workers. That will require serious commitment from the authorities, as well as the 
</p>
<p>investment of resources. The Special Rapporteur wishes to underline that without such </p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>18</b>  
</p>
<p>efforts, the ultimate aim of the United Arab Emirates to nationalize its judiciary will not be 
</p>
<p>achieved. 
</p>
<p><b> IV. Conclusions 
</b></p>
<p>85. <b>The Special Rapporteur welcomes the recognition of the principle of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>independence of the judiciary in the Constitution of 1971. It is equally important to 
</b></p>
<p><b>acknowledge that the justice system in the United Arab Emirates developed into an 
</b></p>
<p><b>elaborate and complex court system with federal and local courts and judicial 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities in a relatively short time frame. 
</b></p>
<p>86. <b>Despite commendable progress, the current judicial system in the United Arab 
</b></p>
<p><b>Emirates faces challenges that negatively affect the delivery of justice, the enjoyment 
</b></p>
<p>of human rights and the public&#8217;s confidence in the judiciary. The Special Rapporteur 
</p>
<p><b>is particularly concerned at reports of serious breaches of fair trial and due process 
</b></p>
<p><b>guarantees, especially regarding, but not limited to, crimes related to State security. 
</b></p>
<p><b>She is also concerned about the harassment, pressure and threats to which some 
</b></p>
<p><b>lawyers are subjected, in breach of their independence, especially when they take up 
</b></p>
<p><b>cases related to State security crimes. 
</b></p>
<p>87. <b>While the achievements should be acknowledged and commended, it is fair to 
</b></p>
<p>highlight the Federation&#8217;s challenges and shortcomings when looking at the 
</p>
<p><b>independence, impartiality, transparency, competence and efficiency of the justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system. As seen above, such challenges and shortcomings may directly undermine the 
</b></p>
<p>exercise of human rights and present credible obstacles to the country&#8217;s stable 
</p>
<p><b>political development, and consequently its further economic growth. 
</b></p>
<p>88. <b>As a member of the Human Rights Council, the United Arab Emirates should 
</b></p>
<p><b>spare no efforts in implementing human rights recommendations effectively. The 
</b></p>
<p><b>Special Rapporteur stands ready to provide technical assistance and advice if needed. 
</b></p>
<p><b>United Nations offices and agencies could also be in a position to provide assistance. 
</b></p>
<p><b>The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, for instance, has an array of ready-
</b></p>
<p><b>to-use tools that can be used to consolidate the functioning of the criminal justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system and enhance its transparency, in line with international human rights 
</b></p>
<p><b>principles. 
</b></p>
<p>89. <b>The Special Rapporteur strongly encourages the United Arab Emirates to 
</b></p>
<p><b>continue engaging with human rights mechanisms; in particular, she hopes that they 
</b></p>
<p><b>will receive more special procedures mandate holders in the near future. In that 
</b></p>
<p><b>context, she recommends that the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, 
</b></p>
<p><b>inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on the 
</b></p>
<p><b>promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while 
</b></p>
<p><b>countering terrorism, and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary 
</b></p>
<p><b>Disappearances be invited to conduct official visits. 
</b></p>
<p><b> V. Recommendations 
</b></p>
<p>90. <b>The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Optional 
</b></p>
<p><b>Protocols thereto, and the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons 
</b></p>
<p><b>from Enforced Disappearance should be ratified. 
</b></p>
<p>91. <b>A national human rights institution in line with the principles relating to the 
</b></p>
<p><b>status of national institutions (Paris Principles) should be established. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>19 
</b></p>
<p>92. <b>Specific steps should be taken to remedy discrepancies between the Emirates  
</b></p>
<p><b>regarding the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and the transparency 
</b></p>
<p><b>and efficiency of the administration of justice, with a view to strengthening the entire 
</b></p>
<p><b>justice system and rendering it more consistent. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Legal uncertainty 
</b></p>
<p>93. <b>All federal and local laws and regulations should be made easily available 
</b></p>
<p><b>accessible to the public in order to enhance the principle of legal certainty. 
</b></p>
<p>94. <b>Legislative provisions that are phrased in terms that are too broad and/or 
</b></p>
<p><b>vague, in particular the relevant provisions of the Penal Code, Federal laws No. 2 of 
</b></p>
<p><b>2003 and No. 7 of 2014, and Federal Decree No. 5 of 2012, should be amended in order 
</b></p>
<p><b>to comply with international human rights standards and the principle of legality. 
</b></p>
<p>95. <b>Public awareness about the content of laws, their application, the obligations 
</b></p>
<p><b>they entail and the differences that exist between the laws of the various Emirates 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be raised. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Independence and impartiality of the judiciary 
</b></p>
<p>96. <b>The principle of the separation of powers should be enshrined in the 
</b></p>
<p><b>Constitution and concrete measures taken to strengthen the independence of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p>97. <b>The functions of the Ministry of Justice and the federal judiciary and courts 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be clearly separated; in particular, the administrative and financial 
</b></p>
<p><b>supervision of the courts should be immediately transferred to the judiciary, so that 
</b></p>
<p><b>the judiciary is self-governing. 
</b></p>
<p>98. <b>The composition of the Supreme Council of the Federal Judiciary should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>revised with a view to increasing the representation of judges and reducing or even 
</b></p>
<p><b>excluding the participation of members of the executive. 
</b></p>
<p>99. <b>The actors of the justice system and the public should be consulted 
</b></p>
<p><b>meaningfully in the process of drafting the revised federal law on the judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p>100. <b>In order to preserve their independence, judges should be appointed by an 
</b></p>
<p><b>independent body composed mainly of judges; the participation of representatives of 
</b></p>
<p><b>the executive should be avoided. 
</b></p>
<p>101. <b>A standardized written examination should be set up in order to ensure that the 
</b></p>
<p><b>competence and expertise of candidates to the bench are assessed in an anonymous 
</b></p>
<p><b>and transparent manner. 
</b></p>
<p>102. <b>Complaints relating to discriminatory attitudes and other improper behaviour 
</b></p>
<p><b>of judges should be promptly investigated and, if corroborated, the judges concerned 
</b></p>
<p><b>should be sanctioned. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Non-national judges 
</b></p>
<p>103. <b>Non-national judges should be given the same guarantees as national judges, 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided they are in line with the rules of secondment of their home countries; their 
</b></p>
<p><b>contracts should not be renewed annually, but rather, should last for the whole 
</b></p>
<p><b>duration of the secondment allowed by the home country. 
</b></p>
<p>104. <b>A transparent and clear strategy, accompanied by a sufficiently resourced 
</b></p>
<p><b>programme, should be adopted to progressively reduce the number of non-national </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p><b>20</b>  
</p>
<p><b>judges, in full conformity with international human rights obligations; in the longer 
</b></p>
<p><b>term, the goal should be to fully nationalize membership of the judiciary. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Accountability and disciplinary measures 
</b></p>
<p>105. <b>A written code of conduct for federal and local judges should be adopted, in 
</b></p>
<p><b>line with the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Fair trial, due process and administration of justice 
</b></p>
<p>106. <b>Violations of due process and fair trial should be investigated immediately and 
</b></p>
<p><b>urgent measures taken to remedy them; such measures may include the revision of 
</b></p>
<p><b>judgements and sentences, the release of detainees, and/or the granting of 
</b></p>
<p><b>compensation. 
</b></p>
<p>107. <b>The Code of Criminal Procedure should be amended to prescribe a limit for 
</b></p>
<p><b>pretrial detention. 
</b></p>
<p>108. <b>The de facto practices of arresting individuals suspected of having committed 
</b></p>
<p><b>offences against the security of the State outside the purview of the law, and of 
</b></p>
<p><b>keeping them in secret detention places, incommunicado and in solitary confinement 
</b></p>
<p><b>should cease immediately; all arrests and detentions should be carried out in 
</b></p>
<p><b>compliance with international human rights standards guaranteeing the liberty and 
</b></p>
<p><b>security of the person. 
</b></p>
<p>109. <b>Evidence and confessions that prosecutors or judges know or reasonably 
</b></p>
<p><b>believe to have been obtained through recourse to unlawful methods, especially 
</b></p>
<p><b>torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or other human 
</b></p>
<p><b>rights abuses, should never be accepted before a court as they constitute a grave 
</b></p>
<p>violation of the defendant&#8217;s human rights<b>. 
</b></p>
<p>110. <b>An independent body composed of professionals with international expertise 
</b></p>
<p><b>and experience, including in medical forensics, psychology and post-traumatic 
</b></p>
<p><b>disorders, should be established to investigate all claims of torture and ill-treatment 
</b></p>
<p><b>alleged to have taken place during arrest and/or detention; such a body should have 
</b></p>
<p><b>access to all places of detention and be able to interview detainees in private, and its 
</b></p>
<p>composition should be agreed upon with defendants&#8217; lawyers<b> and families. 
</b></p>
<p>111. <b>Access to a lawyer in private should be granted in all cases no later than 48 
</b></p>
<p><b>hours after arrest, in full compliance with international standards relating to fair trial 
</b></p>
<p><b>and the legal profession. 
</b></p>
<p>112. <b>Lawyers should be guaranteed, both in law and in practice, full access to 
</b></p>
<p><b>appropriate information, files and documents in the possession or control of the 
</b></p>
<p><b>authorities; appropriate information includes, at a minimum, all materials that are 
</b></p>
<p><b>exculpatory or that the prosecution plans to use in court against the accused. 
</b></p>
<p>113. <b>Court hearings should be public unless restrictions can be justified clearly and 
</b></p>
<p><b>in line with exceptions accorded under international human rights law. 
</b></p>
<p>114. <b>Quality interpretation and translation for non-Arabic speakers should be 
</b></p>
<p><b>provided at all stages of judicial proceedings, including during the investigation and 
</b></p>
<p><b>initial detention phases. 
</b></p>
<p>115. <b>The Constitution and related legislation should be amended to ensure the right

</p>
<p><b>including cases currently falling under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal

<p><b>Supreme Court. </b></p>

<p><b>A/HRC/29/26/Add.2 
</b></p>
<p> <b>21 
</b></p>
<p>116. <b>Use of modern technology, in particular in the criminal justice system, should 
</b></p>
<p><b>be extended and all hearings recorded in order to ensure the proper, adequate and 
</b></p>
<p><b>transparent administration of justice. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Access to justice and legal aid 
</b></p>
<p>117. <b>Efforts to adopt clear policies and measures to promote equal access to justice, 
</b></p>
<p><b>particularly for vulnerable groups such as migrant and domestic workers, including 
</b></p>
<p><b>by providing free legal aid and raising awareness of rights and procedures should be

<p><b>people, including in non-criminal cases at both the federal and local levels throughout 
</b></p>
<p><b>the United Arab Emirates. 
</b></p>
<p><b>  Women in the justice system 
</b></p>
<p>119. <b>Gender-based bias, stereotypes and discrimination persisting in the justice 
</b></p>
<p><b>system should be addressed and eliminated urgently. To that end, training on gender 
</b></p>
<p>equality and women&#8217;s rights, including <b>the prohibition of violence against women, and

</b></p>
<p>120. <b>Federal Law No. 3 of 1983 should be amended urgently in order to allow

</b></p>
<p><b>to improve the representation of women in the judiciary should be taken at both the

<p><b>disbarment. The association and its independence should be officially recognized. 
</b></p>
<p>128. <b>A uniform code of conduct or ethics should be drafted with the full
