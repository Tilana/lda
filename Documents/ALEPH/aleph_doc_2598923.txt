Item 2 Details of Acquisition
2.1
Nature of Business Acquired
On June 21, 2016, the Corporation entered into an asset sale agreement dated June 21, 2016 with Encana
Corporation (the “Vendor”) and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Vendor, pursuant
to which the
Corporation agreed to acquire certain petroleum and natural gas properties, interests and related assets
primarily located in the Gordondale area in the Province of Alberta (the “Assets”) for cash consideration of
approximately $625 million, subject to closing adjustments (the “Acquisition”).
The Acquisition was completed on July 28, 2016 and has an effective date of January 1, 2016.
The Assets are primarily located in the Gordondale area of Alberta, approximately 100 km northwest of
Grande Prairie and include a large contiguous land base which fits between Birchcliff’s existing Pouce
Coupe and Gordondale properties. As at March 31, 2016, the Assets consisted of 42,862 Net acres of
developed land, 11,344 Net acres of undeveloped land and related production infrastructure. The
Corporation acquired an average working interest of 57% in developed lands and 67% in undeveloped
lands.
Major facilities and infrastructure acquired include a 100% working interest in two light oil batteries with
approximately 20,000 bbls/d of combined handling capacity, an approximate 10% working interest in the
Progress gas plant operated by Canadian Natural Resources Northern Alberta Partnership in which
Birchcliff has an existing interest and an approximate 100% working interest in an extensive network of
sour gas gathering and compression systems.
The Assets include 252 Gross (194 Net) producing oil/natural gas wells and 39 Gross (10 Net) non-
producing oil/natural gas wells at March 31, 2016. The average production from the Assets for the first half
of 2016 is approximately 26,000 boe/d (41% oil and NGL). The Assets provide a stable production base, a
decline rate of approximately 20% and a total proved plus probable company Gross reserve base of 191,133
Mboe as at March 31, 2016.
The Assets have the following characteristics:

out in Schedule “A” to this Report under the heading “Disclosure of Reserves Data – Pricing Assumptions” (the
“McDaniel Price Forecast”).
Calculated by dividing reserves estimated by McDaniel as at March 31, 2016 by the average production for the Assets for
the first half of 2016 of approximately 26,000 boe/d. See “Notes on Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information –
Oil and Gas Metrics”.
Reserves data and other oil and gas information in respect of the Assets is set forth in Schedule “A” to this
Report.
All

Acquisition Date
The closing date of the Acquisition was July 28, 2016.
Consideration
The total consideration for the Acquisition was approximately $625 million, prior to adjustments.
The Corporation paid a $31.25 million deposit to the Vendor in connection with the Acquisition, the full
amount of which was drawn down under the Corporation’s extendible revolving credit facilities (the
“Credit Facilities”). The remaining cash required to close the Acquisition was financed by the aggregate
net proceeds of the bought deal financing of 107,520,000 subscription receipts of the Corporation
(“Subscription Receipts”) at a price of $6.25 per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of $672,000,000
(the “Offering”) and a concurrent private placement of 3,000,000 Subscription Receipts at a price of $6.25
per Subscription Receipt for gross proceeds of $18,750,000 (the “Concurrent Private Placement”). The
Offering and the Concurrent Private Placement closed concurrently on July 13, 2016.
Each Subscription Receipt entitled the holder to receive, without payment of additional consideration or
further action on the part of the holder, one common share of the Corporation on July 28, 2016, the closing
date of the Acquisition.
Effect on Financial Position
In connection with the Acquisition, the Corporation completed the Offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement as disclosed under Item 2.3 – Consideration. In addition, in connection with the closing of the
Acquisition, the Credit Facilities were amended to increase the borrowing base to $950 million from $750
million.
Except as otherwise publicly disclosed and in the ordinary course of business and other than in respect of
changes that occurred as a result of the Acquisition, the Corporation does not presently have any plans or
proposals for material changes in the business affairs of the Corporation or with respect to the Assets that
2.4

may have a significant effect on the financial performance and financial position of the Corporation,
including any proposal to liquidate the business or to sell, lease or exchange all or a substantial portion of
the Assets.
Please see the pro forma operating statements attached to this Report as Schedule “C”.
Prior Valuations
No valuation opinion was obtained within the last 12 months by the Corporation that was required by
securities legislation, or by any Canadian exchange or market, to support the consideration paid by the
Corporation for the Assets.
Parties to Transaction
The Acquisition did not involve “informed persons”, “associates” or “affiliates” (as each term is defined in
securities legislation) of the Corporation.

Conventions
Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Report to “$”, “CDN$” or “dollars” are to Canadian dollars and
references to “US$” are to United States dollars. All financial information contained in this Report has been
presented in accordance with Canadian generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).

NON-GAAP MEASURES
This Report uses “netback”, which term does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore
may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies where similar terminology is used.
“Netback” denotes petroleum and natural gas revenue less royalties, less operating expenses and less transportation
and marketing expenses. All netbacks are calculated on a per unit basis. Management believes that netback assists
management and investors in assessing operational performance as it demonstrates field level profitability relative to
current commodity prices.

NOTES ON RESERVES DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
Caution Respecting Reserves Information
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating the quantities of reserves and the future net revenues
attributed to those reserves. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and costs assumptions will be attained and
variances could be material. The recovery and reserves estimates of reserves provided in this Report are estimates
only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual reserves may be greater than or
less than the estimates provided herein and variances could be material.
Definitions
Certain terms used herein are defined in National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas
Activities (“NI-51-101”), Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 51-324 – Revised Glossary to NI 51-101
Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (“CSA Staff Notice 51-324”) and/or the Canadian Oil and Gas
Evaluation Handbook (the “COGE Handbook”) and, unless the context otherwise requires, shall have the same
meanings in this Report as in NI 51-101, CSA Staff Notice 51-324 or the COGE Handbook, as the case may be.
Barrels of Oil Equivalent
Boe amounts have been calculated by using the conversion ratio of 6 Mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil. Boe amounts
may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl is based on an
energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value
equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to
natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis
may be misleading as an indication of value.
Reserves for Portion of Properties
With respect to the disclosure of reserves contained in this Report relating to portions of an issuer’s properties, the
estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as
estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effects of aggregation.
Future Net Revenue
Estimates of future net revenue, whether calculated without discount or using a discount rate, do not represent fair
market value.
Oil and Gas Metrics
This Report contains certain oil and gas metrics which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of
calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies and
should not be used to make comparisons. Such metrics have been included in this Report to provide readers with
additional measures to evaluate the Corporation’s performance; however, such measures are not reliable indicators
of the Corporation’s future performance and future performance may not compare to its performance in previous
periods and therefore such metrics should not be unduly relied upon.
Reserves life index in this Report is calculated by dividing reserves estimated by McDaniel as at March 31, 2016 by
the average production for the Assets for the first half of 2016 of approximately 26,000 boe/d.
For information regarding netbacks, including how netbacks are calculated, see “Non-GAAP Measures”.
Reserves Categories
Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be
recoverable from known accumulations, as of a given date, based on the analysis of drilling, geological, geophysical
and engineering data; the use of established technology; and specified economic conditions, which are generally
accepted as being reasonable.
5
Reserves are classified according to the degree of certainty associated with the estimates:



“Proved reserves” are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be
recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved
reserves.
“Probable reserves” are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved
reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the
sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.
“Possible reserves” are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable
reserves. It is unlikely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of the estimated
proved plus probable plus possible reserves.
Development and Production Status of Reserves
Each of the reserves categories (proved, probable and possible) may be divided into developed and undeveloped
categories:


“Developed reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed
facilities or, if facilities have not been installed, that would involve a low expenditure (e.g., when compared
to the cost of drilling a well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided
into producing and non-producing.
o
o
“Developed producing reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from
completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing
or, if shut-in, they must have previously been on production, and the date of resumption of
production must be known with reasonable certainty.
“Developed non-producing reserves” are those reserves that either have not been on production,
or have previously been on production but are shut-in and the date of resumption of production is
unknown.
“Undeveloped reserves” are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a
significant expenditure (e.g., when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them
capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves category (proved, probable,
possible) to which they are assigned.
In multi-well pools it may be appropriate to allocate total pool reserves between the developed and undeveloped
categories or to subdivide the developed reserves for the pool between developed producing and developed non‐
producing. This allocation should be based on the estimator’s assessment as to the reserves that will be recovered
from specific wells, facilities, and completion intervals in the pool and their respective development and production
status.
Levels of Certainty for Reported Reserves
The qualitative certainty levels referred to in the definitions above are applicable to “individual reserves entities”,
which refers to the lowest level at which reserves calculations are performed, and to “reported reserves”, which
refers to the highest level sum of individual entity estimates for which reserves estimates are presented. Reported
reserves should target the following levels of certainty under a specific set of economic conditions:



at least a 90% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimated proved
reserves;
at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the
estimated proved plus probable reserves; and
at least a 10% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the sum of the
estimated proved plus probable plus possible reserves.
6
A quantitative measure of the certainty levels pertaining to estimates prepared for the various reserves categories is
desirable to provide a clearer understanding of the associated risks and uncertainties. However, the majority of
reserves estimates are prepared using deterministic methods that do not provide a mathematically derived
quantitative measure of probability. In principle, there should be no difference between estimates prepared using
probabilistic or deterministic methods.
Interest in Reserves, Production, Wells and Properties
“Gross” means: (a) in relation to an issuer’s interest in production or reserves, the issuer’s working interest
issuer; (b) in relation to wells, the total number of wells in which the issuer has an interest; and (c) in relation to
properties, the total area of properties in which the issuer has an interest.
“Net” means: (a) in relation to an issuer’s interest in production or reserves, the issuer’s working interest (operating
(operating or non‐operating) share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests of the
or non‐operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations, plus the issuer’s royalty interests in production or
reserves; (b) in relation to the issuer’s interest in wells, the number of wells obtained by aggregating the issuer’s
working interest in each of its gross wells; and (c) in relation to the issuer’s interest in a property, the total area in
which the issuer has an interest multiplied by the working interest owned by the issuer.
Forecast Prices and Costs
“Forecast prices and costs” means future prices and costs that are: (a) generally accepted as being a reasonable
outlook of the future; (b) if, and only to the extent that, there are fixed or presently determinable future prices or
costs to which the issuer is legally bound by a contractual or other obligation to supply a physical product, including
those for an extension period of a contract that is likely to be extended, those prices or costs rather than the prices
and costs referred to in paragraph (a).
Gross Volumes of Reserves
Unless otherwise indicated, all reserves volumes presented herein are on a “gross” basis.

SCHEDULE “A”
RESERVES DATA AND OTHER OIL AND GAS INFORMATION
Disclosure of Reserves Data
The reserves data for the Assets set forth below is based upon the Birchcliff Report with an effective date as of
March 31, 2016. The reserves data summarizes the light crude oil and medium crude oil, conventional natural gas,
shale gas and NGL reserves and the net present value of future net revenue attributable to such reserves as evaluated
in the Birchcliff Report based on the McDaniel Price Forecast. All reserves associated with the Assets are located in
the Province of Alberta. As the tables below summarize the data contained in the Birchcliff Report, they may
contain slightly different numbers than the Birchcliff Report due to rounding. Also due to rounding, certain columns
may not add exactly.
The Assets had previously been evaluated by McDaniel for the Vendor effective December 31, 2015 (the “Vendor
Report”). Subsequently, the Corporation engaged McDaniel to prepare the Birchcliff Report effective March 31,
2016. The Birchcliff Report is based on certain factual data supplied by the Vendor and the opinion of McDaniel of
reasonable practice in the industry. The extent and character of ownership and all factual data pertaining to
petroleum properties and contracts (except for certain information residing in the public domain) were supplied by
the Vendor to McDaniel. McDaniel accepted this data as presented and neither title searches nor field inspections
were conducted. The Birchcliff Report was prepared by McDaniel for Birchcliff in connection with the Acquisition.
As a result, Birchcliff participated in the preparation of the Birchcliff Report and reviewed the reserves data with
McDaniel in conjunction with the preparation thereof. In assessing the reserves attributable to the Assets in the
Birchcliff Report, McDaniel utilized Birchcliff’s proposed field development plans for the Assets and utilized the
McDaniel Price Forecast, which are different than the Vendor’s development plans and the price forecast utilized in
the Vendor Report.
The net present value of future net revenue attributable to the Assets by the Birchcliff Report is based on the
McDaniel Price Forecast and is determined before provision for interest and general and administrative expense and
after the deduction of royalties, operating costs, development costs and abandonment and reclamation costs.
Abandonment and reclamation costs have been estimated by McDaniel in the Birchcliff Report, are attributed to all
existing and future wells that were assigned reserves in the Birchcliff Report and shut-in or suspended wells to
which no reserves were assigned and do not include abandonment and reclamation costs for facilities.
Well abandonment and reclamation costs used by McDaniel were not independently evaluated and were assumed to
be equal to the average costs for the Corporation’s regional reclamation cost area set forth in Directive 11 from the
Alberta Energy Regulator. The abandonment and reclamation costs for the shut-in or suspended wells to which no
reserves were assigned were supplied by the Vendor and were based on a cost per well that was greater than that
used for the wells to which reserves were attributed.
There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and the
future cash flows attributed to such reserves, including many factors beyond the control of the Corporation. The
reserves and associated cash flow information set forth in the Report are estimates only. In general, estimates of
economically recoverable oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and the future net cash flows therefrom are based upon
a number of variable factors and assumptions, such as historical production from the properties, initial production
rates, production decline rates, ultimate reserve recovery, the timing and amount of capital expenditures, the success
of future development activities, future commodity prices, marketability of oil, natural gas and NGL, royalty rates,
the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and future operating costs, all of which may vary
materially from actual results. For those reasons, estimates of the economically recoverable oil, natural gas and NGL
reserves attributable to any particular group of properties, classification of such reserves based on risk of recovery
and estimates of future net revenues associated with reserves prepared by different engineers, or by the same
engineer at different times may vary substantially. The actual production, revenues, taxes and development and
operating expenditures with respect to the Assets will vary from estimates thereof and such variations could be
material.
It should not be assumed that the undiscounted or discounted net present value of future net revenue attributable to
the Assets estimated by McDaniel represent the fair market value of those reserves. There is no assurance that the
A-1
forecast prices and costs assumptions will be attained and variances could be material. The recovery and reserves
estimates of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves attributable to the Assets provided herein are estimates only and there
is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual oil, natural gas and NGL reserves may be
greater than or less than the estimates provided herein and variances could be material.
Estimates of reserves and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same confidence level as
estimates of reserves and future net revenue for all properties due to the effects of aggregation.
The information relating to the oil, natural gas and NGL reserves of the Assets contains forward-looking
information, including information relating to future net revenues, forecast capital expenditures, future development
plans and costs related thereto, forecast operating costs, anticipated production and abandonment and reclamation
costs. See “Forward-Looking Information” in the Report.
For additional information, please see “Notes on Reserves Data and Other Oil and Gas Information” in the Report
and “Risk Factors – Business and Operational Risks – Uncertainty of Reserves and Resource Estimates” in the
Corporation’s revised annual information form dated July 6, 2016 for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the
“Annual Information Form”).

Additional Information Relating to Reserves Data
Undeveloped Reserves
Undeveloped reserves are attributed by McDaniel in accordance with standards and procedures contained in the
COGE Handbook. Proved undeveloped reserves are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of
certainty and are expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure is required to
render them capable of production. Probable undeveloped reserves are those reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than proved reserves and are expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant
expenditure is required to render them capable of production. Proved and probable undeveloped reserves have been
assigned in accordance with engineering and geological practices as defined under NI 51‐101. The majority of the
undeveloped reserves are currently scheduled to be developed by the Corporation in the next four years.
In some cases, it will take longer than four years to develop these reserves. There are a number of factors that could
result in delayed or cancelled development, including the following: (a) changing economic conditions (due to
pricing, operating and capital expenditure fluctuations); (b) changing technical conditions (including production
anomalies, such as water breakthrough or accelerated depletion); (c) multi-zone developments (for instance, a
prospective formation completion may be delayed until the initial completion formation is no longer economic); (d)
a larger development program may need to be spread out over several years to optimize capital allocation and
facility utilization; and (e) surface access issues (including those relating to land owners, weather conditions and
regulatory approvals).
Proved Undeveloped Reserves
Proved undeveloped reserves have been assigned in known accumulations where the reserves can be estimated with
a high degree of certainty. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved
reserves. McDaniel has assigned 51,633.6 Mboe of proved undeveloped reserves in the Birchcliff Report with
$330.3 million of associated undiscounted capital, of which nil is forecast to be spent in the first year.
Probable Undeveloped Reserves
Probable undeveloped reserves have been assigned in known accumulations where the reserves can be estimated
with less certainty. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the
proved plus probable reserves. In most instances probable undeveloped reserves have been assigned on lands in the
area with existing producing wells but there is some uncertainty as to whether they are directly analogous to the
producing accumulation or pool. McDaniel has assigned 74,667.8 Mboe of probable undeveloped reserves in the
Birchcliff Report with $381.1 million of incremental capital over and above the proved undeveloped capital.
Significant Factors or Uncertainties Affecting Reserves Data
The process of estimating reserves is inherently complex. It requires significant judgments and decisions based on
available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. These estimates may change substantially as
additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as
economic conditions impacting oil and natural gas prices and costs change. The reserves estimates contained in the
Report are based on production forecasts, prices and economic conditions applicable at the effective date of the
Birchcliff Report.
As circumstances change and additional data becomes available, reserve estimates also change. Estimates are
reviewed and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by the new information. Revisions are often
required due to changes in well performance, prices, economic conditions and governmental restrictions.
Although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates are accurate, reserve estimation is an
inferential science. As a result, subjective decisions, new geological or production information and a changing
A-5
environment may impact these estimates. Revisions to reserve estimates can arise from changes in year‐end oil and
natural gas prices and reservoir performance. Such revisions can be either positive or negative.
Changes in future commodity prices relative to the forecasts described above under “Pricing Assumptions”
could have a negative impact on the reserves associated with the Assets, and in particular on the development of
undeveloped reserves, unless future development costs are adjusted in parallel. The Assets include a significant
amount of proved and probable undeveloped reserves. At the forecast prices and costs used in the Birchcliff Report,
these development activities are expected to be economic. However, should oil and natural gas prices decrease
materially, these activities may need to be deferred to ensuing years to remain economic or may not be pursued at
all. Other than the foregoing and the factors disclosed or described herein, the Corporation does not anticipate any
other significant economic factors or other significant uncertainties which may affect any particular components of
the reserves data in respect of the Assets.
See also “Risk Factors – Business and Operational Risks – Uncertainty of Reserves and Resource Estimates” in the
Annual Information Form.
Abandonment and Reclamation Costs
In connection with the operations associated with the Assets,
incur abandonment and
reclamation costs for surface leases, wells, facilities and pipelines. The expected total reserve well abandonment and
reclamation costs, net of estimated salvage value, included in the Birchcliff Report for the 255 Net wells under the
proved reserves category is $51.6 million undiscounted, of which a total of $1.5 million is estimated to be incurred
in the next three financial years.

Future Development Costs
The following table sets forth the future development costs that have been deducted in the estimation of future net
revenue attributable to the reserves in respect of the Assets estimated by McDaniel in the Birchcliff Report,
calculated without discount. The future capital set forth below includes ongoing maintenance and optimization
capital that is forecast for existing producing wells.

The Corporation expects to be able to fund the development costs required in the future primarily from working
capital, internally generated cash flow, existing credit facilities and access to debt. Interest and other costs of
external funding are not included in the future net revenue estimates. The Corporation does not expect any
inordinate costs to be associated with such funding sources. There can be no guarantee that funds will be available
or that the Corporation will allocate funding to develop all of the reserves attributed to the Assets. Failure to develop
those reserves would have a negative impact on future production and cash flow estimated by McDaniel.

As at March 31, 2016, there were no undeveloped land holdings associated with the Assets that could expire by
December 31, 2016.
Significant Factors or Uncertainties Relevant to Properties with No Attributed Reserves
There are several economic factors and significant uncertainties that affect the anticipated development of properties
with no attributed reserves. The Corporation will be required to make substantial capital expenditures in order to
prove, exploit, develop and produce oil and natural gas from these properties in the future. If the Corporation’s cash
flow from operations is not sufficient to satisfy its capital expenditure requirements, there can be no assurance that
additional debt or equity financing will be available to meet these requirements or, if available, that the terms will be
acceptable to the Corporation. Failure to obtain such financing on a timely basis could cause the Corporation to
forfeit its interest in certain properties, miss certain opportunities and reduce its development activities. An inability
of the Corporation to access sufficient capital for its exploration and development programs could have a material
adverse effect on the Corporation’s ability to execute its business strategy to develop the Assets.
The significant economic factors that affect the Corporation’s future development of the Assets to which no reserves
have been attributed are: (a) future commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas (and the Corporation’s outlook
relating to such prices); (b) the future capital costs of drilling, completing, tying in and equipping the wells
necessary to develop such lands at the relevant times; (c) the future costs of operating wells at the relevant times;
and (d) the levels of royalties applicable to production from such lands.
Significant uncertainties relating to each of the following matters affect the Corporation’s development of the Assets
to which no reserves have been attributed: (a) the ability of the Corporation to obtain the capital necessary to fund
the development of such lands at the relevant times; (b) the Corporation’s outlook with respect to commodity prices
supporting proposed development activities; (c) the future drilling and completion results the Corporation achieves
in its development activities (e.g. with respect to the development of particular intervals or geographic areas, the
uncertainty would be whether the initial drilling completion results are sufficient to justify the development of such
interval or geographic area); (d) drilling and completion results achieved by others on lands in proximity to the
Assets; (e) transportation and processing infrastructure becoming available on a timeline consistent with the
Corporation’s development plans; (f) the availability of regulatory approvals for development of the lands and the
necessary infrastructure; and (g) governmental actions and future changes to applicable regulatory or royalty
regimes that affect timing or economics of proposed development activities.
All of these uncertainties have the potential to delay the development of such lands. On the other hand, uncertainty
as to the timing and nature of the evolution or development of better exploration, drilling, completion and
production technologies have the potential to accelerate development activities and enhance the economics relating
to the development of such lands.

The Corporation believes there are no unusually significant abandonment and reclamation costs associated with the
Assets to which no reserves have been attributed.

Independent Auditor’s Report 
 
To the Board of Directors of 
Encana Corporation 
 
 
We have audited the accompanying operating statement containing gross sales, royalties, production costs 
and operating income for the Gordondale area (the “Gordondale Assets”) for the year ended December 31, 
2015, and the related notes, which comprise a summary of significant accounting policies and other 
explanatory information (together, the “operation statement”). 
 
Management’s responsibility for the operating statement 
Management is responsible for the preparation of the operating statement of the Gordondale Assets in 
accordance with the financial reporting framework specified in subsection 3.11(5) of National Instrument 
52-107, Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards for operating statements of an 
acquired oil and gas property, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to 
enable the preparation of the operating statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to 
fraud or error. 
 
Auditor’s responsibility 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the operating statement based on our audit. We conducted 
our audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards. Those standards require 
that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the operating statement is free from material misstatement.  
 
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in 
the operating statement. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the 
assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the operating statement, whether due to fraud or 
error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s 
preparation of the operating statement in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the 
circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal 
control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall 
presentation of the operating statement. 
 
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our 
audit opinion.

Gordondale Assets 
Notes to Operating Statement Containing Gross Sales, Royalties, Production Costs and 
Operating Income
1. Background and Basis of Presentation 
 
The  operating  statement  containing  gross  sales,  royalties,  production  costs  and  operating  income  reflects  the  net 
working interest of operating results relating to certain oil and natural gas properties in the Gordondale area located 
in the Peace River Arch, Alberta (“Gordondale Assets”) which are included in the consolidated accounts of Encana 
Corporation (“Encana”). 
 
The  operating  statement  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  financial  reporting  framework  specified  in 
subsection 3.11(5) of National Instrument 52-107 Acceptable Accounting Principles and Auditing Standards for an 
operating statement of an acquired oil and gas property.  As a result, the operating statement includes the following 
line items: gross sales, royalties,  production costs and operating income. The line items in the operating statement 
have been prepared in all respects using accounting policies that are permitted by International Financial Reporting 
Standards,  with  such  accounting  policies  applying  to  those  items  as  if  such  line  items  were  presented  as  part  of  a 
complete set of financial statements. 
 
Accordingly,  the  operating  statement  does  not  include  any  provision  for  depletion,  depreciation  and  amortization, 
asset retirement costs, future capital costs, impairment of unevaluated properties, administrative expenses, interest and 
income taxes as these amounts are based on Encana’s consolidated operations of which the Gordondale Assets form 
only a part. 
 
2. Significant Accounting Policies 
 
Revenue Recognition – Gross sales of Encana’s natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids are recognized when production 
is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred, title has transferred and collectability of 
the revenue is probable.  Revenue does not include any amounts from derivative contracts. 
 
Royalties – Royalties are recorded at the time the product is produced and sold. Royalties are calculated in accordance 
with the applicable regulations and/or the terms of individual royalty agreements. 
 
Production  Costs  –  Production  Costs  include  amounts  incurred  on  extraction  of  product  to  the  surface  including 
gathering, field processing, treating and field storage. Production Costs also include operating expenses incurred on a 
field level, transportation costs and mineral tax. 
 
Joint  Interest  Operations  –  Portions  of  the  Gordondale  Assets  are  operated  through  joint  ventures;  the  operating 
statement therefore reflects only Encana’s proportionate interest.
