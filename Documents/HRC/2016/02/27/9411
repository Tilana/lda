<p><b>Annex 
</b></p>
<p><b>UNITED NATIONS HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL: 
INSTITUTION-BUILDING 
</b></p>
<p><b>I.  UNIVERSAL PERIODIC REVIEW MECHANISM 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Basis of the review 
</b></p>
<p>1. The review shall be based on the following instruments: 
</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The Charter of the United Nations; 
</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The Universal Declaration of Human Rights; 
</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Human rights instruments to which a State is party. 
</p>
<p>2. Voluntary pledges and commitments made by States, including those undertaken when 
presenting their candidatures for election to the Human Rights Council (hereinafter &#8220;the 
Council&#8221;) shall also be taken into consideration. 
</p>
<p>3. In addition to the above and given the complementary and mutually interrelated nature of 
international human rights law and international humanitarian law, the review shall take into 
account applicable international humanitarian law. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Principles and objectives 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Principles 
</b></p>
<p>4. The Universal Periodic Review (UPR) should: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Promote the universality, interdependence, indivisibility and interrelatedness of all 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Be a cooperative mechanism based on objective and reliable information and on 
interactive dialogue; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Ensure universal coverage and equal treatment of all States; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Be an intergovernmental process, United Nations Member-driven and 
action-oriented; 
</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Fully involve the country under review; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Complement and not duplicate other human rights mechanisms, thus representing an 
added value; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Be conducted in an objective, transparent, non-selective, constructive, 
non-confrontational and non-politicized manner; 
</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) Not be overly burdensome to the concerned State or to the agenda of the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>i</i>) Not be overly long; it should be realistic and not absorb a disproportionate amount of 
time, human and financial resources; 
</p>
<p>(<i>j</i>) Not diminish the Council&#8217;s capacity to respond to urgent human rights situations; 
</p>
<p>(<i>k</i>) Fully integrate a gender perspective; 
</p>
<p> (<i>l</i>) Without prejudice to the obligations contained in the elements provided for in the 
basis of review, take into account the level of development and specificities of countries; 
</p>
<p> (<i>m</i>) Ensure the participation of all relevant stakeholders, including non-governmental 
organizations and national human rights institutions (NHRIs), in accordance with 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006 and Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1996/31 of 25 July 1996, as well as any decisions that the Council may take in this 
regard. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Objectives 
</b></p>
<p>5. The objectives of the review are: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) The improvement of the human rights situation on the ground; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) The fulfilment of the State&#8217;s human rights obligations and commitments and 
assessment of positive developments and challenges faced by the State; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) The enhancement of the State&#8217;s capacity and of technical assistance, in consultation

</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) The sharing of best practice among States and other stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Support for cooperation in the promotion and protection of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) The encouragement of full cooperation and engagement with the Council, other

(OHCHR). 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Periodicity and order of the review 
</b></p>
<p>6. The review begins after the adoption of the UPR mechanism by the Council. 
</p>
<p>7. The order of review should reflect the principles of universality and equal treatment. It 
should be established as soon as possible in order to allow States to prepare adequately. 
</p>
<p>8. All member States of the Council shall be reviewed during their term of membership. The 
initial members of the Council, especially those elected for one or two-year terms, shall be 
reviewed first. A mix of member and observer States of the Council shall be reviewed; and 
equitable geographic distribution shall be respected in the selection of countries for review. 
</p>
<p>9. The first member and observer States to be reviewed shall be chosen by the drawing of lots 
from each Regional Group in such a way as to ensure full respect for equitable geographic 
distribution. Alphabetical order shall then be applied beginning with those countries thus 
selected, unless other countries volunteer to be reviewed. 
</p>
<p>10. The period between review cycles shall be reasonable so as to take into account the 
capacity of States to prepare for the next cycle and that of other stakeholders to respond to the 
requests arising from the review. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>11. The periodicity of the review for the first cycle shall be of four years. This shall imply the 
consideration of 48 States per year during three sessions of the working group of two weeks 
each.<b>1</b> 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Process and modalities of the review 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Documentation 
</b></p>
<p>12. The review shall be based on: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Information prepared by the State concerned, which can take the form of a national 
report, on the basis of general guidelines to be adopted by the Council at its sixth session (first 
session of the second cycle), and any other information considered relevant by the State 
concerned, which could be presented either orally or in writing, provided that the written 
presentation summarizing the information does not exceed 20 pages, to guarantee equal 
treatment to all States and not to overburden the mechanism. States are encouraged to prepare 
the information through a broad consultation process at the national level with all relevant 
stakeholders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Additionally a compilation prepared by OHCHR of the information contained in 
the reports of treaty bodies, special procedures, including observations and comments by 
the State concerned, and other relevant official United Nations documents, which shall not 
exceed 10 pages. 
</p>
<p>13. The Council shall also take into consideration additional credible and reliable information 
provided by other relevant stakeholders to UPR. OHCHR will prepare a summary of such 
information which shall not exceed 10 pages. 
</p>
<p>                                                 
</p>
<p><b>1
</b>  UPR is an evolving process; the Council, after the conclusion of the first review cycle, may 
</p>
<p>review the modalities and the periodicity of this mechanism, based on best practices and lessons 
learned. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>14. The documents prepared by OHCHR shall be elaborated following the structure of the 
general guidelines adopted by the Council regarding the information prepared by the State 
concerned. 
</p>
<p>15. Both the State&#8217;s written presentation and the summaries prepared by OHCHR shall be 
ready six weeks prior to the review by the working group to ensure the distribution of documents 
simultaneously in the six official languages of the United Nations, in accordance with 
General Assembly resolution 53/208 of 14 January 1999. 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Modalities 
</b></p>
<p>16. The modalities of the review shall be as follows: 
</p>

</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Observer States may participate in the review, including in the interactive dialogue; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Other relevant stakeholders may attend the review in the Working Group; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) A group of three rapporteurs, selected by the drawing of lots among the members of 
the Council and from different Regional Groups (<i>troika</i>) shall be established to facilitate each 
review, including the preparation of the report of the working group. OHCHR shall provide the 
necessary assistance and expertise to the rapporteurs. 
</p>
<p>17. The concerned country may request that one of the three rapporteurs be from its own 
Regional Group and may also request the substitution of a rapporteur on only one occasion. 
</p>
<p>18. A rapporteur may ask to be excused from participation in a specific review process. 
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>countries, particularly the Least Developed Countries, in the UPR mechanism. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>19. Interactive dialogue between the country under review and the Council will take place in

</p>
<p><b>3

</p>
<p>36. Technical and objective requirements for eligible candidates for mandate-holders will be 
approved by the Council at its sixth session (first session of the second cycle), in order to ensure 
that eligible candidates are highly qualified individuals who possess established competence,

 <p> 
</p>
<p>38. OHCHR shall immediately prepare, maintain and periodically update a public list of 
eligible candidates in a standardized format, which shall include personal data, areas of expertise 
and professional experience. Upcoming vacancies of mandates shall be publicized. 
</p>
<p>39. The principle of non-accumulation of human rights functions at a time shall be respected. 
</p>
<p>40. A mandate-holder&#8217;s tenure in a given function, whether a thematic or country mandate, 
shall be no longer than six years<b> </b>(two terms of three years for thematic mandate-holders). 
</p>
<p>41. Individuals holding decision-making positions in Government or in any other organization 
or entity which may give rise to a conflict of interest with the responsibilities inherent to the 
mandate shall be excluded. Mandate-holders serve in their personal capacity. 
</p>
<p>42. A consultative group shall be established to propose to the President, at least one month 
before the beginning of the session in which the Council shall consider the selection<b> </b>of 
mandate-holders, a list of candidates who possess the highest qualifications for the mandates in 
question and meet the general criteria and particular requirements. 
</p>
<p>43. The consultative group shall also give due consideration to the exclusion of nominated 
candidates from the public list of eligible candidates brought to its attention. 
</p>
<p>44. At the beginning of the annual cycle of the Council, Regional Groups shall be invited to 
appoint a member of the consultative group, who will serve in his/her personal capacity. The 
Group shall be assisted by OHCHR. 
</p>
<p>45. The consultative group shall consider candidates included in the public list; however, 
under exceptional circumstances and if a particular post justifies it, the Group may consider 
additional nominations with equal or more suitable qualifications for the post. Recommendations 
to the President shall be public and substantiated. 
</p>
<p>46. The consultative group shall take into account, as appropriate, the views of stakeholders, 
including the current or outgoing mandate-holders, in determining the necessary expertise, 
experience, skills, and other relevant requirements for each mandate. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>47. On the basis of the recommendations of the consultative group and following broad 
consultations, in particular through the regional coordinators, the President of the Council shall 
identify an appropriate candidate for each vacancy. The President shall present to member States 
and observers a list of candidates at least two weeks prior to the beginning of the session in 
which the Council will consider the appointments. 
</p>
<p>48. If necessary, the President may conduct further consultations to ensure the endorsement 
of the proposed candidates. The appointment of the special procedures mandate-holders 
shall be completed upon the subsequent approval of the Council and before the end of the 
session. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Review, rationalization and improvement of mandates 
</b></p>
<p>49. The review, rationalization and improvement of mandates, as well as the creation of new 
ones, shall be guided by the principles of universality, impartiality, objectivity and 
non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and cooperation, with a view to enhancing 
the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, political, economic, social and cultural 
rights, including the right to development. 
</p>
<p>50. The review, rationalization and improvement of each mandate shall take place in the 
context of the negotiations of the relevant resolutions. An assessment of the mandate may take 
place in a separate segment of the interactive dialogue between the Council and special 
procedures mandate-holders. 
</p>
<p>51. The review, rationalization and improvement of mandates shall focus on the relevance, 
scope and contents of the mandates, having as a framework the internationally recognized 
human rights standards, the system of special procedures and General Assembly 
resolution 60/251. 
</p>
<p>52. Any decision to streamline, merge or possibly discontinue mandates shall always be 
guided by the need for improvement of the enjoyment and protection of human rights. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>53. The Council shall always strive for improvements: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Mandates shall always offer a clear prospect of an increased level of human rights 
protection and promotion as well as being coherent within the system of human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Equal attention shall be paid to all human rights. The balance of thematic mandates 
shall broadly reflect the equal importance of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights, 
including the right to development; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Every effort shall be made to avoid unnecessary duplication; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Areas which constitute thematic gaps shall be identified and addressed, including by 
means other than the creation of special procedures mandates, such as by expanding an existing 
mandate, bringing a cross-cutting issue to the attention of mandate-holders or by requesting a 
joint action to the relevant mandate-holders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Any consideration of merging mandates shall have regard to the content and 
predominant functions of each mandate, as well as to the workload of individual 
mandate-holders; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) In creating or reviewing mandates, efforts shall be made to identify whether the 
structure of the mechanism (expert, rapporteur or working group) is the most effective in terms 
of increasing human rights protection; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) New mandates shall be as clear and specific as possible, so as to avoid ambiguity. 
</p>
<p>54. It may be considered desirable to have a uniform nomenclature of mandate-holders, titles 
of mandates as well as a selection and appointment process, to make the whole system more 
understandable. 
</p>
<p>55. Thematic mandate periods shall be of three years. Country mandate periods shall be of 
one year. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>56. Mandates included in Appendix I, where applicable, are renewed until the date on which 
they will be considered by the Council according to the programme of work.<b>4</b> 
</p>
<p>57. Current mandate-holders may continue serving, provided they have not exceeded the 
six-year term limit (Appendix II). On an exceptional basis, the term of those mandate-holders 
who have served more than six years may be extended until the relevant mandate is considered 
by the Council and the selection and appointment process has concluded. 
</p>
<p>58. Decisions to create, review or discontinue country mandates shall also take into account 
the principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue aimed at strengthening the capacity of 
Member States to comply with their human rights obligations. 
</p>
<p>59. In case of violations of human rights or lack of cooperation that require the Council&#8217;s 
attention, the principles of objectivity, non-selectivity, elimination of double standards and 
avoidance of politicization shall apply. 
</p>
<p><b>III.  HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL ADVISORY COMMITTEE 
</b></p>

and another third for two years. The staggering of terms of membership shall be defined by the 
drawing of lots. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Functions 
</b></p>
<p>70. The function of the Advisory Committee is to provide expertise to the Council in the 
manner and form requested by the Council, focusing mainly on studies and research-based 
advice. Further, such expertise shall be rendered only upon the latter&#8217;s request, in compliance 
with its resolutions and under its guidance. 
</p>
<p>71. The Advisory Committee shall be implementation-oriented and the scope of its advice 
should be limited to thematic issues pertaining to the mandate of the Council; namely promotion 
and protection of all human rights. 
</p>
<p>72. The Advisory Committee shall not adopt resolutions or decisions. The Advisory 
Committee may propose within the scope of the work set out by the Council, for the latter&#8217;s 
consideration and approval, suggestions for further enhancing its procedural efficiency, as well 
as further investigation proposals within the scope of the work set out by the Council. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>73. The Council shall issue specific guidelines for the Advisory Committee when it requests a 
substantive contribution from the latter and shall review all or any portion of those guidelines if 
it deems necessary in the future. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Methods of work 
</b></p>
<p>74. The Advisory Committee shall convene up to two sessions for a maximum of 10 working 
days per year. Additional sessions may be scheduled on an ad hoc basis with prior approval of 
the Council. 
</p>
<p>75. The Council may request the Advisory Committee to undertake certain tasks through a 
smaller team or individually. The Advisory Committee shall report on such efforts to the 
Council. 
</p>
<p>76. Members of the Advisory Committee are encouraged to communicate between sessions, 
individually or in teams. However, the Advisory Committee shall not establish subsidiary bodies 
unless the Council authorizes it to do so. 
</p>
<p>77. In the performance of its mandate, the Advisory Committee is urged to establish 
interaction with States, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and 
other civil society entities in accordance with the modalities of the Council. 
</p>
<p>78. Member States and observers, including States that are not members of the Council, the 
specialized agencies, other intergovernmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions, as well as non-governmental organizations shall be entitled to participate in the work 
of the Advisory Committee based on arrangements, including Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1996/31 and practices observed by the Commission on Human Rights and the 
Council, while ensuring the most effective contribution of these entities. 
</p>
<p>79. The Council will decide at its sixth session (first session of its second cycle) on the most 
appropriate mechanisms to continue the work of the Working Groups on Indigenous 
Populations; Contemporary Forms of Slavery; Minorities; and the Social Forum. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>IV.  COMPLAINT PROCEDURE 
</b></p>
<p><b>A.  Objective and scope 
</b></p>
<p>80. A complaint procedure is being established to address consistent patterns of gross and 
reliably attested violations of all human rights and all fundamental freedoms occurring in any 
part of the world and under any circumstances. 
</p>
<p>81. Economic and Social Council resolution 1503 (XLVIII) of 27 May 1970 as revised by 
resolution 2000/3 of 19 June 2000 serves as a working basis and has been improved where 
necessary, so as to ensure that the complaint procedure is impartial, objective, efficient, 
victims-oriented and conducted in a timely manner. The procedure shall retain its confidential 
nature, with a view to enhancing cooperation with the State concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Admissibility criteria for communications 
</b></p>
<p>82. A communication related to a violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, for the 
purpose of this procedure, shall be admissible, provided that: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) It is not manifestly politically motivated and its object is consistent with the Charter 
of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other applicable 
instruments in the field of human rights law; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) It gives a factual description of the alleged violations, including the rights which are 
alleged to be violated; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Its language is not abusive. However, such a communication may be considered if it 
meets the other criteria for admissibility after deletion of the abusive language; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) It is submitted by a person or a group of persons claiming to have suffered violations 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms, or by any person or group of persons, including 
non-governmental organizations, acting in good faith in accordance with the principles of human 
rights, not resorting to politically motivated stands contrary to the provisions of the Charter of 
the United Nations and claiming to have direct and reliable knowledge of the violations </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>concerned. Nonetheless, reliably attested communications shall not be inadmissible solely 
because the knowledge of the individual authors is second-hand, provided that they are 
accompanied by clear evidence; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) It is not exclusively based on reports disseminated by mass media; 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) It does not refer to a case that appears to reveal a consistent pattern of gross and 
reliably attested violations of human rights already being dealt with by a special procedure, a 
treaty body or other United Nations or similar regional complaints procedure in the field of 
human rights; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Domestic remedies have been exhausted, unless it appears that such remedies would 
be ineffective or unreasonably prolonged. 
</p>
<p>83. National human rights institutions (NHRIs), established and operating under the Principles 
Relating to the Status of National Institutions (the Paris Principles), in particular in regard to 
quasi-judicial competence, may serve as effective means of addressing individual human rights 
violations. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Working groups 
</b></p>
<p>84. Two distinct working groups shall be established with the mandate to examine the 
communications and to bring to the attention of the Council consistent patterns of gross and 
reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
</p>
<p>85. Both working groups shall, to the greatest possible extent, work on the basis of consensus. 
In the absence of consensus, decisions shall be taken by simple majority of the votes. They may 
establish their own rules of procedure. 
</p>
<p><b>1.  Working Group on Communications:  composition, mandate and powers 
</b></p>
<p>86. The Advisory Committee shall appoint five of its members, one from each Regional 
Group, with due consideration to gender balance, to constitute the Working Group on 
Communications. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>87. In case of a vacancy, the Advisory Committee shall appoint an independent and highly 
qualified expert of the same Regional Group from the Advisory Committee. 
</p>
<p>88. Since there is a need for independent expertise and continuity with regard to the 
examination and assessment of communications received, the independent and highly qualified 
experts of the Working Group on Communications shall be appointed for three years. Their 
mandate shall be renewable only once. 
</p>
<p>89. The Chairperson of the Working Group on Communications shall, together with the 
secretariat, undertake an initial screening of communications received, based on the admissibility 
criteria, before transmitting them to the States concerned. Manifestly ill-founded or anonymous 
communications shall be screened out by the Chairperson and shall therefore not be transmitted 
to the State concerned. In a perspective of accountability and transparency, the Chairperson of 
the Working Group on Communications shall provide all its members with a list of all 
communications rejected after initial screening. This list shall indicate the grounds of all 
decisions resulting in the rejection of a communication. All other communications, which have 
not been screened out, shall be transmitted to the State concerned, so as to obtain the views of 
the latter on the allegations of violations. 
</p>
<p>90. The members of the Working Group on Communications shall decide on the admissibility 
of a communication and assess the merits of the allegations of violations, including whether the 
communication alone or in combination with other communications appear to reveal a consistent 
pattern of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The 
Working Group on Communications shall provide the Working Group on Situations with a file 
containing all admissible communications as well as recommendations thereon. When a case 
requires further consideration or additional information, the Working Group on Communications 
may keep the situation under review until its next session and request such information from the 
State concerned. The Working Group on Communications may decide to dismiss a case. All 
decisions of the Working Group on Communications shall be based on a rigorous application of 
the admissibility criteria and duly justified. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>2.  Working Group on Situations:  composition, mandate and powers 
</b></p>
<p>91. Each Regional Group shall appoint a representative of a member State of the Council, with 
due consideration to gender balance, to serve on the Working Group on Situations. Members 
shall be appointed for one year. Their mandate may be renewed once, if the State concerned is a 
member of the Council. 
</p>
<p>92. Members of the Working Group on Situations shall serve in their personal capacity. In 
order to fill a vacancy, the respective Regional Group to which the vacancy belongs, shall 
appoint a representative from member States of the same Regional Group. 
</p>
<p>93. The Working Group on Situations is requested, on the basis of the information and 
recommendations provided by the Working Group on Communications, to present the Council 
with a report on consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of human rights and 
fundamental freedoms and to make recommendations to the Council on the course of action to 
take, normally in the form of a draft resolution or decision with respect to the situations referred 
to it. When a case requires further consideration or additional information, members of the 
Working Group on Situations may keep the situation under review until its next session. The 
Working Group on Situations may also decide to dismiss a case. 
</p>
<p>94. All decisions of the Working Group on Situations shall be duly justified and indicate why 
the consideration of a situation has been discontinued or action recommended thereon. Decisions 
to discontinue shall be adopted by consensus; if that is not possible, by simple majority of the 
votes. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Working modalities and confidentiality 
</b></p>
<p>95. Since the complaint procedure is to be, inter alia, victims-oriented and conducted in a 
confidential and timely manner, both Working Groups shall hold two meetings a year of five 
working days each, in order to promptly examine communications received, including replies 
of States thereon, and the situations already referred to the Council under the complaint 
procedure. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>96. The State concerned shall cooperate with the complaint procedure and make every effort to 
provide substantive replies in one of the United Nations official languages to any of the requests 
of the Working Groups or the Council. The State concerned shall also make every effort to 
provide a reply not later than three months after the request has been made. If necessary, this 
deadline may however be extended at the request of the State concerned. 
</p>
<p>97. The Secretariat shall make the confidential files available to all members of the Council, at 
least two weeks in advance, so as to allow sufficient time for the consideration of the files. 
</p>
<p>98. The Council shall consider consistent patterns of gross and reliably attested violations of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms brought to its attention by the Working Group on 
Situations as frequently as needed, but at least once a year. 
</p>
<p>99. The reports of the Working Group on Situations referred to the Council shall be examined 
in a confidential manner, unless the Council decides otherwise. When the Working Group on 
Situations recommends that the Council consider a situation in a public meeting, in particular in 
the case of manifest and unequivocal lack of cooperation, the Council shall consider such 
recommendation on a priority basis at its next session. 
</p>
<p>100. So as to ensure that the complaint procedure is victims-oriented, efficient and conducted in 
a timely manner, the period of time between the transmission of the complaint to the State 
concerned and consideration by the Council shall not, in principle, exceed 24 months. 
</p>
<p><b>E.  Involvement of the complainant and of the State concerned 
</b></p>
<p>101. The complaint procedure shall ensure that both the author of a communication and the 
State concerned are informed of the proceedings at the following key stages: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) When a communication is deemed inadmissible by the Working Group on 
Communications or when it is taken up for consideration by the Working Group on Situations; or 
when a communication is kept pending by one of the Working Groups or by the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) At the final outcome. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>102. In addition, the complainant shall be informed when his/her communication is registered 
by the complaint procedure. 
</p>
<p>103. Should the complainant request that his/her identity be kept confidential, it will not be 
transmitted to the State concerned. 
</p>
<p><b>F.  Measures 
</b></p>
<p>104. In accordance with established practice the action taken in respect of a particular situation 
should be one of the following: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) To discontinue considering the situation when further consideration or action is not 
warranted; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) To keep the situation under review and request the State concerned to provide further 
information within a reasonable period of time; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) To keep the situation under review and appoint an independent and highly qualified 
expert to monitor the situation and report back to the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) To discontinue reviewing the matter under the confidential complaint procedure in 
order to take up public consideration of the same; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) To recommend to OHCHR to provide technical cooperation, capacity-building 
assistance or advisory services to the State concerned.

</p>
<p><b>VI.  METHODS OF WORK 
</b></p>
<p>105. The methods of work, pursuant to General Assembly resolution 60/251 shall be 
transparent, impartial, equitable, fair, pragmatic; lead to clarity, predictability, and inclusiveness. 
They may also be updated and adjusted over time. 
</p>
<p><b>A.  Institutional arrangements 
</b></p>
<p><b>1.  Briefings on prospective resolutions or decisions 
</b></p>
<p>106. The briefings on prospective resolutions or decisions shall be informative only, whereby 
delegations shall be apprised of resolutions and decisions tabled or intended to be tabled. These 
briefings shall be organized by interested delegations. 
</p>
<p><b>2. President&#8217;s open-ended information meetings on resolutions, 
decisions and other related business 
</b></p>
<p>107. The President&#8217;s open-ended information meetings on resolutions, decisions and other 
related business shall provide information on the status of negotiations on draft resolutions 
and decisions so that delegations may gain an overview of the status of such drafts. 
These meetings shall have a purely informational function, combined with information on 
the extranet, and be held in a transparent and inclusive manner. They shall not serve as a 
negotiating forum. 
</p>
<p><b>3. Informal consultations on proposals convened by 
main sponsors 
</b></p>
<p>108. Informal consultations shall be the primary means for the negotiation of draft resolutions 
and decisions, and their convening shall be the responsibility of the sponsor(s). At least one 
informal open-ended consultation shall be held on each draft resolution and/or decision before it 
is considered for action by the Council. Consultations shall, as much as possible, be scheduled in 
a timely, transparent and inclusive manner that takes into account the constraints faced by 
delegations, particularly smaller ones. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><b>4.  Role of the Bureau 
</b></p>
<p>109. The Bureau shall deal with procedural and organizational matters. The Bureau shall 
regularly communicate the contents of its meetings through a timely summary report. 
</p>
<p><b>5.  Other work formats may include panel debates, seminars and round tables 
</b></p>
<p>110. Utilization of these other work formats, including topics and modalities, shall be decided 
by the Council on a case-by-case basis. They may serve as tools of the Council for enhancing 
dialogue and mutual understanding on certain issues. They shall be utilized in the context of the 
Council&#8217;s agenda and annual programme of work, and reinforce and/or complement its 
intergovernmental nature. They shall not be used to substitute or replace existing human rights 
mechanisms and established methods of work. 
</p>
<p><b>6.  High-Level Segment 
</b></p>
<p>111. The High-Level Segment shall be held once a year during the main session of the Council. 
It shall be followed by a general segment wherein delegations that did not participate in the 
High-Level Segment may deliver general statements. 
</p>
<p><b>B.  Working culture 
</b></p>
<p>112. There is need for: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Early notification of proposals; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Early submission of draft resolutions and decisions, preferably by the end of the 
penultimate week of a session; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Early distribution of all reports, particularly those of special procedures, to be 
transmitted to delegations in a timely fashion, at least 15 days in advance of their consideration 
by the Council, and in all official United Nations languages; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Proposers of a country resolution to secure the broadest possible support for their 
initiatives (preferably 15 members), before action is taken; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Restraint in resorting to resolutions, in order to avoid proliferation of resolutions 
without prejudice to the right of States to decide on the periodicity of presenting their draft 
proposals by: 
</p>
<p>(i) Minimizing unnecessary duplication of initiatives with the General Assembly/ 
Third Committee; 
</p>
<p>(ii) Clustering of agenda items; 
</p>
<p>(iii) Staggering the tabling of decisions and/or resolutions and consideration of 
action on agenda items/issues. 
</p>
<p><b>C.  Outcomes other than resolutions and decisions 
</b></p>
<p>113. These may include recommendations, conclusions, summaries of discussions and the 
President&#8217;s Statement. As such outcomes will have different legal implications, they shall 
supplement and not replace resolutions and decisions. 
</p>
<p><b>D.  Special sessions of the Council 
</b></p>
<p>114. The following provisions shall complement the general framework provided by 
General Assembly resolution 60/251 and the rules of procedure of the Human Rights Council. 
</p>
<p>115. The rules of procedure of special sessions shall be in accordance with the rules of 
procedure applicable for regular sessions of the Council. 
</p>
<p>116. The request for the holding of a special session, in accordance with paragraph 10 of 
General Assembly resolution 60/251, shall be submitted to the President and to the secretariat of 
the Council. The request shall specify the item proposed for consideration and include any other 
relevant information the sponsors may wish to provide. 
</p>
<p>117. The special session shall be convened as soon as possible after the formal request is 
communicated, but, in principle, not earlier than two working days, and not later than five 
working days after the formal receipt of the request. The duration of the special session shall not 
exceed three days (six working sessions), unless the Council decides otherwise. </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p>118. The secretariat of the Council shall immediately communicate the request for the holding 
of a special session and any additional information provided by the sponsors, as well as the dates 
of the special session, to all United Nations Member States and make the information available 
to the specialized agencies, other intergovernmental organizations and national human rights 
institutions, as well as to non-governmental organizations in consultative status by the most 
expedient and expeditious means of communication. Special session documentation, in particular 
draft resolutions and decisions, shall be made available in all official United Nations languages 
to all States in an equitable, timely and transparent manner. 
</p>
<p>119. The President of the Council shall hold open-ended informative consultations before the 
special session on its conduct and organization. In this regard, the secretariat may also be 
requested to provide additional information, including, on the methods of work of previous 
special sessions. 
</p>
<p>120. Members of the Council, concerned States, observer States, specialized agencies, 
other intergovernmental organizations and national human rights institutions, as well as 
non-governmental organizations in consultative status may contribute to the special session in 
accordance with the rules of procedure of the Council. 
</p>
<p>121. If the requesting or other States intend to present draft resolutions or decisions at the 
special session, texts shall be made available in accordance with the Council&#8217;s relevant 
rules of procedure. Nevertheless, sponsors are urged to present such texts as early as  
possible. 
</p>
<p>122. The sponsors of a draft resolution or decision should hold open-ended consultations on the 
text of their draft resolution(s) or decision(s) with a view to achieving the widest participation in 
their consideration and, if possible, achieving consensus on them. 
</p>
<p>123. A special session shall allow participatory debate, be results-oriented and geared to 
achieving practical outcomes, the implementation of which can be monitored and reported on at 
the following regular session of the Council for possible follow-up decision. </p>

<p><b>5/2. Code of Conduct for Special Procedures Mandate-holders 
of the Human Rights Council 
</b></p>
<p><i> The Human Rights Council</i>, 
</p>
<p><i> Guided</i> by the aims and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights and recognizing the ensuing obligations inter alia of States to 
cooperate in promoting universal respect for human rights as enshrined therein, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted on 25 June 1993 by 
the World Conference on Human Rights, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling</i> <i>also</i> that in resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, entitled &#8220;Human Rights 
Council&#8221;, the General Assembly: 
</p>
<p> (<i>a</i>) Reaffirmed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated, 
interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that all human rights must be treated in a fair and 
equal manner on the same footing and with the same emphasis; 
</p>
<p> (<i>b</i>) Acknowledged that peace and security, development and human rights are the pillars 
of the United Nations system and that they are interlinked and mutually reinforcing; 
</p>
<p> (<i>c</i>) Decided that members elected to the Council shall uphold the highest standards in 
the promotion and protection of human rights and shall fully cooperate with the Council; 
</p>
<p> (<i>d</i>) Stressed the importance of &#8220;ensuring universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in 
the consideration of human rights issues, and the elimination of double standards and 
politicization&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (<i>e</i>) Further recognized that the promotion and protection of human rights &#8220;should be 
based on the principles of cooperation and genuine dialogue and aimed at strengthening the 
capacity of Member States to comply with their human rights obligations for the benefit of all 
human beings&#8221;; </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p> (<i>f</i>) Decided that &#8220;the work of the Council shall be guided by the principles of 
universality, impartiality, objectivity, and non-selectivity, constructive international dialogue and 
cooperation, with a view to enhancing the promotion and protection of all human rights, civil, 
political, economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to development&#8221;; 
</p>
<p> (<i>g</i>) Also decided that &#8220;the methods of work of the Council shall be transparent, fair and 
impartial and shall enable genuine dialogue, be results-oriented, allow for subsequent follow-up 
discussions to recommendations and their implementation and also allow for substantive 
interaction with special procedures and mechanisms&#8221;; </p>
<p><i> Underlining</i> the centrality of the notions of impartiality and objectivity, as well as the 
expertise of mandate-holders, within the context of special procedures, along with the need to 
give the required degree of attention to all human rights violations, wherever they may be taking 
place, 
</p>
<p><i> Bearing in mind </i>that the efficiency of the system of special procedures should be 
reinforced through the consolidation of the status of mandate-holders and the adoption of 
principles and regulations taking the specificities of their mandate into consideration, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that it is necessary to assist all stakeholders, including States, national human 
rights institutions, non-governmental organizations and individuals, to better understand and 
support the activities of mandate-holders, 
</p>
<p><i> Recalling </i>articles 100, 104, 105 of the Charter of the United Nations, section 22 of 
article VI of the Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations of 
13 February 1946 and paragraph 6 of General Assembly resolution 60/251, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting </i>decision 1/102 of 30 June 2006, in which the Council decided to extend 
exceptionally for one year the mandates and mandate-holders of the special procedures of the 
Commission on Human Rights, of the Sub-Commission for the Promotion and Protection of 
Human Rights as well as the procedure established pursuant to Economic and Social Council 
resolution 1503 (XLVIII) of 27 May 1970, </p>

 <p> 
</p>
<p><i> Noting</i> <i>also </i>decision 1/104 of 30 June 2006, in which the Council established the 
Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group entrusted with the task of formulating 
recommendations on the issue of the review and possibly the enhancement and rationalization of 
all mandates, mechanisms, functions and responsibilities of the Commission on Human Rights, 
in order to maintain a regime of special procedures in accordance with paragraph 6 of 
General Assembly resolution 60/251, 
</p>
<p><i> Noting further </i>resolution 2/1 of 27 November 2006, in which the Council requested the 
Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group to &#8220;draft a code of conduct regulating the work 
of the special procedures&#8221;, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> that this code of conduct is an integral part of the review, improvement and 
rationalization called for in General Assembly resolution 60/251 that, inter alia, seeks to enhance 
the cooperation between Governments and mandate-holders which is essential for the effective 
functioning of the system, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> <i>also </i>that such a code of conduct will strengthen the capacity of 
mandate-holders to exercise their functions whilst enhancing their moral authority and credibility 
and will require supportive action by other stakeholders, and in particular by States, 
</p>
<p><i> Considering</i> <i>further </i>that one should distinguish between, on the one hand, the 
independence of mandate-holders, which is absolute in nature, and, on the other hand, their 
prerogatives, as circumscribed by their mandate, the mandate of the Human Rights Council, and 
the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations,
